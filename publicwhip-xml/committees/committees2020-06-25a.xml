    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Paddy Mallon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for inviting me to appear today and for the opportunity to make this opening statement.  Ireland is making steady progress in emerging from the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic that has caused a significant number of deaths and has damaged our economy, the education of our children and the provision of healthcare.  Ireland has arrived at this point largely due to the unprecedented support, sacrifices and actions of the Irish people at the request of the Government following the advice of public health officials.  The Irish people have chosen this path at considerable personal cost primarily to protect the lives of their families and fellow citizens.  As a result, Ireland's now holds the advantage in our war against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, with the potential to maintain infections at an absolute minimum.  It is vital that we do this properly.</p><p>We are only beginning to understand the impact of this first wave on the health of our citizens.  There is no effective pharmaceutical treatment or vaccine to prevent the acquisition or spread of this infection.  In addition to the large number of deaths we have witnessed in Ireland, as highlighted earlier this week to the committee, many of those affected - even young and healthy individuals - experience considerable morbidity and prolonged recovery times.  Accepting any level of ongoing community transmission puts people's health at risk and will further hold back economic recovery.  Ongoing community transmission, such as that seen in the United States, Sweden and parts of the United Kingdom, together with a resurgence of cases in Lisbon and the outbreaks reported in Germany, serve to highlight that Ireland is still within a geographical high risk zone for Covid-19.  I and others in the infectious diseases clinical community believe that it is inevitable that we will experience a resurgence of cases as we relax restrictions and permit more travel.</p><p> In this context, control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within our communities through a highly effective programme of rapid testing, contact tracing and community actions becomes a priority in maintaining our national biosecurity.  Effective community control permits a more stable and meaningful economic recovery, a recovery of education for our children, a recovery of our health services, including vital screening services, and a restoration of quality of life and improvements in mental and physical well-being.  In many ways, this programme becomes the beating pulse of our country.  As society reopens, the Irish people are handing back some of the responsibility for controlling SARS-CoV-2 in Ireland to the State.  If this programme fails to work effectively, we risk losing the gains provided to us through the sacrifices of the people.</p><p> Both infectious diseases physicians and leading figures within the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, RCPI, have called for a detailed and coherent written plan to deal with the control of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the island of Ireland.  This should include a detailed end-to-end testing and contact tracing plan, embedded with rapid turnaround times and clear key performance indicators, KPIs.  Alongside this, greater investment should be made in the coming weeks to rapidly upscale emergency department capacity, and isolation room facilities in hospitals are also required.  These actions would be best achieved through the establishment and resourcing of specialist networks operating regionally under a common governance structure.  These networks should comprise relevant specialists and be linked to our extensive academic university infrastructure.  This will enable rapid and scalable regional responses to both current and future threats as they arrive and evolve as well as enabling the rapid implementation of national guidance and adherence to national KPIs.</p><p> Despite the optimism in some quarters in recent weeks, we are still in the midst of a national health emergency and our citizens are no less at risk of severe illness and death if they contract Covid-19 infection now than they were back in March.  Lessons learned from the first wave of Covid-19 need to be translated into actions and resources but we have a narrow window of opportunity.  At a time the incidence of Covid-19 infections in Ireland is relatively low, we need to avoid complacency and ensure that this time is used wisely to improve our infrastructure.  Failure to learn or delays in the planning and resourcing for what is ahead would not only be potentially negligent but would be a travesty to the memories of those who have died from Covid-19, some avoidably, during the first wave.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation.  I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. Damien McCallion, HSE national director; Ms Niamh O'Beirne, national lead for testing and tracing; and Dr. Cillian De Gascun, consultant virologist in UCD and director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory.</p><p>As requested by the committee, we submitted a detailed document on testing and tracing for Covid-19.  I will, therefore, use this opening statement to make some summary comments.</p><p> Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the HSE has worked tirelessly to build a robust testing and tracing infrastructure with the aim of monitoring and reducing the transmission rate of Covid-19 in order to protect public health.  It is important to acknowledge the extent of what has been achieved as part of this response.  To date, we have developed a testing system that has enabled us to complete over 400,000 tests.  Our World in Data ranks Ireland sixth in the number of tests per head of population within the EU and the UK.</p><p> There have been many complexities to the infrastructure that have needed to be considered and overcome.  Carrying out polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing for Covid-19 has proved challenging at times.  The process involves more than simply taking swabs; there are multiple layers to the process that impact the end result.  In order to take swabs, we had to set up 48 test centres.  The first of these opened on 16 March.  Within ten days, more than 40 were open.  We then had to consider how we would increase laboratory capacity to meet the expected demand.  We then had to ensure we could increase our ability to contact-trace to a larger scale than had ever been performed in the country to date.  We also built new IT systems to enable us to track and trace individual results through the process.  To do all this, we had to redeploy staff from other areas of the HSE and other public sector bodies, set up centres to support our public health departments and build a system from scratch to enable the service to function.  This had to be done while responding to the ongoing pandemic, something that has been described in the initial response as equivalent to building the aeroplane while flying it.  It has been well publicised that we had issues with testing in the early stages, with delays in testing and the return of test results, much of this connected with global issues with the supply of test kits and reagents, our local lab capacity and a broad initial case definition.  The case definition changed as knowledge of the virus and its characteristics increased.  This required close work with the primary care community to respond to changes in case definition and referring for testing accordingly.</p><p> We have striven to overcome these challenges to build a more robust system capable of meeting demand today with flexibility into the future for any potential surges.  Despite early issues, we have strengthened our capability to protect the nation's response to Covid-19.  Since 18 May we have the capacity to deliver 100,000 tests per week across our end-to-end testing infrastructure, from referral through to contact tracing.  We have reduced our turnaround times significantly, with swabbing appointments being mostly same day or next, laboratories completing testing in one day and contact tracing also completing in one day.  In order to meet the need to trace contacts on a large scale, a contact management programme has been in operation since March.  It operates a three-call process to efficiently contact-trace a confirmed case and also conducts acts of surveillance for 14 days from contact with a confirmed case.  We are one of the few countries to offer automatic testing for contacts of confirmed cases.  This has been in place since May.  We are ensuring that we remain agile in our approach, driving continuous improvement and striving to be as proactive as possible in our response.  Week on week we make changes that increase efficiency.  We still face some challenges, however, including anticipating the ongoing number of tests which will be carried out per week.</p><p> Referrals from GPs have fallen recently in line with reduced disease prevalence, and positivity rates have fallen from a peak of 25% to 0.5%.  As a result of demand, our available capacity has been lower in recent weeks.  We must keep in mind, however, that as the country begins to open we may see a demand for increased capacity once again, and we need to be ready.</p><p> The current testing and tracing service was put in place in order to meet the immediate requirements of the Covid-19 crisis.  The design of a new model that will operate for the next 18 or more months has commenced.  This critical project will run over the summer months, with a target implementation date in late August.  It will focus on building a fit-for-purpose and sustainable testing service that will deliver short turnaround times, maintain long-term capacity and effective contact tracing and be flexible for any future surges that may come.</p><p> I sincerely thank everyone who has played a part in developing the current testing and tracing operational model, which has enabled us to protect public health to date.  We are most grateful for the support of the GP community, which has worked with us since the outset in a very collegiate, practical and productive way.  Testing and tracing, along with other public measures such as social distancing and good hand hygiene, will play a big part in all our lives until a vaccine for Covid-19 has been developed and delivered.  We will be happy to address any questions members may have.</p></speech>

It has been quite a difficult time for everyone involved, and strong leadership has been provided in the medical advice given and its delivery.</p> <p>  Many of the facilities for testing, etc., are being wound down and some have ceased to operate.</p><p>If there was a surge again tomorrow morning, what kind of time period would it take to have everything up and running and in full working order, in terms of being able to provide tests quickly again?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The number of testing centres in operation at one stage was at 48 and we built up a capability for 100,000 tests per week but with falling community transmission the demand for testing has fallen week on week to 18,000 tests in the past week.  We have capacity for 100,000 tests per week.</p> <p>  We set up a contact tracing exercise to support our public health departments in ten departments around the country.  These consist mostly of both medical and non-medical staff who do the more routine contract tracing exercises.  Again, demand for this has fallen considerably with reduced community transmission and reduced numbers of contacts per case from a peak of 20 in mid-April to about three or so now.  We have centralised the contact management programme to a unit in Galway.  I ask my colleague, Ms O'Beirne, to come in on this.  We have retained the capability to ramp up considerably at short notice should we see in increase in the R value or an increase in the number of positive tests or contacts.</p></speech>

In contact tracing we have consolidated to one centre in Galway with a capacity to do 150 positive tests.  We have agreed with all the centres that have worked with us that if we have three days of 100 tests consecutively, we will step up the other centres again.  We have 1,700 people trained in contact tracing and everyone who worked with us is committed to coming back in that timeframe.</p></speech>

Over the past number of weeks we have been doing automatic testing of the contacts of confirmed cases on day zero and day seven.  Everybody is offered a test and it is scheduled for him or her and then he or she is told to self-isolate for 14 days.  The person tests a second time within the 14-day incubation period.</p></speech>

What is Dr. Henry's view on people coming in from abroad?  The number of people being identified positive has greatly reduced and we have suppressed the virus.  I understand in the UK there is a large number of people being identified positive every day.  What is Dr. Henry's view of the best way of managing this if there is a full resumption of travelling here from the UK, Europe, or outside of Europe?</p></speech>

I would say, referring back to Professor Mallon's opening statement, that it is far too soon for us to forget how transmissible this virus is.  The events in Melbourne, Houston, Germany and several US states remind us that with poor social measures and rapid easing of social restrictions we will see a rapid return to community transmission of this virus on a scale which will be hard to deal with if it is not brought under control very quickly.  Clearly there would be concerns, particularly about people coming from areas of high impact.  In the Covid environment, unfortunately, we have to treat every person as being potentially positive, given the uncertainty that pertains right across Europe.</p></speech>

This is a valued and valuable service to us and to women in Ireland.  I acknowledge the work of the 221 group and other advocacy groups in ensuring that we focus on restoring our services.  There are two main assumptions: that the community transmission level remains low; and that there is a continued easing of social restrictions.  If we see a scenario play out as we have seen in other countries and some US states where there is sudden rapid community transmission, clearly it would give us reason to pause resumption of services, be they screening or otherwise.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, our hope is that notwithstanding those assumptions by October we will have caught up with all those who would have had cancelled appointments through this whole pandemic since 27 March.</p> <p>  One of the positive aspects of cervical screening is that we are now moving to HPV screening, a more sensitive form of screening and one which-----</p></speech>

When one looks at what countries around the world in the same position as Ireland have done with the resurgence of cases, the majority of resurgences are occurring because new infections are introduced to the country, either through people travelling into the country or perhaps through the movement of some goods.  From that perspective, the importance of containing infections at the border becomes higher as the levels of community transmission drop off because that becomes the greatest threat of resurgence of cases.  From a policymaker perspective, if one wants to maintain community transmission at a minimal level and is working on a series of complex interventions to do so, it is important to have robust screening methods at the point of entry into the country.  What those methods are is open to debate.  We could screen everyone or, as is being proposed and which might make more sense, we could judge our screening, restrictions and follow-ups based on the epidemiology of the outbreak in the country from which the person is coming.  For example, at the moment the risk assessments would be very different for someone coming from New Zealand compared to someone coming from Texas.  That might be a pragmatic approach, certainly within the European setting, to enable limited travel.  At the same time, one should focus testing, follow-up restrictions and monitoring to get the most return for investment of time and expense.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the great work the committee secretariat has been doing.  The briefing notes have been excellent.</p> <p>  I will start with Professor Mallon.  In his opening statement he said: "I and others in the infectious diseases clinical community believe that it is inevitable that we will experience a resurgence of cases as we relax restrictions and permit more travel".  In his view, and in the view of the infectious diseases community, how extensive is that resurgence likely to be?  Critically, could it lead to more mass closures of healthcare facilities, businesses, schools and so forth?</p></speech>

For example, in Germany there has been a large outbreak associated with one particular occupational factory, which has led to the lockdown of 600,000 people.  The state of Victoria is currently grappling with the re-emergence of cases in multiple hotspots within the community, which has led to severe restrictions throughout much of the state.  More than 1 million people are currently under restrictions where they almost cannot leave their homes.  This can emerge very quickly.  In the case of Victoria, it has emerged in a matter of days and Australia has gone from a country that had been largely Covid-free to having to introduce quite severe restrictions for a large segment of an urban population.  When one looks between the lines in Victoria, the other lesson to learn is that it is scrambling at the moment to upscale its testing capacity.  That is a lesson we also need to learn.  We cannot get rid of all our testing capacity and expect to switch it back on overnight.  The ability to respond to these sorts of outbreaks depends on days rather than weeks.</p></speech>

The first stress test for the system is going to be what happens in August, as the Irish people decide whether they travel overseas or not, because we will inevitably have imported cases coming back into the country and that is going to stress the testing system.  The second big stress for the testing system is going to be the onset of seasonal influenza because we will be getting a large number of people with symptoms consistent with Covid seeking tests at one time, and we need to be responsive to that.  Within those two settings, the likelihood of re-emergence of infections is high and the likelihood of re-imposing restrictions really depends on two factors.  It depends on the geographical spread of the infections so, for example, if they are all localised in one geographical setting, one could argue for a geographical restriction.  It also depends on the number of cases and the rate of increase in those cases.</p></speech>

The Deputy talks about mass lockdown.  The inevitability of a mass lockdown depends on what happens with the new cases.  One could argue that, within Ireland, if we set up the testing and contact tracing system appropriately, we could place restrictions locally, as they are doing in the state of Victoria and in Germany.  However, if we get a large number of people returning to the country from overseas and there is wide geographical spread of community transmission, and we cannot test and contact trace efficiently, the only way we are going to control that is by returning to mass lockdown.</p></speech>

With regard to measures around international travel, where is the technology in terms of being able to test people at the airports, specifically in terms of the turnaround times?  My understanding is the very rapid, 15-minute testing is not advanced enough right now.  If we were to put labs in the airports and the ports, could we do testing and have passengers wait for one hour, two hours or three hours, for example, instead of having to potentially self-isolate for two weeks?</p></speech>

Therefore, it is useful for that day to remove people who are infectious but it does not solve the problem of ensuring that we follow up those people who are coming from high-risk areas to ensure they do not subsequently develop infections over the coming days, because that will still transmit and cause infections in the country. </p></speech>

The testing is not predictive so what it does is remove positive cases from the pool.  With every test carried out, one removes more positive cases.  One could test every day for seven days and it would be better than testing on day one and day three.  It is never going to be 100%.  Along with any plan for testing, there will still be a requirement for the individual to behave responsibly and report symptoms.  In my view, given the impact of the community transmission of this virus from a public health perspective, as has been demonstrated in Victoria, as well as its economic impact, it is difficult to see how something would improve quarantining for 14 days.</p></speech>

Does that suffer from the same disadvantages, namely, if one is tested in the first day or two after contact, one may subsequently develop symptoms but one will not test positive?</p></speech>

My first question is for Dr. Henry.  We are very constrained by time so many of the answers I am seeking are either one word or one number, if he does not mind.  The experts are telling us that testing and tracing need not necessarily be perfect under lockdown but it must get much better and should be perfect as we exit lockdown.  Is Dr. Henry confident that we will be able to hit the necessary end-to-end targets from the first call to the GP to quarantining contacts?  The target is 72 hours.  I am not sure that we are there yet, or anywhere close to it.  I received a response to a parliamentary question from the HSE which indicated that the turnaround time from the request for a test to the start of the contact tracing process is 1.76 days.  That was on 19 June.  As we exit lockdown and there is more pressure on testing and tracing, would Dr. Henry be confident that we will be able to reach that 72-hour target?</p></speech>

We have built up the capacity to carry out 100,000 tests but, as a result of reduced community transmission, the number of tests being carried out has decreased.

That is fortunate for all of our sakes.  The capacity remains.  We have purchased laboratory capacity.  Mr. McCallion can brief the Deputy further in that regard.  The capacity is also based on the testing centres.  Throughout the pathway, we have built up a capacity to carry out 100,000 tests per week.  The fact that we have not had to use it does not mean the capacity does not exist.</p></speech>

South Korea views the speed of testing and tracing as important to prevent and suppress outbreaks.  Its health officials have stated that testing needs to work not only for identification but also for isolation.  To do this, it must be fast.  According to Dr. Tom&aacute;s Ryan, the science shows that if this is too slow, it will defeat the purpose of lockdown altogether.  In his opening statement, Professor Mallon made the point that, as society reopens, the public is handing back some of the responsibility for controlling the virus to the State and that, if the programme of testing fails to work effectively, we risk losing the gains achieved.  Will he outline what he sees as the necessary underpinnings of any successful testing and tracing plan as we exit lockdown?</p></speech>

This can be modelled.  Looking at our most recent flu season, which just preceded the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, it can be estimated that approximately 103 of every 100,000 people were reporting flu-type symptoms to their local GPs every week.  That would correspond to an expected need to diagnose more than 5,000 positive cases per week.  We need to be able to go from diagnosing about 100 cases per week to potentially dealing with 5,000 people with symptoms a week, or even more.  It should also be taken into account that, if people with Covid-19 slip through the gaps because of delays in testing these higher numbers, not only will we be faced with flu-like illness but also with Covid outbreaks.  That will increase the capacity required yet again.  That is what we need to be ready for.  We need to be ready to roll that out within days.  That is where end-to-end testing comes in.</p></speech>

With that low level of community transmission, we should be at one day.</p></speech>

Provided we can watch community transmission, we will be able to see the impact of the relaxation of restrictions.  I had a lot of concerns that we were doing it too quickly but those concerns have not played out in increased rates of community transmission.  I will still be concerned, especially as we move into the next phase when we will see much more movement of people.  That is going to be a real test.  At every stage, we need to watch, but as long as we are able to accurately observe the community transmission rates, we will get the information we need in order to know whether we are going too fast or too slow.</p></speech>

I think we will have dissemination of tourists from a number of different countries around the island.  In terms of how we cope with that and monitor it, the big consideration is that the Irish people are on the ball with this and have been engaged with it from the beginning.  People coming in from other countries will not be in the same mindset and may not have the same knowledge in terms of reporting symptoms and how to get tested.  The whole system around monitoring and contact tracing will, by definition, be less robust for tourists.  That needs to be taken into consideration because it will increase the risk.</p></speech>

I know this because Dublin Airport is in my constituency.  Those numbers are likely to increase soon but even at the current low level of incoming people, we are not getting things right.  I heard C&aacute;it O'Riordan on the radio the weekend before last talking about how when she came home from America and self-isolated and quarantined, nobody phoned her and nobody checked where she was.  If we cannot manage to do that for the tiny numbers that are currently coming in, what are our prospects of being able to manage it if we go back even to 50% of normal passenger numbers arriving here in the next couple of weeks?</p></speech>

That is the major concern.

One of the most frustrating things about this pandemic has been the comparison of what we are doing versus what is being done in other countries.  It is very clear to me from a pandemic scenario that we are unique.  We have a unique healthcare capacity, which is lower than in many other countries, and a unique community engagement.  When considering the characteristics of how we manage this pandemic, we need to focus on what is required within our country.  We can take lessons from other countries but I do not think we are going to be able to pull off the shelf a written end-to-end testing policy or contact tracing policy and say that this is how it is being done in the UK and, therefore, we are going to do the same.  I just do not think that is going to work.</p></speech>

One of the approaches we have not taken which other countries around Europe have taken is that we have not, until recently, adopted a very strict approach at our borders.  We have a large landmass border with the UK in respect of which we have applied no restrictions.  Even if we put restrictions in place at the airports, we will still have people travelling across that land border.</p><p>I recognise the limitations with that but when one looks at other countries around Europe with large land borders, they have been much more restrictive in terms of movement across those borders than we have.</p></speech>

There is a marginal cost and there is also a cost for fixed capital, recruitment and everything else.  In general, labs have an idea of how much each test costs.  In simple terms, could Dr. Henry give me a number for that?</p></speech>

I will quickly break them into two groups.  The marginal cost in terms of hospitals broadly averages out at approximately &euro;75 per test but there is a significant variation between the hospitals and between the testing platforms that are used.  We are being very careful in terms of the commercial rates because we are still negotiating with laboratories and trying to build further capacity going forward but, broadly speaking, they range from &euro;140 down.  We have rates which are well below that at present.  The average budgeted rate is typically around &euro;120 per test, and we are operating below those levels at the moment.</p></speech>

Is that equipment adaptable for use in respect of other diseases that may come along?  Are they generic machines, as it were, that can be used with different types of reagent if another pandemic comes along or for testing, say, for influenza?</p></speech>

Most of these platforms would be usable for things like influenza, as the Deputy alluded to, or for sexual health or blood-borne viruses like HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C.  The PCR is quite an agnostic technology which one can use for a variety of infectious pathogens.</p></speech>

Most of our staff would be either technical officers or medical laboratory scientists.  There is a shortage of medical laboratory scientists across the country at the moment.  From the point of view of training people up to operate these machines, they are very capable and many of them would have transitioned from existing work to work on Covid-19 testing.  As the Deputy is aware, a lot of the demand in the health service declined significantly due to Covid-19 and we saw the same issues in the laboratories so people were transferred from operating perhaps in the sexual-health screening area and came across to work on Covid-19.  It is well recognised that we need to invest in medical laboratory scientists.</p></speech>

One of my relatives who is an Irish citizen arrived in Hong Kong airport recently and was tested on the spot and kept in the airport for five hours until the results came back.  There was a five-hour turnaround time for the test.  The person was then confined to their home with a tracking device for a period afterwards.  Are we going to test people arriving at airports?  It seems that if we can completely suppress the illness within our island, if we reopen transport to other countries, presumably we are exposing ourselves to huge risk.</p></speech>

As Professor Mallon pointed out, it is a point-in-time testing.  Releasing people who have positive results, whether they are asymptomatic or not, would clearly have to be considered.  It is not something that we are doing at the moment.  It is under active discussion by NPHET and will undoubtedly inform our own testing policy.  It is not something we are doing at present, but anything that would reduce the dissemination of the virus should be seriously considered.</p></speech>

I just want to point out that it is actually happening in other countries.  There is an international precedent for that, even if we do not go that far.</p> <p>  In terms of antibody tests and serological tests, the science is advancing all the time, is there any understanding yet as to whether there is any point to being tested.  I see that people can go to a number of private serological testing clinics in Dublin.  Do we have any idea how long immunity lasts, if at all, if a person has antibodies?  Is there any plan to do scientific research to see the extent of antibodies in the Irish population?</p></speech>

At this stage, the plan is to call forward or invite just over 5,000 individuals who will be representative of the population at large and offer those individuals a blood test to look at the level of antibodies in their blood.</p> <p>  At this point in time, we do not have an indication as to how long immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will last.  If an antibody is present in an individual's blood sample, based on previous coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, it is possible that immunity will last for one to two years.  At this point in time, however, it is too early to say that.</p> <p>  My understanding is that there is a significant amount of research ongoing in the area of antibody testing.</p></speech>

We just put through 1,000 samples from patients with three antibody tests.  We are awaiting the results of those which we expect in the next day or two.</p> <p>  What is emerging is that if one has a mild infection, the chances of having antibodies are lower, the level of antibodies are lower and the chances of those antibodies hanging around are lower.  It seems to be that those who are more severely infected may have higher antibody levels.  How that corresponds to any protection from future infections, we really do not know.</p></speech>

It is also quite frightening in that it has left me in no doubt that we should respect a resurgence.  If a second wave should happen, what would we do differently with testing and tracing?  What lessons have we learned from the past couple of months?</p></speech>

This is reducing all the time.  In mid-April, when we had significant problems with each step of the testing pathway through shortage of swabs or reagent, we had to compete in a very tightly competitive international market to secure the swabs and reagents to allow the pathway to continue.  Through those contracts, thanks to my colleagues in the HSE some of whom are here today, we have secured those different things which enable each step of the pathway.</p> <p>  The turnaround time in the community is a second thing.  It is already at one day in most hospitals because of the nature of the patient being there.  The second lesson for a second surge, whenever it comes and whatever form it takes, is how quickly we respond to cases, how much we increase awareness among the public about the importance of presenting early with symptoms and how doggedly we pursue close contacts of each known case to test them also.</p></speech>

We have a secure supply and we are comfortable with what we have, beyond even the levels of testing that are there today.  If a number of countries got a resurgence at the same time, however, in a global sense, there would still be challenges there.  The market has obviously invested a lot in manufacturing to increase that.  We have also looked at diversification across platforms to ensure we are not completely dependent on one or two platforms which could present problems then if such a situation arose globally.</p></speech>

This was because one of the platforms was particularly good from an extraction perspective.  With the help of HSE procurement, over the recent months we have ensured we have diversified across the hospital laboratory network.  Hopefully, we will not get caught in the same situation again.</p></speech>

First, in April we had a blanket exercise across care homes, residential settings, disability settings and mental health settings, which gave us limited information given there were relatively low levels of positivity, although there was geographical variation.  This week we are starting a series of testing of all healthcare workers in nursing homes for four consecutive weeks to help to inform us more of the behaviour of this virus among healthcare workers.  In view of the fact that we cannot always be certain where it was contracted, it will give us more information on how the virus was contracted and the behaviour of it among healthcare workers.  My colleague, Ms O'Beirne, may also wish to comment on that.</p></speech>

We estimate that this will involve approximately 33,000 people across 586 nursing home settings.  We will do this for four weeks and produce a report at the end of each week, and at the end of the entire exercise, to see what we have learnt from it and how it informs our testing strategy for healthcare workers in those settings as we go forward.</p></speech>

First, people may conform to the case definition because community transmission has fallen so much.  It has fallen to very low levels in terms of demand.  Second, it can be used to support specific strategies guided by public health.  This could be in the context of outbreaks, which have also fallen because of the fall in rates of community transmission.  Third, testing can be used for specific strategies to inform us of the behaviour of the virus among healthcare workers in nursing homes or to inform a strategy that we have just developed and passed through NPHET, which is a broader strategy of how we use our testing capacity to test healthcare workers in different settings to inform us about how it behaves and how it is transmitted among this population, as I said earlier.  Much of the capacity at the moment is, thankfully, unused but we need the capacity for any surges which, as Professor Mallon said, are more likely than not to appear in the coming autumn-winter season.</p></speech>

The minutes and advices up to the middle of May were sent through yesterday evening.  I will take on board Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments.  We are conscious of not having matters in the public arena that are under active consideration with ourselves or NPHET because that could impinge on the work of the committees.  We are certainly working to get things out as quickly as possible in conjunction with NPHET.  We are a subgroup to NPHET after all.</p></speech>

I read the most recent minutes of the debate within the expert advisory group on the use of masks.  I do not have time to go into detail, but it was a very interesting debate.  However, it took place five weeks ago.  Deputies have to make decisions now.  I wish to know the most up-to-date advice on masks and face coverings and the debates that are happening within the expert advisory group.  I hope my request will be taken on board.</p> <p>  Could we have more information about who is becoming infected?  We are told there is community transmission, although I acknowledge that current rate in this regard is low.  Surely the committee needs to know who is becoming infected now.  Do the witnesses know that?  If not, why?  Given that certain restrictions are to be lifted, will that be tracked in detail?  Approximately two months ago I asked whether we should at least know the occupations, sectors and categories of people who are contracting the virus in order that we can understand from where outbreaks may come.  Is that reasonable for Deputies to know?  Do the witnesses know the position in this regard?</p></speech>

We have heard that young people are contracting the virus.  Are they young people who were drinking cans on the banks of the canal or are they young people in direct provision?  There is a big difference between those things and we need to know them in order to make informed decisions.</p></speech>

At its press conferences, which used to be held daily, information is provided in respect of occupations, particularly as regards healthcare workers, in the context of outbreaks and their background.  A significant amount of information on positive cases is collated by our public health departments.  That was the case even when there was a large number of cases.  The information is not exhaustive to the degree suggested by the Deputy, that is, that it narrows down each case of infection to the person's occupation and one particular place, but it gives broad indications in terms of healthcare workers, age, occupation-----</p></speech>

My point is that people are worried about the guidelines, whether they are adequate and how they will be policed.  One way to test whether the guidelines will work in various sectors is to know whether there are particular outbreaks among hairdressers, transport workers or airport workers or, if we reopen schools, among schoolchildren.  Surely that kind of information is critical.  Is that not a reasonable thing for us to know?</p></speech>

Those supplies were badly needed in the teeth of this pandemic.</p><p> Earlier it was said that the geographical spread will determine further lockdowns.  Obviously we need contact tracing and testing.  I represent the constituency of Waterford where we have, thankfully, managed the Covid pandemic very well largely because of the provision of isolation rooms in the new Dunmore wing at University Hospital Waterford.  I called for, potentially, Waterford and the south east to be allowed to open in advance of Dublin and stated that we were pegged with what was happening in Dublin.  I agree with him that without a doubt we will have sectoral outbreaks in the country.  I know it has been said that a written plan is being sought.  Is there any plan that would allow regions of the country to continue to operate if there are clusters around the country?</p></speech>

The short answer, in terms of the development of plans, would probably be best addressed by our colleagues in the HSE because they develop the plans.  To date, I do not know of any plans that are in draft form, that I have seen.  Again, there may be others that are in the background that are being worked on.</p></speech>

Our own occupational health lead, Dr. Lynda Sisson, has provided guidance for healthcare workers and reminded them of their obligation throughout.  That is a message sent out repeatedly and, most recently last Friday, of their need to be alert for the symptoms of Covid and to isolate themselves as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  In terms of obligatory screening, as yet there is no obligatory temperature taking of staff entering acute hospitals facilities.  Such a measure is under consideration as it happens in nursing homes and residential care already. </p></speech>

If we take the case of a hospital like the University Hospital Waterford, where we have 500 beds and 2,000 care staff transiting through there, I do not think this measure should be delayed any longer.  It is a simple zapping of temperature in the morning when healthcare workers are coming in and out, and I am not sure why we are delaying on it.</p></speech>

We are conscious of the fact that there is no guidance in the area.  We have asked HIQA to perform an evidence census for us in this area.  As Professor Mallon alluded to earlier, it is certainly possibly one of a suite of measures but while temperature was a significant element of the disease in China, back in January, we know that at this point in time that the majority of our patients in Ireland do not actually have a temperature associated with Covid-19.  HIQA is conducting an evidence census for us at this point in time on the role of temperature screening to inform our practice and the possible development of guidance in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Can I ask about travel in and out of airports?  Earlier, Dr. Henry mentioned that newer screening techniques were coming through that would shorten the screening time.  I am aware of screening techniques that are coming through which will give a Covid response test in 20 minutes, potentially.  I wonder if such a test can be made available would NPHET encourage that all people transiting into this country, particularly from affected countries, undergo a screening test at the airport and await a Covid response test before being allowed to leave?</p></speech>

The information that I have is that that is not the case at the moment.  The other test - the polymerise chain reaction or PCR test - that we do takes four to five hours.  To achieve that turnaround would involve detaining people at airports for at least that time interval.  As I said earlier in response to one of the Deputy's colleagues, as we begin to re-open and if we are going to resume passenger travel at the scale, or even a fraction of the scale pre-Covid, we would have to consider any measure we have, particularly coming from countries where there are higher levels of community transmission.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  I will begin with questions to the witnesses for the Department and the HSE.</p> <p>  In response to a question I put to the Taoiseach three weeks ago, I was told that testing for Covid-19 cost &euro;200 per test.  My presumption was that was the cost of testing carried our in German laboratories.  Earlier, we were told that the cost of a test is &euro;120.  In my investigations I have found laboratories in west Cork that can carry out Covid-19 tests for under &euro;50.  Everyone has a different figure.  Why did the HSE not use Irish laboratories, which are up to 75% cheaper in terms of testing?</p></speech>

There are different rates as well.  The tests we use within our own hospitals vary significantly in cost.  When we looked at trying to get capacity up to 100,000, we looked to where we could get high volume to deal with the high volume going through.  All the laboratories that we use have to be accredited and work under a clinical laboratory service.  We looked at all possible laboratories in country and out of country.  We needed high volume laboratories for some of our community testing such that the systems in place would ensure we got the results through in a timely manner.  In regard to the rates we are using, we are being very careful in terms of the commercial rates because we are still negotiating on those and we do not want to prejudice those discussions.  We are happy that we have achieved good, competitive rates relative to the rest of Europe.</p> <p>  The cost referenced by the Deputy does not refer to the German laboratory.  Its rates are competitive, as are all of the on-island rates.  There is a degree of fluctuation, often down to the nature of the test.  There are other factors as well the cost.  We have to ensure that all the IT is enabled, from the GP referral through to the appointment, the laboratory result coming through and feeding back into the contacting tracing system.  A sophisticated IT system has been built up as we have moved through this process.  We have engaged with all possible laboratories and, at one stage, we were getting 50 to 60 leads per day.  We have a team who sifted through all of those to identify those that would give us the quickest return.  I may be aware of the laboratory to which the Deputy referred.  It would not be appropriate for me to get into a discussion on it here but I am happy to have that discussion outside.  We have engaged with every possible laboratory that could offer a service.  Currently, we have the capacity and, as mentioned earlier, the volume is running at a lower level.</p></speech>

Clearly, that is not the case.  The capacity was built to deal with surges, not for every day such that costs at the moment are under that.  They are set out in the briefing paper that we provided today.  We have used the Air Corps on a small number of cases when no courier services were available from Dublin Airport, which is built into our price.  The Air Corps has been very helpful.  I take this opportunity to recognise the Department of Defence and the Air Corps for their support at times, not just in regard to the transport of samples but also in regard to contact tracing, where the cadets were very helpful to us and invaluable in the early stages as well.</p></speech>

In case there is any doubt, the bulk of that investment has been in our acute hospitals or laboratories such as the National Virus Reference Laboratory and other associated laboratories.  As stated earlier by Ms O'Beirne, we are developing a strategy that seeks to beef up the capacity on-island to cater for the flu season next year, for example, other potential surges and how to build on that in a sustainable way.  It is not, unfortunately, just a case of purchasing the test.  It is about staffing, the logistics, the infrastructure, the buildings and the IT, which is crucial.  Earlier, a Deputy mentioned the learning.  Not having all of that technology and building on it as we moved through this crisis has been one of the biggest challenges.

Animal Health Laboratories Limited in Bandon, which I visited recently, can produce results within four to five hours at a cost of &euro;50 per test, as, I assume, can other laboratories here.

I understand more than 40 hospitals are carrying out testing.  It is not simply a case of doctors and nurses doing the tests.  Laboratory services and all of the other necessary elements are required.  The test involves relatively complex PCR testing.  A number of things have to be in place in order to undertake tests.  I am not sure if the Deputy has a query about a particular hospital that we could follow up on.  In general, the process involves the scientists Dr. De Gascun has referred to, all of the equipment, which can be quite expensive, the reagent, IT systems, etc.  If some hospitals are not testing it is because those things are not in place.  They will be clearly aligned to a larger hospital or a hospital close to them.  Most geographical areas are covered.</p></speech>

We are not incurring costs over and above what we are testing.  In some cases, we have had to stock up on tests.  In the public hospital system we have tried to purchase ahead so that we are not caught with some of the problems we had at the start and ensure we have a stockpile that brings us forward in terms of reagents, test kits and so on.

It is inevitable that if we want to sustain capacity, whether private or public, we will have to pay some amount towards that.  We are working with laboratories to minimise anything around that.  It is not an issue at present, but it is something we are conscious of and we also have to be aware lab capacity will become a problem when there are surges, as Professor Mallon said, across Europe.  We do not want to have to compete again with bigger players than ourselves in terms of trying to find capacity, reagents or supplies from big global companies.  It is a challenge for private labs and our public laboratories.</p></speech>

Can I get a note on the number of people currently working on contact tracing and the number of volunteers, and how those numbers have changed over time?  I ask for a note on the difference between the use of and recommendation on face shields compared to face masks.  A number of people have contacted me about the use of face shields because they can speak while wearing them and they are easier to wear than face masks which people cannot talk through.</p> <p>  I refer to the relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  There are different rules in both jurisdictions, depending on whether people live in the North or the South or in the UK.  Do the witnesses not think that we need to address this issue in a significant way?  People travelling to the UK through the North do not have to fill in any forms on their return, whereas people from the UK coming into Ireland through the South are required to.  There are serious ambiguities. </p> <p>  My next question addresses a key point.  I agree with Professor Mallon about the problem being exacerbated by the flu if there is a return of the pandemic.  What should we do in terms of the flu vaccine?  Should it be mandatory and available to everybody free of charge or should health workers, older people and so on be prioritised?  </p> <p>  I have an important question.</p><p>The WHO tells us people aged over 60 and those with underlying conditions should use medical grade masks.  People are told in the newspapers that medical grade masks are not available.  People can go into Dunnes Stores, Lidl or pharmacies to buy masks but they do not know the quality of the masks they are buying.  If people aged over 60 and those with underlying conditions are at a greater risk medically, surely it is incumbent on us to make sure those people get masks, that they get them for free if they are on low incomes, and that those masks meet the medical need, if that is what the recommendation is.</p></speech>

Ms O'Beirne will answer the question on the people in contact tracing and I will ask Dr. de Gascun, in his role on the expert advisory group, to comment on shields versus masks.

Of these, 300 people were deployed to the public health departments to support them in contact tracing and up to 700 were placed in the nine centres.  We have consolidated our contact tracing centres into one centre in Galway, which is operating with 34 staff.  This number of staff can comfortably deal with 100 positive cases per day.  Yesterday, we had five positive cases so the centre is capable to do much more than it needs to do.  The agreement we have, as I mentioned earlier, is that once we get three consecutive days of 100 cases, we will open up other test centres or remotely ask contact tracers who are trained to step up that capacity again.</p></speech>

It is voluntary, as the Deputy alluded to.  It has gone from 30% to 60%.  It needs to improve further and there will be a big push on this.</p></speech>

I also fully support the expanded availability of the flu vaccine as a public health measure.  The one thing about public health measures in general is that an expected uptake of any measure will always be dented if it comes at a cost to the public.  This can be either the provision of the vaccine or the provision of masks or, as the Deputy said, the provision of higher grade more expensive masks to certain cohorts in the population, particularly members of the population who may not have the financial stability to secure them.  Any consideration of a public health measure needs to take cost into account.  If it is something that is expected to be widespread and expected to be effective, as the flu vaccine and mask use will need to be if they are to be useful, then we need to examine whether it should be made freely available.  It is only by doing this that we will get the maximum impact from the intervention.</p></speech>

We were able to secure supply lines but in recognition of the particular risk in healthcare settings, it was introduced for healthcare workers.  The WHO reflects this in its guidance, recognising the particular importance of providing and having a supply of masks for healthcare workers.  Now that we have secured a more promising supply, we will have to factor in how much more we will need for particular at-risk groups in the community to make sure they feel safe and ensure they have access to those masks free of charge.  It was a considerable effort for us as a country to secure the PPE we needed for healthcare workers in our hospitals and community system.</p></speech>

I will start with Professor Mallon.  He stated in his opening statement that the lessons learned from the first wave of Covid-19 need to be translated into actions and resources and that we have a very narrow window of opportunity.  As we look forward and try to learn from the past three to four months, what lessons were learned and where do we need more resources to be directed as we face a potential resurgence of the virus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Paddy Mallon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#T00200"><p>We are talking about contact tracing and testing today and we have underlined how vital a component that is.  Moving forward towards the early autumn, our hospital settings will be critical.  People in Ireland will expect to be able to attend a clinical care facility and to be treated in a safe environment and it is paramount that we maintain safety within our hospitals and prevent Covid-19 infection from entering the hospitals.  The two main ways Covid-19 will enter hospitals will be through patients attending hospitals through the emergency department or through outpatient clinics with symptoms - so we need to pick people up at that stage - and staff attending the hospital unwittingly bringing the infection in.  These are lessons we have learned from the first wave.</p> <p>  In my view at the moment, we do not have a clear process in place to be able to at least deal with the staff issue.  That is part of the idea around the need for this written end-to-end testing strategy.  As we retreat rapidly from our use of private hospitals, there is an expectation that we will all be able to squeeze back into the same healthcare footprint we had back in March, be able to deliver the same services in a safe manner.  I cannot see those expectations being realistic.  We have emergency departments where the footprint is far too small; we had a trolley crisis that went on for months on end up until March when we had in excess of 900 people on trolleys on some days and where we are unable to physically distance.  Even with the adequate testing and turnaround in hospitals, the current environment within a lot of our hospitals is simply not adequate to be able to safely manage increasing community transmission of this infection.  We have a window to fix that but that window will only be open between now and September because it is at that stage that I expect cases to increase.</p></speech>

Then we could have the normal winter surge, the winter vomiting bug and the winter flu.  We all know about the issue of the late discharge of patients and the late transfer of care and the number of bed days lost as a result of that, which I have raised consistently for the past four years and which we discussed with the Minister for Health in the D&aacute;il last night.  We have to put a clear emphasis on throughflow through the hospital so that when patients arrive, the correct wraparound supports can be put in place for those who need to be sent home as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  Professor Mallon referred to "the memories of those who have died from Covid-19, some avoidably".  In this committee, I have constantly raised the question of what would have happened if patients were tested prior to entering residential care settings throughout March and April.  For example, we know that in March 1,300 patients were transferred from acute hospital settings to nursing and residential care homes.  We know this virus has borne down hardest on our older people, with 63% of all deaths occurring in residential and care homes.  Professor Mallon speaks about avoidable deaths so does he believe that if these patients had been tested prior to entering nursing homes, some deaths could have been avoided?</p></speech>

We need to maintain safe environments for the public to be treated for their illnesses.  From the point of view of a physician and on a societal level, that is critical.  Whether it is in acute hospitals or in nursing homes, the same thing applies because the consequence of the sick, the vulnerable and the old acquiring this infection is death.</p><p>That is a fairly stark consequence that we simply cannot accept.  We can talk about bed days and social distancing, but if we enter September, October and November knowing what is coming and we still end up with people dying within our healthcare facilities from nosocomial infection, then, in my view, we have failed.</p></speech>

I firmly believe that if the capacity had been available in March and April to test people who were being transferred to residential care from acute settings, and if patients had been tested prior to being returned to nursing homes, they could have been isolated for 14 days.  It would have certainly made a difference.</p></speech>

I had the experience of going out to visit nursing homes during the pandemic.  There was huge variation in what was happening in nursing homes.  There could be a nursing home being decimated in one district, with all staff and patients infected with Covid-19 and a number of people dying, yet one could travel 200 m to 300 m down the road and see a nursing home that was completely unaffected.  We can talk about hospital discharge and nursing homes, but it is not the only story.  There is certainly something at a managerial level within nursing homes that some nursing homes were able to do excellently to maintain the safety of their residents and staff throughout the whole pandemic, but other nursing homes were unable to do.  That is the key.  What were the nursing homes that avoided this doing right?  We need to learn from what they did right-----</p></speech>

We are not confining testing to the disciplines she mentioned.  I will add, based on the Deputy's remarks on testing and transfer during March and April, that in the past 100 days we have learned so much about this virus from a very low base.  I am speaking now with my clinical hat on again as a geriatrician.  What we know now that we did not know then is the importance of atypical presentations in older people and asymptomatic transmission.  It should be remembered that testing was directed by the case definition.  People had to conform to the case definition, which was originally quite narrow, and testing depended on the presence of a fever or respiratory symptoms.  That guided testing.  What we know now, and what only became clear through international experience towards the end of March, is the importance of atypical presentations in older people and asymptomatic transmission.</p></speech>

That was carried out in April.  To go back to what the test actually does, it provides information at a point in time.  It tells one something about a particular time on a particular day; it does not tell one anything about the following day.  What we will do in the next four weeks is serial testing of all healthcare workers, including all the disciplines the Deputy mentioned, in nursing home settings.  This is to inform us in a deeper manner about the mode of transmission and the behaviour of this virus among healthcare workers, who have the power to transmit the virus while asymptomatic.  That has potentially been an important source of transmission in a very vulnerable healthcare setting.</p></speech>

How important is this to control the spread of the virus?  I know that one of the other speakers said tests are carried out on day zero and day seven.  Does Dr. Henry think we need to continue doing this on an ongoing basis, and how important is it?</p></speech>

Among symptomatic contacts the positivity rate is 14% so far.  The next figure underlines how important this process is.  Among contacts who have no symptoms, the positivity rate is 9%.  For that reason, we are aggressively pursuing all contacts and we need them to engage with testing and be tested.  Just because they do not have symptoms does not mean they do not have the virus and could not potentially be transmitting it to other people.</p></speech>

That submission is dated 16 June.  Could the Business Committee do an examination of the reason it arrived so late?  Was it related to the HSE or just a bureaucratic issue?  Clearly, it is difficult to engage in questions to witnesses when receiving a document two minutes after the meeting has started.  Without making a big issue of it today, perhaps it is something the Business Committee will examine on Friday.</p> <p>  I thank our guests for coming here.  Professor Mallon and Dr. Henry and his team are all busy people and we appreciate their presence here.  I wish to ask Dr. Henry about workplace incidences.  We have discussed meat plants previously and when Dr. De Gascun was here, I asked him whether there was any specific type of workplace outside of healthcare centres, other than meat plants, that had experienced a prevalence of Covid-19 cases that would cause concern.  Dr. De Gascun's position was that he was unaware of any other workplaces.  Can Dr. Henry confirm that meat plants were the only workplace where there was a prevalence of cases, outside of the healthcare services?</p></speech>

The Deputy should bear in mind that meat plants were included in the category of essential services as we gradually closed down and social measures kicked in on 12 March and 27 March.  Many other workplace settings either went back to home-based working or closed down completely.  That said, our experience has been replicated abroad.  In Germany in the past week, there has been a significant outbreak in a meat factory setting similar to what we have experienced.  I am not aware of other clusters in a particular workplace setting other than meat plants and healthcare facilities, but I will come back to the Deputy with more accurate information from the HPSC.</p></speech>

Recognising that meat plants have been a particular issue not just in Ireland but internationally, for obvious reasons, what level of focus is Dr. Henry's team keeping on meat factories to ensure that we do not see other spikes in cases within those settings?</p></speech>

There is a particular configuration of workers there, who are often foreign and do not have English as their first language.  The mode of transmission is as likely, if not more likely, to have taken place outside the work setting, relating to how they live in congregated settings and so on.  Our public health lead, Dr. Mai Mannix, has led on this and produced a report for NPHET, which I am sure we will be happy to share with the Deputy.  This report gives a summary of the total number of outbreaks and the total number of workers affected, which I think is now in excess of 1,000.  Again, I can supply the Deputy with exact figures.  The management of it was predominantly by a focus on our public health workforce, led by Dr. Mannix, who liaised with the owners of factories, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and directly with the workers themselves, employing, in many cases, translators of Portuguese and other languages.  It was a considerable undertaking, with-----</p></speech>

Fortunately, we have seen a marked reduction in outbreaks as community transmission has fallen.  The events in Germany underline how transmissible this virus is and how quickly it can get a foothold in a workplace setting, such as a meat plant, where other factors play into transmission and not just people working together.  I reassure the Deputy that among the measures brought in by the public health team were having staggered shifts and smaller groups of people working in hubs.  Measures were introduced in co-operation with the meat factory owners.</p></speech>

She made the comment, which stands up to scrutiny, that in Ireland the prevalence of Covid-19 infection among healthcare workers is the highest in the world.  The Taoiseach has tried to undermine those figures by quoting a different set of figures.  Does Dr. Henry accept that the prevalence of Covid-19 infection among healthcare workers as an overall percentage of the population infected is the highest in the world?</p></speech>

That said, I do not accept the characterisation of it.  While every case would be troubling to any of us who work in the health service, given that we have friends and family and others working as front-line healthcare workers, the denominator - the number of people we tested throughout the pandemic - has varied.  At one point we were testing small numbers of people owing to the difficulties we had in securing testing equipment and laboratory facilities, but at all times we prioritised healthcare workers, so that-----</p></speech>

That is what I am saying to the Deputy.  I do not dispute the figure of 32%.

As the committee heard on another occasion, a number of people have called for a change in the regulations to categorise instances of Covid-19 that were contracted in the workplace as notifiable occupational illness that would then be notified to the HSE.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation could change the regulation at the stroke of a pen.  Does Professor Mallon believe that should happen?</p></speech>

At national level, we have no sight over the impact on a workforce of a large number of people within that workforce contracting Covid-19.  Anecdotally, from my personal experience, having run a follow-up Covid clinic for the past five weeks, the vast majority of attendees at that clinic have been healthcare workers from a variety of settings.  The majority of them did not initially contract the disease sufficiently badly to require hospitalisation.  As we mentioned, some people have acquired a flu-like illness and have still not recovered three or four months later.  It is really vital to our economy that we recognise the extent and the nature of that and be able to characterise it.  There is no reason that the recovery of healthcare workers should be any different from the recovery of those in any other part of the workforce.  For example, if we are going to open up our economy, we need to know the expected impact in terms of absenteeism and recovery times of any resurgence in cases in the community.</p></speech>

First, I record our thanks for all the work everybody throughout the entire HSE and the health service has done.  I will make a few quick points before asking questions.  I am very supportive of the testing programme and the work that was done in getting the laboratories, including the German laboratory, on board.  It is vital that the HSE continues to deliver that service in the best possible way and is not influenced by the individual requirements of companies in different parts of Ireland looking for business, no matter who is selling it on their behalf.  I would like to see the HSE continue to provide that service based on the best possible clinical practice, results and outcomes.  That is important to put on record.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time being very limited.  Dr. Henry has said a number of times that the HSE has capacity for X or that 20,000 odd tests were being done in a day and so on.  However, our testing requirements are now much lower.  Maybe this is a real layperson's view but I cannot understand why, if the numbers being tested have gone so low because of a lack of community transmission, the HSE still cannot get the turnaround time down to a day.  The median figure and the average number of days was quoted earlier.  The infrastructure is there and the witnesses say it can be turned on at the drop of a hat.  If we have the existing infrastructure, the capacity of which one of the witnesses from the HSE said was in excess of what is needed at this moment, why are still not delivering the same turnaround times in the community as we are in, say, a hospital setting?</p></speech>

When a person feels unwell, he or she contacts a GP and the GP then has to refer him or her for a test.

We are currently meeting the targets we set for ourselves and we will look again at what we believe, particularly in light of the nature of our country and the pathways in which we can have testing, would be feasible and most desirable.

In the context of testing individuals entering the country at airports, a number of people are trying to sell kits that do these 20-minute tests, 40-minute tests and one-hour tests.  Most of the international research so far is very dubious on the effectiveness of those tests.  I would be very anxious that in their programme, the HSE and NPHET would be advising the development of air corridors with areas of like infection, rather than going with some half-baked testing idea that gives us no real protection.  To be honest, I would not have anybody coming into the country from the United States at this moment, regardless of whether he or she has passed a test at all, be it a 40-minute test or a four-hour test.  I do not think we should have people from the United States coming into our country.  I would be interested to hear that the view is as I hope it is, namely, that we would stick exclusively with like-for-like air corridors.</p></speech>

First, the public should be warned against doing any test that is not officially validated.  For example, the public may undertake an antibody test that would take 20 minutes but it really tells us very little when they think they are getting the reassurance of a point-of-care nucleic acid test.  We really need to put the message out there that people need to get tested through the official channels so they are tested right.</p> <p>  As I have said previously, we need to be very careful in terms of allowing people from the outside into the country.  If we allow unrestricted movement of people from any area of the world, whether it is the United States, South America or parts of eastern Europe or Asia where there is uncontrolled community transmission, we will be making trouble for ourselves.</p></speech>

If any of my questions are repetitive, my apologies.  I will be quick because I know time is against us.</p> <p>  In regard to the tracing app that we understand is currently being tested by the Garda, do we have a view on when it will be ready to go?</p><p>Are there any GDPR concerns regarding its use and will it be freely available to sports clubs and community groups?  Is the HSE working towards a test from home model?  If so, how would that work?  Would testing kits be free to all?  Third, were there many instances of members of the public who refused to engage with the tracing process and, if so, what were the consequences of that?  What lessons can be taken from it?</p><p> Finally, where the virus has re-emerged in other countries, it has emerged in superspreader events such as on public transport, in clubs and the like.  Are the witnesses confident that our testing and tracing system as it is currently set up will be able to respond to that type of superspreader event at short notice in a particular location?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.283" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#Z00200"><p>I can take the questions about the app.  I can confirm that development of the app is complete and in a technical sense, it is ready to be deployed.  The purpose of the app is to enable the health service to improve the speed and effectiveness of contact tracing.  It has three basic functions: the contact tracing, a symptom tracker and a trusted source of information relating to Covid-19.  It will add value by identifying more contacts than is possible in a manual tracing process.  This particularly applies to strangers who might become close contacts, and those cases will increase as we return to normality and lift restrictions.</p> <p>  The issue of timing has featured during the debate.  The app provides a capability to provide rapid notification to all close contacts who are app users within three hours.  That is a very significant gain on the alert and the guidance that will apply.  The app will be free to all citizens.  It is a population health initiative and we want all citizens to engage with it.  In that context, we have arrangements in place to have English and Irish versions and we have worked with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, to ensure full accessibility.</p> <p>  The app has two critical success factors as we assess it.  The obvious one is population take-up.  The other one is interface with the testing and tracing services.  On the interface with those services, I assure the committee that enormous work has been done to plug it in properly into the wider testing and tracing operation.  The issue of population take-up brings us to the GDPR issues and the assurances people can have about their privacy being managed in how the app is designed.  We have taken enormous care to ensure maximum privacy.  The development of the app over the past 12 weeks or so has been a journey towards the maximisation of privacy.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties and others have contributed substantially in setting out key principles that must be observed, and we are confident that we have observed those principles.</p> <p>  The app is voluntary.  It operates a decentralised architecture that avoids any data being held centrally by the health services or the Government.  Additional data of statistical value is provided by users on the basis of user preference.  All the details about the data and the privacy considerations are set out in a detailed data protection impact assessment, DPIA, document.  We completed that a number of weeks ago and it has been considered in great detail by the Data Protection Commissioner, who has responded.  The Minister committed in the D&aacute;il and the HSE committed in statements in recent weeks to making these publicly available and it is our intention to do that tomorrow morning.  That will be good in terms of transparency and it will set the ground-----</p></speech>

I am just curious about that.</p> <p>  I will move to my second question.  I totally agree with what Professor Mallon said about the footprint.  We will be putting a square peg into a round hole with regard to capacity come September, if not before.  To what extent does he believe issues like understaffing, the consequent long hours that people may have to work and the stretching of staffing are factors in the increase in infection rates among healthcare workers?</p></speech>

I have no comparator group.  There is, however, a much more prolonged period of recovery than would ever be expected for people with a mild initial infection.  That is what we do not know.</p> <p>  In the context of the footprint, I completely agree with the analogy of the square peg in a round hole.  To give an example of how relatively understaffed we are, this morning I compared our gross domestic product with that of Norway.  Ours is approximately 30% lower than Norway's.  Norway has more than 100 infectious diseases specialists for a population not dissimilar to that of Ireland.  We have fewer than 20.  I am sure it would be the same for every single medical specialty including nursing and for intensive care unit capacity.  We got away by the skin of our teeth largely due to the biggest non-pharmaceutical intervention the country has ever taken, which was mediated by the public.  We did not get away with this because of the capacity in our healthcare system.</p><p>To ask our healthcare system and the people within that system to do again what they have done over the past three months would be similar to asking the population to undergo the three-month lockdown again.  There needs to be a recognition, going forward, that we cannot operate safely with the current footprint and current staffing levels.</p></speech>

A question I still have is one to which I do not expect an answer today.  It is about whether we can expect the public to lock down again in circumstances where it is a question of assessing our economic response - it is a horrible question - having regard to the fact that 99.5% of the people who died of Covid-19 had underlying conditions or were over 65.  The question is to what extent we take out the entire economy for the benefit of that group of people or the extent to which we can afford to do so.  However, that is a broader question to be answered by lots of people in this Chamber at a different time.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputies who asked questions and the witnesses who came in to answer our questions and stayed longer than anticipated in order to do so.</p></speech>

Inclusion Ireland conducted a survey of parents in the first three weeks of May on how school closures were impacting on their lives.  In total, 1,064 people responded to the survey, with 89% of respondents reporting that their child was missing school quite a lot.  Educating at home is not working well for most respondents.  There are huge barriers to home schooling for parents who, in most cases, are not teachers.  Some parents noted that their child presents with behaviours that can be challenging or he or she has poor attention skills which require the support of a skilled teacher.  The support from schools has been variable, from excellent to non-existent.</p> <p>  Our survey indicates that most families have access to some form of technology that enables them to access schoolwork at home.  However, 11% have no access to such technology.  While the virtual classroom is an option for some, there is a technology deficit which means that many children have not been accessing education in this way.  A full technology audit and supply of equipment must be undertaken with immediate effect to ensure the children who would benefit from virtual education can do so.</p> <p>  Research tells us that school closures for extended periods cause regression in learning for children with intellectual disabilities.  These children need to be top of the priority list for a return to school.  They generally fall into the categories of those with highest support needs, traditionally referred to as moderate, severe and profound intellectual disabilities, as well as severe autism.  For most children with disabilities, direct access to teachers, special needs assistants and a structured lesson plan derived from their individual education plan is what is required.  These children find it more difficult to engage in virtual classes and should, therefore, be allowed back to school as early as possible.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has initiated a summer programme, which has expanded to include additional children in 2020.  However, the scheme continues to exclude cohorts of children with disabilities and has been characterised by poor planning, leaving schools and families frustrated and in the dark.  One trade union has stated the lack of guidance makes the scheme unsafe for pupils.  Parents are also reporting a lack of transport as a major barrier to attending the summer programme and there are significant fears for September.  The National Council for Special Education has previously expressed concern about the scheme being open to challenge on equal status grounds.  The scheme must be opened to all children with intellectual disabilities, including those in second level, as they also experience regression.</p><p> A very small group of pupils in the Irish education system will not be able to attend school for some time.  These are medically fragile pupils with disabilities to whom the Department needs to pay particular attention.  These children need regular access to their teacher via remote means or through the home tuition scheme.  It may require the Department to supply technology into homes as these children may not be back at school again for a significant period.  It must be noted that HSE therapy support which enables education has also ceased.</p><p> Inclusion Ireland believes the following should happen to mitigate the undoubted and continuing regression in learning and skills for children with intellectual disabilities.  A technology audit must be carried out to ensure all children who would benefit from virtual classroom support can do so.  We must include all children with intellectual disabilities in the summer programme.  At present, secondary school children remain the subject of possible discrimination by their continued exclusion from the scheme.  Children with disabilities need to be at the top of the priority list for returning to school and transport issues must be addressed in advance.  The resumption of HSE therapies such as speech and language therapy and occupational therapy must occur without delay.  Many of these services can be delivered in a virtual manner.  The Department of Education and Skills urgently needs to identify all children who are medically compromised and put in place supports for them to receive a home tuition package until it is safe for them to return to school.  Some of these children will not be back in school until a vaccine is available or Covid-19 is fully suppressed.</p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  I thank committee members for their time this afternoon.  We are very happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#GG00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses to the committee today.  I thank them for taking the time to be here and for their opening statements.</p> <p>  The National Council for Special Education and the Department of Education and Skills acknowledge that school closure and extended periods of time outside the classroom and the normal learning environment as well as the loss of regular school routine is causing regression in learning and skills and is having a widespread negative impact on children with complex needs and their families.  Mr. Egan has also said that.  All the central stakeholders are also highlighting the Government's summer programme as a pathway to combating such issues.  Mr. Egan called for the scheme to be opened to all children with intellectual disabilities, including those in secondary school.  Is it his understanding that this includes all children with complex needs that are in preschool, primary school and post-primary, as well as those with Down's syndrome?  If this does not happen, in his view how potentially devastating could the long-term effects of such a decision be?</p></speech>

It would be an understatement to say the summer programme has been characterised by confusion.  The Department has definitely changed the message it gave to organisations such as Inclusion Ireland, AsIAm and Down Syndrome Ireland over a period of weeks and that in turn has led to confusion among parents, schools and so forth.</p> <p>  At the moment, children with Down's syndrome who are in secondary school cannot avail of the summer programme.  Children with moderate intellectual disabilities at second level cannot avail of the programme.  Children who are in special classes at second level cannot avail of the programme unless they have autism.  No magic happens at 13 years of age to suggest that a child's education does not regress over the summer period.</p><p>These children have the same issues as children at primary level.  If the Department is making a decision that we should be admitting these children into the scheme at primary school level, I cannot see why there is a cut-off where it goes into second level.<br/><br/>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to what the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, said about the scheme in 2015.  The NCSE is the organisation which gives policy advice to the Minister and the Department.  It stated:</p><blockquote>	As the research evidence does not support the provision of an extended school year on the basis of a diagnosis of ASD only, we are concerned that continued funding may be open to challenge on equality grounds.  Research shows other students with significant intellectual disabilities .... can also experience regression in learning and a slower rate of recoupment.  </blockquote><p>For that reason, the NCSE was &quot;not able to recommend continuation of a scheme .... which is inequitable&quot;.  While it is welcome that additional children are in the scheme this year, it is still excluding a large cohort of children.</p></speech>

The research is pretty clear on it.  Long absences from school mean children with intellectual disabilities can suffer regression in their learning.  Making up that lost ground can take quite a period of time, if it is ever made up.</p></speech>

To me, it is almost like an abandonment of the children and their families who have really suffered for the past four months, obviously through no one's fault because we have a pandemic.  These children with additional and complex needs may not get support because they are now in secondary school.  I imagine that will have a long-term effect.</p></speech>

We must be mindful the country was faced with a situation that nobody could have ever imagined with schools closed down and people scrambling to address that.  Our own survey, which we would have presented to the Minister in May, indicated that for children with intellectual disabilities and autism, home education has been pretty much non-existent.  It has been very difficult for parents to engage that.</p></speech>

Will Inclusion Ireland go into further detail on the type of problems we are likely to face in terms of transport in order to give us a better idea of what we are facing in September?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#HH01100"><p>Normally during the summer programme or extended school year scheme, the special transport arrangement for the children in special classes and special schools would continue.  However, because of the disjointed nature of schools closing down in March, as well as the possibility of those contracts being terminated, along with losing drivers and the capacity to get that up and running, the Department for Education and Skills and the Minister said they would support families to make transport arrangements by way of a grant.  The problem with the grant is that simply by the very nature of special schools and special classes, they are dispersed across the country.  We only have 130 special schools across the country.  Many children can travel up to a maximum of an hour and a half one way to go to school in the morning.  For a parent with more than one child or trying to get back into the workplace, it is simply untenable that they would be making a three-hour round trip twice a day for their child to have four hours of school-based July provision.  Despite offering a grant, which would not be paid until the autumn in October or November, as well as the logistics for parents in organising transport, it means that where a child does have school-based provision on offer, the parents simply will not be able to take that up due to the transport issues.</p></speech>

It was a much more restrictive and discriminatory scheme.  What normally happens is that 70% of children avail of home-based provision because not enough schools are in a position to open up during the month of July to provide the extended year scheme.  The Minister, Deputy McHugh, said that last year some 230 schools participated - out of 650 eligible schools - and the current number that have opted in to participate this year is 200 schools.  There are more than 4,000 schools in the State.  There are mainstream national and post-primary schools that have got the staff together and that have a grouping of children who would otherwise qualify except for the fact they are in mainstream primary schools and are not in a special class.</p></speech>

I have one last question and one point to get across.  One of Mr. Egan's conclusions speaks to the need for schools, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to be supported to take part in the scheme as an important component in opening the scheme to a degree by which we can include all children with intellectual disabilities.</p> <p>  On Tuesday the committee heard about SNAs.  Ms Marie Daly, CEO of Crann Support Group referred to the childcare sector losing many childcare workers to the SNA sector, that they have all summer off, finish work at 4 p.m. and that they do not have the burden of responsibility or the paperwork to carry out that childcare professionals have.  I strongly disagree with this insinuation and I did not have an opportunity to come back in during that discussion on Tuesday.  Any of the SNAs I have encountered are very hardworking people who have a strong vocation for the important role they play within our education system.</p> <p>  In Ms Dempsey estimation, how many more SNAs would be required to deliver this scheme for July provision?  I believe the Minister, Deputy McHugh, said that 230 SNAs are working with families as part of their temporary assignments.</p></speech>

Thousands of SNAs underwent the vetting process to transfer through the redeployment programme through the HSE.  While it the figure of 230 was lauded yesterday by the Minister as a success story, in effect it showed there were serious issues with the redeployment phase and the vetting process, which significantly delayed linking SNAs up with children through the health programme.</p></speech>

I do not believe this is necessarily feasible.  Parents can now employ an SNA for the home-based provision but they are already saying there is huge difficulty in getting tutors and SNAs to take up the home-based provision.  We have more than 9,000 parents registered currently for an expression of interest but we will not know until October how many parents actually managed to engage a tutor or SNA.</p></speech>

For me, some of the hardest stories we have heard in recent months and weeks are from parents and children with autism, intellectual disabilities and special educational needs.  Some of the stories are on the loss of learning and in some instances, unfortunately, the regression that children are seeing.</p> <p>  My first question is general, because education is not just academic or scholastic.  From talking with many parents I am aware of the huge impact also in the loss of socialisation.  This has had a hugely detrimental impact on children.  I invite a brief comment on that general question.</p></speech>

Obviously, the main function of any school is to impart a quality education on the children who attend but there are also the many softer things.</p><p>Many socialisation activities such as being invited to birthday parties or becoming involved in the local GAA team happen through schools.  As the Deputy recognised, it is a very difficult situation.</p><p> While travelling to Leinster House today I listened to the RT&Eacute; "Morning Ireland" programme.  On it, a mum of three children who have autism related the detrimental impact on her youngest child, a four year old.  He has regressed and lost most of his speech.  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that regression is certainly a factor.  In our survey, families highlighted that children were missing school a lot and missing their friends.  Although some of the children could engage through online interaction, many could not.  The socialisation piece is what they are really missing.  There is a certain amount of routine around school for many of them.  Not all people with autism or intellectual disabilities are very rigid in their routine, but many of them like to have a routine.  They simply cannot understand why they are unable to go about their normal business and go to school.  That is a great difficulty for them and their families.</p></speech>

On the issue of the loss of speech, many parents fought an inch-by-inch battle to make progress.  The children and their parents were so proud of the gains that were made.  It is very difficult for them to see those gains being lost.</p> <p>  On summer provision and the way in which it is laid out, July or other summer provision is typically four weeks long.  The Government document states that it can be a minimum of two weeks, but if one gets two weeks in the school-based programme, one is not entitled to supplement that with two weeks in a home-based programme.  Are the witnesses concerned that children will not have the depth of engagement that was available in previous years?  In addition, as I understand it, if there are two or three children in a family, the same number of hours applies to them.  There is a maximum number of hours under the home-based programme for all of the children in the family.  Those children may see a much reduced benefit than they may have experienced in previous years.</p></speech>

One cannot avail of the school-based and home-based programmes.  To clarify, families do not have the option of turning down the opportunity of doing two weeks in the school in favour of four weeks in the home-based programme.  If the programme is available in the school, it must be taken up there.  As was stated, if only two weeks are being offered in the school, one cannot supplement that with the home-based piece.</p> <p>  On the issue of siblings, I do not have the exact numbers to hand, but there is a little bit of extra tuition available if there are siblings in the same house.  That was not available in previous years, but this year there is a small amount of additional tuition available.  Instead of having a strict limit of ten hours for one child, there are extra hours available for other children in the house.</p></speech>

Yesterday in the House, the Minister referred to 9,200 children having registered for the home-based programme and perhaps 3,400 for the school-based programme.  That is a long way short of 20,000 children.  I fear that there has not been enough capacity planning in the context of the number of teachers and SNAs required to deliver school-based or home-based programmes to that number of children.  Are the witnesses concerned that a substantial number of those 9,200 children may be disappointed because they will not be able to find a tutor?  That may be difficult to gauge.  Is it a concern the witnesses have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#KK00500"><p>The Deputy asked pertinent questions yesterday about capacity planning and whether the Department done any pre-planning in the context of expressions of interest from schools and educational staff to establish whether the promised programme was deliverable.  When it was initially announced, it raised the hopes of thousands of parents.  As the weeks have gone by, we have realised that all is not what it seems in terms of the numbers and capacity.  Only 200 schools have registered.  Those schools do not have the capacity to deliver a school-based summer programme for all the children enrolled in them.  The number of children for whom they can cater is limited by the number of staff who have opted in.  Some 9,200 parents have registered.  I encourage other parents to register an expression of interest now, go through the process and see whether their child qualifies for the scheme.</p><p>To reiterate, we will know until about October how many of the thousands of people who registered have managed to engage with a tutor or an SNA in the home.  It is going to be very late in the day where anybody can laud this as being a successful programme for supporting students.</p><p> It is about capacity.  One should not promise our families anything unless one knows one can deliver in terms of capacity.</p><p> On the HSE-led measure, which is the third aspect of the summer programme, the Ministers, Deputies Harris and McHugh, have indicated that they would like to support 1,200 children.  This also depends on the opt-in of SNAs and the opt-in of school buildings whereby a school that is not doing school-based summer provision or, indeed, is has expressed an interest in making its building available to the HSE for a HSE-led scheme with SNAs opting in.  Again, the Minister, Deputy McHugh, said yesterday that of the 200 schools that have opted in for a school-based programme, 35 have opted to provide a premises for the HSE-led scheme.  There is absolutely no way we can guarantee capacity for 1,200 children to be supported through this respite-based programme rather than the more educational-based programme.</p></speech>

Are they concerned that children and families will be disappointed because they will be unable to find a tutor?  Will a large cohort of people be affected?</p></speech>

We know already that families are having difficulties sourcing tutors who are registered teachers with the Teaching Council or SNAs.  Pay is an issue for SNAs.  Childcare, which the committee dealt with earlier this week, is an issue for staff signing up to the programme.  There are many deterrents there to people being physically able to provide the support to families over the summer.</p></speech>

The point has already been well made by Deputy Butler about children with Down's syndrome who attend mainstream secondary education and who are not entitled to avail of this programme.  There was much hope when the Minister announced that children with Down's syndrome would be entitled to avail of this programme but it now appears there are large categories of children with Down's syndrome who will not be in a position to do so.  Do the witnesses agree that this is a form of discrimination?</p></speech>

We, in Inclusion Ireland, can believe whatever we want but we would have to go back to the policy advice the Minister has.  The National Council for Special Education, whose representatives will be here later this afternoon, have previously described the scheme as inequitable.  By not allowing children with Down's syndrome and moderate intellectual disabilities, even with mild intellectual disabilities, into the scheme, because many of these children present with co-morbidities that further complicates their situation, the NCSE is on the record with policy advice to the Minister that the scheme is inequitable and open to challenge under equal status grounds.  I do not think it can be any clearer than that.</p></speech>

Is the proposed transport grant feasible or workable?  Will it assist parents to get their children to the school-based programme?</p></speech>

As my colleague, Ms Dempsey, has said, for many parents it is not.  I always cite the following example.  There is only one special school to cater for counties Monaghan, Cavan and Leitrim so people could be faced with travelling for an hour and a half each way to school.  That is an hour and a half to drop the child at the school, an hour and a half to travel home and the same in the afternoon, which is not feasible.</p></speech>

Many of my questions have already been asked so I will try not to repeat them and let more people in as the day goes on.  Therefore, I might take less time.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the impact on children at different stages of development and I thinking about the different ages.  Obviously our concern is for all of the children.  For many years the evidence has been that the earlier supports and interventions are provided the greater the impact.  I will talk about assessing intellectual disability and the allocation of schools.  This morning, I spoke to a parent who told me that their child simply cannot be assessed for cognitive reasons for intellectual disability until the age of five, with the practical difficulty then of accessing and registering for a special school.  I ask the witnesses to talk me through the background to the issue and explain how this creates problems.  I understand that waiting lists for special schools cannot be created because of the change in 2018 concerning waiting lists in general.</p><p>Can Mr. O'Connor provide additional information in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#MM00200"><p>In terms of early intervention, all of the international evidence points to a golden window of opportunity with children being the three-to six-years timeframe.  This is not to suggest that on reaching age six, learning is not achievable.  There are fantastic gains and learning that can occur after that age but three to six years is a golden  window of opportunity.</p> <p>  In terms of assessment, we are probably straying into the health arena.  In terms of HSE assessments of needs, however, there is a statutory six-month timeframe for such assessments and a further month to produce reports.  We know that this timeline is not met in approximately 90% of cases and that this means families do not have that accurate picture of their children.  In terms of how this factors in in schools, when one looks at the enrolment policy of any school in Ireland, be it a mainstream school, special classes or otherwise, the special education sector requirement is a psychology report that is less than two years old.  For a family that does not have such a report and is not awaiting one, this will be a barrier to their child getting into any school.</p></speech>

One of the cohorts that appears to have been left out is that comprising children with Down's syndrome transitioning to mainstream national schools in which there are no designated special classes.  Is this an issue that has been highlighted often in the Inclusion Ireland survey or in anecdotal reports?  I am not concerned about any one child in particular and I am sure this is not the only cohort that has been left out of the system.  These children, having been left out of the school system for six months, now have to make the transition to national school but without any supports.  This will be difficult because that transition is in some ways more difficult for these children.  Is this unique or is it something Inclusion Ireland is coming up against?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.358" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#MM00400"><p>It is definitely something that is coming up.  There is a cohort of children that is moving from supported preschools, either in the mainstream via access and inclusion model, which is an excellent system, or through specialist early years provision.  If they are moving into specialist provision in primary school, they will have access to the summer scheme.  Let us look at that from a human rights perspective.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which Ireland has ratified, is very much focused on mainstream education as the route we need to go down, yet the Department provides that a child who goes down the mainstream route to education will be denied this vital support.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Dempsey, at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#MM00500"><p>There has been a huge amount of work done by the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and other bodies in regard to transitions and the importance of transitions for children with disabilities.  For this particular cohort, whether they have Down's syndrome or another syndrome in the context of which an intellectual disability arises, it is very important to plan that transition.  These are children that would have had supports in preschool under the access and inclusion model which my colleague mention and which is led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  That transition has been broken since March.  It would have involved children visiting their new schools and work with them on changing and getting ready for the move from their local preschools into primary schools.  It is very disjointed now.  The fear families have is that their children will have a huge amount of difficulty settling in come September.</p> <p>  In a general sense, what the Department needs to focus on for all children, but especially those with disabilities who are transitioning into primary education, particularly mainstream primary schools, is the transition package.  It needs to come up with resources that all families and all schools can use, especially for the first three months, in terms of getting children back into school.  In the absence of guidelines, we do not yet know what schools will look like in the autumn.  However, schools will need support to bring children who have had that six-month gap in their education at an early education level into a school building where they may or may not be social distancing, where there is a much more rigid environment than in preschool and where the numbers are generally much greater.  What we need is a system response for all children, with the cohort of children with developmental delays being the subject of a particular focus.</p><p>I do not think it is something we can do individually as families or, if we are lucky, with a team around us.  The system needs to respond to what will be a much broader problem with children come September.</p></speech>

For children without intellectual disabilities or any social vulnerabilities other than the Covid-19 period it will be difficult enough, particularly those who have been in an ECCE scheme and have had to drop out of it and may or may not go back to childcare or any sort of structured environment for July or August, in addition to the usual two months of settling in for any child.  For children with medical or intellectual additional needs of one kind or another, it will be very difficult and disruptive and we will ask departmental officials about that later.</p> <p>  We have already discussed the nature of the different types of regression and I do not want to focus on that too much.  I refer to physical, as well as emotional and intellectual, regression.  I ask Ms Dempsey to talk me through some of that.  Children have made great gains physically and parents are trying to work with them at home.  When we talk about transitions, it occurs to me that the physical side is just as difficult in many ways.  Can Ms Dempsey talk me through the nature of some of the physical regressions?</p></speech>

All of those services closed in March along with their preschools.  The opportunities for them to develop have been very restricted, mainly to their own homes.  Children with physical disabilities require a lot of therapy input and assistance with equipment, including splints and seating assessments.  Where possible, in emergency cases the HSE and HSE-funded bodies have tried to respond to that with PPE and major precautions.  However, for the most part there have been massive delays in interventions to support the physical development of children.  Playgrounds have been closed and there has been a 2 km travel restriction, which has impacted heavily on the ability of families to utilise what is around them in the community outside of their home setting to bring on children's gross motor skills development.  It is not rocket science when a therapist explains the things that parents can do, but if they do not have wraparound services and are isolated it is extremely hard to know how they can support their children.</p></speech>

Being locked down has been a problem for all children, but it affects some even more.  I ask Ms Dempsey to talk me through the restrictions in terms of more hands-on therapy and hands-on physiotherapy.  How can we get back to the level of support required?</p></speech>

It is not a hands-on therapy.  For the most part, physiotherapy and all other therapies are about developing the capacity of parents to deliver them on an ongoing basis rather than what a child gets at a particular session and being able to maximise the input of the therapy and advice.  Service provision has been extremely limited.</p> <p>  There has been a significant issue with HSE staff and HSE-funded staff being redeployed to Covid swabbing centres or to Citywest.  We need all of the professional therapy staff who were redeployed for Covid-related activities to return to their normal posts.  There are also ongoing issues with the provision of therapy, which will be compounded by issues in the HSE where there are extensive waiting lists for all types of therapy provision.  The fear is that without serious investment in additional therapy staff who have been identified as being needed, more and more children will miss out and waiting lists will become more extensive.</p></speech>

Every single school in the country had to shut, regardless of the type of school it was.  That was the simplest thing to do.  Obviously some schools are different, such as special needs schools.</p><p>I am aware of children being taught in groups of two or through one to one tutoring.  Clearly, the risk is different with smaller groups of people.  It may be greater with different behaviour types.  In reopening the schools the risks should be looked at.  Has Inclusion Ireland had any engagement with the National Council for Special Education or the Department of Education and Skills on the reopening of schools, taking into account the various risk profiles with much smaller classes, shorter days or better ventilated rooms rather than every school being closed or reopened?  Has there been engagement with the Department of Education and Skills on risk reduction that could help with smaller classes?</p></speech>

As Mr. Egan said, we conducted a fairly extensive survey of families and asked their opinions on education and how they were coping in the absence of their children accessing school.  We sent that to the Minister and asked to have a meeting to discuss some of these issues.  We have not had a response on that yet.  We attended a briefing with the Department but it was not a consultative briefing.  It was very much to tell us what it was doing.  With regard to special schools, we have highlighted in our report and our submissions that while obviously public health guidelines must be adhered to, in special schools quite a lot of children are educated in smaller groups so social distancing might not be as big an issue.  We might have a typical classroom with between four and six children and a couple of SNAs and a teacher.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Dempsey, who wants to comment on this.</p></speech>

The day before yesterday, schools were circulated with another document from the Department on the school Covid-19 response guidance for the summer programme.  Much of what is in it can be got off the yellow posters, with the exception that mask wearing will not be a predominant feature when those schools hosting the school-based summer programme return next Monday.  This morning, I was on the Luas for the first time in two months.  I understand that from next week wearing a mask will be compulsory on the Luas but the Department has deemed they will not be needed in our schools.</p> <p>  With regard to planning for schools, particularly special schools and special classes, special classes typically have six pupils in a mainstream school and special schools have various profiles.  Each class might have anywhere between four and 11 children, depending on the type of profile of the children in the room.  They might have a teacher and a minimum of two assistants.  Some might have three or four assistants, depending on the complexity of the needs of the children.  Other classes are more nurse-led units for extremely medically complex children with a profound level of disability.  I have visited several special schools.  Some are in very new modern buildings with wide spacious classrooms where desks can be spaced out and social distancing can be managed to minimise contact, unless direct contact is needed for personal care or to guide a student in the educational programme.  I have also been to special schools that are ramshackle add-ons, with corridors that have been subdivided to squeeze in another child with an SNA and teacher, where courtyards have been roofed over to get in another special class and where people have to go through one classroom to get to another.</p> <p>  Certain schools will have a huge problem over the summer and a great body of work will be required to be able to provide a safe environment not just for our children but also the staff who will be working with them.  If they go sick our children will not have anybody to care for them or provide an education to them.  We implore the Department look clearly at supporting the schools with the resources they need to open up safely.  We all want our children back in schools but we also recognise the risks.  Infection-control measures will be very important as will ensuring schools have an adequate quantity of personal protective equipment where it is required, particularly for children who need regular contact.  Perhaps the idea of not instructing teachers and SNAs to wear masks means the Department will supply adequate personal protective equipment to those who need direct contact.</p><p>My child relies on an SNA for full support to access her educational programme.  Many parents will testify that it involves extremely close contact.  SNAs sit beside the child so it is imperative that we wear PPE on public transport where there are seats that are banked for social distancing.  My child, SNAs and teachers all have a right to be safe when schools return.</p></speech>

There is a tendency to assume that everything is working well and that this July provision debate comes in an extreme circumstance, which is why we are discussing it.  Can the witnesses speak to the reality experienced by parents who cannot find a school place?  Can they speak to the waiting lists that are there for basic interventions that can often last as long as five years?  I have documentation here from constituents of mine, one of whom has a daughter aged six who has been on the waiting list for two years for a basic intervention.  She has autism and the letter from the HSE states in black and white that the waiting list for Beechpark services is five years long.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses speak to the fact that many parents go from school to school trying to get a school place and can be and are turned down?  Can the witnesses speak to the number of times the Minister has invoked his right under the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 to instruct a school to open a unit?  Can the witnesses speak to the fact that because of the constitutional reality, the Department of Education and Skills abdicates its responsibility and puts the onus on parents to find a school place for their children and that special educational needs organisers, SENOs, hand a list of schools to parents and basically abandon them at that point?  We have parents who have been to 15, 16, 17 and 18 schools looking for a school place for their children.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses speak to the fact that parents become campaigners when they do not want to be campaigners?  They need the State to defend and protect them and to care for them.  What happens is that they suffer huge levels of exhaustion because at one point, one is dealing with a challenge in one's family life where someone has a diagnosis that has to be dealt with and learned about and then overnight and at the same time, one becomes a campaigner for services that are not there.</p></speech>

I will bring it back to that context so.  Given the context of the deficiency of services and of State provision for children with additional needs, how do the witnesses reflect on how these issues can be addressed in the long term in terms of the July provision and of schools returning in September?</p></speech>

I am aware of many of the issues that pertain in his constituency.  Even as recently as last week, I met with a group of parents from Involve Autism.  Those parents are in Dublin 2, Dublin 4 and Dublin 6 and the service provision for their children is virtually non-existent.  That brings me back to the fact that the Minister has asked the NCSE to prepare reports on those schools and on what kind of provision is there.  That has not happened because of Covid-19.  One might argue that it was not happening anyway and it should have happened in years gone by but it has not happened because of Covid-19.</p> <p>  I refer to the waiting lists for vital therapy services.  Going back to what was said earlier, the research shows that people will always make gains in life with treatment but children with disabilities have a golden window of opportunity between the age of three and six where significant gains can be made.  As my colleague, Ms Dempsey, said, many of these therapists have been put into contact tracing and Covid-19 testing and so forth, which is vital work.</p><p>We urge, however, that those folks be redeployed because in Ireland we seem to have flattened the curve.  What that will tell us, however, is that waiting lists have just got longer and longer.  While in an ideal world these therapy services should be delivered face to face, we have engaged with various therapists to provide information to families on our Facebook Live page as to what they can do during the Covid period.  These guys are at the forefront of physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology.  Some of them say a lot of this can be delivered virtually because in a lot of the programmes they deliver, if they are familiar with their patient or a child experiencing their services, they can give instructions and exercises to the parent, who can then go and carry them out.  The waiting lists certainly have not improved during the Covid period.  They were diabolical to begin with.  If, however, there is proper innovation through proper telehealth, many more children will be able to be seen than have been previously.</p></speech>

This is my second Covid session today.  The first this morning concerned contact tracing and testing.  Professor Mallon from UCD gave quite an interesting but worrying presentation in which he talked about the expectation of a second wave of the virus at some point in the autumn.  Should such a scenario arise, what lessons would the Department of Education and Skills apply that would be different from what happened in March?  What do the witnesses expect the Department to learn and apply to their special needs students should that situation arise in some schools, either regionally or on a county basis, or if even a mass lockdown has to happen again?  What lessons should we learn and how should we apply them?</p></speech>

Looking at it at a micro level, what should we expect in schools when they return, and what would be wise of schools to do?  Let us look at the preschool sector and the suggestions there, and other European countries and what they have done.  They have engaged a pod-like system whereby, particularly where there are medically complex children in special schools, school classes should not really mix with one another.  The staff who provide supports within class groups should not mix with other staff.  There should possibly be staggered movement around the school that is managed in case there should be a further outbreak.  It is not really a case of "should" because there will inevitably be an outbreak in the winter period.</p> <p>  We have learned a lot, including that the whole country does not need to shut down and that we should have the systems in place to manage any outbreak at a micro and local level initially.  Individual schools need to look at having a way to militate against the spread of Covid should a staff member or child introduce it into the school environment.  Again, it is a matter of stringent handwashing and having the supports and resources from the Department of Education and Skills.  If that means additional staff to split up classrooms, particularly for our vulnerable children, the Department should consider that in its budgetary planning.  We have the highest numbers of children in our classrooms in the country.  We advocate mainstreaming where possible.  My colleague, Mr. O'Connor, mentioned the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Article 24 of the convention infers a right of all children to an inclusive educational experience.  We need to treat all schools as if there are potentially vulnerable children within them for that to happen.  They could be children who are insulin-dependent or children with cardiac issues.  Then there are the staff themselves, who seem to be predominantly more impacted by Covid as adults.  Having said that, we do not want adults spreading it to children, who then potentially bring it back asymptomatically to other vulnerable family members.  That is imperative for that micro planning.</p> <p>  It is also important that at this stage that schools get guidance on what this should look like.  There are serious delays in that.  In the appendix to the Covid guidelines issued the other day, there is a protocol for staff returning to work, including a checklist, whereby the staff will sign to say they are not symptomatic, are feeling well, have not been party to contact tracing, etc.  There is no suggestion, however, of doing the same for children returning to schools.  Looking at the international experience, temperatures are checked and families have to state whether they have been in contact with a person through contact tracing.</p><p>The idea of closed bubbles is now quite common, particularly in special schools.  The UK kept certain schools open to provide childcare for front-line staff.  I will give one example of a London special school, which normally has 178 pupils.  From March, when most of the schools closed down, this school provided support for 20 pupils on an average day but some days there were as few as three pupils who were supported by a core group of staff.  They continued that support and now they are looking at expanding the number of children that are coming back into that special school in pods.  I believe that the UK Government has indicated that from July they are going to be very loose with the return to school and the precautions that need to be taken.  In schools across Europe that stayed open for the cohort of children with special educational needs and those who were considered vulnerable and for front-line workers, pupils were in school in very low numbers and they were very careful to ensure that there was not cross-mixing of staff and pupil groups.  We have to look at that as we open up in September.</p></speech>

Some schools are planning on opening for the summer programme this Monday.  They have had to basically do their own background reading.  It is important to note that there is the HSE return to work safety protocol, which businesses, schools and services have and which provides some guidance, but the Department of Education and Skills has been seriously lacking in this area.</p></speech>

It is probably no exaggeration to say that the past four months have been the most challenging for families and children with special needs.  Those difficulties have been amplified by the lack of routine and structure.  Those services were a lifeline for children and families and this was suddenly taken away.  Some of the news reports have been deeply upsetting, even to watch.  Families are at home, they are isolated, they have children with sometimes challenging behaviour and difficult needs and there is no outlet.  Anybody looking at those reports would be very moved by the situation.  I worked in special needs myself prior to getting elected and I know the staff and teachers have been deeply affected as well by the situation in the past four months.  They are in a situation where they cannot give back to their pupils and the service users.</p> <p>  I have three questions.  One is about the guidelines for July provision which are quite confusing for service users and schools themselves.  Second, September day services are going to look very different from how the classroom looked in March.  I am not sure if anybody can answer this question, but there are some students and some children who will take a considerable amount of time to come back to any sort of educational setting because of the complicated needs relating to the public health emergency.  They might never come back to that school setting or day service.  In those situations, resources must be put in place for families who find themselves in a position where their child cannot access any services outside the home.  That is the most challenging of all.  Could the witnesses give some sort of guidance on those questions?</p></speech>

One of the difficulties with going back in September, and this is an issue we have campaigned on for quite a number of years in Inclusion Ireland, is that there are approximately 109,000 children in supersized classes of 30+ in mainstream schools.</p><p>The pupil-teacher ratio shows a certain amount of what we need to know.  Some 109,000, which is approximately 20%, of primary school pupils are in a class of 30 or more.  That will be extremely difficult for the Department.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned resources.  The only way to get those people back in is to have additional space for social distancing depending on what the public health guidelines are like at the time.  That may entail additional teaching resources as well as physical space.</p><p> The guidelines for the summer programme or July provision only came out yesterday.  As we mentioned already, the Department's previous communication has been characterised by mixed messages that have served to confuse parents.  Inclusion Ireland has had contact from hundreds of parents who do not know how to go about the system and all of that. </p><p> I will deal with a final point before handing over to my colleague, Ms Dempsey.  A number of children who are medically frail attend schools.  As of two weeks ago when we asked the Department, no provision had been made for them.  We urge it to extend the home-tuition programme to these children because a significant number of children will not be able to attend school in the absence of a vaccine or complete suppression of Covid-19, as Mr. Egan has stated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.386" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#SS00200"><p>I wish to come back on the third point about the children who cannot come back.  I know Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in was alluding to the children who are just not in school in the first place because they cannot find a school place or where school places have been very challenging, and they have faced expulsion even from special schools.  A significant proportion of children would normally not qualify for the home-tuition scheme.  This is another departmental scheme usually for children who either for medical needs or because they do not have a school place would qualify.  We need to extend that kind of medical category provision for children where it is assessed as not being safe for them to come back in September for the winter period.  Parents of children with extremely complex medical conditions or profound disabilities have stated that winter is already a challenge with the winter vomiting bug, the flu and all the other viruses that hit schools.  These children can easily end up in intensive care in our paediatric hospitals.  The concern is real.  It is already lived experience with other viruses.</p> <p>  Other children are awaiting complex surgeries for conditions such as scoliosis or heart surgery where to get any viral infection at this stage would seriously delay their surgery dates.  Some parents this summer simply will not risk their children's accessing the summer scheme despite their needing it or bringing them back into school in September because they do not want to jeopardise any medical pathways or appointments relating to surgery.  The Department needs to look ahead at the likely number of children and the capacity of the different school environments to cater safely for their needs, taking into account the psychosocial aspect of children needing to mix.</p> <p>  It is complex and certainly needs to be looked at now.  For this cohort or indeed for children receiving cancer treatment or immunosuppressed because of drug regimes they are on, we have no indication that work is under way to cater for their needs or indeed ramping up a school nursing programme to ensure there is a higher level of infection-control participation within special schools where there are very compromised children.</p></speech>

I want to get their opinion on something discussed earlier, the issue of the exclusion of children with Down's syndrome from the July provision programme.  I have tabled a motion to allow their representatives to appear before the committee.  Do the witnesses have any insight as to why this group of children has been excluded?</p></speech>

At a briefing, the Department had indicated that all children with Down's syndrome would be allowed to attend it and then when more detailed information on the scheme came out, it curtailed that to primary school children.</p><p>We have no idea why that is.  There is no magic button and nothing magic happens at 13 years of age.  It is the same for children with intellectual disabilities and children who attend certain special classes in primary school.  They can attend primary school but not second level.  We simply do not know what occurs at 13 years of age that excludes them from the scheme.</p></speech>

I have already raised some of the PSO issues in this House and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is yet to signal any specific funding to cover the PSOs for school transport.  Have the witnesses had any engagement yet with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the likely scenario for the return to schools in September?</p></speech>

We have already explained why it is imperative logistically to get children to school, considering the geographic spread of special schools in particular, the areas they cover and the extensive travelling times certain children have to undergo.  In 2019 the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform raised a red flag over ballooning expenditure on the special school transport scheme.  We are very fearful that, under the guise of Covid-19 and restrictions to the service, efforts will be made to curtail the funding for the special school transport scheme on the grounds that more parents are opting to bring the pupils in themselves or more grants can be provided to parents.  Those grants would be accepted under duress.</p> <p>  Under normal circumstances the NCSE and the Department would be provided with the final number of new enrolments for special schools and classes and a public tendering process would be run over the summer for those special transport routes.  If parents are lucky enough, towards the end of August, just before school starts, they might get a phone call to tell them who is going to turn up on Monday morning to pick up their child for special school.  They are not always guaranteed to know who that is going to be, which is another issue.  We have no indication of whether there are delays with the public tendering process which should be happening over the summer, or whether social distancing guidelines will have to be taken into account in the transport routes.  If there are 17 children on a bus that is shared across two different special schools, which often happens, two school groupings and children who might be in different classes will be mixing.  If we are going to minimise the spread of Covid should it enter into a school setting, the transport arrangements are essential.  I reiterate concerns that this might be used as a means to reduce the funding for a particular budget that has already rung alarm bells for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Speaking of mainstream schools, they also mirror some of the challenges in special schools, such as the lack of sensory rooms, the lack of SNAs, SNAs acting like accountants by allocating hours to students in mainstream schools, the lack of a psychological assessment service, and only two assessments being offered on average to schools by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.  I recently raised these issues with the Minister for Health in this House.  Is there any opportunity for Inclusion Ireland and for people who are trying to represent the mainstream area to come together and funnel all these challenges, which are largely the same, towards the Department?</p></speech>

We engage with the Department regularly and raise many of these issues in our annual budget submissions.  NEPS is a blunt instrument.  Schools get their two assessments per 100 children and if a third child requires an assessment it has to be done privately.  That does not necessarily mean the parents have deep pockets.  They are quite often borrowing money to do these kinds of things.  It is pretty much a blunt instrument.</p><p>We have campaigned on this over the years but we have met with the finite nature of the resources that are available.</p></speech>

Apart from this, we are not aware of it.  In our own survey, we asked families what sort of supports they would like to see.  Some indicated access to the summer programme, which is happening, and others indicated access to the teacher before they go back and perhaps some visits to the school in the week or two running up to going back to school.  Having that contact from the teacher and the SNA would ease their way back in.  However, we have not seen any plan from the Department as yet, although when the Department appears before the committee this afternoon, it might have something.</p></speech>

It looks like there is no distinction between those attending preschool, primary school and post-primary school.  Is this the case?</p></speech>

As we have already indicated, most children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome at second level will not be able to access the scheme, or rather, to correct that, all children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome at second level will not be able to access the scheme.</p> <p>  With regard to children in preschool, if children are moving from preschool to specialist provision, in other words, a special school or class, they can access it.  However, many people want their children to attend mainstream schools.  While they may have similar needs to someone in a special school or class, it is just that they want to go down that route and to attend their local school with their brothers and sisters and all of their neighbours.  That is an aspiration we all have for our children in life.  However, if they have chosen the mainstream route and they are moving from preschool into mainstream, they cannot access the scheme either.</p></speech>

However, I go back to the policymaking arm of Government, the National Council for Special Education.  In 2015, so this is not new news, the National Council for Special Education stated to the Department that it was not able to recommend the continuation of a scheme which is inequitable.  That is what the policymaking people who will appear before the committee this afternoon said in 2015.</p></speech>

Many parents report that even though their child and primary school may be eligible to participate in this programme, they will not be able to avail of the opportunity if schools are not running the programme due to lack of guidelines and teacher and SNA unwillingness to participate.  Does Inclusion Ireland believe this is going to be the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#UU01100"><p>I got a letter from my daughter's special school the other day indicating the difficulties it has in terms of not having guidelines.  It is similar to many letters parents have received in the past two weeks.</p> <p>  The other issue is opt-in from staff.  Again, if one cannot provide the supports to staff to be able to opt in, such as paying them nearer the time they are working and providing childcare, thereby making it easier for them to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and to opt in to the scheme safely, in the absence of guidelines many staff have fears around being able to opt in to the scheme.</p><p>To refer back to the numbers, only 200 out of 650 eligible schools have registered to provide the programme, but mainstream schools which have staff ready to go have been excluded from being able to offer it to children.  Regarding the purpose of the school-based programme this year - it is not July provision but is called the summer programme - the intention of the Department is to reacquaint children with the school and learning environment and focus on transitioning to get them ready for school in September.  For the most part, with consultations, it was saying that its preference was a predominantly school based programme.<br/><br/>To refer to statistics from last year, the majority of children have home-based programmes not because they work but because there are few schools that will engage in the extended summer programme.  There has been a downward trend over the years of fewer schools engaging with it.  There is a plethora of pre-existing issues with the schemes that Covid-19 has only compounded.  Regarding the parents who are currently registered, I encourage parents to go to the <i>www.education.ie</i>summer provision programme website and to register their interest and follow the guidelines.  Essentially, however, what we are all doing now is competing for a very small group of teachers and SNAs who have indicated in their different areas that they are available for home-based provision.  Taking the 10,000 children who normally engage with these programmes and the children who do not find tutors in a normal year and promising that it will be extended out to over 20,000 children - indeed, yesterday the Minister stated that there is capacity for up to 24,000 children to avail of the scheme - if there is only a small pool of people who will be able to provide it, whether in school or in the home, those numbers are simply fanciful.<br/><br/>Everybody quotes Dr. Michael Ryan saying that speed trumps perfection and that we need to get things out despite mistakes.  What we have found with the Department is that there has been no speed and there are President Trump-like exaggerations in numbers.  Certainly, we are very far removed from any form of perfection for this summer.  It is devastating for families.</p></speech>

First, I refer to the survey that Inclusion Ireland conducted between 30 April and 20 May in which 89% of respondents, and these are parents of children with additional needs, said that their children were missing school and a further 78% said that students were not motivated to learn or it was not easy or accessible for students with additional challenges to learn at home.  I move from that to the summer scheme, formerly the July provision scheme.  With that information one would anticipate that there would be a massive uptake, given the recognition that there is a great need for students to have an educational facility available to them.  Last year, as was mentioned previously, 10,000 students participated in the July provision programme.  This year there are approximately 14,000 participating with one programme or another, despite the Minister saying that there was capacity for 24,000 or 25,000.</p> <p>  Something has gone greatly wrong.  Parents have recognised that there is a major need for students to be integrated once again into some form of education plan or programme, but the uptake is not there.  I note the witnesses said in the report that it is poor planning, lack of guidance, school transport and a variety of things.  I am interested to know at what point was Inclusion Ireland or parents, and I appreciate Ms Dempsey acknowledging that she is a parent, included in the discussion or negotiations for a programme such as the summer scheme.</p></speech>

All of our members knew that we were going to that meeting.  We issued a note about the meeting to our membership and there was a humungous backlash in the media and on social media.  That evening, the Department decided to widen the scheme.  This was good news but it is also where the confusion started.  Approximately two weeks later, we were asked to attend another briefing.  We were told at that point, "This is the scheme".  We thought it had been widened at that time but other information became available over the weekend that made it clear that certain cohorts of children that had been discussed were to be excluded from the scheme.  It is definitely not correct to say that people were consulted or that the views of parents were sought.</p></speech>

We are generally brought into a room and given a presentation on what the Department has decided to do and then that is what it does.  There is rarely a process of ongoing input with the Department.  Some other Departments do this better.  The HSE, for example, has ongoing working groups.  That would be rare enough for the Department of Education and Skills.  Ms Dempsey may wish to come in on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.420" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#WW00600"><p>I have experience of engaging with a number of different Departments while wearing different hats over the years.  When some Departments are looking at developing new policies and initiatives, they are inclined to take a co-design approach very early on to get input from stakeholders.  Over the years, our experience with the Department of Education and Skills has been, as Mr. O'Connor indicated, that one is informed of the direction the Department is going and that organisations are used more as a sounding board rather than being engaged with at the beginning.  Inclusion Ireland represents 66,000 people with intellectual disabilities and their family members.  We have a substantial mechanism to get the voices of parents to the table.  For example, over a two-week period and under difficult circumstances, we had more than 1,000 responses to the survey that was just conducted.  It is not that those voices and those opinions, which can sometimes contradict those of parents, cannot be brought to the table; it is just that they are brought to the table a bit too late in the day.</p> <p>  I will go back to a question Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked and about which he spoke to the Minister yesterday: the question of capacity and of what the Department did to engage with educational stakeholders and schools to see how many schools and staff members were likely to opt in before this programme was launched and before up to 24,000 families were promised that their children would have some level of provision over the summer.</p> <p>  What normally happens is that the Department opens up applications for the July provision programme in April and those applications are then processed over a two-month period.  Post-primary pupils then engage in July provision from the month of June and primary children engage for the month of July.  Again, a limited number normally qualify.  Knowing that public health guidelines and lockdown measures could be alleviated to such a degree that these schemes could be rolled out, I would have expected the Department to engage from April.  This is similar to the concerns I have about special school transport.  If the Department is not on top of this matter now, we are going to have difficulties in September.  It is an issue of process with regard to the way certain Departments have conducted themselves during the Covid crisis.  Some Departments have gone into fifth gear while others have kept to their standard mode of addressing issues.</p></speech>

If I were one of those parents listening to this discussion at home, the distinct impression I would get is that, when it comes to the witnesses' engagement with the Department of Education and Skills, they were not listened to or heard and were brought in only after the fact.  Is that an accurate summation?</p></speech>

At the first meeting, the departmental officials stated that they would be severely restricted in what they could do and would only be allowing special schools and special classes to run the programme this year.  Approximately an hour and three quarters later, the Minister was in this House stating that the programme would be opened up to all children with Down's syndrome in a very much expanded group.  Whatever the communication issues were between the officials and the Minister, we are not sure.  They were at least to our advantage in this instance in that we were told at the meeting the following week that the scheme was to be very much broadened out.  However, as Mr. O'Connor explained, over the course of the weekend, as parents were looking at the criteria, they realised that all children with a mild to moderate intellectual disability in post-primary mainstream provision, regardless of their syndrome, were excluded.</p></speech>

We know now from listening to the witnesses where they were before and where they are now.  It is clear that the system needs to change.  What one thing would they like to see changed, going forward, in their dealings with the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.424" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#XX00400"><p>A more collaborative and co-design approach from very early on would be helpful and has worked well in other Departments.  It is about listening to the voice of the child and finding out what it is that children actually want.  We know from our own survey of parents that 10% or 11% of children are happier at home.  The stresses of being in the school environment created a crisis for them on an ongoing basis.  There were bullying issues and their mental health was suffering.  It is imperative to listen to the voice of children.  While it is okay for us parents to talk, we need to be able to understand what our children want as well.  One of the key things that stood out for me from the survey was the fact that more than 80% of children missed their friends and the school environment.  During the first couple of weeks of the lockdown, the question that was repeated to me every minute was "When is the virus over?".  My daughter wanted to go to school and see her friends.</p></speech>

I was really impressed with Mr. Egan's opening statement, in which he said: "Some parents noted that their child presents with behaviours that can be challenging or he or she has poor attention skills which require the support of a skilled teacher."  That sums up everything we have been discussing over the past number of years.</p> <p>  I have done a bit of work around autism provision and with parents of children with autism.  How I came to that was because of the number of people, year on year, who contact us because they cannot get an ASD school place for their child, or an assessment, a particular therapy or school transport.  I came to the conclusion, long before Covid ever was here, that there is a two-tier education system, whether or not people want to admit it.  It should not be the case but it is.  If a child has an additional need, he or she is basically a second-class citizen in the education system.  That is a very sorry thing to have to say but it has been my experience from dealing with the parents in question.  That is not to take away from the very good schools and very good teachers who do a huge amount of good work in this area.  The expectation that a child with an additional need can wait forever for a school place or that it is okay for a child to have to be driven for two hours to and from school every single day is not acceptable.</p> <p> When one is among the last to speak in debates like this, many issues have already been covered, but I have several questions for the witnesses.  They note in their submission that the National Council for Special Education previously expressed concern about the scheme being open to challenge on equal status grounds.  I do not think anybody should have to take that case but we have seen over the years in this country that it sometimes take a court case to get people to wake up.  I know it is a different thing but if we look at CervicalCheck, for example, I often wonder whether we would ever have heard about what happened there if the matter had not been brought before the courts.</p><p>Has Inclusion Ireland ever given consideration to that?  I accept that cost would be an issue and it is not something it should have to do, but I would welcome the opinions of the witnesses on that first.</p></speech>

I reiterate that Inclusion Ireland has long held the belief that the scheme is discriminatory in its nature but it is not only us; the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which provides policy advice for the Minister for Education and Skills on special education needs, has stated the scheme is inequitable in its current guise.  That has not changed.  The NCSE tells us that the research shows that children with other intellectual disabilities, not just autism and severe and profound disabilities, can suffer educational regression.  There is no reason they should be excluded from the scheme.</p> <p>  In response to what the Deputy and others have said, sometimes when one has a child with a disability a parallel universe opens up when that disability is confirmed.  One goes into what we term "special land" and services can sometimes be difficult to access.  Parents often characterise it as a constant fight for supports, be they financial supports from the State or educational and health supports.</p> <p>  Specifically regarding the July provision scheme, a couple of parents came to us some years back who were fed up with the situation whereby their children could not access the scheme.  They took a case to the Equality Tribunal, which is now in the Workplace Relations Commission.  It took a long time to get going but eventually in the summer of last year the case went to the High Court, at which time the Minister settled the case so a judgment was not made.  The two children with Down's syndrome were allowed to access the July provision scheme they were not previously allowed to access.  This summer allowed the Minister to build on that and to open up the scheme fully.  We welcome the bit that it has been opened up but we urge him to push it that extra little bit and to include young people who are in second level education.  It would not have been too much more ground to cede on the scheme.  While there is still time, we urge the Minister to do that.</p></speech>

On Tuesday, the committee discussed the early years childcare sector which is reopening on Monday.  We all accept that there will be challenges, difficulties and teething problems for everybody reopening at the moment.  Given that other sectors are reopening, there is a way to provide the July provision to all children with additional needs rather than to just limit it.  Do the witnesses think it could realistically be extended?  What are the barriers?  Even before Covid I heard that a lot of schools did not want to sign up for the scheme.  I know it is not possible to say for definite what the reasons are for that, but do the witnesses have opinions on it or even anecdotal evidence?  Does the scheme present difficulties for schools?  I have heard that if a school volunteers to do it, staff do not get paid until November and there are difficulties in that regard.  Is there a way to make the scheme more accessible and easier?  Do the witnesses believe it can be done this summer?  That would be the one clear way to indicate that there is concern about children with additional needs and that they are as important as everybody else.  There is no point in the Minister or the Department saying they empathise and that they know it is difficult for parents and children.  The only way to address the issue is through action.  This could be one way of doing that and showing the Government is serious about it.  I would welcome the views of the witnesses in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.430" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#YY00400"><p>What has been really important about the opportunity today is to have such a level of focus on the summer programme and refer back to the normal July provision that would take place.  We have moved up a few steps in terms of broadening the scheme.  We welcome the recognition by the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills that children suffer regression and it is not just children with autism or children on the severe to profound end of intellectual disabilities.  It is a big step and it is something we have been looking for.</p> <p>  In terms of the operation of the scheme and making it a reality, the teaching unions and managerial bodies would be best placed to answer that, but we do know from the public domain that pay is an issue.</p><p> SNAs traditionally cannot deliver home-based provision but they can this year.  Both for SNAs and tutors, when the forms are completed by the parents and the tutors at the end of August and submitted to the Department, they will not be paid until November.  Again, going back to the point about childcare, if one needs to engage a childminder to look after children during July, the childminder will not accept that the parent will not pay them until November or December for that work.  It acts as a disincentive.  I know people have been talking about having to get into the higher tax brackets.</p><p> For schools, it is about supporting and encouraging them to be in a position to deliver.  Schools will say that staff can be burned out, particularly in special schools where a high intensity of supports are given to children.  There have to be different ways of encouraging staff and enabling them to deliver the July provision or the summer scheme.</p><p> One good point about this summer is the fact that the Department has recognised the scheme needs to be flexible.  Instead of it having to be delivered only in July, this summer it can be delivered any time from 29 June right up to 21 August.  How it is delivered can be very flexible.  There is a maximum number of hours of 40 but that can be delivered by breaking up the weeks if suitable for the tutor to engage in it.  We need to hold on to the flexibility.  However, it has just not been enough this year to put this programme together so late in the day.  Not having the guidelines for the schools has played a major factor.  The management bodies and the education unions would be better able to answer those questions.</p></speech>

Sometimes, when one puts in a parliamentary question, one gets an answer back that everything is fine and rosy in the garden when the experience is a lot different.  Is there assistance available from the NCSE or from SENOs to assist people in finding tutors?  From what I have seen and heard, it is parents who really have to do all the groundwork and legwork.  Not every parent has the capacity to do that.</p></speech>

In fairness this year, however, the NCSE has produced a document that indicates - again it is only a sign-posting exercise - the websites where tutors will advertise that they can work on the July provision scheme.</p> <p>  This year the scheme has changed slightly.  Most years, one would ordinarily express an interest in taking part in the scheme and then later on the Department would send an email asking one to fully apply.  This year, that system is not there.  Without the proper guidance, many parents do not realise that they have to print off the actual claim form and that the principal has to sign it.  That is their authorisation to go ahead to get a tutor.  The parents then have to see the tutor's Garda clearance, or proof of it, signed by a notary, a solicitor or a commissioner of oaths.  While there is a rationale for the Garda vetting, these are the barriers and difficulties that parents face.  At least this year there is a bit of guidance on where parents can go to look for tutors.  It is very much, however, that the parent has to go out and find somebody.</p></speech>

Is there a case for a national forum for itself, along with organisations such as Down Syndrome Ireland, whereby they could be statutory consultees on major policy issues like this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#ZZ00500"><p>Under the Education Act, the Department of Education and Skills has a statutory obligation to consult with the National Parents Council Primary and the National Parents Council Post Primary.  Beyond that, it is whoever else is deemed to get on the list for consultation groups.  Traditionally, Inclusion Ireland would be in consultation groups with other disability organisations.  There would be a teachers consultation group with a therapist or health led consultation group.  As well as going back to how other Departments get involved in more co-design with stakeholders early on in these matters, there is room for the Department to have a national forum made up of a broader spectrum of groups.</p></speech>

With regard to many of the Department's consultative pieces that we experienced in recent years, it is pretty much a <i>fait accompli</i>when one is asked one's opinion on something.  I will cite one example.  When it changed over the resource teaching hours scheme everybody in the room would have very much advocated for an appeals mechanism for when a parent was not happy with the number of hours allocated to their child.  It was unanimous within the room, but the Department chose not to go with it.  That is one example.  If the Department was to consult in a meaningful way it would be very welcome.<br/><br/>One of the other partners coming into the committee this afternoon along with the Department is the National Council for Special Education, NCSE.  In fairness to the NCSE, its consultative processes when developing policy advice are generally quite significant.  It will meet with us and invite written submissions and sometimes one can see the submissions we have made reflected in the NCSE policy advice.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could all think a bit more about future plans or things we ought to include.  Some of the criticisms made could have been avoided if a forum and statutory consultation were in place.  I am aware that one cannot do it every day of the week but it could happen for major policy initiatives.</p> <p>  I wish to raise some other issues and to support what other members have said.  I have a constituent who has three children each of whom has a diagnosis of autism.  Pre-Covid-19 they would have had 120 hours, which is what they had last year, but this year they are getting 100 hours.  This is a significant disadvantage to those children.  One of the children attends an Irish language school and needs the additional support.  Normally, children would come from a primary school with this diagnosis, and pre-Covid-19 they would have had the normal integration programme with much new learning to be done.  There is a huge lacuna this year, notwithstanding the good things that are being done, where a family such as this are being cut by 20 hours and they cannot get the service they need.  This is a huge issue.  There is also the issue of paying for a tutor.  The mother wants to make the arrangement as she did last year but she does not have a guarantee of the income.</p> <p>  The second case I want to make is for a child who needs to attend a special school in Drumcar, the parent lives in Drogheda and the family do not have a car and do not have access to public transport.  Their needs are met, if they can afford it, with a taxi costing &euro;35 each way.  This family would have to pay &euro;70 per day to get their child to that service.  They are told they can be recompensed at the end of that period - in other words, come August they will get back the &euro;1,400 they had paid.  They cannot, however, afford to pay.  There is a huge issue where parents cannot provide the transport and cannot afford to pay for it and, therefore, cannot take up the place.  I know Mr. O'Connor is aware of the special school, St. Mary's in Drumcar.  This is a huge disadvantage for some families.</p> <p>  On the rights of these children, will Mr. O'Connor please articulate what this committee should recommend in additional supports and rights?  These rights should be there automatically and the families should not have to beg or fight for them.  The rights should be there by fact and by definition.</p></speech>

As my colleague, Ms Dempsey, has indicated, the transport grant is often not made available until the end of September or October.</p><p> On wider socioeconomic issues, we know that when a household member has a disability, there is a greater likelihood of that household experiencing or being at risk of poverty.  They do not have &euro;1,400 just sitting in a drawer to pay out on taxis and then reclaim several months later.</p></speech>

It boils down to one of the issues raised by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, that is, a lack of supported school placements.  We have found that in County Louth, to which the Deputy referred, County Dublin and elsewhere, children are transported from one area to another, while children from the latter area are transported to the first location because that is where the school places were available at the time they were looking for them.  There is a significant amount of transporting of children.  If we were to urge the Department to do one thing in respect of the summer scheme and in light of the Covid restrictions, it would be to make transport available for families in order to ensure children can get to their placements.  As the Deputy mentioned, these children have rights, including a statutory right to education.  There is no doubt that the Covid-19 period has been extremely difficult, but that right has not disappeared into the ether.</p></speech>

Basically, if a family does not have transport, as is the case for the family to which I referred, the Department should meet the cost in advance and make those arrangements.  It is entirely unfair and unacceptable for a child with significant disabilities, as in the case I have mentioned, to be placed at further disadvantage as a result of being offered a place which sounds great, but to which he or she cannot get.  That is not acceptable.</p></speech>

Businesses have lost money, but they will be able to make that money back in the future.  People have put on weight, but they will be able to lose it.  However, some children are not just failing to develop - they are regressing.  My daughter was born recently and it is amazing to watch her develop.  I cannot imagine what it must be like to watch one's child not just fail to develop, but regress.  I acknowledge that there are shortages everywhere.  The Clare Crusaders Children's Clinic in Ennis is inundated with requests from parents who are desperate to get help because they are watching their children regress and do not know whether they will ever get them to make progress.  In light of the shortage of SNAs, could the Government consider using occupational therapists, speech therapists and specialist nurses to provide July provision, or would their skill sets be unsuited to the provision of that service?</p></speech>

Many of them have been redeployed to Covid-specific work.  We are waiting for the HSE to engage in a process of getting them back into their original posts.  I do not think their involvement in July provision would necessarily be feasible.  The issues around childcare, being paid late in the autumn, being put into a higher tax bracket and all the other disincentives that exist would just be extended to another group of people.  That is not to say that their involvement would not be advantageous.  There is a related issue, namely, that there is already a shortage of all the categories of worker the Chairman mentioned.  The irony of tomorrow being the second anniversary of my sitting in one of these committee rooms and raising issues around the provision of therapy and educational supports to children is not lost on me.  At the time, no new children's disability network team had been established since 2014.  Two years later, there still has been no such new team formed.</p><p>We have a severe shortage of the people the Chairman refers to and we require heavy investment to provide that scaffolding around parents, now moreso than ever.  The Chairman touched on the fact that he has a new baby and how one appreciates watching one's child develop.  When one becomes a parent of a child with special needs any minor achievement is massive and I cannot overstate that.  Parents have had to deal with much emotional upset over the past couple of months, seeing children not being able to sleep, destroying their houses or assaulting siblings and not through any fault of their child but arising out of the frustrations and lack of supports.  The lack of access to school and therapists over the past three months has been catastrophic and I cannot state that enough.</p></speech>

My name is Teresa Griffin and I am the CEO of the National Council for Special Education.  With me today are Mary McGrath, head of operations, and Madeline Hickey, acting head of special education.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact of Covid-19, as an organisation we were able to move online relatively quickly because many of our staff already worked from home and most of us have the technology to do so.</p><p>We are delivering nearly all our services to families and schools online but this required a period of adjustment and changed processes. <br/><br/><b></b>In terms of the impact of Covid-19 on students with special educational needs and on schools, it is very clear that Covid-19 and the resultant closure of school buildings has challenged the education system to its utmost.  It has had a significant impact on all students, their families and teachers.  However, it has had a profound impact on many students with special educational needs and their families who greatly value the structure, individualised teaching, adapted curricula and intensive support given to these students in schools.<br/><br/>Many students with special educational needs are not independent learners.  They are not a homogenous group of students who can take a piece of text or an article or a chapter of a maths book and work independently.  Some need adult assistance with every activity and cannot be left alone for any period of time.  Some cannot engage with learning in an online environment.  All of them need more support and guidance, over and above that required by other students, to give them the best chance to reach their potential.  They need an education that is differentiated to their abilities and needs.<br/><br/>To move a school-based education online overnight, without the planning, time, equipment and training required for all involved was very challenging, particularly for teachers, principals, students and their families.  Online education requires access to technology but for these students it may also require access to specialist assistive technology, adapted curricular activities, therapeutic inputs and supports for families.  From an NCSE point of view, we immediately began to develop resources that we felt could best assist parents and teachers in trying to support students at home.  These resources have been broadly welcomed, in particular our seven booklets on promoting learning and positive behaviour at home; and our theme of the week material, but we recognise that many parents do not have access to technology, stable broadband, or time nor are they teachers themselves.  We know that students with complex needs regress more over the normal, long summer break than typical students and also take longer to recoup or regain their learning.  We were very pleased that the Minister was able to run summer provision this year and expand eligibility to include students with additional needs other than those typically provided for, namely, children with severe-profound general learning disability or autism.  This is in line with our 2015 policy advice on the extended school year.  Summer provision will enable students to re-engage with learning and assist the transition back to school.  This is very important for students who have anxiety issues as well.<br/><br/>On the position with regard to 2020-2021,<b></b>like everybody else, the NCSE would like to see a full return of all students to school in late August-September, provided it is safe.  We are not public health experts and, therefore, cannot advise the Department of Education and Skills in this respect.  We note, in the return to school context, that many special classes and special schools have much lower pupil-teacher ratios, often as few as six students in a class with a teacher and two SNAs and, therefore, social distancing issues may not be as challenging as in mainstream.  We are working with Department of Education and Skills colleagues to prepare resources and supports that we think will be useful for both students and teachers in transitioning back into school.  We are also working to ensure that our work resourcing schools as well as our teacher professional learning, in-school support, visiting teacher services can be delivered online, in a blended manner or in person depending on the situation in September.<br/><br/>We are very happy to clarify any matters in our submission for the committee.</p></speech>

I am assistant secretary with responsibility for inclusion in the Department of Education and Skills.  Attending with me are other Department of Education and Skills colleagues, including Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer in the Department&rsquo;s special education section, Mr. Brendan Doody, assistant chief inspector in the Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate and Ms Anne Tansey, director of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS.</p> <p>  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s announcement on 12 March last of the closure of all schools, colleges, universities and other training and learning facilities was the commencement of a series of challenges across the education and training sector as a result of Covid-19.  The challenges continue to be managed by the Department of Education and Skills, the education partners and a range of stakeholders.</p><p> The interests of students and their families, as well as the safety of the staff in the sector, have been the paramount considerations throughout.</p><p> Advice and guidance was issued to the school sector following the closures.  All schools were asked to work to minimise the impact on teaching and learning by continuing to plan lessons and, where possible, provide online resources for students or online lessons where they were equipped to do so.  Schools were asked to be conscious of students who may not have access to online facilities and to consider this actively in their plans.  Information was provided for teachers on a range of online resources to assist schools to provide ongoing support to students during school closures.  Following the decision that they would remain closed after the initial period, more comprehensive guidance was issued to all schools on supporting teaching and learning.  Specific guidance was also issued for those engaging with students with special educational needs and those at risk of educational disadvantage.  Additional ICT grants and the creation of new resources have also been part of our response.  There are many good examples illustrating how schools and teachers have developed innovative ways to connect with their students.</p><p> While most children have adapted reasonably well to the new circumstances, there is evidence that the absence of school and other supports is having a negative impact on the lives and well-being of many of those with complex needs and their families.  The loss of the regular school routine, social interaction with friends, access to teachers, special needs assistants, therapy services and respite-type supports are presenting a real risk of regression in the learning, the social and emotional development and the well-being of these children.  Furthermore, many families are reporting significant challenges caring for their children in the absence of these supports and routines.</p><p> Phase 4 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business sets out that educational institutions can open on a phased basis at the beginning of the 2020-2021 academic year, with a limited reopening provided from phase 2 on 8 June last.  Since the Government decision of 5 June, the Department has progressed plans for specific programmes and initiatives for children with special educational needs.</p><p> Summer Provision 2020 - Reconnecting with Education, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  The summer programme includes a Department of Education and Skills-led programme involving school-based and home-based strands.  It is focused on providing a foundation to re-establish relationships and a sense of belonging and connectedness to school, re-engaging with learning and support and the successful transition or reintegration of students with their peers into their planned education setting for the next school year.  The programme also involves a Department of Health and HSE-led activity-based programme delivered in a school setting.  In-school or home-based supports provided by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs.</p><p> To be eligible, a child must fall into one of the following categories: pupils with a diagnosis of autism; pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties; any child in a special class or special school; children transitioning into a special class from early years settings to primary school; and pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with a number of disabilities.  Comprehensive guidance and frequently asked questions for the programme have been published.  Participation in the programme by schools, teachers and special needs assistants is voluntary and so far the response is very positive with 200 schools registered to run the school-based summer education programme.  Some 36 schools, of which 35 are also running the school-based programme, have registered to participate in the HSE provision.  It is estimated that 3,400 children will benefit from these school-based programmes.  Almost 9,200 children are registered for the home-based programme.</p><p> Decisions on summer provision must be underpinned by public health advice.  The Department has this week issued guidance to all primary schools to help guide them in running the summer provision.  This guidance is informed by our engagement with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, and the Department of Health.  I thank the committee for giving the Department the opportunity to discuss these issues today.  My colleagues and I are happy to take questions from members on this matter.</p></speech>

Their submissions are very valuable and I thank them for their time.  My first questions are directed to the NCSE and the remainder will be to the Department.  In our previous session, we heard that a great deal of concern and frustration was expressed by the parents of children with Down syndrome.  This is something I have experienced with constituents.  These parents, on the basis of some of the announcements, expected that their children would be entitled to avail of summer provision.  However, it has now emerged that children who are in mainstream secondary schools or who are transitioning from early years services to mainstream primary schools will not be able to avail of summer provision.</p><p>Is there any good educational reason for this?  Is it in line with the 2015 policy position on the expansion of summer provision?</p><p> Ms Griffin stated that in light of the size of the units there might be greater capacity to ensure they return.  There is a particularly acute shortage of units in large parts of the country, including Dublin, Cork and Kildare.  There may well also be a number of other areas.  Will Ms Griffin provide a brief update on the work the NCSE is doing with the Department to try to resolve the lack of spaces in units.</p></speech>

The research is very clear that all students, irrespective of special educational needs, regress over the long summer break and that students with complex needs not only regress more but take longer to recoup what they have lost.  It is almost impossible to generalise but the important thing is that students who need additional support over the summer or access to a summer programme should get it.  It should be based on their individual needs rather than a category of disability.  We thought the categorisation of disability with regard to access to the extended school year was open to challenge on equity grounds because we could not find any evidence base to support access simply for children with autism-----</p></speech>

There is no basis for that.</p></speech>

For the coming school year we will open 190 special classes.  We recognise that in some parts of the country there are pinch points.  We have written to the Department to advise it of our concern about south county Dublin.  In Cork, we believe there is an issue with regard to special school places rather than special class places.  Generally, there are one to two places that can pop up from time to time but we work very well with the generality of schools on opening special classes.  For a number of reasons, in some areas we have found it difficult to get schools to open up special classes.  This can be because the school might not have space or an outdoor area to build in.  There can be a number of reasons for this.  It is disappointing that we have had to write to the Department to say that in south County Dublin there will be some areas where we will be unable to open special classes.</p></speech>

We had a look at almost every school in south County Dublin, and the reasons can vary.  Many schools just do not have the space and are using every classroom they have for classroom purposes.  Other schools have no space outside on which to build.  We have been working with many schools and getting some engagement on opening special classes, but there is a shortfall of in the region of eight classes in south County Dublin.  The main reasons concern accommodation.  Some schools would prefer upfront training for their staff.  That can be provided, and we have explained that.  That is what we did in Dublin 15 last year.  It is, however, fundamentally a matter of a lack of space in the classes and the fact that schools are not automatically provided with rooms for special classes as they are built.</p></speech>

There are proportionally as many children there who need additional support as there are anywhere else.  As a result, I urge Ms Griffin and the Department to do everything they can in this regard.  We still have difficulty with the Red Door school and so on, but I will leave that for the moment and go back to the overall issues.</p> <p>  On July provision, I ask Mr. Tattan to confirm a couple of things.  I would like simple "Yes" or "No" answers.  This is a voluntary scheme - correct?</p></speech>

Many of them have been both available and interested very often, and it is great to see the engagement so far.  This year is different, however, with everybody experiencing their own knock-on effects of Covid, whether illness in the family, childcare arrangements or whatever.  To confirm, this is a voluntary scheme.  The Department cannot force people to participate.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Tattan talk about the overall background to this and the level of engagement with the Department and the different schools?  Were we to go into a second lockdown, what is Mr. Tattan's forecasting?  Could we be assured of a more consistent approach from education providers to children, especially those with additional needs?</p></speech>

As stated earlier, we have issued a number of items of guidance and have had a very close engagement, particularly through the inspectorate in the Department, with schools to try to ensure that level of consistency.  Where there has not been that consistency, we have taken steps to address that.  I will ask Mr. Doody to come in.</p></speech>

In the period between the closure of schools and 16 June, the inspectorate endeavoured to contact as many schools as possible.  To date, we have managed to contact approximately 60% of all schools.  The idea behind the contact was supportive in the first instance, seeing what schools were doing to meet the needs of learners and seeking to find out the extent of the challenges in those spaces.  Then the view was towards repackaging what the schools were telling us about what was working such that we would be able to provide guidance to all schools.</p><p>Over the recent period, we have worked with colleagues in other sections of the Department, including those in NEPS, to put several guidance documents into the system.  We have provided guidance documents for schools to assist them in their work to support children with special educational needs.  That includes separate documents at primary and post-primary levels.  We have provided a guidance document to primary and post-primary schools to support them in their work with students who are most at risk of educational disadvantage.  We put a guidance document together after being in contact with Youthreach centres.  This is a very important sector for young people who are vulnerable and so on.  More recently, we have put guidance documents together for schools to support their summer provision.</p></speech>

If this were to happen in November, for example, we could expect that schools will be ready.  It is not just an online provision because one can pick up the phone or send documents.  Parents might expect a more consistent response from schools in the future.  I appreciate this happened suddenly and quickly and without preparation but we will never be in that situation again, so we might expect a more consistent response if it happens again.</p></speech>

The idea behind the guidance documents is ultimately to share the good practice that we encountered and were told about in the school system, so that other schools which may not have worked to the same extent are able to see that many things are possible.  There are many really good examples of schools adopting very innovative and creative approaches and finding solutions to the problems that were presented.  Other schools can learn from those.</p></speech>

I see what the Department is trying to do there.  I raised it with Inclusion Ireland.  I wish to raise the case of children who have been in supported early-years settings and are now transitioning into mainstream primary school.  I argue that they face a bigger and more difficult transition because they are transitioning not into a special supported class but into the mainstream.  They arguably require more support than children who are transitioning into a special class.  I want to press the case for children who have been away from the educational sector for six months and are now transitioning into mainstream school, which is difficult for anybody.  Is there any way of reviewing what is being done to try to include this group of vulnerable young people, even at this late stage?</p></speech>

Does Mr. Tattan see my point?  Going into a mainstream school is difficult anyway, but they may not have the additional support they need if they are just on the cusp of being able to go into mainstream and have been away from school or a structured environment for six months.  Does the assessment of need take into account the actual provision and availability of classes for the child?</p></speech>

There could be a child with a recommendation to go into a special class.  In that situation, he or she should go into a special class.  It would not be considered appropriate to place him or her somewhere else.  The idea is that children in special classes have a greater or more complex level of need than children in the mainstream.  That said, there are very significant supports in the mainstream as well, both in terms of special education teachers and SNAs.  There are supports for incoming students whether they end up in special schools, special classes or the mainstream.</p></speech>

I appreciate their presence today.</p> <p>  In my constituency of Kerry, principals and parents have raised the allocation of SNAs.  I very much welcome the rollover of SNA allocation and SET allocation from last year to this year.  That is very positive and progressive.  Notwithstanding that, the needs of schools change every year.  I could give a number of examples, but one in particular stands out.  Following its notification of allocation, a school received applications from four students with additional needs and therefore it obviously would require further SNA support.  However, it has been advised that the opportunity to give SNA support will need to be reviewed in the autumn.  What exactly does that mean?  What timescale is involved?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, the public health guidance is going to inform where we are and that will be based on the experience as we move through the summer.  There may need to be changes in how both SNAs and special education teachers work with their students because of physical distancing, other restrictions and heightened concerns.  Some of the children we are talking about have significant medical conditions as well so we have to take cognisance of all of that.  Until we have that guidance, we are not going to know for certain how we will go about that but it is something we can keep under review.</p></speech>

I appreciate that previous speakers have raised the issue of the summer programme or July provision but I seek a little clarity on it.  This morning we heard from Inclusion Ireland and its representatives told us that in the survey they conducted among parents of children with additional needs, 89% of parents very clearly said their children missed school and 78% said that homeschooling did not work well for them.  One would anticipate, therefore, that there would be a significant uptake of this summer programme.  The Minister for Education and Skills forecasted that when he suggested that between 20,000 and 24,000 students might take that opportunity.  Last year there were 10,000 students on the programme and yet this year we are only looking at approximately 14,000.  Why has there been such a divergence between the projected figure of 20,000 to 24,000 and the uptake of 14,000, bearing in mind that parents are crying out for an opportunity for students to attend such programmes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#TTT00400"><p>There could be a few reasons for that.  To clarify, the figure of 20,000 to 24,000 relates to eligibility, so that is the potential universe of children who could benefit from the scheme as we have constructed it.  Up until this year, July provision only applied to children with autism and those with severe or profound intellectual disabilities, and in a typical year there would have been a cohort of 15,000 and about 10,000 or 10,500, or two thirds, of them would typically take it up.  The figure of 14,000 is not far off that.  As the Deputy noted, one would expect there to be more this year but from talking to parents I know and others who contact the Department, some would have concerns for their children about going back now.  They might think it safer to wait and see how things progress for Ireland on the Covid-19 issue through the summer and wait until the autumn.  While the schools being closed is far from ideal, if they have put up with it for this length of time they may be prepared to wait a bit longer just to see.  Some will have made that decision out of an abundance of caution.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Tattan clarify once and for all that, irrespective of the announcement on 5 June, which was hugely endorsed and welcomed, children with Down's syndrome who attend a mainstream second level school are not eligible to participate?  Is that the case as it stands?</p></speech>

We have had, and continue to have, engagement with Down Syndrome Ireland on this issue.</p><p>We believe there are arrangements.  There were arrangements in place last year under a different scheme through which Down's syndrome children of post-primary age could benefit from summer activity, and that was funded through the Department.  We are seeking to have something similar in place.  We certainly have no intention of taking away something that was available last year. </p></speech>

I am glad there was an acknowledgement we are short of eight special classes in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown region alone.  One of the reasons given was a lack of physical space for these and I want to know if there is any plan to resolve this in respect of the capital programme or temporary buildings.  It is an issue of unfairness that seems deeply inequitable, if not unconstitutional.</p></speech>

The challenge can be the time it takes to do that and the space available.  The area with which the Deputy is familiar is very built-up and, therefore, there is more limited space than on greenfield sites or in more rural locations.  That said, the work the NCSE has done and the work that was done in Dublin 15 showed that, sometimes, existing space can be made available in certain circumstances.  Given the report is in regard to intake for September this year, the answer has to be within what is immediately available.  That is not to say that forward planning is not important - of course it is - but in terms of the immediate issue for September, that has to be resolved through existing space being made available in those schools.</p></speech>

We expect we will engage with schools immediately over the course of the summer, as we had to do last year also in a different part of the city.  We are hopeful that, within the schools that are being looked at, there is potential for that space to be provided for the next school year.</p></speech>

As we know, in March, all schools in the country were shut down<i>en masse</i>, regardless of how many pupils were in a class or what type of distancing was present.  I guess this was a blanket approach to dealing with an immediate problem.  However, in reopening them, perhaps we can take a different view in cases where a very small number of pupils are being taught by one teacher.  Is the Department engaging with NPHET or with the Department of Health to find a way to have a low risk or to take risk into account and, at the same time, provide what is a vital service for special needs children?</p></speech>

We have had very extensive engagement, particularly over the past few weeks, with the Department of Health, through the office of the Chief Medical Officer, and also with the HPSC, which provides the detailed technical guidance to the HSE that ultimately gets issued.</p><p>There is some very helpful work being done there which will help inform us on general things such as hygiene, distancing, school transport and specifically issues relating to special education.  Within that there is an acknowledgement and acceptance that at times for those with children who are quite young or children with certain disabilities the distancing is not always either proper or appropriate and is not really possible.  If they are going to be supported appropriately, the distancing we have all become familiar with in everyday life will simply not work in those school situations.</p></speech>

Children are seeking to be taught by teachers over video connections.  The representatives of Inclusion Ireland told us earlier that they estimated from their survey that 11% of homes with a child with disabilities did not have equipment such as a laptop or tablet to connect to and receive that education.  The total number appears to be approximately 1,500 families, which does not appear to be an impossible number to resolve if we were to provide those families with laptops or technology to allow them to access education.  Is that something the Department is examining or will consider?</p></speech>

For example, there was an additional &euro;10 million in an ICT grant pushed out to schools earlier in the year with advice to support children who would not have ready access to technology.  Along with our colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment we have also worked with some of the telecommunications providers to zero rate websites and so forth, and in the case of people who have packages which they might have been exceeding, therefore costing them more, to zero rate some of those too.  A number of things have been done and there are further proposals in the pipeline to provide that support, particularly for those who simply do not have the ready access to the technology that is required.</p></speech>

My first question is about the summer programme.  A principal contacted me to say that she was under the impression or she was told that the pupil-teacher ratio for the summer programme would 6:1.  On that basis she encouraged four teachers from her staff to sign up to the programme, which they did.  Then she got an official notification from the Department stating that the ratio would be 12:1.  As a result, two of the teachers who had signed up for the programme will now no longer be able to do it.  Will Mr. Tattan comment on that?  Was there an official statement from the Department that it would be 6:1, and if that situation changed what was the reason?</p> <p>  I will read a message that was sent out by a school regarding July provision.  I want to get the reaction from the Department to the message that parents are getting from schools.  It states: "Due to lack of guidance and support from the Department of Education and for health and safety reasons the school has decided not to participate in the summer provision programme".  That came from a primary school.  I was a primary school principal and when a primary school principal is engaging with the parent body, one's language is very tight.  One generally does not use any type of blame, one might say.  However, this is quite stark.  What reaction would the Department have to such a communication from a school to a parent body?</p> <p>  The third issue is transport for July provision.  Certainly, in an urban context it might be easier to access July provision if it is school based, but it is obviously more challenging if one lives further from the facility.  However, even in an urban context many people and children have to travel long distances in transport which is often provided but which I understand will not be provided in these circumstances.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to respond on those three issues - the pupil-teacher ratio, the statement from the school to the parents and the issue of transport.</p></speech>

That is the ratio for the primary scheme for literacy and numeracy, which has existed for a number of years.  Schools typically avail of this for 12, 24 or possibly 36 kids but usually for no more than that.</p></speech>

We have not changed that.  Some months back, 72 schools initially agreed to participate.  We put out a further request for expressions of interest and 210 primary schools wished to run the DEIS primary programme.</p> <p>  On the issue of the lack of guidance, I am disappointed to hear that a school does not wish to participate.  We did issue guidance on this matter on Tuesday.  This included a template which schools can use and adapt and some very helpful information on public health considerations.  There is ongoing engagement with stakeholders and further guidance in this regard will be issued later today.  All of that is informed by the advice we have been getting from the HPSC and our colleagues in the Department of Health.  There is guidance.  Obviously, we would have liked to have it out earlier than this week but it is there.  We know many schools wish to proceed with summer provision and have been putting plans in place.</p> <p>  On school transport, this is again an issue of timing.  We would have liked to have provided school transport in the normal way.  Unfortunately, in order to do that, we need time to go through the procurement process.  We were challenged this year because we were not advised that we could actually run this until early June  Only in much more recent times have we known which schools would participate and the numbers and locations of children who wish to participate.  We are making a grant available to parents.  That will not answer the issues in every case but we hope it will be of some assistance in helping children to avail of summer provision.</p></speech>

I want to go through some of the comments Mr. Tattan made in his opening address.  I imagine that supporting special education provision while minimising the risk of spreading Covid-19 infections both during the summer programmes and as we reopen schools in autumn will require an increase in the amount of sterilisation of rooms and cleaning staff.  How many more cleaning staff are the Department expected to hire between now and when the schools open in the autumn?</p></speech>

We have been clear, however, that where they need additional cleaning, hand sanitiser or PPE, schools can avail of this things and that we will reimburse them.  That will be funded.  We want to have procured facilities in place for schools coming back in the autumn so that they will not have to go through that reimbursement exercise.</p></speech>

I have worked in many schools throughout Dublin.  Most schools have cleaning staff for two hours a day.  When we leave this Chamber, it will be sterilised before another group comes in.  Does the Department anticipate an increased level of expenditure on the provision of cleaning staff, to be paid for by the Department?</p></speech>

On the second page of Mr. Tattan's opening statement it says, "Additional ICT grants and the creation of new resources have also been part of our response."  Will he go through those funds?  Is he referring to the &euro;7 million allocated to secondary school and the &euro;2 million allocated to primary schools or have additional funds been allocated?</p></speech>

That is what I am referring to with regard to ICT.</p></speech>

It was a grant that had previously been made available for schools that had high-performing or good ICT strategies.  It was not an additional grant; it was just a grant that was brought forward.  It worked out at &euro;2,900 for a school of 160 students.  That would pay for approximately three devices.  A school of 750 students would have got approximately &euro;17,000 from the fund, which would buy 17 devices.  Clearly, that is not enough to bridge the digital divide in any way should the virus re-emerge in the autumn.</p><p>Is it anticipated that more money will be made available for that provision?</p></speech>

They are very vulnerable children, as the HSE has categorised them.  We will need to consider the technology piece as part of that.</p></speech>

During the committee's first session today, a professor from the school of medicine in UCD talked about the expectation that the virus will re-emerge in August.  We should be pre-empting that and having a budget available which can be used to support the students and their families who are affected.</p> <p>  In regard to the summer provision and, in particular, the DEIS aspect of it, much of the work that is going on seems to be concerned with the well-being of students.  That is absolutely welcome because we are going to have a flood of children experiencing emotional distress and an expectation on teachers to deal with that.  What supports and training have been given to the teachers and SNAs taking part in the summer provision who will have to provide that well-being support, and how far in advance have those supports and training been given?</p></speech>

That is a normal and healthy response to the challenges we have faced and it is being dealt with through the collective experience that has been utilised and the support that has been provided.  It has been managed largely across our society.  We know that the public health restrictions and school closures have rendered some families and children more vulnerable.  We know that those with a pre-existing need have been rendered more vulnerable, as have those who experienced illness, bereavement or financial stress.  The removal of the supportive school structure, which is a key protective factor in the well-being of many children's lives, has rendered some children more vulnerable.</p> <p>  Since the start of the pandemic, we have been providing guidance around supporting the well-being of children and young people while they have been out of school, as well as support for their teachers and their parents.  That guidance has been issued via the Department of Education and Skills.  What we are planning for in terms of the summer school provision is a training webinar that NEPS is currently developing which will be made available to all teaching and other school staff who are supporting the summer programmes.  We intend to provide additional guidance in this regard and there will also be support from NEPS psychologists.  That is the plan for supporting the well-being of our children and supporting the school staff who will be delivering the support to children.</p></speech>

We may not be there on the ground but we are always available for consultation with our schools and we will continue to be available to support school staff to build their capacity to manage the situation.  Our expectation around the well-being of children as they return to school is that some will be very happy, relived and excited to be back.  There will be other children who experience some degree of anxiety but we anticipate that most will settle down quite quickly after an initial period.  It is normal to expect some anxiety but most children will settle down.  That is our expectation.  We are also planning for and supporting teachers to notice those children who are struggling or are reluctant to come to school.  There may be students who arrive with behaviour presentations that are different from normal and who fail to settle down.  We will be working with teachers and school staff to notice and plan for how we might respond in order to support children if that happens.</p></speech>

The need for the summer provision, both to have it and to expand it, is obvious.  The aspiration of the Minister to reopen the special educational needs provision as best as possible in September is a noble and correct one which I am sure everybody shares.  However, I wonder if there is a Walter Mitty element about some of this in terms of matching aspiration with reality.</p><p> I had a few conversations before coming in here, one with F&oacute;rsa, which represents SNAs, one with an SNA and another with the parent of a child with special needs who is involved in the group of parents protesting against the cuts.  Every one of them was just scathing.  What F&oacute;rsa said is that the plans for the summer provision are laughable.  Schools do not know about numbers in classrooms. They are not clear what to do with PPE.  They are not clear what to do about feeding and washing where it is necessary to do those things for some children.  They are not sure about deep cleaning, who is going to do it and whether it is going to be done.  They are not sure about the type of protocols necessary in the home-provision section where SNAs, for example, would be going to people's homes.  Should they be tested?  Should they not be tested?  Would insurance be in place for taking children out in cars?  The impression given across the board is that the guidance and supports are just not there.</p><p> The SNA to whom I spoke informed me that SNAs feel very badly treated.  She stated that he has been 17 and a half years in the sector.  She said that, first, they were told they were going to nursing homes and then, when it was realised that in many cases rather than doing nothing, they work during the summer, often with the same children, they were told they were going to support the plan for the summer provision.  They were told they would get &euro;16 an hour, which would be much less than that after tax.  They are getting no supports and they are badly paid in the first place.  In her case, she said she is just not doing it.  How does Mr. Tattan respond to those criticisms and the level of frustration that has been expressed?</p></speech>

We have been working with F&oacute;rsa on the temporary reassignment of SNAs to the HSE.  More than 230 SNAs have been temporarily reassigned into the HSE and we are really appreciative of the flexibility that they have shown around that.</p> <p>  We also share some of the frustration in a sense because we would have liked to have this guidance out earlier.  As I indicated, it is going out today.  One of the stakeholders we will meet this afternoon is F&oacute;rsa.  We are seeking to engage with people.  I can understand some of the frustrations people feel in respect of these matters.  Some of the issues Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned are included in the guidance that was issued on Tuesday and the remaining items will be going out today.  We would have liked it to have gone out sooner but most of the substantive work around having summer provision only became possible when we had that public health advice at the beginning of the month, so most of the work-----</p></speech>

We had a presentation earlier from Inclusion Ireland.  Down Syndrome Ireland sent in several questions.  While I know the issues have been raised before, on its behalf I would like to ask several of its questions which are still pertinent.</p> <p>  On the summer provision programme proposed by the Department, will the witnesses provide data on the number of children deemed eligible for the programme in past years?  What percentage of these children actually availed of the July provision?  If they do not have that to hand, will they come back to me and Down Syndrome Ireland on it?</p> <p>  We are still struggling with the Minister's decision.  On 5 June, he had signalled that Down's syndrome children were to be included.  We know secondary school children were not, however.  Will the witnesses explain why that was the case?</p></speech>

Last year, about 10,500 participated in that with 7,000 at home and about 3,500 in schools.</p> <p>  The announcement made last Friday week was clear.  There are several categories such as blind, deaf or moderate general learning disability.  Down's syndrome is in that group where the provision is for primary.  Effectively the reason for that was built around and informed by a needs-based approach, looking at those with the greatest level of need.  We focused on those knowing that the demand would be significant this summer but uncertain in terms of supply and ability for teachers and schools to meet that.  We wanted to focus on those with the greatest level of and with the most complex needs and where the greatest level of risk of regression was.  That is why it has been framed in the way it has.</p></speech>

I accept it is not an easy job.  I can assure Mr. Tattan that it is not an easy job for the parents either, especially where they were getting buoyed up about their children getting some respite care but having their hopes dashed.</p> <p>  Parents are experiencing difficulties this year with a shortage of tutors willing to participate in the programme and with teachers in receipt of full salary without undertaking any additional work over July and August.  Will the Department outline the incentives for teachers to participate in summer programmes, given that they are already in receipt of full monthly salaries?</p></speech>

There is also additional extra personal vacation days.  There are additional days that they can accrue and then take during the regular school year.  They can do that as part of summer provision.</p> <p>  To return to the Down's syndrome point, on the post-primary side we are in engagement with Down Syndrome Ireland around the post-primary issue.  There is a proposal there concerning the post-primary age children.  We do not anticipate that they are going to be left out in the cold.</p></speech>

On 5 June the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, opened the summer provision programme for this year to include children with Down's syndrome, making no distinction between those attending preschool, primary school or post-primary school.  Will Mr. Tattan explain how, over the course of the following week, the guidelines produced for the summer provision programme discriminated against certain cohorts of students with Down's syndrome?  The guidelines are certainly not in keeping with the declaration made by the Minister.</p></speech>

Many parents report that even though their child at primary school may be eligible to participate in the programme he or she may not be able to avail of the opportunity as schools are not running the programme due to a lack of guidelines or maybe teacher or SNA unwillingness to participate.

There are 200 schools registered that wish to participate in the programme and we will be putting out a further call to any other schools that wish to do it, given the flexibility this year whereby the programme can be run right into mid-August.

It is of vital importance to these schools and to many more out there.</p> <p>  I have other questions but they do not relate to the crisis we are in at the moment.  Perhaps Mr. Tattan will get his colleagues to contact me on one further query, if he cannot answer now.  The calculated grades system, which replaced this year's leaving certificate exams, was the best solution to a difficult dilemma during the Covid-19 crisis.  Like everything else, however, it has its flaws.  One of the concerns with leaving certificate students in my constituency is a case where a student had studied a European language outside the school.  This student did not have a tutor or teacher and was not attending grinds.  The student was able to study on his own and performed well in the subject at junior certificate level, but has had no track record on the subject in the school since then.  How will this subject be graded under the calculated grades system?  It was brought to my attention that no provision was made for this situation in the calculated grades system.  The student in question will not have a European language, and therefore will not be able to meet the criteria for university and will not be offered a place in the college.  Is it possible to make provisions for students who are in this situation by taking into account results achieved at junior certificate level?</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of PPE in the country, with a sizeable stock warehoused very close to where I come from in east Clare.  Availability of hand sanitiser should not be a difficulty.  I am sure it would not be beyond the capability of a State that built Ardnacrusha in a couple of months to install taps in some schools under the summer works scheme.

That is concerning.  The advice received was not what the Department expected.  Suddenly, it was possible for summer provision to be made available.  The Department found out in June that the programme could be provided, but there was not enough time to plan for it before it was due to commence.  I am very keen to avoid a similar situation in September for every secondary and primary school in Ireland.</p></speech>

We expected that there might be nothing possible in the home environment because we felt that in the absence of the sort of advice that became available in early June it was very unlikely that teachers or SNAs would be willing to go into homes or, equally, that families would want outsiders coming into their homes in the absence of very clear advice on that.  Similarly, with schools, we expected the provision to be quite limited and we were engaging with the HSE just on those with the most complex needs, which was a relatively small cohort, to provide some additional support there.</p> <p>  We are obviously very pleased that the advice is the way that it is.  We have had some time to come with an expanded programme, and that is recognising the gap in provision that there has been.  We do believe, from the response that we have got, that we will have a good programme concerning both the home and school-based aspects.  </p></speech>

I am talking specifically about  autism spectrum disorder, ASD, and also in general.  What provisions are in place to provide either resource hours, a place in a special school or an ASD class?  I refer to children who everybody knows will probably need an ASD class, a specialist school or resource hours from September.  Unfortunately, they cannot receive such support because they do not have a diagnosis, which was already an issue in this area.  Given that no children have been diagnosed over the last few months due to Covid, what plans are in place?  I would hate to see children negatively impacted.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.618" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#CCCC00400"><p>I will start and then I will pass over to Ms Griffin.  In recent years we have changed how we allocate special education teachers in the mainstream.  In the past the requirement would have been a formal diagnosis and then a certain number of hours based on a disability category.  We have moved away from that since September 2017 to the special education teacher allocation model where, based on a profile, schools are allocated that based on complex needs, on a baseline, on standardised test scores and one or two other factors  That builds a picture of that school and we resource the schools based on that profile.  That followed advice that we received from the NCSE and detailed work, which Ms Griffin may want to touch on.  Effectively, what that means is that a child does not need a formal assessment.  The resources are available in the school and will be there waiting for September.</p> <p>  Children who are occasionally on waiting lists, say for the HSE or others or are working with the HSE disability teams, again, it gets picked up that is complex need and it gets factored into the provision for the school.  Occasionally things change.  I mean a child might move over the course of a year and move to a school.  That, of itself, could, depending on the child's needs or the numbers of children there, significantly change the make up of that school.  In that situation there is an outlet for the school to apply for an exceptional review and get additionally, if merited.  </p></speech>

I know one cannot apply for a place at a particularly school in Kilkenny unless one has a diagnosis on paper.  I mentioned resource hours but I also mentioned an ASD class and special schools.  What happens if one awaits a diagnosis that has been delayed due to Covid and one's child is due to start school in September?  Will such children be accepted into that school or will they have to wait and maybe start late in October or November?</p></speech>

There is only one ASD preschool in Kilkenny and as such Ms Griffin will probably be aware of the preschool I am speaking about it.  The preschool can cater for 12 children but it has only nine children enrolled, with diagnoses in respect of three other children delayed owing to Covid-19.  Every year, this preschool is inundated with queries.  This time last year I was dealing with a number of parents who were hoping to get their children in there.  It is not the case that there is a lack of demand or need for this service.  The preschool has been advised that if it does not have ten children enrolled by the end of September it will lose an SNA.  It will definitely be able to fill all of its places in the months ahead but it currently cannot do so owing to Covid-19 and delays in diagnoses.  I would welcome a comment from Ms Griffin.</p></speech>

We are all aware of how difficult the current situation has been on children with additional needs, parents and families.  There is no point in us applauding those people and saying that they are doing great work and that we have empathy with them unless we are prepared to take action to help them.  As I said in an earlier session, we can do this by expanding the summer provision programme to cater for all children with additional needs.  During that session, I noted in the opening statement of Inclusion Ireland a comment that the NSCE feared Inclusion Ireland could be in breach of the Equal Status Act because such provision is not being rolled out.  I would welcome Ms Griffin's views on that.  I would also like to hear from the departmental witness why this programme cannot be rolled out to all children with additional needs.  Why can such a plan not be put in place?  For as long as I have been a Member of the D&aacute;il, this issue has come up for discussion every summer.  I understand that things cannot be done overnight, but can we at least make a start on putting a plan in place?  I believe we need such a plan in place for this summer.  This would show children with additional needs and their families that they are as important as everybody else and they matter.  There is no point in saying we have empathy and we understand that things are difficult; people want to see action.</p></speech>

We have been doing work on it.  The NSCE policy advice dates back to 2015.   We agree with the council and we want to move to a needs-based provision for the summer, which would be much more in accord with other reforms we have made across the special education sphere over the past number of years, moving away from categorisation to a needs-based approach.  We were doing quite a bit of work on that this year, looking at it in a more activity-based programme, which is, again, in line with what the NCSE had recommended.  We had taken that work to a certain point and had had a number of engagements on it with stakeholders and other Departments that also fund or support summer-type provision.  Unfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis largely derailed that work.  What we have done for this summer is a programme that is an expansion on previous years but we recognise it is not a panacea.  It is not what we would ultimately like a summer provision programme to be but it is more equitable than what other schemes might offer.  This programme allows other groups to be involved and it has, as far as possible, had regard to that needs-based approach in informing the groups that we came up with as eligible.</p></speech>

Many of them may have concerns regarding transport.  I accept this is not a matter that comes directly within the remit of the witnesses.  Could interim services or, perhaps, an interim programme be put in place for them for this September-October?</p><p>Many will not be able to move directly to adult services because of everything that has happened and the uncertainty that exists.  People came to me in February and March to ask about transport and then all of this happened.  Everything is up in the air for those families, and they have had a difficult few months.  Can anything be looked at in terms of an interim measure before people transition if there is going to be a gap?</p></speech>

Our default position is that people should transition.  A child who is in his or her final year of school and who would normally transition into adult day services with the HSE ought to make that transition.  We have done other things.</p> <p>  Mention was made of calculated grades.  What we sought to do there was not to put students into a holding or repeat position.  We found a mechanism through which they could progress to the next stage in their lives.  We do not believe that it is appropriate to deal with this group differently.  They also should move, transition and progress with the next stage of their lives.  We recognise that some of the normal things which would happen to support that transition have not been possible since March.  We will continue to engage with the HSE as a way to support children in making that transition successfully.</p></speech>

I refer to access to and the availability of broadband.</p><p>The past number of months has been a very challenging time for parents.

We know anecdotally that the difficulties are not simply about access to technology or broadband, although if people do not have technology they cannot use the online supports.  The issue is also with regard to the fact that many of these students find it very hard to engage online and learn online.  This is because many of these students need explicit teaching.  They do not learn incidentally.  They need very good, experienced teachers to teach them and bring them through various new routines and new learning.  It is very difficult for parents and the children themselves to do this online.</p></speech>

In recent years, the number of SNAs in primary schools has increased by more than 5,000.  In view of the changes that have occurred because of the new challenges posed by Covid, what increase, percentage-wise, do we believe we need to start planning for?  The other aspect of this is whether we need to put in place additional training for people working in the area.  As I said earlier, there is a new set of rules for dealing with the challenges in the educational system.  Is there a need to devise additional training in this area?</p></speech>

We have highlighted apps of the week and themes of the week.  We have issued brochures on the promotion of positive behaviour at home and the promotion of learning at home.  These have been some of our more popular measures.  Over the summer, and for the summer programme, we are looking at trying to develop resources for teacher professional learning with the themes of calmness, safety and social connectivity.  We are looking at perhaps having a resource on getting started and the time at home.</p> <p>  Fundamentally what this crisis has shown is that there is a digital divide and a learning divide.  Some teachers were able to get into Microsoft Teams immediately and others were not.  There is quite a lot to reflect on and a lot to learn from.  In the context of continuing professional development, in the next year we will be looking at online learning.</p></speech>

I want to try to understand the July provision for those with Down's syndrome and I have read the submission from Down Syndrome Ireland carefully.  The parents of Down's syndrome children are upset and I feel they have to right to be upset.  We all know the pandemic has been extremely difficult for children and families with complex and special needs with the loss of routine, attending classes and one-on-one contact with teachers and SNAs.  That could not have been avoided but it still would have had a huge impact on many children, not only those with Down's syndrome but any kids with complex or additional needs.</p> <p>  The Minister announced on 5 June that he would open the summer provision programme for this year to include children with Down's syndrome and he made no distinction between those attending preschool and primary school and those attending post-primary school.  As an elected representative from Waterford, I was contacted by various parents and I went back to them and said that kids with Down's syndrome would be included in the July provision.  The parents were extremely happy and they felt this would have a great influence on their kids before they went back to school.  However, we have since learned that July provision will only be made available for those students with Down's syndrome who are in primary school.  I am trying to understand why that is so.  Is it because of capacity issues and that the Department would not be in a position to provide the July provision to kids who are in first or second year?  These children might only be aged 13 or 14, they have transitioned from sixth class and they are now going into first year in secondary school but they will not be able to avail of the July provision, which is really necessary for many of them.  The transition between primary and secondary school can be very difficult.  I am a mother of three children and I know it is a huge step for any child to take.  I am thinking of the case of a child with Down's syndrome who has been in mainstream school and will now be moving on to first year in secondary school in September when please God the schools will reopen.  Why was that decision taken?  Is it purely a capacity issue that the Department felt there would not be enough teachers, SNAs or school capacity to deal with this?</p></speech>

We felt we had to come up with a list that was achievable and could be easily understood and that schools that wanted to participate in it could deliver on it.  That is effectively what informed the approach we took.  We have looked at children with the most complex needs and at those at the greatest risk of regression.  We engaged with Down Syndrome Ireland, both before and since then and we are meeting with it again tomorrow morning.  There is a proposal in place that ensures that for those who are at post-primary school age, provision can be made outside this scheme that is still focused on the summer and with a good degree of flexibility, which is probably in tune to a greater extent with the NCSE policy advice around this area than the July provision scheme as it has traditionally run.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#GGGG00700"><p>I welcome the fact the Department will be meeting Down Syndrome Ireland tomorrow because my main concern is around the pupils.  It is not only for those with Down's syndrome but it is for those in post-primary school mainstream classes who presented with the following disabilities: Down's syndrome; deaf or most severe hard of hearing; blind or most severe visual impairment; moderate general learning disability; and diagnosis of severe emotional behavioural disorder.</p><p>This cohort will be allowed attend only if they are in primary school.  My concern, however, is the sixth class pupils who have not been in school since the start of March and who are expected to transition to secondary school in September.  It is difficult enough to transition from sixth class into first year if one does not have any other issues, but these pupils leaving sixth class have to try to deal with having been out of school since March and then attending secondary school in September without having had the advantage of July provision for those few weeks.  This is really important.  Could the Department look at it again?  Obviously, a child in second, third or fourth year is more used to being in secondary school.  For some children going to secondary school, it might be their first time ever going on a bus.  They might have been able to attend primary school in their local area but might have to go on a bus to secondary school.  I believe there will be so many challenges for these kids heading into secondary school because of Covid.  They may not see some of their friends who they have been in school with again.  Could the Department be flexible on this?</p></speech>

Alternatively, if the school does not offer a programme, they will be able to avail of the home-based programme.</p></speech>

The children currently in sixth class, who were due to leave sixth class at the end of June this year, and who will go into secondary school, are included.</p></speech>

There is actually a more enhanced range of options for them this year than was available last year.  In addition, if a tutor is not available to them in the home-based strand, they have access to an SNA, should that be the choice of the parent.  Again, if the school is offering a HSE programme, there is a chance, depending on the level of the child's disabilities, that he or she could be included in that strand.  What we have tried to do is expand the range of options and have a suite of options that are flexible and available over a significant period of the summer.</p></speech>

It is most welcome.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about July provision.  I think the expectation is that 70% of the provision will take place in the child's home.  Is that because not enough schools have come on board or the Department does not have enough staff, or is it the norm?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.662" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#HHHH00700"><p>That is the norm.  Last year, for example, we had approximately 10,500 children participate in the July provision scheme, and more than 7,000 of those were in the home.  The 70:30 split in favour of the home is typically what we get.</p></speech>

It cited transport as a major issue.  Does the Department share its concern in this respect and, if so, what needs to be done to address it?  We know that public health information is evolving day by day and week by week, and I know there will be very many challenges with children when they return to school in September and October in respect of transport.  Up to last week we were hearing that a bus that would normally take 50 pupils may only be able to take 14, so there will be huge challenges.  I imagine there will be many challenges with children with complex and additional needs as well.  I suppose it is very hard to plan for that.</p></speech>

Our focus in getting the advice has been primarily on being ready for the summer provision next week and being able to give guidance to schools.  There is help in that too in terms of our planning towards the autumn.  We are hopeful about the guidance on public transport, and there are moves afoot more generally in that regard, so changes are happening there too and we will be able to draw on them.  This underlines the point I made earlier about the guidance coming in a timely way - not so early that things radically change before schools reopen but with still enough time for schools to plan for it.</p></speech>

Have the witnesses any idea?  Is it possible that this could be considered for 2021?  I welcome the fact that the primary school students are included this year but I feel for children in secondary school and in preschool who have not been included.</p></speech>

The work we were doing this year has been interrupted by the circumstances relating to the crisis but we have been doing a lot of engagement with stakeholders and with other Departments on the July provision scheme, mindful of the advice that we have got from the NCSE.  We want to move to that needs-based, activity-centred model that the NCSE has advised on.  That is the ambition that we have and we hope to pick up on that work as soon as possible as we move into the autumn.  We will plan towards change for 2021.</p></speech>

I will put seven on the clock and we will finish then.  I want to bookend a number of issues raised.  The first one is the issue of the special classes, which I will come back to Ms Griffin on.  She stated earlier there was a problem with some schools rolling out special classes and mentioned south County Dublin and Cork.  She said that the reasons for that were varied but two of the main reasons, as I think she put it, were a lack of space and a lack of outdoor areas.  Were they only identified this year in respect of those schools or have they come up year-on-year in the same schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-06-25a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020062500002#JJJJ00400"><p>The situation we are highlighting this year is that we have been unable to get agreement from sufficient schools to open special classes.  In that area, for example, we are opening 13 special classes.  We have been unable to get another eight.  When we look more closely at the situation, we see that some schools simply do not have enough space. They just cannot expand.</p></speech>

My question was more specific.  Regarding the schools where it was identified that there was a problem with a lack of space and outdoor areas, was that only identified this year or has this been known for a long number of years?</p></speech>

We, as an organisation, foresaw a number of years ago that there would come a time when we would not be able to open up sufficient spaces.  We have been working with the Department on strategies around that.  This has not just come up this year-----</p></speech>

Have those schools made applications for additional space, for example, buildings or increased capacity in outdoor areas?  Is there joined-up thinking there where a problem is identified such as a lack of space or outdoor areas and the problem has to be resolved?  Have those schools identified those problems in the past and made applications for funding to resolve them or is it a new problem that has been identified only this year?</p></speech>

Others would not.  Between ourselves and the Department we have put a process in place so that when we identify three, four or five years ahead that there might be a shortage of places, we then contact the planning and building unit.  We have been working together to try and improve that process so that in future this situation with regard to spaces should not arise.</p></speech>

Inclusion Ireland claims it could be in breach of the Equal Status Act.  I will go on to quote something else in the Down Syndrome Ireland submission:</p> <blockquote> 	There appears to be a complete disconnect between the Minister and officials in his Department and the students with Down syndrome who are caught in the middle.  It is shocking and deeply distressing for all concerned. </blockquote> <p>I think Mr. Tattan needs to have a greater appreciation of that distress and the shock that these parents and this organisation are articulating.  He said he is meeting its representatives tomorrow, which is good.  However, there needs to be a much deeper appreciation from the Department, which I am not hearing from Mr. Tattan and I have not heard from any of the responses today, of the perception of a disconnect, the perception of children being left behind and the perception that this has been deeply distressing for the children involved and for the parents of those families.</p><p>An Teachta Funchion put it well earlier.  We have heard promises of changes for years.  Despite all the rhetoric - we heard more of it today from Mr. Tattan - that we are going to see more changes and that we are moving in the right direction, the organisations that represent these children do not feel that pace is quick enough.  Down Syndrome Ireland states it is shocking and deeply distressing for all concerned that there is this perceived disconnect.  Does Mr. Tattan agree with it on whether there is a disconnect?</p></speech>

Something is seriously wrong when an advocacy group is so strong and compelling in its statement and yet the Department takes a polar opposite view.  It is a matter we will need to take up with the Department when the sectoral committees are established.  Once and for all we need to resolve this issue for that organisation.  I wish the representatives of Down Syndrome Ireland the best when they engage with the departmental officials tomorrow.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee today.</p><p>Is it agreed to request that the clerk seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the committee?  Agreed.</p></speech>
