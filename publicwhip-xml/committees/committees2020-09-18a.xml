We had a long discussion as to whether we would have a fourth session if possible.  I have confirmed the availability, although their appearance will be subject to the approval of the committee, of Dr. Johan Giesecke, who is a former chief epidemiologist in Sweden, a former chief scientist at the European Centre for Disease Control and a current adviser to the World Health Organization, WHO, to talk about lockdowns in an international context; Professor Tom&aacute;s Ryan of Trinity College, Dublin, who is also available to talk about testing, which is his specialty; and from University College Dublin, Professor Kirsten Schaffer, who is also a consultant at St. Vincent's Hospital.  Professor Schaffer is a German national but is very well acquainted with our health system.  It would be good to put what is happening in Ireland in perspective.  I propose that fourth session for the approval of the committee.</p></speech>

We are not proposing to extend the number of meetings.  It has been agreed by the D&aacute;il that the Covid-19 committee will no longer exist at the end of September.  I had hoped all along that the idea was we would cease to exist in order that the sectoral committees could start looking into this, such as the Joint Committee on Health, the Joint Committee on Education and Skills and all the others.  Unfortunately, I can tell members just what is happening with regard to this committee, not the others.  My understanding was-----</p></speech>

I too am anxious to conclude it, but I think that when the lockdowns in Kildare, Laois and Offaly occurred, this forum provided a valuable platform for us to discuss that.

I thank them for their patience and forbearance.  From the GAA, we have Mr. John Horan, uachtar&aacute;n, and Mr. Tom Ryan, ard sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir; from the FAI, Mr. Gary Owens, interim chief executive, and Mr. Mark Scanlon, director of the League of Ireland; and from the Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, joining us by external link, Mr. Philip Browne, chief executive officer, and Mr. Stephen McNamara, director of communications.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  This applies to witnesses who are present in the precincts of Leinster House.  There is less certainty regarding the privilege that accrues to witnesses who are joining us by videolink.  I am not saying privilege does not accrue but the matter has never been tested in court.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I hope witnesses will respect that advice.<br/><br/>All of the opening statements have been circulated in advance.  I ask witnesses to limit their statements to five minutes.  I invite Mr. Horan to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The events of recent days have brought that into sharp focus, reminding us of the importance of collective responsibility and staying the distance in the fight against the pandemic.  While we are here as the three largest sporting organisations in the country in terms of participation and profile, I am also conscious that we represent all of the incredible sporting associations in the country and the volunteers who sustain them.</p> <p>  Studies the world over recognise the importance of the sporting and physical and active health of a nation.  As a former secondary school principal of a large inner city school for almost ten years, I have seen at first hand the role that sport and recreation have to play in the physical, mental and emotional well-being of young people, and their positive impact on their communities.  Be it swimming, cycling, athletics, basketball, boxing or any of the many other sports being promoted as well as our sports, it is important to recognise the return on State investment and support of sport is a stronger, healthier, happier and a caring population.</p> <p>  The GAA is primarily about two things, people and the playing of games.  There is so much more to what we do but, in essence, the vast majority of what we do falls under these two headings.  On 12 March last, we lost our ability to stage games and activities.  Crucially, the importance of people across our wider membership came to the fore in ways that previously we could only have imagined.  In standing down our games and activities when we did, we set out one of the key principles of our approach to dealing with Covid-19, namely, to assist the country and people of Ireland in any way possible to deal with the pandemic.  From that day through to this one, being cautious and responsible, keeping the safety of our membership and their communities paramount and remaining consistent with public health advice have underpinned everything we have done at local and national level.</p> <p>  The response of our clubs and their members to lockdown was staggering, helping to establish Community Call in conjunction with partners and other Government agencies.  Some 20,000 people volunteered to oversee basic menial tasks such as shopping and the collection of medicines for people in more than 35,000 households across all 32 counties who were either cocooning or in a vulnerable category.  Additionally, a myriad of other organic voluntary activity is taking place across our network right across the island and further afield, not to mention incredible charitable initiatives and fundraising.  We were also delighted to make our facilities available to the HSE at 20 locations throughout Ireland, seeing stadiums and clubhouses being used in a way we never previously considered.  It was, in fact, a very visible GAA response to the fight in flattening the curve and a source of pride for us to see our facilities so prominent.</p> <p>  Another cornerstone of our approach was to appoint a Covid-19 advisory committee, chaired by Shay Bannon and including An Cumann Cam&oacute;ga&iacute;ochta and the Ladies Gaelic Football Association.  In so doing, we were one of the first organisations to take that step.  The medical expertise offered by this respected grouping has guided us on every step of the journey and will continue to do so in the months ahead.  The emphasis we have placed on our plans to return has been one of safety first and we remain steadfast in this commitment.</p> <p>  While it has been difficult to quantify the loss of games to communities and people throughout the country, we know from the outpouring of positivity on their return how badly they were missed.  In three of the most recent Government policies on mental health, sport has been highlighted as a major protective factor.  Similarly, in our most recent return on investment report, conducted by Munster GAA, 64% of parents cited the positive impact of sport on mental health as one reason for overseeing the participation of their child in organised sport.</p><p>For many, the games and associated activity provide a pulse and rhythm to their lives and communities.  Nowhere was the absence of games and training more acutely felt than among our youngest and most senior members.  In the absence of classroom schooling, it is an accepted fact that many young people struggled with isolation and being away from their friends.  Similarly, the social outing that was the stroll to the local field and the accompanying catch-up was sorely missed by our more experienced members, many of whom were housebound for long periods.  It was a way of living that we never thought we would have to contemplate.</p><p> The physical importance of sport and exercise is well known to us all but one major lesson from the whole experience, which is not finished yet, has been the importance of mental well-being and the social element to physical activity, not least when it is undertaken around others.  It was for these reasons that we decided at a very early stage that any return to activity would be for the many and not the few.  Our decision to return with club activity was taken with 100% of our players in mind and not only the 2% who play our games at inter-county level.  It was our belief all along, which was borne out, that club activity at every level and right across the island would reinvigorate communities and provide a badly missing sense of purpose and unity.  Needless to say, it was not without its challenges.  Within ten days, we constructed a dual approach to our phased return.  This was not as fast as it might have been but it was our intention to ensure that our members came back to our games both educated and comfortable at the pace of return.  Our watch words were safety, caution and acting responsibly.</p><p> We asked every active member to complete an e-learning module in addition to filling out an online questionnaire every time they presented for either training or games.  That questionnaire has been completed more than 7.3 million times, peaking on a recent Saturday at 120,000 in one day.  At peak times, eight forms are completed every second.  Similarly, we were determined to stage as many of our GAA C&uacute;l Camps as possible at a time they were so badly needed.  One positive case, unconnected to the playing of our games, from an attendance of 71,000 children aged between six and 13, vindicated our decision to proceed with the ever-popular camps, which were overseen by 4,000 coaching personnel at 900 venues.  Our games have been back for 13 weeks and while a small number of clubs have been impacted by a positive Covid case in their community, the numbers are minute when set against an organisation of 600,000 active members across 1,600 clubs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#D00200"><p>Finance and the generation of funds is not the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael but, like every other organisation, it is an important element of what we do and it has to be.  It allows us to employ coaches, invest in facilities and to plan for the future growth of the organisation while safeguarding the health and vibrancy of our national games.  We can only reinvest moneys we generate.  Our commitment is to reinvest 85 cent of every euro received into the growth and development of the GAA at school, club, county, provincial and national level.  Whether it is having an army of 365 coaches working in schools and clubs, helping to develop club facilities in local communities, or supporting injured players and growing participation, the work of the GAA to stay relevant is constant.<br/><br/>To say that our financial predicament is stark would not be an overstatement.  It is our estimation that in 2020 alone, there will be a &euro;50 million hole in our finances.  We are working through possible scenarios for 2021 but it seems certain that further losses will follow of at least &euro;20 million.  These losses will be felt at every level of the organisation beginning at the most important unit, the club.  This unit of the association will feel it particularly hard as assistance from central level and our provincial councils in developing facilities will be curtailed in the short term.  The pandemic has also brought into sharp focus that as the national organisation promoting native Irish sports, we do not have an international governing body capable of coming to our financial aid.  In that context, we publicly acknowledge the State support that has been earmarked for sport up to this point and thank the Government for its support in helping us to stage our GAA inter-county championships at a time the country needs a focus and a positive distraction more than ever.<br/><br/>This week provided a welcome glimmer of hope for all of us in what are still testing times.  Last weekend, many county finals were played across the island at various levels, although without the familiar fervour that the presence of supporters ensures.  This weekend, that will change and supporters will return to games in the Twenty-six Counties.  While the numbers are small, they represent an important step in the right direction even at a time wider society continues to grapple with the challenges of the past six months.</p><p> Our engagements with the civic authorities have centred largely on how we can get people back to attending games in a controlled fashion, and we will continue to engage in that vein.  We have developed plans that show how the GAA can demonstrate that we can continue to be trusted and to act responsibility with the safety of people in mind as regards the return of any numbers of spectators to matches.  We look forward to working with the other sporting organisations to establish what might be possible for our larger stadia when the bigger games are being staged.</p><p> In the weeks and months ahead, we must all contemplate living with the virus and with an acceptable level of risk.  As a sporting and cultural organisation with a considerable reach, we remain committed to playing our part and we will continue to urge our wider membership to do likewise.  We look forward to the ongoing engagement and support of the State and also to a time when crowds can safely flock back to our games and sports, and sport in general, in the carefree manner that we perhaps took for granted as recently as 24 weeks ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to update it on how we have operated since the onset of Covid-19 earlier this year.  I echo what Mr. Horan said in that we not only represent our sports, but the many other sports that are not represented here today that are also facing up to the huge challenges of Covid-19.  We believe that rugby has a significant role to play in the physical and mental well-being of Irish people and that, in the face of this cruel pandemic, we continue to have a positive contribution to make to public health and society, and hope to do so for years to come.  We have covered these areas in detail in the documents provided to the committee and I am happy to explore them further should the committee have questions.</p> <p>  Before I proceed, I wish to acknowledge how difficult it has been, and continues to be, for all those who have lost loved ones or have had their health compromised by the virus.  A huge "thank you" goes to all those front-line workers who have stepped up to help at this time of crisis. </p> <p>  The adjective &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; has been overused in the past six months but our experience to date and history will show that, if anything, the description of the 2019-20 season as being unprecedented is understated.  Our season, and our business operations, were thrown into chaos by the Covid-19 pandemic in March, when our Six Nations fixture against Italy became the first mass gathering to be cancelled.  This represented the first major blow to our sport and finances. </p> <p>  Pre-Covid, our financial situation was looking quite positive.  Now, we are facing an unprecedented cash flow crisis as we try to work towards the objectives of protecting our national men's and women&rsquo;s teams and our professional provincial teams, and, most important, ensuring that we preserve the amateur club game and support the jobs of our 500 employees to the extent that we can.  It is important that I put context on the financial reality we are now facing.  The key issue facing rugby is the absence of spectators at major fixtures.  The absence of a clear pathway to the return of spectators, in meaningful numbers, means our perilous financial situation will continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate into 2021, moving to an unsustainable position by the third quarter of that year if we do not take certain actions. </p> <p>  The IRFU is the only sporting body in the country totally supporting a professional game which is massively dependent on the men&rsquo;s national team&rsquo;s ability to generate funds.  The men&rsquo;s national team generates 80% of all revenues, which, in turn, is fed down to support all other national teams, the four professional provincial teams and, most important, clubs and schools across the country.  Every stakeholder in Irish rugby is shouldering their share of the economic burden, including salary cuts of up to 20%, redundancies and the elimination of all but the most critical overhead costs. </p> <p>  Going into this crisis, the IRFU balance sheet was very healthy and, notwithstanding the welcome Government supports rugby avails of and greatly appreciates, it has always sought to live within its means.  However, Irish rugby&rsquo;s net losses in 2020 as a result of Covid-19 are catastrophic and are forecast to be in excess of &euro;30 million, despite the implementation of the cuts and initiatives provided by Government, as previously mentioned.  This excludes more than &euro;32 million of 2020 ten-year ticket renewal moneys due.</p><p>We are unable to invoice for these sums in the absence of any visibility of fans attending games.  This figure relates solely to 2020 and the outlook for 2021 is far worse.  In very broad terms, it is anticipated that the IRFU and the provinces will continue to burn at least &euro;5m a month, primarily on professional game wages and costs.  This is not a sustainable position and will require significant additional actions after December 2020 if there is no sight of spectators returning at that point.   </p><p> The current projected position to the end of June 2021, shows a negative cash swing of almost &euro;40 million from a cash surplus of &euro;28 million in June 2020, to borrowings of just in excess of &euro;10 million, backed by IRFU assets.  This is very serious and is being kept under constant review.  The IRFU will be forced to commence borrowings in January.  If these projections were to materialise, the very existence of professional rugby on the island would be under significant threat in 2021.   </p><p> Our audited financial statements for the period to 31 July 2020 will show an actual record financial loss of more than &euro;35 million.  In January 2020, we were forecasting a planned deficit of &euro;3.5 million.  Until we can admit spectators in meaningful numbers into our stadia, and return to some level approaching self-sustainability, the entire rugby infrastructure built over the past 150 years is under threat.  Indeed, there may be a requirement in our accounts to comment on the uncertainties we now face regarding future going concern challenges for the union. </p><p> We will, of course, continue to follow NPHET and public health guidelines on this, but that will come at a significant cost to our sport, not only at the top level but at club level, schools level and grassroots level.  It is our ambition, with the support of Government, to survive as a properly functioning unit and repay the faith shown in us by playing our part in supporting the national recovery effort that will demand so much of us all in the years to come. </p><p> We remain available to discuss any issues or provide the chair and his colleagues with any further supplementary information they may require.</p><p> Before I close, I extend my thanks to the countless volunteers in clubs and schools around the country who have been meeting the challenges posed by Covid-19 as best they can to preserve our club and schools game.  I thank the committees and subcommittees at the IRFU and the provinces and the IRFU and provincial staff, who have adapted to the changed working circumstances and, in the case of our staff, have experienced significant pay cuts.  I also acknowledge the provincial chief executives who have worked closely with the IRFU to ensure a coherent and aligned approach to the challenges that we are collectively facing.  I thank Sport Ireland and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the support they have given to Irish rugby and to sport in general, and I thank the Government for the initiatives that have been put in place during the Covid-19 crisis, which have helped enormously.</p></speech>

I echo the comments of Mr. Horan and Mr. Browne about all sporting organisations.  I address the committee in my role as interim chief executive officer of the association.  I am joined, as per the committee's invitation, by Mr. Mark Scanlon, the FAI's newly appointed League of Ireland director and a member of its new senior leadership team.  All committee members will have received an information pack from the FAI ahead of the meeting.  If further copies are needed, we will arrange that as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Like all national governing bodies for sport, the FAI has had to come to terms in recent months with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our game, our members, our organisation and our finances.  Little did any of us know when we announced our first cessation of football on 12 March just how long this pandemic would last and the enormous impact it would have on our game.  We immediately focused on three key priorities: what our staff could do to support the public health crisis; how to get back to playing football in a safe environment; and what impact this would have on our financial solvency.  I am proud that our staff reacted superbly and got involved with community initiatives on the ground.  Some of our development officers delivered medicines in conjunction with our sponsors, Boots, while others worked closely with local authorities to provide real support to the vulnerable in the community who needed it most in the lockdown.</p><p>Arguably our most significant contribution was the launch of our home skills video programme where thousands of children and young adults participated on a daily basis, eager to show their best to Niall Quinn, Stephen Kenny, Vera Pauw and the coaching team in the FAI.</p><p> Our second priority was working with our key stakeholders on developing a safe pathway for both a return to training and playing football.  One of the best and earliest decisions we made, in conjunction with our friends in the GAA, the IRFU, Sport Ireland and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, was the creation of an expert medical group where our own Dr. Alan Byrne has played a significant role.  This group has played an important role in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic from a sporting perspective and was a crucial step in creating a clear pathway, taking incremental steps supported by medical professionals, for a safer return to football.   </p><p> Since then, we have issued two further cessation notices, amended and published nine protocols around a safer return to training and a safer return to football, ensured the appointment of Covid-19 compliance officers at every club in Ireland, produced four frequently asked questions videos for our affiliates and players and tested 1,085 international and League of Ireland players, male and female, all with negative results.  We have worked with all our members and volunteers to ensure the return of 116 leagues for over 211,000 players across over 12,000 fixtures since football returned to play on 11 July.</p><p> As a result of our very successful return to playing football, we are now ready to move to the next stage on our journey to get fans and supporters at all levels back watching live matches in significant numbers.  The harsh reality is that our association will not survive financially without fans attending our international and League of Ireland matches.  We strongly believe that we can deliver the same standards and protocols for a safe return for our fans in significant numbers.  We have already demonstrated that by developing safe, well thought through protocols, delivered with experienced and trained personnel.  In this regard, I am particularly concerned about the future financial viability of League of Ireland clubs.  They cannot survive without fans attending games.  They are almost entirely financially dependent on supporters attending games and we are now entering dangerous territory for them if the current ban on large spectator attendances continues much longer.  I know these loyal fans would sign up to any spectator code of conduct to attend matches and keep their clubs alive.  </p><p> Together with the IRFU and the GAA, we have been working on developing a plan to allow for the safe return of fans to all our stadiums, across all codes, which we will shortly present to the Government through the expert medical group.  We are also working with UEFA and FIFA on this project.  Next Thursday, UEFA is hosting a pilot test at the Super Cup Final in Budapest when up to 20,000 spectators will attend a live match as Bayern Munich meet Sevilla.  We will share the learning and output from this with the expert medical group which we are confident will demonstrate a clear pathway for the return of fans to matches.  In the meantime, we will continue to work with the HSE on ensuring that all our games at all levels adhere to the guidelines set down by the Government on Tuesday in the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19 policy document.</p><p> As an association, the FAI is proud of the fact that our sport is now played in every corner of Ireland and at every age level.  There is not a village in the country that is not a part of the football community in Ireland these days and we take great pride in the contribution our clubs and affiliates make to society.  A recent UEFA survey confirmed that the total economic value of football participation in Ireland is &euro;1.13 billion annually.  We are really looking forward to hosting Euro 2020 next year with fans attending.  It will provide a real boost to the economy when we need it most, with the potential revenue to the Irish economy from the Euros calculated at over &euro;100 million.</p><p> Irish football, and the FAI in particular, has faced many challenges in the past 18 months and Covid-19 has only served to increase the significant pressure on all of us who love Irish football to ensure that our game can survive.  Getting over 211,000 players back playing is only half the story.  Every club in every city, town and village relies on coaches, officials, volunteers, parents and guardians to make those games possible.  Every game relies on match officials and grounds staff to ensure the fixtures go ahead and we thank them all for their contributions during a very difficult period.  We have gone from one crisis to another through no fault of the hundreds of thousands of these important people who devote valuable time and energy to our great game.  We owe it to them to support them, particularly when the going gets tough.  It would be very easy for our volunteers to disappear from the responsibilities that go with managing all our requirements in a Covid environment.</p><p>In addition, the psychological value of the return of football to so many lives is immeasurable, as our medical director, Dr. Alan Byrne, has outlined in correspondence to the committee.  We owe it to all of these people to ensure they have a safe and financially secure football environment to look forward to.</p><p> Unfortunately, the financial cost of Covid-19 to the association is serious and, for the second time, we need the support of the Oireachtas.  These Houses have always supported Irish football and we thank their Members for that support over many years.  We really appreciate the support already provided by Sport Ireland and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in keeping the association solvent but this time we are not responsible and we are not alone.  That is why we have applied this week for support funding of &euro;19.2 million from Sport Ireland via the Government resilience fund for sport.  Members will learn more about the financial impact of Covid-19 in the documentation sent to the committee prior to this meeting and I am happy to answer any further questions.</p><p> The safety and health of all our stakeholders remains of paramount importance to our association and has come first in any decisions made on our journey to date.  Finally, on behalf of the FAI, I would like to thank a number of people and bodies when I have the opportunity.  I thank Sport Ireland, the Ministers and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for their great support over the crisis period.  I also put on public record my thanks to all the staff in the FAI for the great work they do every day to support our members.  Most importantly, I sincerely thank all front-line workers for their significant contribution to our country over the last six months.  Without them we would not be here today talking about a safe return to our games for spectators now that football is up and running again.  I thank the committee for the invitation to present today.</p></speech>

I am easy.  I welcome our witnesses and thank them for coming before the committee.  I compliment them on the role they have played over the last six months.  They have shown leadership and encouraged people both directly and by example.  All they have done to contribute to the fight against the virus is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  My questions will be short and simple.  We are now entering a new stage, which is challenging in two ways.  There has been a resurgence of the virus but, at the same time, the sporting organisations need to be able to expand their appeal, to cater for crowded venues to a certain extent and to remain viable.  My question for each of the organisations is as follows.  Do they believe they can maintain the safe social distance required in the current climate and the climate that is likely to emerge as we proceed?  Are they all satisfied that they can meet the challenges of social distancing, of curtailing the forward march of the virus and of being sufficiently expansive to allow the organisations to make enough money to keep them going?  That is my first question.  I will only ask two.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#H00400"><p>With regard to the safety of participants, I am quite comfortable that we have heretofore had good practice in place.  We were initially criticised for not returning sooner but we put good education programmes and practices in place.  This is why we have not had any major problems in the 14 weeks we have been back.  Any incidences of Covid connected with GAA clubs have been the result of outside factors rather than internal factors.  I am quite confident that our volunteers who have embraced the great responsibility of keeping our facilities and members safe have done so well and will continue to do so.</p> <p>  With regard to financial matters, a small return of attendances will not turn around our financial position.  That is why we have had to come to the door of the Government to seek financial support.  In fairness, the Government has been very appreciative of the work we have done and I believe we will get a positive response.  We are of the view that whatever funding we get must be distributed throughout our organisation.  That is the network within which we operate.  From provincial and county boards down to the clubs on the ground, which are the real heartbeat of our organisation, all levels must be provided with financial support because capacity on the ground has dried up considerably and clubs are finding it difficult to remain viable within their communities.</p><p>I will add to what Mr. John Horan has said.  He has expressed it very well.  We are satisfied that our clubs have been well educated and there are good protocols in place.  At the end of the day, the health and safety of our players and all involved in the game are paramount.  We have successfully opened up the club game at amateur level and it is working well.  It is interesting to note that our sister unions in the UK do not anticipate playing club rugby until at least the end of this year and possibly well into next year.  The three field sports organisations in Ireland have really set the pace and done a fantastic job.</p><p> I wish to echo what Mr. Horan has said in terms of the financial situation as well.  Social distancing at 2 m would possibly generate an attendance in the Aviva Stadium of approximately 7,000 people.  Unfortunately, that would make no difference whatsoever to our financial situation.  Social distancing at 1 m would bring us up to approximately 18,000 capacity at the Aviva Stadium.  That would still not solve the problem entirely, but at least it would help.  The work done by the GAA, FAI and IRFU to put a roadmap together and to look at how we get spectators back into stadia is paramount for all three organisations and for the wider sporting community as well.</p></speech>

Our experience to date is that we have proved through incremental steps, especially with the expert medical group, that we take the right decisions in a safe environment.  From the FAI point of view, we have access to best international practice as well.  UEFA is doing a good deal of work on this and will carry out a test next week which will be interesting.  A total of 20,00 fans will attend.  I believe we can get fans back into the grounds in a safe environment.</p> <p>  There is a significant difference between 2 m and 1 m financially.  If we can get to 1 m then it makes a big difference and that is a critical goal for us.</p> <p>  We have come together as a group.  The three associations are working together.  We will put a formal proposition to the Government and we will look for support for that.  I believe we can do it.  I am more concerned about the financial implications where we have lower numbers of fans attending.  We are going to have to work out the implications of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#J00400"><p>My last question arises from simply recognising the points that the organisation representatives are aware of and have made.  They have recognised that social distancing is an important factor in curtailing the virus.  For example, the 2 m distance is far more effective than 1 m.  I recognise and accept the points made in terms of the financial situation.  On what will the organisations be relying most in the time ahead?  If the organisations go below 2 m social distancing, on what will they rely most to prevent the virus from spreading?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#J00500"><p>First, we cannot be the arbiters of whether 1 m or 2 m is the appropriate measure to take.  All I can say and commit to on the part of the GAA - I imagine it is the same for all sporting organisations - is that whatever the limits are dictated to be, we will adhere absolutely to them and will ensure they are applied rigorously.</p> <p>  All manner of things contribute to a safe environment at a GAA game.  It is not only about the number of people we can accommodate in a stand or on a terrace.  There are things that we can do there with regard to specifically killing seats and ensuring that seats allocated are appropriately spaced out.  We can manage access and egress appropriately into and out of the grounds.  We can dispense with traditional things like catering and retail outlets in grounds.  We can provide adequate or improved media access and so on.  All manner of things contribute to it.</p> <p>  The important thing that I would like the committee to bear in mind is that we have a track record of running games and events.  Over the course of a normal year we would cater for millions of patrons at our games.  I imagine people would agree and acknowledge that all those games are run safely and to a high standard.  All we are talking about now is perhaps changing the parameters that would apply to those games.  If the State and health authorities dictate to us what those parameters should be, then I have no doubt but that we can adhere to and meet those standards in a safe way.</p></speech>

We have a track record across all three organisations of running major events successfully and safely.  We are three responsible organisations.  We will follow whatever guidelines are put in front of us.  We will work with Government, and with the Department of Health and NPHET, to see what we can do within the parameters we are given.  We have experience in this space and I would be fairly confident that whatever solutions we come up with will be successful.</p></speech>

We are part of a big community and there is a lot of experimentation going on with regard to starting next week.  That will continue.  We will learn from that and we can share that with the three groups here and feed that in.  That will be invaluable in determining exactly what protocols we need to put in place.  Our experience to date has worked very well.  We are taking incremental steps, working with the expert medical group and the Department.  I believe the result of all of that will allow us to bring fans back in a safe environment.</p></speech>

I thank each of the organisations for being with us today.  There are very few people in this House who needed a pandemic to outline to them the importance of sport to society, our mental health and many other aspects.  It would be wrong of us, however, not to acknowledge formally the huge level of contribution sport, particularly the structure of sport, played during the early stages of this pandemic.  The organised ability of local sports clubs to respond, whether to assist older people in their homes or to allow people engage online in a structured way, was crucially important and I want to acknowledge that here.</p> <p>  The witnesses are right in terms of the return to activity.  I saw joy on the faces of some children in my area.  Many people are returning to games across the country.  While we may not be able to do that in Dublin, my club, Ballymun Kickhams, is in the club final and we will try to support that club with our red and green flags, as they did with Bohemians, in Phibsboro, with the red and black flags.  There is no doubt about the psychological benefits of sport.</p> <p>  While sport is not a business, it does have a financial model.  I will focus on that briefly to assist the witnesses make the point that each of them has made.  The IRFU has been clear in the figure it has given of &euro;30 million.  The GAA and the FAI might outline what they believe their financial loss might be, and I apologise if I missed it in the submission.</p></speech>

We hope to embark upon playing senior inter-county championships over the course of the next two or three months.  The amount at risk for us as that championship plays out is potentially up to another &euro;20 million.  On top of that, and I am talking here purely as a governing body, the projections for the Thirty-two Counties and the four provincial councils is a further &euro;11 million of losses this year.  In totality for the organisation, excluding clubs, I am talking about &euro;32 million lost and the prospect of a further &euro;20 million at risk as we embark upon the championship.  It is stark.</p></speech>

Effectively, for the FAI, the association, it is &euro;14 million and then another &euro;5 million for all the clubs affected by it.  It is in the documentation we sent, which accompanied the pack we gave to the members.</p></speech>

I imagine if the risk at local level is included, those figures are compounded.  I have dealt locally with one soccer club, Tolka Rovers, which I would say is at the point of closing its gates.  It is dealing with banks.  Some clubs will have an events facility or a pub on the site; others do not.</p><p>How has each organisation assisted those local clubs?  Has it been in the form of non-financial support, advice, assistance with negotiations with banks and so on?</p></speech>

They, in turn, would have worked with the clubs themselves.  In recent times, we have actually engaged with financial institutions with regard to getting funding released to our clubs.  It is our intention in the next number of weeks to release funding down through the system to our provincial councils, county boards and club structure to keep all those entities within the organisation viable.</p></speech>

Hopefully, that figure will turn out to be &euro;4 million, which is a substantial reduction.  Mr. Browne referred earlier to the prospect of borrowing looming for the IRFU.  That &euro;4 million will be funded, at least in part and possibly substantially, by a borrowing programme that we have already undertaken.  We started that work last week.</p></speech>

We also distributed a Covid starter pack containing materials designed to help clubs open their grounds once games started opening up again.  That was probably worth another &euro;100,000 as far as equipment was concerned.  Since then we have been very successfully running a series of webinars with our clubs about how to deal with the financial situation and how to raise funds themselves.  We used ideas from the different clubs contributing to the webinars and the sharing of experiences has been really helpful and successful.  We also have a club fundraising programme whereby we put up the prizes for a lottery-type scenario, which generates significant funding year-on-year.  That has been put in place again this year.  We are doing the best we can.  We are trying to educate, facilitate and to assist wherever we can, and the clubs have been very receptive to that.</p></speech>

We reached out to clubs to try to understand the financial implications of Covid-19.  We supported clubs financially.  Like the other organisations, we have been trying to brainstorm with them, putting together online lotteries, national draws and trying to find other ways of generating income in the current climate.  We have a submission from all of the clubs that decided to respond to it and we included that in our submission, as far as looking for support is concerned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#L00700"><p>The initiative Mr. Horan mentioned about dealing with the banks is a really crucial one.  Given that much of the land, sports clubs are   is State-owned or leased through the local authority, liens on any mortgages would often be against that.  There is not the same capacity to realise a debt if a club runs into trouble.  I am happy to try to facilitate this with the Minister with responsibility for sport but there might be an opportunity for the three organisations to meet representatives of the banking industry to see what can be done.  If the banks step up to the mark, it would take significant pressure off local clubs, in particular, which might have very small loans.</p> <p>  I will not dwell too much on the financial elements because there are other issues I want to speak about.  I do not want to unpick the national plan that was been announced only this week.  I attended a funeral earlier this week where the doors were closed to many people who wanted to attend and sympathise with the bereaved.  #The idea of people returning to a stadium, particularly in Dublin where we will not even be able to return in small numbers, seems a long way off.  I agree that we need to start planning for what that looks like, should the virus continue for a long period.  I have a question on schoolchildren.  In the light of the national plan, what engagement have the organisations had regarding matches for school-aged children?</p><p>I appreciate that contact is inevitable during a match and that training is permitted but have there been discussions on allowing matches at junior level?</p></speech>

They have made clear decisions to postpone school games for a period until they get more comfortable in the environment of running a school.  The challenges in going to school matches are slightly different from those in going to club matches in that parents would bring the individual child.  In school one would look for a large number of children to be moved from one venue to another, and there are challenges there.  School activity will therefore be suspended for the moment.  Under level 3, juvenile activity will be suspended.  That is a challenge possibly facing Dublin this weekend.  At our C&uacute;l Camps, the parents of every child who goes to a training session have to complete a questionnaire confirming there are no Covid factors within the house for the child.  In that context I think it is a safe environment for children in which to play.  As the committee will see from the statistics from our summer camp activity of 71,000 children taking part in our camps, we have good structure in place.  My young lad goes to his training session.  The children are broken into pods the minute they arrive at the training session and it is all organised in a very structured way.  I am therefore comfortable that the activity of younger members, juveniles, is well catered for.  Unfortunately, however, under level 3, there is that possibility that within Dublin this weekend, that will be suspended.</p></speech>

We have been feeding everything back.  We have had a very successful return.  We started in early June with the League of Ireland and progressed all the way through to amateur and underage.  We have had very few bad experiences.  We are feeding that into the expert medical group.  There is a case to be made that at level 3 we should continue to be allowed to play, and we will feed that good feedback through the expert medical group.  We have found that the group responds to the feedback we give it and the findings we have had from week to week.  Level 3 this week will be a bit of a blow to us if we are not back and if we have to stop all the matches, but we will go through the right channels to feed that back.</p></speech>

I will just echo what Mr. Horan and Mr. Owens have said.  We had successful summer camps towards the end of the summer and, from a kid's point of view, they were enormously successful.  It is just so important for the kids to be out on the park.  It requires good organisation and good protocols.  At club level that can all be delivered.  Obviously, schools are a slightly different environment.  It is really a matter for the schools themselves as to how far they want to go in giving access to sports during the school year.  Some schools are very open to this; others are more cautious.  We will work very closely with them and the expert group.  Level 3 in Dublin will be a bit of a blow for those clubs that had opened up but we just have to deal with that.</p></speech>

I refer to the &euro;70 million in funding secured by Sport Ireland in response to Covid-19.  I understand that the applications opened in July and that &euro;40 million of the &euro;70 million was to be divided between the three main sporting organisations.  Do they know how exactly that funding is to be divided up between the three of them?  For the remaining &euro;30 million there were three different categories.  I presume they can apply for these funding streams individually as organisations.</p><p>How much will each organisation benefit from the &euro;40 million?  Overall, given the fact that the losses incurred this year due to the pandemic have been outlined, does each of them feel that &euro;70 million funding is sufficient?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#N00200"><p>I do not know how that funding will be allocated.  I am hoping that my colleagues in other sports are of the same view.  We do not know.  The application process closed this week, and we are expecting that we will hear the outcome of that in mid-October.  It was really welcome when it was announced for two reasons.  First, it bore out the fact that the plight and the voice of sporting organisations were being listened to and heard, and we were very grateful for the good offices of Sport Ireland in that process.  Second, from a practical point of view, and I do not want to keep repeating myself, but people will understand the extent of the financial plight that we were all in, and this was very much a good start to addressing that.  The announcement came in July, at which point the funding that was announced was going to make a significant difference.  It will still make a significant difference, but the problem is that our financial difficulties have persisted since then, and are growing.  In short, we do not know how that funding will be allocated.  It will make a big difference, but unfortunately, the financial problems that confront us did not just stop in July.  The have been exacerbated since then and I am sure they will persist into 2021.</p></speech>

The funding is hugely welcome.  My  understanding is that the funds are there for 2020, but as he said, we have to face into 2021, and the situation, on the face of it, does not look like it is going to get any better.  I suspect we will have to look at this again next year, in terms of how we can keep the show on the road in sport.  The funding is enormously welcome.  I have no idea how it will be distributed across the three organisations in terms of the &euro;40 million, but we await a decision being made in October on that.</p></speech>

We have no idea how the funding will be allocated.  There are two important points.  One is that what we have actually applied for, we need.  I am not sure if the sum total is going to exceed &euro;70 million because I have not seen the other submissions, but anything lower than that would mean that we would have to look seriously at our costs.  As Mr. Browne said, it only applies to 2020, and we still have to go through 2021.  I cannot see it really improving much unless we get fans back into the stadiums, and we certainly will not get full capacity back in.  We will take a big financial hit next year, so we will have to go through the same process again.</p></speech>

I acknowledge all the changes that have been made in the FAI, on the board and within the organisation as a whole, that losses have been suffered and that funding has been restored.  The new board of the FAI has been set up but I refer to proper governance, etc.  It is in receipt of public funding but to reassure the public, if an invitation was issued to the FAI to attend the Committee of Public Accounts, would the association be willing to accept?</p></speech>

We have gone through a significant number of changes at board level.  We got huge support at the annual general meeting for the constitutional changes that are required, and we have worked with all the key stakeholders such as Sport Ireland, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in that regard.  We are confident that the governing structures that we have in place with the subcommittees will put us in exactly the right position, and it is best practice.</p></speech>

We are liaising with our colleagues in the Six Counties on their experiences because they are dealing with larger numbers.  We will follow the best practice that is given to us by international organisations.  Along with that, we have a competent health and safety committee within our organisation that works across the Thirty-two Counties and its experience will also be brought to bear in making sure this is all working in a safe manner.</p></speech>

We have seen some pilot programmes already in the UK in terms of rugby stadia and we are carefully watching what is happening with the opening of stadia in Europe through the soccer environment.  We will bring all of those experiences to bear in whatever we ultimately present to the expert group.  There is plenty of international experience out there that we can bring to bear.  What is happening in Northern Ireland is slightly different to here.  It is likely that there would be more spectators in the likes of Kingspan Stadium in Ravenhill than there would be down here for the time being.  We have to look at what is happening elsewhere around the world and we have to take account of the particular circumstances in Ireland as well.</p></speech>

There will be good learning from that.  In Germany, 20% of the fans are already returning so UEFA will be able to help a lot in feeding in what best practice is and in developing protocols.  We have used those protocols in our safer return to training and safer return to play protocols and there is a lot of good expertise in those.  We will feed that into the group with our colleagues in the IRFU and the GAA and try to present a best-practice case to the Government through the expert medical group.</p></speech>

That was one of the reasons initially cited for limits and restrictions on attending matches.  On a practical level, what measures have been put in place?  Have the witnesses had to make changes to the grounds, for example, to combat that?  That was one of the reasons that was given for restricting spectators attending matches.</p></speech>

Given the restrictions that applied to attendances and the profile of those games, we were always only talking about a small number of spectators anyway.  In the case of my club, where we had 200 people permitted at a game, when one takes into account the fact that this number covers the players, officials, team management and so on, essentially only 30 to 50 spectators could be catered for.  The GAA did not encounter many instances of inappropriate behaviour or congregation, either before or after those games, which is probably not surprising given the number of people we are talking about.  We would be of a mind that if there are measures we can take and there is the prospect of slightly greater numbers attending, we will do that.  This would involve, for example, stewards on the sideline asking people to keep an appropriate distance and we can regulate carparks and ask people to leave the ground as soon as the game is over.  We did not use dressing rooms, for example.</p><p>We adopted the mantra of turn up, play the game and go home.  We communicated that message to people very publicly and we will double down on our efforts.  However, I think the reservations and restrictions regarding numbers were born out of a fear of what might arise, rather than reported cases.  We did not come across many such instances.  </p></speech>

What has become crystal clear, not only from our experiences in recent months but also from the statements we have heard from the witnesses, is the positive impact and lift we all got when we saw sport, at all levels, return to our public playing fields, as well as the more organised professional sports.</p> <p>  I direct my first question to Mr. Owen and Mr. Scanlon.  Last night was one of those all too rare but very special occasions when a League of Ireland club, in this case Shamrock Rovers, got to play a true giant of European football in facing A.C. Milan.  Having to play that match behind closed doors obviously impacted on the financial return for Shamrock Rovers.  For illustrative purposes, will the witnesses contextualise the opportunity lost to Shamrock Rovers, given how much the club might have raised in normal circumstances but was lost by having that match played behind closed doors?</p></speech>

We have partly resumed the League of Ireland to test what level of potential income we might get from streaming.  That was disappointingly low, although it was in line with the budget we put in place.  It was, however, an alternative way of generating some income for League of Ireland clubs.  There was some income from doing this, but I do not have access to the precise numbers.  I suspect the income was down about 90% from what would have been expected from a full house at the game.  I can get the numbers for the Deputy, and to be fair to the Shamrock Rovers club, it will make those numbers available to us.  This is a very good example of a club that would have expected to do really well financially in European competition but which, as a result of not having fans at the game, will now take a significant hit.</p></speech>

I have a question now that I will pose to all the witnesses.  Will they describe the level of engagement their organisations have had and if that has been with NPHET or line Departments?  When did that engagement start for each organisation, by what means is it ongoing and how regular is contact?  Do the witnesses have any thoughts regarding how engagement could be improved?  My motivation in asking this question is not to catch out any organisation, NPHET or a Department.  I ask from a genuine desire to understand what kind of communication has been taking place and at what level, and how satisfied the organisations present are with the process.</p></speech>

Subsequently, a Government expert group was set up.  We have representation on that group and that is how our views and the cases we make are communicated.</p> <p>  We had open and ongoing engagement with the Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the officials in her Department.  They have been very receptive to whatever ideas and proposals we have put forward.  We are very happy that our proposals are being given good consideration and have been taken on board, in some cases.</p></speech>

When the crisis first hit, there was some tension regarding the Ireland-Italy match and its cancellation.  Communication since then has been excellent, however.  The expert group in Sport Ireland is an excellent conduit to the HSE and NPHET.  Our voice is being heard, and that is really important and encouraging.</p></speech>

Since we started, we decided between the three organisations that we needed an expert medical group, and we suggested that would be done through Sport Ireland.  It has been set up and it meets regularly.  I believe it meets weekly.  It has been excellent at feeding back and taking feedback.  It has responded to any research we have fed in.  We have had our own challenges with the international team and making sure it can travel to and from international matches without unnecessary hassle.  We have got considerable support from the group on that.  The way forward on having fans back in stadiums is to work through the extra medical group and NPHET and to continue to produce the best feedback we can on the international experience.  We will get there.  That has actually been one of the big success stories.</p></speech>

My questions are for Mr. Scanlon and Mr. Owens.  In the absence of a substantial investment package before season tickets go on sale in December and January, which tickets will not attract the interest they attracted in previous seasons given that people expect further lockdowns throughout the next six months or so, do the witnesses believe that there will be a League of Ireland in 2021?</p></speech>

The only income the League of Ireland clubs get is through fans.  That would represent about 80% of the income.  We are currently presenting three scenarios to all the League of Ireland clubs.  The first sees fans back in the grounds, the second sees no fans at all and the third is somewhere midstream.  We are trying to present the scenarios in terms of the financial support we might be able to provide.  Obviously, the feedback from what we have submitted will be important in that regard.  I am worried about the impact on the League of Ireland clubs.  It will be significant if we cannot get fans in.  We will have to have contingency plans for some of the clubs.  Clubs that qualify for Europe will probably have a better opportunity.  Clubs that do not will really struggle next year.  We have enough visibility this year.  Going into 2021, it will be very difficult without any fans on the ground and without any financial support.</p></speech>

With regard to the number of fans who attend games, the proposition is one of improving all the time.  One can see that from the quality of the games.

I was on a UEFA conference call on Wednesday and learned that it is still expecting fans to attend games next June.  We obviously have to work here with local government, the expert medical group and NPHET.  We will have to feed in the information.  That is why next week is quite important in terms of the pilot test for 20,000 spectators.  This is being done with eye on the UEFA Euro championships next year.  As matters stand, we still expect to hold matches here with fans in attendance.  We have a challenge in trying to convince everybody that this should happen.</p></speech>

I come from a sporting background, playing club and intercounty football for my native county of Louth for over 16 years.  I was lucky enough to manage my senior football team for four years and currently I am chairman of Louth county board.  I also played for Dundalk football and rugby clubs, and I am a member of the local running club in Dundalk.</p> <p>  As we know, over the past six months the country has probably been through one of the most difficult periods in its history.  During the pandemic, every member of society was affected in one way or another.  It has been a very difficult time for everybody, including older people, who had to cocoon and were, in effect, isolated from society.  Younger people, meanwhile, were confined to indoors and separated from their friends.  If any positive is to be taken, we can look at how the sporting organisations at local levels rallied and gave their support to the most vulnerable people in the area.</p> <p>  My local sporting clubs in Dundalk stepped in and supported the most vulnerable people in the area.  Members did many daily tasks for people confined to their homes, arranging grocery shopping and collection of medicine and ensuring that necessities were available at all times.  This was an example of true community spirit.</p> <p>  This was not just confined to Dundalk.  Sporting clubs and organisations in the county and all over Ireland stepped up when needed.  A great effort has been made by these clubs and it is important that we look after them because of the effort they put in.  In recognition of the great effort they made, it is important that we in politics and the people in the organisations running these great sports also step up to the plate.  There is no doubt these local clubs have suffered financially during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We had financial supports for businesses, which was right, but we must also support our sporting organisations.</p> <p>  I welcome the Government commitment to provide over &euro;40 million to sporting organisations but we must also support our clubs.  As I said, these clubs facilitated the only contact that people had in many cases during the period in which they cocooned.  We must recognise the benefit of such work by clubs in the community, particularly with respect to mental health of people in that community.  There is a financial benefit to those actions and, as such, we should provide relevant financial support to these clubs.  They provided an invaluable service and in many ways they helped maintain, among other things, people's positive mental health during a most crucial time.</p> <p>  Looking at the overall picture, it is clear that sport, health and fitness became more popular during lockdown.  People are now realising the importance of their health and the impact it can have on mental health and resilience.  I was particularly struck by the increase in the number of people I saw walking and running in my local town of Dundalk.  As a sporting person, it gives me great heart to see so many people involved with fitness.  In this respect, I offer the delegations my full support in efforts to promote and sustain the sport they represent.  They need Government support to maintain and grow their great achievements.  We have great tradition for sport in Ireland and this must be continued.</p> <p>  We must also take advantage of the new interest in health and fitness as everybody in society will benefit from that.  The more active and healthy a person's lifestyle, the less time that person will spend being ill, and that in turn will benefit health services and ultimately leave more resources available to the Government.</p> <p>  I am a sports person and I realise the contribution made by sport over the past six months.  It is also great to see people taking such an interest in sport.  How would people have survived without sport?  It is very important that regular exercise be actively encouraged and that kids are involved in sport throughout school, whether it is soccer, Gaelic football or rugby.  It is important that sport is not just a hobby but also part of life.</p> <p>  The work done in summer camps really struck me this year and I commend the witnesses on this.  I am not trying to promote the GAA but it had 71,000 children attending C&uacute;l camps and there were practically no coronavirus cases.  That is absolutely fantastic.  I encourage more people to get outdoors.  I would like to see more spectators going to matches.  The witnesses said earlier that the three groups are working together but what plans are there to get more spectators to see these matches?</p></speech>

Access to stadiums is more complex than people might realise.  It is about egress, access and the apron around the stadium as well as the stadium's capacity.  The social distancing figures in place are also a factor.  I am sure the people in the three organisations who have the expertise in the area will make a robust cast to be put to the authorities and we hope that would lead to an increase in attendances at games across the three sports.  </p></speech>

I spoke to members of Tralee rugby club last night.  It is probably the oldest club in Kerry, there since 1882.  They were very complimentary about the FAI system of return to play which they say is the most professional of all the organisations.</p> <p>  I think it was in May that Mr. Browne said that if he did not have a clear line of sight by September, he did not know what way things would go.  England is working towards 10% capacity for some major games.  What percentage capacity of the Aviva stadium would be needed to break even or get towards breaking even?  Would the IRFU be able to achieve that in a safe way and comply, given how professional the organisation has been with everything else?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#S00800"><p>We put a stake in the sand in September and said we would look at the environment then.  We have since moved that stake out to December.  In December we need to see a clear line of sight of when we will get spectators back into our stadiums at provincial level and at the Aviva stadium in 2021.  If we cannot see that we will have to take certain actions which will be unpalatable.</p> <p>  On the level for breaking even at Aviva, we would be comfortable with 1 m social distancing which would generate attendance of approximately 18,000.  That is not ideal but it would be manageable.  With our colleagues in the GAA and FAI, we will try to put together a roadmap of pilots to see how we can move to that.  One does not want to do it in a big bang.  A capacity of 18,000 would ease our situation.  We need to ease the situation for the provinces which are very reliant on gate income and have a huge problem without it which ultimately comes back to the desk of the IRFU, as we have to support the provinces.  We can do it and safely but we must take cognisance of the advice given to us by NPHET and the HSE.</p></speech>

We would put pilots in place to see how we can get to a capacity that is acceptable to NPHET and the HSE.</p><p>That would work for us as well.  One of the difficulties is that if we are putting 5,000 people into the Aviva stadium, there is actually a cost.  While the optics look great in terms of having 5,000 people in the stadium, it costs us money to do that.  In ramping up, we achieve one objective, namely, getting people into the grounds, but it ends up costing the organisation a significant amount.  We have to find those balances.  If we have to invest in order to get to the 18,000 spectators or 1 m social distancing, that is what we have to do.</p></speech>

We are working very well together.  A bit like the GAA, we have teams and our jurisdiction goes into the Six Counties.  We are picking up learnings from them and, equally, they are picking up learnings from us.  There is good co-operation.</p></speech>

I was at a meeting last Friday with officials from Cork-Kerry HSE and the understanding there is that no case has been picked up attending or playing any outdoor game.  Given that 600,000 people have returned to playing football and hurling, could something be brought into play like what they have in the Six Counties?  There, it is self-regulated.  The GAA has very professionally returned to play as I know from my own under 12s player clocking in every time he is going to training.  Does Mr. Horan think that there should be self-regulation, maybe in consultation with councils around the country, to increase the capacity tailored for every ground?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Horan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#T00500"><p>Yes, particularly considering we are all on the same island.  We made a very clear statement at the beginning of this problem that while we were across two jurisdictions, we did not feel we wanted to leave one behind the other.  In that context, the Ulster council has regulated a figure of 400 for attendance at matches.  That has proved very positive within the councils in the Six Counties and there is a feeling that they have acted in a very responsible and trusting manner.  If that responsibility was given to us at this stage down here in the 26 Counties, we would carry it out and it would give us that opportunity also to increase the numbers that attend.  While there was a limit of 400 put on venues in the North, it is actually acceptable up there that those numbers could be greater.  We try to keep the two organisations North and South together on that within our one organisation.  If they stretched it out even further it would cause greater frustration within the 26 Counties.  If we had willingness on the part of the authorities for us to make those decisions, we could be well trusted to carry it out and we would be responsible enough to carry that responsibility.</p></speech>

We are of the view that there have been incidents of Covid within the GAA membership, which was highlighted very prominently in the media.  Some clubs acted immediately with a shutdown which was probably a cautious and sometimes maybe over-cautious way of dealing with it but again everybody was suffering from a nervousness at the beginning of this pandemic.  One would not criticise those decisions that were made at that time.  We are confident that cases have been picked up within the GAA membership but no activity within our playing and training areas has caused an increase in the pandemic numbers.</p></speech>

I would not second guess any of the work done by their organisations individually or collectively.  I would love to see all juvenile and senior teams in the country playing again and all of our international stadia full, but Covid is no respecter of sport.  While it is correct to say that there is no known incident of Covid transmission at a GAA game, we must follow the public health advice, which the witnesses acknowledge.</p> <p>  I am not worried on that front.  Rather, I am worried by the story this morning that, of 40 people who indulged in an outdoor activity called "golf" over a period that I am unsure about, 20 now have the virus called "Covid".  Notwithstanding the hurt, upset and anger that exists at this time, particularly in Dublin, and Covid's impact on jobs, unless we act to the benefit of everyone, we will not beat this virus.  I have no problem with an all-island strategy for sport, and if public health experts in both jurisdictions say that best practice would see us going in a certain direction, then that is where we should go, but either it works for all of us or it works for none of us.</p> <p>  I laud the full support given by the sporting bodies.  For example, they have allowed the HSE to use their community facilities, they have educated and informed and they have regulated their sports in a constructive way.  That has been very positive and beneficial.  I do not know whether the witnesses would like to comment on this point, but whether it is north, south, east or west, the name of the game is "Beat Covid".  Until we do that, we will all suffer.  The majority of people love sport.  They play it and follow it and their lives are about sport.  I am making this point strongly.</p></speech>

We accept that any activity done in the GAA's name should be done in a safe manner and should put no one and no one's extended family at risk.  When activity returned to our facilities, we were conscious that it be done slowly and carefully.  That initial caution has stood the test of time, given that no known cases of Covid have occurred in our facilities or from partaking in our games.

Some &euro;40 million will go to the FAI, GAA and IRFU, &euro;10 million will go to the resilience fund for governance bodies and up to &euro;15 million will go to the sports club resilience fund to support clubs.  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked whether this funding would be adequate.  Will the witnesses comment on this matter?  Have they applied for these funds?  In addition, up to &euro;5 million will go to the sports restart and renewal fund.</p></speech>

As the months ahead of us are still very uncertain due to the pandemic  we may need to supplement it with further assistance.  It will play an important role in securing our future and that of the clubs over the next few months, and we will administer it on the part of clubs. </p></speech>

I have learned a lot as many of my questions have been answered, particularly concerning social distancing, protocols, the roadmap and working with NPHET.  I welcome the fact that the three organisations have worked so well together.  I compliment every sporting organisation on the work that they have done during the pandemic, which has a hard time for many people.  The funding amounts to &euro;70 million and there are different sections, which is welcome.  The greatest fear is what will happen in a few months.  Will areas like mine, County Carlow, experience a lockdown or restrictions similar to counties Laois, Offaly and Kildare recently?  We do not know what will happen in Dublin.  Funding is important but I wonder what will happen in the long term.  As I drove here today I thought this was the first summer in years that I have not attended a field day or events or a clubhouse.  Normally, clubs are fundraising all the time and they host the afters of christenings, communions and funerals.  Rural community clubhouses, and there are many in County Carlow but I will not mention them in case I offend someone by not mentioning one, are part of our lives and culture so much so that we have been affected by the restrictions.  It is crucial, working with NPHET, that we return to normal as much as possible and, therefore, I seek assurance that funding will be made available to all of the local clubhouses.  Like other politicians, I have always fundraised and I am well aware of how much work is done by volunteers in communities.  Today, we must compliment every volunteer.  It is true that one does not truly appreciate these community events until they are taken away and one realises how great a role they play protecting mental health and providing a lifeline to so many people in our communities.  </p> <p>  The witnesses have answered many of my questions.  With regard to GAA clubhouses and restrictions in the long term, will these events continue to be held when we return to a so-called normal?  I thank again all of the organisations for co-operating.  It is great for the country to see everyone working together to ensure that we are on the right road to making things right for everybody.</p></speech>

Some clubs became creative and organised virtual bingo and virtual runs.  All of that was not necessarily done by the clubs in the context of raising funds for their own needs.  Some of them took these on board for charities because charities throughout the country have suffered.  The clubs were not selfish and split their efforts and energy.</p><p>With my own young lad's team, we got a contact from the club the other day to say that because it does not have an opportunity to raise funds for equipment, it was asking everyone to anonymously put a donation in an envelope if it was within people's power to do so.  While there were challenges, there was also creativity on the ground.  Some clubs got caught out by not having their lotto competitions online.  It was a case of people having to go to a local venue to drop it in and that was obviously a major problem during the lockdown.</p><p> Creativity definitely came to the fore on the part of the volunteers.  They have done a huge job for us.  As was stated, when we got the opportunity to return and attend games for that period, it was embraced with great enthusiasm.  There is a pent-up hunger for people to get back involved and to socially integrate.  The social integration is nearly every bit as important as the actual playing of the game.</p></speech>

I have spoken to people in my area.  The effect that it has had has been unreal because sporting events play such a part in people's lives, particularly in rural towns.  I cannot say how much I appreciate the work everyone has done.  I thank Mr. Horan.  He has answered all my questions on the roadmap and the protocols.  The Minister with responsibility for sport, Deputy Catherine Martin, politicians and all of us are working to ensure that we support and fund sporting organisations in our local areas.  We have a significant role to play as politicians to make sure we deliver for our communities to keep the lifeline going so that we are back to normality as soon as possible.

It shows how important sport is in Irish society.</p> <p>  I have a question specifically for the FAI.  How realistic is it that the UEFA Euro championships will take place in 2021 given the strong international dimension to the competition?  What plans are in place for the next season for the SSE Airtricity League of Ireland?  It has been stated that clubs will be struggling without match-day attendance but they will also lose out on commercial and season ticket income.  What plans are in place for the League of Ireland clubs?  It would be great if the witnesses could answer those questions.</p></speech>

Next week's super cup match is really important in a UEFA context in terms of planning for the Euros next year, right across all the countries.  UEFA is still quite confident that with the protocols which we have used in the return to training and the return to play, we can put in protocols that will allow fans to attend games in a safe environment.  The output from that will be key.  The feedback I am getting from UEFA is that it is confident that it can hold the Euros next year with fans attending the games.  That may well change.  I do not know, but UEFA is still confident that the protocols it is putting in place for next week will work.  It is using best practice in terms of technology.</p></speech>

We have had a very successful return already.  The international Nations League competition has already started and UEFA specifically stated that it did not want any fans attending the games.  It has done exactly what we are doing here, which is taking incremental steps.  It was the only federation in the world to commence international games so quickly.  Only one game was postponed and that was for good reason.  We can only go on the guidance UEFA has given to us, but it is very confident that next week will work very well and it is going to use that as a template to guide people in terms of what it does next year.</p></speech>

As Mr. Owens has mentioned, we invested in excess of &euro;3.5 million into both the SSE Airtricity league and the women's national league this year to ensure a return to play, which started on 31 July with the SSE Airtricity league and continued on 8 August with the women's national league.  That has been a significant return for us and to do that, we waived affiliation fees and provided support for the clubs' usual costs for referees and match-day operations.  We also provided Covid assistance grants to the clubs in order to have their stadiums ready for a return of smaller groups of spectators, as well as making the facilities safe for the players, fans and volunteers.  The clubs really embraced that and did a fantastic job, particularly on a voluntary basis, with the appointment of Covid compliance officers in each of the clubs.  That return has been very successful and that is why the next steps are important because next year is a concern.  We meet with the clubs weekly.  We have a strategic working group which met yesterday and the clubs are hammering home their concerns that next year, in the absence of fans, it will be difficult for them to continue unless we are able to provide that investment again.</p></speech>

That investment would need to be higher for a full season, if all games were behind closed doors in 2021.</p></speech>

That is why we are working on three scenarios at the moment, as Mr. Owens outlined earlier.  One scenario involves full stadiums, which is very unlikely.  The second involves cluster groups within stadiums, depending on what percentage may be safe for a return in the next few months.  The pilot projects and international experience will help us define that.  The final scenario is a worst-case one where there are no fans.  It would be very difficult for a professional league to continue in that manner.</p></speech>

The research has shown that it has had significant effects.  We are in the process of setting up a sub-committee in conjunction with the HSE and the women's national league, which will be a pilot project for us in terms of mental health.  We are inviting players, coaches, club representatives and the HSE to come together to start a pilot project.  We hope to roll that out in 2021 to the SSE Airtricity league, as well as our underage national leagues and then spread it out to grassroots level.

At the moment, we have a very successful set of structures, a very successful professional game, and we have good success in terms of grassroots rugby.  Effectively, if we cannot generate revenues to support those activities, then we are going to have to reduce them, which inevitably means redundancies, lay-offs, scaling back programmes, and maybe scaling back the professional game.  All of those things have a negative feedback in terms of the sustainability of the sport.  That is why it is unpalatable and we do not want to be going down that road, but ultimately, we have to live within our means.</p></speech>

I would also particularly like to praise the staff of the respective organisations, indeed, the players and the many volunteers up and down the country who have kept things going.  Even when there was not much happening, they were still willing to serve and put plans in place.  Much has been said about the &euro;70 million that was given in funding, and that consisted of &euro;40 million for each of the three organisations, and some from other sporting bodies, such as local sports partnerships and clubs.  All of the witnesses have referred to Sport Ireland's expert medical group.  How often does it meet?  Are all the organisations participating at the same meeting and is it a group meeting, as it were?  I would like an answer to that question first, please.</p></speech>

I understand from Mr. Horan's opening statement that the organisation is processing approximately 91,000 health questionnaires daily, and various activities have been kept going over the last number of months.  As Deputy Andrews stated, in respect of mental health, all sports, irrespective of their code, play an important role in people's lives.</p> <p>  I acknowledge there were significant financial issues prior to Covid for the FAI, and obviously the pandemic is compounding the problem.  I understand that it has applied for &euro;19.3 million in funding.  I want to ask specifically about the League of Ireland, and the impact of the pandemic there.  In his opening remarks, Mr. Owens mentioned the pressures on individual clubs.  My question to the FAI is this: are there plans to reduce the registration fees or other costs associated with participating in the League of Ireland for individual clubs?  What measures have been put in place to try and ease the burden for the clubs that might not have the same resources as others?  </p> <p> In his opening remarks, Mr. Browne stated that he predicted there would be a &euro;30 million loss for the IRFU this year.  Am I correct in saying that there could be another potential &euro;30 million loss for ticket revenue for 2020, plus further &euro;5 million per month going forward?  </p> <p> I appreciate that the organisations have mentioned the importance of spectators, and the importance of spectating for the fans, irrespective of the code.  Notwithstanding what happens today in Dublin, how do the witnesses see their engagement with Sport Ireland and the ability to get some spectator sport back on television, or spectators physically in the stadia or on the pitches, over the next couple of months and indeed next year?</p></speech>

An average of 91,000 respondents reply to our health questionnaire.  One very positive outcome of that health questionnaire being filled in every day on an app is that it keeps an awareness in all those families, because if it is a juvenile player, the parent completes the questionnaire, and obviously if it is an adult player, they do it themselves.</p><p>However, it keeps that conversation going in the family of whether the questionnaire has been done before returning to training.</p><p> On mental health, we carried out a survey recently and 51% of respondents believe that the pandemic has had a negative or very negative impact on their mental health and well-being.  Approximately 75% agreed or strongly agreed that the pandemic will have long term implications for the mental health and well-being of society, while almost 80% agreed or strongly agreed that mental health services will require additional resources to deal with the impact.  As an organisation, we have our own community and health unit within Croke Park which deals with the mental health issues within the association.  We are conscious of mental health but as an organisation we believe that these issues will become even greater going forward and extra support will possibly be needed in that regard.</p><p> Our relationship with Sport Ireland is positive.  There are two aspects to it, the first of which involves the safe practices which allow games and training to take place and the second is the financial aspect in terms of continuing to keep the organisation viable throughout the country.  As has been mentioned already, the funding that was put in place is to see us through to the end of 2020 but this is a matter that will need to be revisited if we are, as an organisation, to remain viable going into 2021.</p></speech>

The next critical step is an assessment of the detailed submission we made and we expect that to happen pretty much straight away.  We submitted a request for &euro;19.3 million which would have included some support for the League of Ireland.  We have been working with the league in steering groups and are trying to generate income outside of fans attending games.  We are looking at enhancing sponsorship as well as streaming, TV and media rights to see if we can generate some income.  We are also looking at using central purchasing for merchandise which we believe can add some value to the clubs.  Those steering groups have been working quite well but there will still be deficit which we will need to help the League of Ireland with.</p> <p>  On mental health, we have already said what we are doing in that area.  We fully agree and we have taken the initiative, as Mr. Scanlon indicated.  Have I missed any questions?</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Browne to answer the same questions.</p></speech>

The &euro;30 million loss is up to the end of 2020.  The assumption behind it is that we will continue playing behind closed doors.  The &euro;32 million figure relates to the sale of over 5,000 premium seats and we managed to get those away in March-April.  There was a balancing set of payments to be made by those who had purchased those seats but obviously we cannot pursue those payments, worth &euro;32 million, until such time as we get spectators back into the grounds.  That is a cash loss that we would have anticipated having and then the &euro;5 million cash burn is the combined cash burn across the four provinces in the IRFU.  It is largely around the professional game.  It is important for us to try to keep the professional game up and running because it is the generator.  It basically generates the revenues for the rest of the sport.</p></speech>

The first is for Mr. Browne.  He talked about 80% of all revenues being generated by the men's national team and that money is used to fund everything down the line including provincial teams and clubs.  Are all of the provinces suffering equally in a financial sense?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#Z00700"><p>Yes they are.  The way it works is that any revenues generated by tournaments in which they participate come to the centre, to the IRFU and we use them to effectively pay the player, coach and technical staff salaries across the provinces.  The provinces' revenues are effectively limited to gate receipts, sponsorships and any other hospitality revenues they can generate locally.</p><p>They are massively reliant on gate receipts and all four provinces are suffering equally in not being able to have paying spectators through the turnstiles.  It has effectively decimated their finances and their business model.  The IRFU has had to step in to try to help them financially, which obviously impacts our central finances.  The central contracting model has been great for us up to now but in the current circumstances, it is actually working against us.  </p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

Obviously Leinster, being based in the capital, has had greater resources available to it over the years and it has reserves.  Some of the other provinces also have some reserves but others are in difficulty and we have had to step in and assist financially.</p></speech>

It defines community throughout rural Ireland.  The closed games have been very difficult.  What impact has that had on communities and the spirt of communities, with old men not being able to see their children or grandchildren playing?  We have seen scenes of old men desperately trying to get to camogie matches to see their granddaughters play.  It has been very difficult for people to witness that and not be affected by it.</p></speech>

A lot of our focus this morning has been on the financial picture, and rightly so, but the cost goes far beyond finances.  The social cost of what we have all had to endure in recent months has been very significant and it will take a long, long time to recover.  I can give an example from my own family.  I was sent a photograph of my father-in-law looking in over a ditch of a wall, sadly, as his two grandchildren were going in to play a county final in Limerick last week.  Those kinds of things have a cost to them that we cannot measure in this room.</p> <p>  Deputies Fitzpatrick and Murnane O'Connor talked about club and grassroots activities but what defines our ability to do those is not just financial, it is also the capacity, appetite and ambition of our volunteers.  We would have a very real worry that there is a cost to be paid in terms of the pressure that has been on volunteers, club officers and so on over the past few months.  It has been unimaginable.  They have been trying to make sure their club continues to keep its head above water while also shouldering the burden involved in getting back to playing games safely.  That comes at a cost to people, most of whom are doing things in their own spare time and out of the goodness of their hearts.  We owe those people an awful lot and that is why I would not like the focus this morning to be predominantly on the financial side of things.  From our point of view, the financial aspect is important because that is what keeps us viable and allows us to pursue all of the ambition I am talking about.  We only need to be kept safe; that is all we need.  We need to be kept safe for the sake of those people and for all of the social reasons mentioned by the Cathaoirleach.  They are so important and we should not forget them.</p></speech>

When I say professional, I do not mean that people are being paid but rather that the costs have grown hugely for county boards in producing a team that can go out and compete.  It is not just 15 fellas coming together on a Sunday morning any more.  We are dealing with top athletes and large backroom teams are required to work with them to maintain conditioning, fitness and so on.  We see that in Limerick, Tipperary and Clare.  What financial state are the county boards in now?</p></speech>

For the year we are about to complete, there will be a deficit of &euro;12 million.  Funding for counties comes from three sources, the governing body, sponsorship and gate receipts.  The cumulative gate receipts around the country for local championship games is in the order of &euro;10 million or &euro;11 million.  That revenue is gone.  Even extrapolating at a very small level, in Munster we played 1,200 or 1,300 games over the last few weeks since we went back to activity with an average of 150 people at each of those games, which is very modest, and an average admission price of about &euro;8.  That adds up to &euro;1.5 million which, although in the broad scheme of the national Exchequer and of our national finances in the GAA and so on it might not seem hugely significant, locally is the lifeblood of those counties and clubs.  Ordinarily it is a precarious enough job to keep a county and a club running, the Chairman is right.  What we have experienced over the last six months makes that even more difficult.  We and those people will have a job to rectify and set right those finances next year.</p></speech>

I am reminded of the idea that the good that men do is often interred with their bones while the evil lives on.  There has been a lot of talk about failings from the FAI.  One of the strengths of the previous regime in the FAI was the camps and funding for grassroots clubs.  What cost-cutting measures are expected as a result of the drop in resources and will they impact on funding to the FAI camps and to clubs?  I am not referring to League of Ireland clubs but those right across Ireland in small towns and villages, which have received support from the FAI up until relatively recently.</p></speech>

We need to keep them alive and well.  I would reinforce what Mr. Ryan has said.  The pressure on the volunteers is just immense now when they have to implement the protocols.  In our plans, we are assuming that we will continue with the same support.  We put in a new process whereby the clubs can look for funding.  The difference between the old regime and the new regime is that there is a formal process now in place.  We are sticking rigidly to that.  Clubs can apply for it and we will support them where we can.  In our submission, in terms of resumptions, if we get the support we are looking for there will be no change to that.</p></speech>

In any event,  if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>All of the opening statements have been circulated in advance.

I am the acting assistant secretary for tourism and sport in the Department and with me are my colleagues: Peter Hogan, head of sports policy; and Noel Sheahan, head of sports capital.</p> <p>  This year contained much promise for Irish sport.  The Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were drawing near.  The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor showed that activity levels were increasing in line with the national sports policy.  Sadly, as we all know, that did not come to pass and in mid-March, pitches and sports halls across the country began to fall silent.  In response to the necessary public health restrictions, organised sport ceased entirely at the end of March.</p> <p>  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business was introduced, providing our plan for the summer and a welcome route back towards activity in sport.  As part of sport&rsquo;s plan for returning, the expert group on the return to sport was established, chaired by my colleague, Peter Hogan.</p><p>This group has met 17 times to date, and I express our sincere thanks to its members for their invaluable contributions to the development of guidance for sports, gyms and leisure centres.  I also recognise the excellent work the sporting bodies have done to develop comprehensive protocols for the safe return to training and competition.</p><p> As soon as phase 1 began, organised sport started to return, with individual sports such as angling, golf and hill walking developing protocols to enable people to return to activity.  The return of our elite and high-performance athletes to training at their national centres on 8 June was a significant step forward.  With the acceleration of the roadmap and the combination of phases, all sports were permitted to start again on 29 June. </p><p> I know the committee heard from the three larger national governing bodies, NGBs, this morning, and the Department and Sport Ireland have been in regular contact with them and the other national governing bodies throughout the pandemic, as well as the Federation of Irish Sport.  As members heard this morning, the suspension of activity had a major financial impact on sporting bodies and clubs.  The Government has made additional funding to support the sport bodies.  This will help sports to cover their losses and also adapt to the new reality we now find ourselves in.  A funding package of &euro;70 million was announced on 19 June, with further measures announced in the July stimulus.  The closing date for applications for this funding was on Monday, and I understand Sport Ireland is working to allocate and disburse this funding next month.  We are also consulting Sport Ireland and the sporting bodies as we look ahead to the 2021 Estimates. </p><p> Our sporting organisations have worked hard to adapt and deal with the new reality we find ourselves in.  It has been a time of innovation.  Sport Ireland has created online courses to educate coaches and organisers.  As influencers, our top athletes have helped to reinforce public health messaging and have supported people to stay active at home. </p><p> The new living with Covid plan provides welcome clarity to sport for the next six to nine months.  In level 2 of the plan, the following currently applies in respect of sporting activity.  Spectators are permitted at sports matches and events, with up to 100 permitted at outdoor events and 50 at indoor events.  These numbers are in addition to players, officials and others required to host the events.  For larger outdoor sports grounds with a fixed spectator capacity of a minimum 5,000 spectators, up to 200 spectators are permitted.  Sports training is permitted, with athletes and players training in pods of 15 outdoors or six indoors.  Gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools are permitted to open, but must take appropriate steps to ensure social distancing.  In Dublin, there is currently a further restriction on spectators at outdoor sports grounds with a fixed capacity of a minimum 5,000 spectators, where the limit on spectators is reduced to 100 people. </p><p> The return of some spectators is a very welcome development, but it is important to recognise that the risk of Covid-19 transmission remains.  The expert group on return to sport is developing guidelines for sports clubs on how to safely manage spectators at matches and events at community sports facilities.  As the committee heard earlier, the Department will be engaging with the field sports organisations to develop specific guidance for large sports stadiums, taking account of their size and the different conditions which apply for major sporting events. </p><p> We are confident that the resilience and recovery plan will enable sport to continue during the winter months for the benefit of public health and well-being.  However, as we all know, the best way to facilitate this is to continue to adhere to the public health advice, namely, to maintain social distancing, practice appropriate hand hygiene and wear face coverings, where appropriate.</p><p> I will speak briefly about the supports the Department provides for the provision of sports facilities.  As members will be aware, the sports capital programme is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sports facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment.  Applications are accepted from voluntary, sporting and community organisations, national governing bodies of sport and local authorities.  Schools are also eligible once they apply jointly with a sports club. </p><p> Over 12,000 projects have benefited from sports capital funding since 1998, bringing the total allocations in that time to close to &euro;1 billion.  The programme has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The most recent round of the sports capital programme in 2018 attracted a record 2,337 applications.  Allocations were announced in January, May and November of last year, with a total of more than &euro;56 million awarded to 1,648 different projects.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be with the committee today.  I am joined by my colleague, Paul McDermott, director of national governing bodies and high performance sport.  My statement is a bit long.  I will go through it, though not in detail.  I will highlight some of the issues.</p> <p>  When the restrictions were put in place in March, Sport Ireland responded quickly to its role in terms of protecting public health and supporting the sport sector. Sport Ireland identified three areas of focus: making the case for the inclusion of sports in the Government's roadmap; creating an environment where high performance athletes could return to training as quickly as possible; and presenting a strong case to Government to ensure the financial stability of the sport sector during the pandemic.  There was a high level of collaboration across the sector to achieve these objectives, specifically with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, including our colleagues here today, the NGBs, the Federation of Irish Sport, Sport Northern Ireland with which we meet regularly, the Olympic federation and Paralympics Ireland.  The &euro;70 million Covid-19 funding package secured for the sport sector has been greatly appreciated and Sport Ireland wishes to acknowledge the Government's support in this regard.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland undertook an initial analysis to identify the potential short and medium-term challenge facing the sport in Ireland.  This analysis showed that for the first three months of the crisis beginning in March the NGB sector would have the capacity and capability to manage a period of intense restrictions without significant issue.  Four to six months would be a significant challenge for sports, especially those with a summer season.  Beyond that, and into the winter season for indoor sports, the crisis presented a much broader sectoral challenge.  NGBs with strong governance and financial structures are considered to be in a position to utilise both their reserves and reduced expenditure levels to address unforeseen costs arising for a period of time.</p> <p>  The Government support schemes introduced during the crisis have been essential to ensuring the continued operation of many organisations.  Specifically, the wage subsidy scheme has allowed NGBs to retain staff during a period of great uncertainty.</p> <p>  The development of the Government's Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business offered a pathway for sport to return in a controlled and phased manner, with the acceleration of the roadmap presenting a more positive outlook.  Notwithstanding the financial challenges associated with the restrictions through loss of gate receipts, membership income and commercial activity, the primary challenge for NGBs is the uncertainty associated with planning for the future, particularly the planning of competitions and events.  We are particularly mindful of the challenges facing sports that are primarily indoor-based and most active during the winter period.</p> <p>  The establishment of the return to sport expert group arose from specific concerns within the sport sector regarding the chain of approval of their return to sport protocols.  The group, chaired by the Department's Peter Hogan, has done an excellent job in providing guidance and approval to the sector as it moves through the roadmap.</p> <p>  The return of our high performance athletes to training bases around the country was hugely significant.  We were delighted that they were able to go back on track again.  The postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games was obviously a setback but Sport Ireland moved quickly to reassure the athletes that their funding would be maintained and would run into 2021.</p> <p>  A positive to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis is the innovation of our NGBs, partnerships, clubs and groups.  Since the onset of the restrictions in March, sporting organisations have shown great adaptability to support their memberships and communities.  In particular, social media and other online platforms have been used to great effect to continue to provide fun, engaging and regular advice, classes and challenges to people of all ages.</p> <p>  The importance of maintaining physical and mental well-being has been evident in all facets of society during the crisis, especially during the lockdown stage.  Sporting organisations came to the fore in that.  We conducted research on that as well.  There were significant increases in sport and physical activity, with the rate of sporting activity jumping from 43% up to 51%, with participation in exercise, running and cycling jumping significantly.  The other good news was there was a significant decline in the proportion of people described as sedentary during that period.  There was also a big jump in the number walking, with a 18% increase.  We got to the highest level ever recorded of 83%, which is equivalent to 3 million regular walkers.</p><p> Throughout the crisis, Sport Ireland has continued to support the sector and we have rolled out a number of programmes that have supported the sector through this.  Whether it is a large NGB, a small NGB or a local sports partnership, all of these programmes are being rolled out.  There was Covid compliance officer training, Covid awareness courses which we ran for NGBs, local sports partnerships, clubs and communities, and we continue to roll out guidelines and infographics which explain the various phases of the roadmap. </p><p> In June of this year, the Government announced funding of &euro;70 million.  The purpose of the funding is to protect the national sports system and to invest in people and sports programmes which will play a major role in the long-term public health response to Covid-19.  The funding is made up of four separate streams: funding of up to &euro;40 million for the three main field sports, which were before the committee this morning; a resilience fund of up to &euro;10 million to support the national governing bodies of sport; a sports club resilience fund of up to &euro;15 million to support clubs; and a sports restart and renewal fund of up to &euro;5 million.  The closing date for that programme was last Monday, 14 September, and 39 of the 60 NGBs have applied for funding.  We will be working through those applications, we expect to have decisions made during the month of October and an announcement will probably be made at the end of October. </p><p> Looking forward to 2021, Sport Ireland anticipates further challenges ahead for the sports sector.  However, the resilience shown to date gives Sport Ireland confidence that through our continued collaboration with all partners, we will see a full return to sport by a thriving sector in due course.</p></speech>

It is important that we give our full support to all the sporting organisations across the country because we have so many volunteers, players and spectators who have been greatly affected by this.  All of us see the value of the work done through all our sporting organisations and we have to applaud them and say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; because these have been very challenging times.</p> <p>  My first question is to the Department.  Before Covid-19, many clubs and sporting organisations around the country were struggling.  How can we ensure adequate funding and sustainable multi-annual funding arrangements for the sector at this time of uncertainty?  We will be providing additional Covid-19 support, for example, building on the stability fund for charities so that smaller clubs can deal with the projected &euro;445 million collapse of fundraising income which will not be made good by the wage subsidy scheme or its successors.  Will the Department comment?</p></speech>

That is to address the short-term and medium-term issues.  We think the best way to do that is through the governing bodies.</p> <p>  The Deputy has raised a very tricky challenge for the future in terms of charities and how Covid-19 has impacted fundraising.  What happened in June was a point in time and we are aware we are going to have to revisit this.</p></speech>

Even as matters stood, clubs were struggling, so this is important.  We spoke about the &euro;70 million earlier.  We need to see small GAA clubs and other clubs in small rural villages get the support that is urgently needed.  Will we be resourcing local sports partnerships to ensure they can support local clubs to encourage people back to sport?</p></speech>

As chair of Concern Worldwide, I am very keen that people continue to give to charities around the country that are doing great work.  That is to be encouraged.</p> <p>  As for funding, the LSPs have done tremendous work during recent months, as they always do, and have reached out to local communities, trying to keep people as active as possible and giving them the resources to do so.  We have invested heavily in the LSPs and will continue to do so.  We have increased their budget in recent times by providing funding for development officers and disability officers.  We have dormant account funding as well that we have given them, amounting to &euro;7 million this year.  Those resources have been increasing.  That is a partnership with the local authorities, and they invest as well.  Participation is highlighted in the national policy on sports, and the LSPs are one of the main vehicles in increasing participation.  They will be resourced by Sport Ireland going forward.</p></speech>

We have wonderful community swimming pools around the country.  Children's swimming lessons are currently postponed.  This is a vital part of the school curriculum.  What is being done to support a return to healthy sports such as swimming for our young people?  Community pools such as mine in Carlow have been a great outlet for those wishing to ease back into exercise.  Swimming has been called the perfect exercise.  It is just a concern I have.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back to me on it.  With community pools, as they themselves know, again, fundraising has been a major issue.  Schools from around the county, including my area, used to attend the pool in Carlow and now they cannot.  Will there be a certain criterion such that pools will get special funding?  They play such a significant part in our community.</p></speech>

Reopening was very costly for a lot of them.  The Deputy will see that, according the recent roadmap, if schools can do social distancing safely, they can have more people in, which will help them with the bottom line.  That is what we have done to help them out.  It is very challenging, though, and we are very aware of that.  I will ask Mr. Hogan to come in from the expert group's perspective on what it has done in this area.</p></speech>

We have ongoing contact with Swim Ireland and Ireland Active and are working very closely with them.  Both organisations have done great work in developing protocols for the safe return to swimming and to activity in the pools generally.  We are optimistic now that things will go in the right direction.  We have a little more certainty now with the roadmap for operators.  There was a little uncertainty previously as to when they would be allowed to open and how they would open.  We will work forward with them in a positive way.  Swimming will be really important through the winter months.  We hope to see the lessons and the activity clubs returning and going very well over the coming months.</p></speech>

Could the witnesses clarify if the Department has sought specific EU funding to assist sporting organisations?  There has been a lot of liaison with larger sporting bodies.  Has the same focus and assistance been given to minority sporting organisations?  Furthermore, in terms of opening up again and going back in some cases, judging from what is coming across my desk and, I presume, other Members' desks, there seems to be a lack of clarity surrounding gyms, yoga classes and small exercise classes.  Is it possible to get some clarity on those?</p></speech>

We have engagement with them, as does Sport Ireland, and the &euro;70 million is open to all sports.  The Minister had a Covid sports monitoring group, which opened to a wide range of NGBs.</p><p>We will have a meeting again next week and we met them recently as part of the roadmap consultation.</p><p> As for dance and exercise classes, following public health advice, under level 2 at least, pods of six are allowed and that is how they can proceed.</p><p> On EU funding, I might ask Mr. Hogan to comment.</p></speech>

The flexibility of the EU system to enable people to continue sharing information and to feed back on the issues faced within the member states has been really positive.  It is a sensitive period at the moment in the EU context in regard to looking ahead to funding and funding programmes, but I can assure the Deputy that sport is certainly being recognised, with a new work programme for sport being taken forward by the Commission.  While nothing has been settled at this stage, the meetings are ongoing in that regard.  There is a recognition that Covid presents a further challenge to the sports sector throughout the Union.</p></speech>

By and large, if any of the smaller NGBs has a smaller question, it will get on to Mr. McDermott's team.  Questions relating to guidance through the roadmap are answered and a great deal of support is given to them, such as through the programmes I mentioned earlier.  A total of &euro;10 million has been allocated for the sector to see it through the end of 2020, which will be a significant resource as the sector goes forward.  Mr. McDermott might like to comment on that.</p></speech>

They all have open access to us, the services and the programmes, and have applied for the funding on their own behalf and on behalf of their clubs.  They draw down all the services on an equal basis.  Our colleagues are available to them daily and the general response from the wider sports sector has been very positive.</p></speech>

There is a bit of work to be done.  While there is some flexibility in the roadmap, there are a number of challenges.  It is not just about how large the stadium is.  It is also to do with the entrance, the exit and the congregation before and after the match, while taking account of social distancing.  That work is starting but it is going to take a bit of time.</p></speech>

I assure the committee we recognise that it is a pressing matter and that it is important for the sporting bodies concerned, the wider sports sector and society in general to see a return to spectating in a safe way.  We want to continue, as we have done throughout this process of return, to be safe and to do things in the correct way.  We will certainly move forward as quickly as possible.  As Mr. Kelly stated, there is a bit of work to be done, but there is great energy in the sector and people have been collaborating well, which will continue in this process.  We want to see people working together to identify suggestions, proposals and ways to address the challenges Mr. Kelly outlined.  We will then bring that to the public health team at the earliest opportunity so that, as soon as possible, we can start to see a return to safe spectating at some of the larger venues the Deputy referred to.</p></speech>

I hope I am correct in saying that.  Would the Department consider giving more decision-making responsibility to the GAA and other large sporting organisations?  The evidence indicates that there have been no occurrences of Covid at GAA matches, for example.  Would the Department be willing to give more responsibility to the GAA to ensure that more spectators can attend matches?</p></speech>

We have no issues with them and how well they are doing but we have to work within the broader roadmap and public health advice.  As Mr. Hogan said, we have a very good relationship with health officials, including taking things to them if they will work.  That is what this group will do.</p> <p>  In terms of what is happening in the North, we have very regular dialogue with them and we are watching very closely what they are doing, as we are watching other test events across the Continent.

There is a lot of collaboration between the three main field sports.  As evidenced this morning, they are working together on this.  It is better that everyone moves at the same time.  The information is there.  This can move on quickly.  We meet regularly with Sport Northern Ireland.  We are keeping the dialogue open.  We are trying to take an all-Ireland approach as best we can, even though we are different jurisdictions in this case.</p></speech>

We have a large body of work to roll out with the &euro;70 million.  We have not let go of any of the staff of Sport Ireland and it is not our intention to do so because the body of work has increased.  As was stated earlier, every call from an NGB is answered, and on the same day.  That is the level of contact that we have with the sector.  </p> <p>  All of our business continues.  We have to plan for Tokyo in terms of our high performance programmes and high performance team.  Our anti-doping remains operational, as is our child protection and ethics work.  Our participation work has never been more important.  We need to continue to encourage and to have in place programmes that keep people active.  This work needs to continue.  We found out during the lockdown that it was more important than ever.  We got many programmes out through social media at that time.  Our local sports partnerships, which we also fund, did that work.  The workload has increased this year, even though most of our staff are working remotely and there is only a few of us on campus.  That work has continued.  It is not our intention to slim down the organisation at this time.  As I said, the workload has increased.</p></speech>

During Mr. Delaney 's time with the FAI, we had some interesting times talking about sport, soccer and so on.  My question is for Mr. Treacy and relates to governance in all of the sporting organisations.</p><p>Without picking out any one organisation, is he satisfied that there is appropriate and proper governance for the money he is spending?  Turning to the FAI and the governance review of the 78 recommendations, is Mr. Treacy satisfied that all those have now been met?</p></speech>

We had a session on governance with chairs and chief executives on Wednesday, which we led in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration, IPA.  We are rolling out a governance programme at level 9 with the IPA and 58 people have registered for that course.  I am pleased to say that females outnumber males on the programme.  We are delighted to highlight that aspect of the programme.  We will also undertake a governance endeavour with all the bodies at the end of November, where we will take findings from our audits during the year and highlight them so that all the sporting organisations can be aware of them.  We also pick a theme for the night.</p> <p>  This governance work is ongoing in the whole governing body sector.  All those bodies are on a journey with regard to the community and voluntary code.  We have taken over the code, which is now a sports code.  We have someone who will drive that within Sport Ireland in providing supports for the various organisations and dealing with any queries they may have.  We also work with the Carmichael Centre and use its expertise in certain aspects of what we do.</p> <p>  A great deal of work was done on the FAI in recent months and that has continued.  The pandemic has not stopped that work.  We have a memorandum of understanding, the IPA report, which we are working through, and the KOSI report recommendations.  We have set up a governance oversight group with the FAI.  There is also a financial oversight group chaired by members of Sport Ireland.  That work has continued.  The FAI is back on track.  All the recommendations the organisation was supposed to implement by this stage have been implemented and are up to date, and funding has been restored.</p></speech>

My second question is probably better directed to the Department.  The budgetary commitment to be made next year is for the Department to determine.  The important fact we must consider is that we do not know how this pandemic will play out.  Sports organisations may experience greater difficulty or fewer problems, depending on how far we can go in resolving issues with medical care and a vaccine.  How is it proposed that that issue be managed?  The Department is stuck with a deadline for a budget.  How will it deal with that?  That is a generic question. </p></speech>

It is an extremely challenging situation, not only in sport but across the public services.  We do not know the path of the virus and how it is going to impact, which makes things very difficult.  The Government stepped up in June and we intend, as part of the Estimates process, to speak to representatives of all the NGBs to get their best current estimate and a prediction of what their needs will be next year.  As I said, the budget will be challenging for a number of Departments, but we will do the best that we can for the moment.</p></speech>

Let us suppose that &euro;70 million is available again next year.  We do not want to create unrealistic expectations that cannot be met regarding the amount of funding will be available.  I am just commenting on that as a difficulty that may arise for the Department.  I am satisfied that Sport Ireland and the Department are giving this the best shot they can, as are the sports organisations.</p></speech>

I am sure they are familiar with the earlier contributions from the three large sporting organisations, namely, the IRFU, the GAA and the FAI.</p><p>Some of my questions will be based on the information garnered from them.  Mr. Kelly mentioned the LSPs, the very important role they play and the &euro;7 million that was allocated to them this year.  I refer to the issue of mental health and general well-being, particularly in light of the pandemic and the issues people have faced with the restrictions.  In my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has come up with pretty creative and imaginative ways of hosting events that are set pieces in the calendar.  An example of that is the community walk, which is now going to be done over a week, and people will do that in their own smaller local parks where possible.  There are also cycling and other initiatives to keep people active, which is very welcome.  The funding the Department supplies is critical to these partnerships and other organisations, including sporting ones, which Mr. Treacy touched on with reference to charity events.  All of these things are being done in a different way due to the circumstances that faces us.</p><p> In his opening statement, Mr. Kelly referenced the sports capital programme and &euro;19 million having been paid out so far this year.  A full review of that programme in 2018 is being conducted and it is due to report shortly.  When is that going to be published?  Equally, the sports capital programme is going to reopen later this year.  Does Mr. Kelly have a timeframe for that?  As he will appreciate, many sports clubs, which may be watching this afternoon, will be very keen to know when that round of funding is opening.  I read in Mr. Kelly's opening statement that due diligence and appraisals are under way as well on the LSSIF.  Given the financial pressures Covid has put on clubs and organisations that may have applied for that fund, what happens if that money is not drawn down?  I ask because he said that there are no plans in the short term to reopen that fund.</p></speech>

It is subject to clearance and approval by the Ministers.  As I said in my opening statement, we are hoping to do the next round of the sports capital programme later in the year but I do not have a date for it.  On the LSSIF, my colleague, Mr. Sheahan, who is heading up sports capital, will reply on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Sheahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#SS00300"><p>Returning briefly to the review and next round of the sports capital programme, the review is our own exercise to look back on elements of the programme that worked well or other issues we could improve upon.  From the official point of view, we have finalised our work on it and have done a submission to our new Ministers.  The reason we do that is that once it is signed off on finally, it will form the basis of the terms and conditions of the new round of the programme.  The transfer of functions only happened earlier this week so we are now in our new Department.  We are very hopeful we will get sign-off in the next week or two.  We are currently testing our IT systems and so on in the new Department.  As Deputies will be aware, the sports capital programme generates a huge volume of traffic to ourselves with several thousand applications each time and, therefore, we need to ensure all of our IT systems are in place before we actually open it.  I am confident that we will be in a position to open it up some time in October.</p> <p>  We announced 32 grants under the LSSIF in January.  It was always the intention that all of those projects would have to go through a due diligence process and we are fairly advanced on that.  We are engaging with our legal advisers, which is the Chief State Solicitor's office, on finalising the actual grant agreements but again, it is more or less there.  With the sports capital and the large scale programmes, we have always been flexible about the grants we announce and any delays or particular issues that may result in delays to the drawdown of funding.</p><p>At an early stage of this crisis, we engaged directly with the national governing bodies which appeared before the committee this morning to get updates on where they were in terms of some of the larger products under the LSSIF.</p><p> It is a rolling fund and we have amounts allocated for this year and next.  If needs be, we will carry forward that funding.  There is no issue currently in terms of funds being withdrawn and so on.  As with any other large capital spend, we will conduct our own internal reviews - those will happen some time early next year - to see how projects are progressing, engage with the NGBs and local authorities, and determine whether we need to reprioritise.</p></speech>

That will be reassuring for those clubs and organisations that have been granted funding but whose circumstances have also changed.</p><p>In the time remaining, I might ask Mr. Treacy a question focusing on elite athletes.  He mentioned Tokyo.  There are other events coming down the track for many sports as well.  What supports have been put in place since the initial Covid outbreak in Ireland for elite athletes?  Some might not have the necessary training capabilities in their immediate environs.  When the travel restrictions and so forth were lifted, what supports were put in place <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>travel and accommodation for people who had critical deadlines in their professional careers?</p></speech>

Through dormant accounts funding, we provide the LSPs an additional &euro;6 million in core funding.  I welcome the Deputy's support for them.</p> <p>  Regarding elite athletes, a major issue was getting them back into facilities and training in groups.  In addition, we safeguarded our funding to sports.  We asked all of the NGBs not to spend high-performance sport funding and to ensure that they held onto it for next year.  The Olympic Games were beckoning and training camps and so forth would continue once various countries opened up.  As such, we wanted to safeguard that funding.  The institute opened up and our elite athletes could once again use it and avail of its services.  During the lockdown, our service providers provided services to our athletes, for example, remote guidance on strength, conditioning and other aspects.  They were available online all the time to talk to athletes.</p> <p>  I will now pass to Mr. McDermott, who is in charge of high performance.  He will elaborate further for the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#TT00400"><p>The first action was to guarantee funding for all of the athletes on the international carding scheme through to 2021 and up to the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.  That was an essential if we were to give them stability and the confidence that we would support them all the way up to the games.  The initial phase of lockdown was difficult, but the Sport Ireland Institute remained open and operational, albeit at a virtual level.  Services were provided virtually, with service providers continuing to engage with athletes and their coaches and supports.  The institute reopened safely, but at the earliest opportunity.  A number of athletes now use the facilities on the Sport Ireland campus on a regular basis, including the institute.</p> <p>  We work daily and weekly with the performance directors of the sports to ensure that their programmes are on track and their funding is secured.  We give them as much clarity and security as we can to ensure that all of the athletes who are aiming for European, world, Olympic and Paralympic championships are provided for.</p> <p>  It is important that we acknowledge our excellent working relationship with the Olympic Federation of Ireland and Paralympics Ireland.  Through a collaborative effort between the Sport Ireland Institute and the governing bodies, individual athletes have a large suite of supports available to them.  I believe that 45 places in Tokyo have already been qualified for, as have a number on the Paralympics side.</p> <p>  The Deputy rightly acknowledges that the immediate locations of some athletes who are living away from the campus are not ideal.  Notwithstanding that and other difficulties, every effort is being made.</p><p>I wish to acknowledge that, in all the Government&rsquo;s roadmaps and various interventions around Covid-19, the needs of elite athletes have been recognised and, notwithstanding everything that is going on, we have seen some excellent performances at the European Under-23 Rowing Championships.  The Ireland cricket team played England and won one of the matches.  Where our athletes have been able to compete, they have done well.  Notwithstanding the difficulties and various challenges that we are facing, the supports are there.  All of our colleagues in the Sport Ireland Institute continue to provide supports.  We pay tribute to the athletes and their coaches who have shown great resilience and determination and continue to train.  When they have been given the opportunity to perform in limited circumstances, they have done so to an exceptionally high standard.  We are doing well, generally speaking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#UU00200"><p>I thank all our guests for their contributions.  I come from a sporting background and place an emphasis on the importance of sport and fitness to the well-being of people.  During the earlier session, I outlined to representatives of the GAA, soccer and rugby bodies my views on the importance of sports and fitness, especially during these current challenging times.  There is no doubt that, during the lockdown, people's mental health and well-being were helped by their daily fitness regimes.  It was great to see a big increase in the number of people who got involved in fitness and sport and returned to a daily fitness programme.  The question we must ask ourselves is what would have happened if these people did not have this opportunity.</p> <p>  It is clear to see the benefit that everybody gets from increased participation in sports and fitness.  During the past six months, I have seen the increase in the number of people out walking about in my home town of Dundalk.  We have an opportunity to build on this and regular exercise should be actively encouraged.  It must be taught at an early age that exercise is not just a hobby but a vital part of healthy living.  It must start in primary schools and children should be given every opportunity and encouragement to take part in sporting activities.  For that to happen, we must provide better facilities.  Much has been done in recent times but it is still not enough.  We must invest in greenways and make use of all areas where safe walking facilities can be utilised.</p> <p>  I have been actively pushing for a walkway from the seaside village of Blackrock into Dundalk.  I am pleased to see that some progress has been made on this and look forward to seeing it completed.  Not only will it facilitate and provide a safe route for walkers and runners, it will provide an opportunity for the tourist industry in the region.  I hope that we can eventually develop a greenway from Dundalk to Carlingford.  With those things in place, I firmly believe that the area will become a magnet for tourists to visit and provide a safe and enjoyable route for walkers, runners and cyclists.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, many clubs throughout County Louth provided invaluable support to their local communities during the lockdown period.  Without that support, I fear that many in the community would have been in a very bad place.  It is now time that we repaid that great community service.  Many of the clubs are calling out for support to develop their facilities.  I should point out to the committee that I am chairman of the Louth county board and, as such, have an interest in the fight for clubs to access more funding from the Department.  It is now time for the Government to provide this much needed support to sporting clubs that gave so much when it was needed most during the lockdown.  The Government must provide the necessary funding that clubs now require as a matter of urgency.  In fairness to the Government, it has stepped up to the plate when it comes to supporting businesses and the health service during the pandemic but we must recognise the important role that local clubs have played, and continue to play, in communities during these extraordinary times.  Clubs need our support to continue to provide this much needed service to local communities.  I would welcome the view of the Department on this matter and if they could outline any plans it has to support grassroots clubs of the GAA, soccer and rugby.  </p> <p>  A minor point I would like to raise is the fact that there is no dedicated section for sport on the Department's website.  It has been raised by many people in the sporting sector that it seems that sport is not being given the attention it should be.  The fact that it is not even recognised on a Government website is alarming.  What plans are in place to rectify this?</p> <p>  I want to put on record that not enough funding is available for sport and fitness in Ireland.  We must recognise this and act on it.  We all know that if one partakes of regular exercise, not only will one's physical health improve but also one's mental health.  We must help people to realise this and support them.  Supporting them means having the right facilities in place so they can have a walk, run or even a cycle on a regular basis.</p><p>We must invest in greenways such as the one I mentioned from Dundalk to Blackrock.  We must make it safer to go out and to exercise with better facilities.  Clubs are only too willing to open up their facilities to walkers and runners but we must help them more by providing the funding necessary to improve their facilities, whether it is for improved lighting or track facilities.  We cannot regard this as an expense or a drain on the budget.  This is an investment in the physical and mental well-being of people, which, in turn, will lead to a lowering of the cost of maintaining our health system as people become more healthy.  We have an opportunity and we must grasp it.  Let us not be found wanting.  This country and its people have been through enough during the past six months.  There is now an opportunity to put in place long-term measures that will ultimately give us long-term positive results.</p><p> What would happen if people did not have the opportunity to participate in sport?  The Government must provide necessary funding for clubs as a matter of urgency.  They are the heart and soul of their communities.  They need money and they are broke.  These are the ones who were out helping people throughout the pandemic.  Let us make sure that the money goes to the right people.  The Government and Sport Ireland representatives are the ones who distribute the money.  It is important that the grassroots receive it.  Can the witnesses answer those two questions, please?</p></speech>

Then I can pick up the other issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#VV00300"><p>The Government provided &euro;15 million that is to be allocated to clubs around the country as part of the resilience fund.  The funding will be allocated through the governing bodies of sport, which will apply for their clubs as they are in regular contact with them.  It is very welcome.  It is current funding that the clubs can invest, keeping in mind the protocols they need to put in place.  The funding is vital to them.</p> <p>  As the Deputy stated, the clubs are doing Trojan work.  During the pandemic, their members were out helping the elderly and always going the extra step.  They are the life and soul of every community.  We were delighted that the Government stepped up and provided &euro;15 million to the clubs.  The clubs are supported by the national governing bodies and also by the local sports partnerships, which are in contact with them regularly and supporting them on the ground on an ongoing basis.  Any guidance and training the clubs require is provided through their national governing body or the local sports partnership.  This needs to continue, obviously.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on the importance of sport and physical activity for people's health and well-being.  If people are healthy, active and engage in outdoor activity, they have a better chance of fighting a pandemic.  To that effect, we will be launching a policy on outdoor activity in the next week.  It promotes being active and outdoor sports.  Clubs are involved in that at local level.  We need to promote this.  It is about utilising greenways, walkways and blueways or anything that will encourage people to go out and participate in sport.</p> <p>  The important point is that there is a sport for everyone.  One does not need to be able to kick a football.  If one cannot do so, there is another sport.  It might be in a boat or in a boxing ring.  There is something for everyone.  We encourage everyone, irrespective of their abilities or disabilities, to participate.  An important point is that it is never too late to start.  This really came through during the pandemic.  Everybody was out walking again.  They were utilising the forests around the country, which is really to be encouraged.  They were bringing their children to the forests and allowing them to experience physical activity, such as walking, and nature at the same time.  Important work was done on this.  We strongly encourage people to adopt physical activity into their way of life and continue with it into the winter months.</p></speech>

There was very strong take-up of that scheme as well.  That would be covered.  I want to give people confidence that every effort is being made to get right into communities and into every strand of Irish sport through governing bodies and local sports partnerships.  Every effort was made to make sure that all clubs, large or small, knew there was a scheme available to them.  We are encouraged by signs from the sports partnerships that there has been strong pick-up and good coverage.  It will take a few weeks to validate all of the applications but in reviewing the information we have got in the last few days we have seen that both governing bodies and sports partnerships have done a good job in connecting with their club networks to ensure applications are forthcoming.</p></speech>

I have just a couple of questions, which have also been referred to by previous speakers.</p> <p>  In respect of the major capital grants programme, some grants have been awarded and, in the case of swimming pools, some are yet to be awarded.  Are the witnesses satisfied that any glitches that have occurred whereby local contributions were slow in coming in as a result of the impact of the virus will not result in any applicants falling through the net?  Are the witnesses satisfied that as we approach the winter months, sufficient space will be available for both indoor and outdoor sports to ensure that our communities which, in some areas at least, have been largely locked up for a considerable time will have those important outlets to fall back on?  Those are my two questions.  I may ask one more short one afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.226" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#WW00300"><p>I will come in on the question of space for indoor and outdoor sports and will ask Mr. Sheahan to pick up on the sports capital element.  We are very conscious that we are entering the winter.  As we all remember, during the deepest of the lockdown we had some great weather, which helped to get people out, but we cannot hope for that in the winter.  In July, the Minister announced a fund to help out pools in dealing with some of their costs.  We are aware that those costs have not gone away.  As can be seen, in level 2 pools can maximise revenue if they maintain social distancing.  This should make a big difference.  There is no doubt but that it will be very challenging to keep indoor spaces open.  It is something we will have to examine in the context of the Estimates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Sheahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#WW00400"><p>I will come in on the question of grants for large-scale projects.  I probably touched on this briefly in my earlier answer.  In January of this year, we announced the first allocation.  As the Deputy knows, the large-scale sport infrastructure fund is a new scheme.  The first allocations were made in January, when a total of &euro;82 million was allocated to 32 different projects.  All of these are still going through a due diligence process.  Different schemes are at different stages of readiness.  There are two streams to the fund.  Stream 2 is for projects that are more or less ready for construction while stream 1 relates to ideas for projects which local authorities or national governing bodies may have.  We are more or less there with regard to due diligence; we are just seeking final sign-off from our legal advisers, the Chief State Solicitor's office.  We will then issue grant agreements in respect of projects that have passed that stage of the process.</p> <p>  Anecdotally, we have not been told that any projects will not happen.  Some concern has been expressed in our engagements with the bigger national governing bodies that a certain amount of their own resources had to be provided, which is a requirement of the scheme.  As members will have all heard this morning, Covid has hit the financial projections of all the national governing bodies.  There is no suggestion that any of the projects will not happen but I suspect that some may be on ice or not advancing as quickly as was initially envisaged.  We had always planned to sit down with the bodies after a certain stage to go through all 32 projects and to get updates.</p><p>Next year, we might examine whether these projects are proceedings, whether there is scope for reallocating to the particular national governing body or local authority or even, in the longer term, whether it is time to open up a new round of the large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF, again.  We are keeping it under review.  I am not aware of any projects that will not proceed.  </p></speech>

There seemed to be increased emphasis on the need for swimming facilities, as some conditions do not allow people to run or to walk.  The capital programme on swimming pool projects is due to take off again shortly.  What stage is this at?  When is it likely to be concluded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Sheahan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#XX00300"><p>The old scheme was the local authority swimming pool programme, which we inherited a long way back from the Department of the Environment.  Only three projects remain in that programme.  The new large scale sport infrastructure fund, the first grants for which were announced in January, in many ways subsumed the old local authorities swimming pool programme.  Any applications we get for new swimming pool projects are now covered under the LSSIF.  Of the 32 projects that grant funding was announced in January, about eight had a swimming pool element.  Some were new facilities and some were refurbishment work to existing pools.  There is no plan to open the new local authority swimming pool programme, rather a new round of the sports capital programme itself.  Sometimes local authority swimming pool projects have gym facilities and might come looking for equipment for those.  We hope to open the sports capital programme next month.  There are no plans to open a new round of the LSSIF in the short term but we will review that some time early next year.</p></speech>

Earlier, I outlined the benefits of sport and acknowledged the huge contribution that organised sporting bodies played locally in the early days of the pandemic.  They demonstrated the substantial community resource that they are.  I echo John Treacy's comments on the availability of sports outside the traditional ones.  I was very pleased to be involved in Sportsfest, the sports partnership led by Dublin City Council which encouraged people to try different sports that were new to them.</p> <p>  Sport is not a business but it does have a financial model.  This morning we heard clearly from the large sporting bodies and how they operate.  I am more concerned about those on the ground.  I mentioned Tolka Rovers this morning.  It is almost at the point of closing its gates because its financial model was based on its hall being let to different groups.  The income stream from that is gone, and they now have a bank loan with no way of meeting its repayments.  I imagine every sports club with a substantial premises is in a similar position.  </p> <p>  What guarantees are in place to ensure that the &euro;70 million going into sport in Ireland through the sporting bodies and Sport Ireland is reaching those on the ground?  More importantly, non-financial help is needed to assist with the capacity in each of these clubs.  The Department needs to approach representatives from the banks to ensure that much of the property owned by sporting bodies locally, often on State land on long-term leases, cannot be realised by the bank closing on them.  The bank should and must take steps to restructure or be proactive.  Can the Department commit to dealing with the banks to support clubs on a wider scale in order that there is a policy across the sector rather than by individual bank?</p></speech>

I will speak on the banking issue and ask the representatives from Sport Ireland to speak about the &euro;70 million disbursement.  It is not something that has come to my attention but perhaps my colleagues have heard differently.  I am happy to talk to the Deputy on that issue and see what we can do.  Anything we can do through connections with the Department of Finance and the banking federation on that, we are willing to do.</p></speech>

There are strands of funding and the ring-fencing of &euro;15 million for clubs is to ensure that it is channelled directly into clubs at local level.  I referenced that the local sports partnerships have run clubs, again at a community level.  Consequently, by having the &euro;70 million funding programme in strands, we can make sure the money goes where it is needed most.  We will review the documentation and will validate all the applications.</p> <p>  The first priority of the Government bodies when this crisis hit was to try to maintain activity.  Second, when they said there would be a resource requirement to allow sport to continue, they put clubs first.  That is the general view.  Governing bodies came to us.  Some of them had their own financial issues but they in general spoke to the need of clubs at a local level and that is reflected in the way the Government signed off on the funding.  There will be strands and there will be mechanisms put in place to make sure those most in need can access the funding.  The Deputy has referenced Tolka Rovers.  We do not know the specifics of that but basketball is one of the sports.  Hopefully, that will be reflected in the applications when we review them over the next few weeks.  There are mechanisms put in place in our review and validation of applications to make sure clubs are looked after and the money does not just go to a national level, but will also go local.</p></speech>

It does not matter what level Dublin or any other county is at.  No one can use that facility or that pitch and the bank is not realising any money.  We need to look at the financial model of each club and perhaps ask the national bodies to put in place financial advisers and assistants to allow them to restructure in a world that does not have income from events.</p></speech>

Everyone welcomes the money and the systems from a point of view of higher-level supports to ensure we have continuity of the GAA championships, professional rugby and the League of Ireland in particular, and maintenance of all sorts of sports clubs.</p> <p>  There was talk of difficulties and the fact that sports organisations do not know what they will face into in the future.  No more than businesses and other such entities in our society, there will be a need for further supports.  People have talked about stadia and we all welcome and would look for opportunities for more people to avail of seeing their favourite teams.  However, until it gets up to really significant numbers, it would not necessarily be financially beneficial to clubs and beyond.  There was a suggestion that 5,000 fans in the Aviva Stadium - which one cannot even see happening at the moment - would not be financially viable and there would need to be about 18,000.  Given where we are at the moment, that is incredibly difficult to see.</p> <p>  What contacts have the Department made in relation to budgeting and planning for the future?  We are now talking about at least six to nine months but we could be talking about two years of living with this pandemic.</p><p>We could have two steps forward and three steps backwards like we have at the minute and that could put severe pressure on clubs at every level.</p></speech>

There is no way around this.  It is extremely challenging and all we can do is stay very close, both ourselves and Sport Ireland, to the NGBs and keep an eye on where things are going.  As the Deputy said, the virus is changing.  It is having an impact.  Some places have moved from one level of alert down to another level and that is incredibly disruptive.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, the &euro;70 million was welcome at that point and it really helped.  We are not, however, under any illusions that it will be enough for the future.  We are currently in the middle of a budget process and an Estimates process.  We will engage, through Sport Ireland, with all the NGBs to get a sense of what their requirements are going to be for next year.  </p> <p>  I will not lie; it will be difficult to plan with any visibility in the future.  We will work on the spectators.  We talked earlier about what we will do but we are not depending on that or planning that as something that will fill a big hole.  It would be welcome if we got to that point.  The reality is, however, that we will need to support the sports sector during this pandemic and that will have to continue.</p></speech>

Obviously, Mr. Kelly cannot get into facts and figures, particularly if he is in a negotiation process.  I will take for granted that there is acceptance that in this State, across Europe and on a wider level, we need to be imaginative.  We need to ensure we put the moneys in place in order that we have an operating society beyond this pandemic.</p> <p>  I am inclined to believe Mr. Kelly is taking into account what was said earlier by the three groupings and the particular costs they have, whether that is for maintenance of the League of Ireland or otherwise.  I also take from what he said earlier that Mr. Kelly is looking for input from all stakeholders on the needs and wants, particularly, financial, to maintain as much as we can of our sporting infrastructure.</p></speech>

As with all things in life, whether we can achieve everything we want remains to be seen.  However, we are, of course, staying close to them in terms of what we can do to keep as much sport as is safe to do so and address the real costing.  The Deputy mentioned some of them and that is the real challenge in front of us.</p></speech>

As I am generally circular in how I speak, apologies if I come back on myself at any stage.  I welcome a great number of things that have been said with regard to all-Ireland co-ordination, which is obviously necessary.  As for dealing with NPHET, it probably would be fair to say that when the restrictions were introduced in respect of gyms, there was a lag-time of a couple of days with regard to clarity.  People were saying that only six people were allowed in a gym or only six were allowed in any exercise class.  People then started reporting to me that they heard this somewhere.  I was going to say that they were not even naming Dr. Ronan Glynn properly, so I assumed they had not heard it properly.  I had to relisten to every utterance made by Dr. Glynn, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly and the Taoiseach and I did not hear what I was being told I was hearing.  It was a case that people believed or thought they heard something and started operating pods within gyms.  It all sounded like they were doing the correct thing but I was not sure they were covered by the rules.</p> <p>  I then heard that Basketball Ireland obviously had made an approach and had sought information.  It entered my head that nobody had probably considered indoor basketball games.  That is fair enough because not everything can be covered with a blunt instrument.  However, one needs to get on top of it as quickly as possible.  Two or three days later Basketball Ireland got its update, which stated that indoor training could operate within pods of six.  It is about ensuring the conversation is happening between NPHET, the Government, the Department, Sport Ireland and all these bodies to avoid wobbles like that, which are not absolutely necessary.</p> <p>  We talked about business models before.  There are an awful lot of sports.  I am thinking of a number of combat sports that I do myself, albeit pretty badly.</p><p>They would not necessarily have governing bodies that are recognised by Sport Ireland, etc., at this point in time.  They operate on the basis of a basic business model.  I do not mean that they make crazy money but they charge people to take part and one hopes that it washes its face with whatever other funding and allocations they can get.  Many of them would have been put under pressure when that happened.  This is to ensure that we have clarity and that we maintain as much as we can, even with heightened restrictions that may happen in the future.</p></speech>

It is our objective to be as clear as possible and I think that the roadmap will help to give people a sense of what each level means.  We have good relations with the Department of the Taoiseach, from which the roadmap emanates, and with the Department of Health.  We have taken an approach to sport where we take the guidelines, go away and then come back with our solutions.  That has worked well.  The committee has heard Mr. McDermott say that Sport Ireland is in regular contact with NGBs.  We try to get it as clear as possible and to get all the wrinkles ironed out before anything goes out.  With the best will in the world, that is not always possible so we try to clarify it as soon as possible.  Mr. McDermott might address his contacts with NGBs.</p></speech>

We try to turn things around quickly between the expert group, with Mr. Hogan and colleagues in the Department, and governing bodies, and we try to provide clarity as well as we can.  It has worked reasonably well.  Some challenges are difficult to overcome.  We understand that some combat sports operate in a way that is not that straightforward to assist at present because they operate in indoor facilities with large groups.  As the Deputy says, people are just paying for classes.  That is tricky.  Having said that, the Irish Athletic Boxing Association has excellent protocols.  It introduced them as a conservative return to boxing and that has generally gone quite well.</p> <p>  We appreciate the point the Deputy is making.  We endeavour to turn the information around quickly.  It worked well during various phases of the roadmap.  The expert group was obviously critical to that because sports presented protocols and were given feedback, advice, approval or direction, and that gave the governing bodies significant confidence to go back to their clubs and communities to say that was how they needed to do it.  The existence of that mechanism was critical to giving the governing bodies confidence to go out to their clubs.  No doubt, with how all of this has unfolded over the last weeks and months, there have been a few stumbles along the way.  We did not get it 100% perfect every time but the intent and ambition is there to support it and to make sure that every sport is operating safely, and to allow the maximum number of people to participate in the sport of their choice.  It has gone reasonably well and hopefully it will continue in that way.  The new regime gives a platform for the next six to nine months.  We have many questions and have clarity from the past 24 hours about the new levels.  Hopefully that will give sports bodies confidence.  Mr. Hogan is chairman of the expert group so no doubt he would like to speak to that.</p></speech>

We appreciate that there can be hiccups along the way.  I have a couple of comments to make.  The first is to express our thanks and appreciation to all members of the expert group, particularly those sporting representatives who have joined us and done extraordinary work for us.  It has been a collaborative effort over the last few months.  As Mr. Kelly mentioned earlier, we have had 17 meetings.  One is taking people who are moving well outside their sphere of expertise in the context of the sports that they work with daily, and making that expertise available to minority sports and smaller national governing bodies to assist them to find ways to return to their training and competitive action in a safe way.  It ensures that participants, officials who will be present, spectators on site and the wider community will feel confident that the sport is responsible and that events in their communities are being done in a safe, managed way in line with public health guidance.</p><p>It is important to remember that everything we do has to be in line with the public health guidance.  We have a good relationship with colleagues in the Department of Health.  We have had contacts with the acting CMO.  We also had contacts with Dr. Holohan before he stood down from his position.  There has always been a general agreement across the Government that sport and physical activity is hugely beneficial.  It will play an important role in safeguarding health and well-being as we move through the next six to nine months while we are dealing with the pandemic.  It continues to play a positive role but we just need to make sure what is happening is safe, managed, overseen and properly supervised.  I have every confidence we will continue to do so.</p></speech>

I accept there will always be wobbles and mistakes.  If we are looking to cut them out, that is fine.  I get the point of view of Mr. Hogan and the sporting organisations that despite a couple of <i>faux pas</i>, a plan that operates for six to nine months is far better than what we were probably operating with beforehand.  Once we have clarity and people have things explained to them, they can accept them.</p><p>I wonder if Mr. Treacy or somebody from Sport Ireland could talk about particular difficulties that certain clubs would have.  I have had approaches from a swimming club that is under heightened financial pressure because the swimming pool has to operate with new rules and regulations on distancing, etc., which is all fine but which involves added costs to the club.  I wonder whether there were any other such sectors.  I accept that if one looks for information on what people's wants and needs are, one will find a huge amount of difficulties that many of us will not even have considered.</p></speech>

He probably knows that many of the income streams of some clubs have been lost because of local competitions involving an income that did not happen or because of lost revenues in terms of membership.  Many clubs are facing such issues, which are starting to affect the winter sports now.  I refer to members joining clubs, or clubs joining the national federation, in sports like gymnastics or cycling.  That has been a factor in many of the NGBs losing membership fees.  That is challenging.  We will see that come through in some of the applications we will get.  There is also the cost of losing local fundraising.  People cannot be as active on the fundraising side at local level.  That is one piece, and the loss of commercial sponsorship for local tournaments is another piece.  Many clubs and smaller NGBs in the winter sports are facing those challenges coming down the tracks.  The funding that is being provided - the &euro;15 million for the clubs or the &euro;10 million for the smaller NGBs - will be pivotal in getting them through such challenges.  We are very much aware of what those challenges are.  I suppose the longer this goes on, the greater the challenges will be.  It will go into 2021.  If it goes late into 2021, more resources will be required.  That is just a fact of life.  I will ask Mr. McDermott to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-09-18a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McDermott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CRS2020091800002#BBB00400"><p>A number of speakers have raised the issue of swimming pools.  Notwithstanding the popularity of outdoor swimming at locations around the country like the Forty Foot in Dublin, swimming pools are ultimately where people swim and take their exercise.  Facilitating access to a pool is complex because it is an indoor facility.  Swimming pools are expensive to run, etc.  There is a concern around swimming.  We are working closely with Ireland Active and Swim Ireland, as Mr. Peter Hogan mentioned earlier on.</p><p>I refer to sports like basketball, which is an important winter sport in Ireland and is very popular and widely played.  We were heartened when Bernard O'Byrne, the CEO of Basketball Ireland, recently said that the clubs have been very creative in accessing venues if certain venues were closed to them.  We understand that it is very challenging for them and we are committed to working with Basketball Ireland.  The indoor season over the winter is going to be difficult for certain sports.  We dealt with a range of challenges over the summer.  Mr. Treacy has mentioned some of the things that sports clubs and governing bodies have faced such as loss of income from events and various memberships and affiliations.  We are overcoming that and will work very closely with all partners referenced earlier to deal with the different challenges that are going to arise over the winter.  Some of them are not completely in our control because of the nature of the virus and this health crisis.  We are absolutely committed to working with the governing bodies and clubs to address their particular issues.</p></speech>

We probably also need to look at some purpose-built sports facilities where we would have the likes of indoor soccer.  While I accept that generally team sports were sorted, I refer to <i>ad hoc</i>type training scenarios taking place in these huge multipurpose facilities offering multiple slots for multiple teams.  In those scenarios, everybody would be particularly distanced and removed from each other and all the rest of it but they probably fell between stools in respect of rules and so on.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  An awful lot of people who engage in sport are not necessarily doing so in set teams.  It is the case of the couple of fellows who meet up on a Monday and a Thursday.  They all think they are Lionel Messi, but they are not.  Such a person could be sitting in this room at the minute, thinking he has a twisted ankle.  That is myself I am talking about.</p></speech>

What has been set up within sport is second to none.  The expert group, which is chaired by Mr. Hogan, provides a mechanism in that the inquires coming through Sport Ireland are fed into the expert group and, through Mr. Hogan, any inquiries that we or the expert group cannot answer are fed into the Department of Health for guidance.  That mechanism has worked extremely well.  I want to pay tribute to the Department and Mr. Hogan for putting it in place.  Sport Ireland is there to help them through that as well, if required.  The process has worked extremely well in recent months and the sports have found it extremely helpful.</p></speech>

I commend Sport Ireland, the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and all the clubs on all the work that has been done during the pandemic and now.  We all accept that the watching and particularly the playing of sport are really useful for connectivity in the community and from a mental health point of view.  The only two requests I have is that if a consideration could be made that we could have social distancing in boxing because I think I could make a return if there was a 2 m distance between me and my opponent.  Unfortunately Deputy Fitzpatrick has gone but if Mr. John Treacy was able to give me a training programme that would mean I could beat him when eventually we get back to 5 km and 10 km races in Dundalk, I would be very happy with that.</p></speech>

I have one question for Mr. Treacy, who competed as an elite athlete.

Athletes hate uncertainty.  They are very good planners.  Generally, athletes plan on a ten-month cycle.  Swimmers might be a bit different but, generally, it is that type of cycle.  There is a rest period and then they have their foundation period.  It is all geared towards a peak on a given day.  If a person is preparing in 2019 for 2020 and half way through that cycle and the Olympic Games are pulled, it leaves a big void in one's life.  One is all the time thinking about this date in July or August 2020 and now that date is gone.  One is lost.  One then looks to the next competition but the summer is uncertain also because competitions were not happening.  It is a time of great uncertainty for the athletes.  They always have a focus and that focus was gone for a long period.  The 8 July was a very important date because it enabled those athletes to get back to training.  They could get away from training on their own and back into an environment where they were around people of a similar mindset and ilk.  They could start planning again.  They were around the experts, whether they be coaches, high performance directors or whoever, who provide that guidance to them in terms of getting them to focus again.</p> <p>  Athletes are resilient.  Sanita Puspure said it very well.  When the date was set for 2021, the focus went on that date straight away.  That is the date all athletes are now working towards and that is what they need.  They need that date.  All the performance directors and coaches will be working hard to get the athlete to peak on that day.  They have a focus again and that is very important.  If they are back in an environment where they are with their coaches and training at a very high level for the winter months they will be fine but in terms of springtime, getting back into early competitions is vital because those competitions are very important if the athletes are to reach their peak in July.  That is part of that session.  It is about getting oneself in peak condition and putting oneself through the rigours of competition.  There is nothing like competition to get one ready for the big day.  There is a period of uncertainty but at least they have a date now.  The news out of Tokyo a couple of weeks ago from the Olympic movement was very encouraging.  The Japanese are keen to progress with this.  It might look like a different Olympic Games but it is proceeding.  The athletes need that certainty but they are resilient, and they are fantastic people to be around.</p> <p>  The teams are back in action.  Coming into 2020, we had three teams in equestrian sport that had qualified.  The women's hockey team had qualified.  We had won a total of 80 medals internationally and we were going into the games in very good shape.  This has been a major setback for us but we are putting our faith in the athletes.  The athletes have the services, through the Sport Ireland Institute, that they require.  The system is in place to support them.  Everyone is available to support them but it is an uncertain time for an elite athlete who is preparing.  Athletes are very conscious of their health and well-being.  They are cautious people also and that extra danger in the environment is probably something that is very much on their minds and which they want to avoid at all costs so they would be very cautious in terms of their approach.  The issue is more serious if it is a contact sport but if one is in an individual sport, at least one can train with people and not have that social contact.  It is a time of great uncertainty for every Irish athlete who is preparing for 2021.</p></speech>
