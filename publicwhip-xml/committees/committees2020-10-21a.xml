No clear guidance can be given on the extent to which evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Lord Kinnoull to make his opening statement.  It is good to see him again.  We look forward to our conversation this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Kinnoull" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#B00300"><p>May I say how honoured we are to join the committee's meeting this morning.  Our respective committees have enjoyed a strong working relationship in recent years.  Today's virtual meeting is a welcome opportunity to continue that dialogue.  To scrutinise the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and Ireland has been one of my committee's overriding priorities.  In December 2016 we published our first report after the Brexit vote on Brexit UK-Ireland relations.  That was the first of what is now 74 reports in our canon.  We conducted a number of visits to Belfast, Dublin and the Border region.</p> <p>  Following our analysis of the original backstop in December 2018, we published detailed reports on the revised withdrawal agreement and protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland in January and June 2020. </p> <p>  After last week&rsquo;s European Council, the Prime Minister said that the UK "should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia&rsquo;s based on simple principles of global free trade".  The committee, however, has consistently held that it is greatly in the interests of all concerned that a mutually advantageous free trade agreement is concluded.  Therefore our hope is that both the UK and the EU will be willing to make the necessary compromises to ensure that negotiations reach a successful conclusion.</p> <p>  On 16 October, my committee published a report on Part 5 of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill ahead of its Second Reading in the House of Lords on 19 October.  The report concluded that the UK Government has not disclosed any evidence that the EU has acted in bad faith, and has not explained why it chose not to use the withdrawal agreement&rsquo;s safeguard, arbitration and dispute resolution procedures, or why it chose instead to take pre-emptive and unilateral action through the Bill.  In the absence of these explanations, the committee expressed the hope that the Government would undertake to remove Part 5 while seeking to reach an agreement with the EU both on the future UK-EU relationship and on the implementation of the protocol.</p> <p>  At the same time, the report acknowledged the UK Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement and its legitimate concern that a rigid interpretation of the protocol, by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, could undermine it.  Yet the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement is itself made up of three interlocking strands: supporting North-South, east-west and internal Northern Ireland relationships.  The challenge before the withdrawal agreement joint committee, which met earlier this week, is to come up with solutions on implementation of the protocol that maintain this delicate equilibrium.</p> <p>  More than ever, it is incumbent on all parties, including the UK Government, the EU, the Irish Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive, to work in a common endeavour to prioritise and address urgently the interests, stability and prosperity of the people and communities of Northern Ireland.  As we concluded in our first report, anything less would diminish the efforts of all those who have worked so hard for peace and good relations across these islands.</p> <p>  We look forward to discussing these issues with the committee this morning.</p></speech>

Has the committee received any response from the British Government as to why that is?</p> <p>  Moving to the general work of the House of Lords, for those of us who are not as familiar with the system, what was the impact of the regret motion which was passed by the Lords yesterday on the status of this Bill?  When is the Bill due to be processed through the House of Lords to go back to the Commons?</p> <p>  On the wider issue of Brexit, as we meet here, Michel Barnier has again addressed the European Parliament and has and has answered the proposal that the European Union continues to be open to intensified talks and to seeking additional compromises if necessary.  In our guests' opinions or in that of their committee, is there an opportunity for us to get back to the negotiation table this week, as I think it behoves both sides to do, as soon as possible?</p><p>Thank you.

If Lord Kinnoull can respond directly to Deputy Richmond we will ensure we are switched to mute and Deputy Howlin can come in after that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Kinnoull" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#C00700"><p>Thank you.  I thank Deputy Richmond for those questions.  I will make a brief factual response and then hand over to my colleagues.  I should just say that as a committee we are balanced both politically and in our views on Brexit.  The delegation before the committee today is also balanced in the same way.  I will ask my colleagues when they speak for the first time to say which party they come from.  I am non-affiliated.  I came from the crossbench beforehand so I do not have a party.</p> <p>  The first part of Deputy Richmond's question was whether we had a response to our letter with nine questions of 18 September.  The answer to that is we have not had a response yet.  That is very rare and unusual because the Cabinet Office, in particular, is normally pretty good at responding.  I suppose they are very difficult questions to answer.  When we do have an answer I can assure the Deputy it will be made public immediately on our website.</p> <p>  Second, I will set out the factual background of the timings of the Bill.  We have had the Second Reading and the regret motion, which I will ask my colleagues to comment on, but the amending Stages of the Bill are set down for seven days.  We will have Committee and Report Stages and those seven days begin next Monday, 26 October, and finish on 23 November.  I would expect the voting to happen in the latter part of those seven days on Report Stage.  I think more than seven days will be required but there are a few extra days available within that timetable whereby we might see the process still end on 23 November.</p><p>In common, no doubt, with Ireland's procedure, at any time the Government could choose in amending Stages to bring forward government amendments to remove Part 5 of the Bill.  I have no doubt that would form part of a package that represents a future relationship deal, so procedurally it would be very simple for them to excise Part 5 of the Bill, which is being seen as so difficult with the withdrawal agreement.</p><p> That said, I will hand over to my colleagues.  Perhaps I will start by asking Lord Wood to take up the running.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Wood" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#D00200"><p>I am very pleased to be with the Deputies and Senators.  My name is Stuart Wood and I am a Labour member of the House of Lords and a former adviser on Northern Ireland to former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  I have an interest in the topic from that perspective.</p> <p>  I have a political thought, possibly with my Labour hat on, and other colleagues will have different views.  Yesterday's motion does not have much legislative force.  However, it has much political force and it was the biggest British Government defeat since the reform of the House of Lords in 1999, when almost all hereditary peers were taken out of the House of Lords.  Some leading Conservative Brexiteers supported the amendments, along with a large number - over 100 - non-affiliated peers.  This is important as if the vote were to be seen as about Brexit, it would have limited force.  The size of the vote suggests there is a general consensus that this is about the rule of law rather than Brexit itself, and this has a political force.</p> <p>  As Lord Kinnoull has said, the next issue is whether, over the next few weeks, the negotiations give the British Government space and justification to introduce its own amendments to the Bill.  It is very difficult to see how the Bill can proceed unamended, whatever one's political viewpoint.  That really is the political nexus for the next three or four weeks.</p></speech>

I should say that I am a cross-bencher, an Independent and a former diplomat.  It is clear the British Government cannot get Part 5 of the Bill through.  It is not clear at what point it will lose if it maintains the clauses.  Lord Kinnoull has correctly said we normally vote on Report Stage but it is conceivable we will decide to vote on Committee Stage.  A number of the Independents like me were arguing that the effort to restore the national reputation required us to remove these articles or clauses from the Bill at the earliest opportunity.  It is conceivable we might vote on Committee Stage but as far as I know there is no clear plan to do that yet.</p> <p>  Lord Wood is absolutely right in that these clauses cannot survive because of the rule of law aspect rather than Brexit.  The majority in favour of the regret motion would have been much smaller if the matter had just been about Brexit.  It is, however, about the rule of law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Couttie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#D00600"><p>I am Philippa Couttie and I am from the Conservative Party.  One of the difficulties we face as a committee and in the House of Lords is the lack of evidence we have received to back up the Government's claim that the EU is acting in bad faith.  If it was, it would mean the Internal Market Bill and its clauses did not break international law.  Although one of our ministers stood up and said it did, we have also had Lord Keen and a minister, Mr. Michael Gove, alluding to the fact that they believed the EU is acting in bad faith.  Nobody in the Conservative Party, the House of Lords or the British Parliament as a whole would want to break international law so there is a difference of opinion on where one comes down in the circumstances of not having evidence.</p> <p>  The question was asked about dispute resolution and why the British Government did not choose to use that mechanism, as opposed to Part 5.  Again, there is no evidence, which makes the process very difficult.  Informally, I have been told the concern was that if the joint committee classified all agricultural goods and food products moving from the UK to Northern Ireland as being at risk, this would cause such an impact on the Northern Ireland economy - and, possibly, the peace in Northern Ireland given the unionist desire to remain intact as part of the UK - it would have a serious detrimental impact on the UK as a whole in the short term.  The time required to go through the disputes mechanisms would therefore be too long to save us from some of that impact.  That is why Part 5 became important.</p> <p>  As I said, my committee has not seen evidence for that and it is very hard to comment further than that.  I thought I would nonetheless put it in the pot.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the Liberal Democrats have been a pro-European and anti-Brexit party but I endorse the comments of my colleagues that this is no longer an issue about Brexit but it is about rule of law and the reputation of the UK.  Speaking personally, there is absolutely no doubt about the breach of international law.  I note even that Lord Keen subsequently resigned from that position.  We take it extremely seriously and I share the view of the majority of my colleagues, which is that in its current form, this Bill will not go through the House of Lords.  We hope the Government will see that sooner rather than later and will remove the relevant part.</p></speech>

In response to Lord Wood, we too are a very balanced committee, politically speaking, as all political parties are represented.  We are also all balanced in our views on Brexit, in that across the political spectrum we are all opposed to it.  That is representative of the view of Ireland.</p> <p>  We have been grappling with understanding Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill and the committee's report is extraordinarily helpful, giving us insight, along with speeches of members of the House of Lords.  Arising from the discussions with the minister, Mr. Michael Gove, does the committee have a view on why such a proposal as Part 5 in the Bill was tabled at this time?  The minister, Mr. Gove, has asserted it does not breach the Northern Ireland protocol but the committee seems to conclude in its report that it does.  It seems, even from a technical perspective, a matter of concern that it would be introduced at a time when trade talks are at such a delicate and final phase.  If there was an absolute necessity for such a proposal, it might seem appropriate for such a proposal to come when talks collapsed, if that were to happen.</p> <p>  The comments from members on the timelines of the Bill have been very helpful.</p><p>I realise I am asking the witnesses to look into a crystal ball in a way, but knowing the views of members of the House of Lords and those who have spoken, what do they think will be the ultimate fate of this legislative measure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Kinnoull" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#E00200"><p>They are two very interesting questions.  What we will do now, so we can get to answer as many questions as possible, is have a couple of us respond to each question, if that is all right.  What I will observe before handing over to Lord Wood is that we put a great deal into our letter of 18 September in terms of trying to get at the Government's reason for Part 5 of the Bill.  Until we have the answer to that, we are not a lot further forward in truly understanding it because there are many conflicting statements from various members of the Government at various times.  Personally, I do not have a settled view of that, but Lord Wood might.</p></speech>

I have a political guess about why this is inserted.  As usual with Brexit issues, one must try to understand the dynamics within the Conservative Party, which are very complex.  The Governments of both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have had very serious difficulty in getting any type of Brexit deal or any type of movement on the Brexit negotiating position past the more hardline Brexiteers in the party.  That remains an issue for Boris Johnson's Government.  My view is that Part 5 was included in this Bill as a reassurance in the event that compromises would have to be made to get a Brexit deal across the line during the transition.  Essentially, it was signalling: "Do not worry if you do not like things that we may have to agree because ultimately there will be a legislative provision which enables us to override things you do not like."  It is exactly the same tactic that was tried to get the original Brexit withdrawal agreement through last year.  That is my reading of why this was inserted.  It is a type of insurance policy, a signal to the Conservative Party backbenches in the House of Commons.  However, that is pure conjecture on my part.</p></speech>

I take a different point of view.  What I suspect happened is that the negotiations between the two sides got quite fraught and someone in the negotiations made some comment about the ability to behave vexatiously and use the joint committee to block goods flowing from Great Britain into Northern Ireland as a negotiating threat.  The British Government's response to that was Part 5.  It views it as a safety net.  I, too, would like to see it removed after the negotiations have reached a point where we all can sign up to them and agree on a sensible way forward as far as Northern Ireland is concerned.  I very much see this as a safety net and not a negotiating tactic within the Conservative Party at all.  It is much more EU focused than internally focused.</p></speech>

They are giving quite comprehensive answers.  I welcome the fact that they are here.  I should put it on the record that on some level I would prefer that legislation that has an impact on any part of Ireland would not be carried out in Westminster, but we are where we are.  People are giving their views on the basis that the questions have not been answered yet by the British Government, but the two views given on Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill are that either it is part of an internal negotiation within the Conservative Party or it is a matter of putting pressure on in negotiations with the European Union.  There is a view here, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a number of others have voiced it, that the European Union, even as a marketplace, is too important for Britain.  I could be wrong, but I understand that 45% of Britain's exports go to the European Union.  On that basis, this is seen, to some degree, as a negotiating gambit.</p> <p>  I come from Dundalk, which is on the Border, and obviously we have worries about businesses and the impact.  We would also worry if there was any possibility of circumventing the Irish protocol, if one believes some of the statements by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or even David Frost, depending on what day of the week it is.  We are very worried about there being contingencies.  It is utterly unacceptable to impact on the lives of people in the Border area or that there would be any possibility of a return of a hard border.  I wish to put that on the record.</p> <p>  In fairness, what a number of people have said here is that the major difficulty they have with Part 5 is the rule of law.  If that is the means by which it falls, so be it.  I am asking the witnesses for their view on where we go from here.  I am seeking some type of assurance insofar as they can give it.  They can give the general mood music between the House of Lords and the House of Commons regarding the chance of this legislative measure going through.  If it did in any way, shape or form, it would be utterly unacceptable.  The big question is whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and others are correct, that a deal with the European Union is an absolute necessity and whatever Boris Johnson says about an Australia-type deal is just bluster at this point, if anybody is willing to go down that line.</p></speech>

It is problematic for the Government because if it is forced to use the Parliament Acts, which is the formal process where the House of Commons trumps the House of Lords, that process takes 12 months.  It would mean that the Bill would not be able to come into play immediately on leaving the EU.  That is another relevant fact for the committee's deliberations.</p> <p>  I will ask Lord Kerr to take up the running on this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Kerr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#E00900"><p>I do not know why the government came forward with Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill.  There is another theory that it was simply to shake up the negotiation, to move fast on things and see if the deadlock in the future relationship negotiations could be cracked that way.  If so, I personally believe it was a grave error.  The degree of mistrust it created makes it more difficult to secure an agreement on level playing field enforcement and governance, which appear to be two of the three outstanding areas of difficulty in the negotiation.</p> <p>  I agree with what has been said about the desirability of securing a free trade agreement, and ideally a free trade agreement plus.  The difficulties of implementing the Irish and Northern Ireland protocol would become much greater in the event that there was a tariff war between the United Kingdom and the EU.  It is clear that many of the problems, such as the goods-at-risk problem, get much easier or disappear in the event that there is a deal.  If the deal includes level playing field provisions, that removes another of the likely difficulties in implementing the protocol.  Speaking personally, I believe it is very important that the protocol should be implemented in full.  As the Chairman said, we all must hope for sensible compromises on its implementation.</p><p>As to why we need a free trade agreement, it is not just in order to make the problem on which we are focusing this morning easier.  The whole relationship between the UK and the EU is likely to go through a bad patch if there is no deal and no agreement.  It is likely to become a bit rebarbative.  Without a foundation to build on, and in order to build up other agreements, we will take a while to rebuild the relationship.  This is particularly important with regard to matters like the Border and co-operation between law enforcement agencies.  I was struck by the difficulty law enforcement will have if the UK no longer has access to the Schengen information service, the European arrest warrant and so on.  It seems to me that it is not just about free trade but if there is no core of a free trade agreement, it will be very difficult to add on things like a security agreement.  </p></speech>

Having worked in a number of countries around the world, particularly in Africa, where despite the UK's reputation being somewhat mixed in some respects, our reputation for upholding the rule of law has been very high, my huge concern is that this could cause a problem.  It is not just about Part 5.  If we feel we can act like this, the whole question about trust and how we act in different areas arises.  Clearly, trust has been undermined.  I share the view of Lord Kerr that this is probably about brinkmanship and an attempt to force the negotiations.  I am not sure if it is effective but time will tell.</p> <p>  As to the seriousness of the UK Government's position regarding an Australia-type deal as it calls it, that is, it means no deal at all, Michael Gove told us that it would be content with that.  What is clear is that our industry, be it manufacturing, services, farming or a new and significant aspect of our economy, would not be content with it.  I think it would be catastrophic.  We are not Australia.  We are not 10,500 miles from the EU and, as we know, geographic proximity is critical in trade flows.  I hope and pray that it is not the UK Government's genuine view that an Australia-type no-deal outcome would be acceptable.  I still have hope that in the remaining weeks, minds will be concentrated and there will be shifts on both sides because this is mutually beneficial to all of us.  I certainly do not think it has been helped by Part 5 of this Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#F00400"><p>I thank Lord Kinnoull and the rest of the members of the committee.  We really appreciate the engagement this morning.  My colleagues have touched on some of the key issues.  The select committee's report is excellent and succinct and covers all aspects.  The committee has touched on all the questions we have been asking.  We would agree with the committee that the tensions, as the speakers from the committee have outlined, in the withdrawal agreement were known fully to both sides when it was signed up to so nobody went into that agreement with his or her eyes closed.  Perhaps that is why it is such a surprise that this particular difficulty has arisen given that the agreement was only agreed less than a year ago.</p> <p>  Given there is no evidence of the EU acting in bad faith, and I agree there is no evidence of that and I do not believe the EU has acted in bad faith in these negotiations, and the fact that the dispute resolution mechanism within the withdrawal agreement was not utilised, one would have to ask what the real purpose or intent behind the Internal Market Bill was.  Perhaps it was a negotiating strategy or, as one of members of the select committee said, it was to reinvigorate and kick start the negotiating process.  Perhaps it was trying to be a bit too clever.  I really do not know but, unfortunately, the outcome has left a bad taste in the mouths of those involved in the negotiations.  The fact that this could happen has definitely bred much mistrust across the board.  From an Irish perspective, it is important that a significant amount of blame is not being heaped on all Members of Parliament or the country.  There is an appreciation that these are difficult negotiations, that it probably is a negotiating strategy and that the intention was not to harm Ireland, the North or the peace process.  I do not think that was the intention behind it even though that has been suggested.  </p> <p>  I have two more specific questions.  The first is around state aid and the level playing field provisions.  I am curious about the thoughts of Lord Kinnoull and the other members of the committee.  Is there an appreciation of why this is so important?  Is there an appreciation at Government level and in the UK Parliament as to why this is so important from an EU perspective?  If there is going to be access to the market, similar rules must apply to all those in the market.  Is that appreciated?  Is it genuinely the view of the UK Government, and I know not everybody can comment on this, that it is an unreasonable request from the EU, that is, that if one wants free access to the market, one must apply the same rules and that level playing field provisions are there to safeguard matters and ensure that UK companies cannot get an unfair advantage over EU companies?  Does Lord Kinnoull think this is understood?  </p> <p>  We will get to a point where the Brexit process concludes.  I hope sincerely that we have a free trade agreement - certainly by the end of the year - and can move past this.  I would be interested in hearing the thoughts of the committee on what kind of mechanism it believes we should put in place for future engagement between Ireland and the UK because that is really important.  From my perspective, and I am sure the view is shared across the board, the UK is a very close friend of Ireland.  We want that relationship to be maintained.  We want a very close and special working relationship with the UK beyond Brexit.  The mechanisms that have been there between the two countries for the past 45 years have been at EU level.  We have engaged weekly and monthly through the institutions and the European Parliament and we will no longer have that, so what does the committee think both countries should do to ensure that really close co-operation and working relationship post-Brexit when we put all this behind us and start working together?</p></speech>

I will make a few points before handing over to Baroness Couttie.  The first is that we wrote a report entitled Beyond Brexit, which covers some of those areas.  I am incredibly tempted to talk to the joint committee for ages about what we think we should do but I will let my colleagues do that.</p> <p>  I refer the joint committee back to some of the evidence we took from Lord Frost in the past in terms of state aid.  Essentially, what the UK has been suggesting are presidential provisions that have been contained in other treaties - both EU treaties with third countries and third country-third country treaties - because the state aid issue comes up in every single free trade agreement between different countries.  Others will want to talk at greater length about that.  I will hand over to Baroness Couttie.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Baroness Couttie" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#F00600"><p>I will touch on the question asked about whether we are serious about an Australia-type deal, as it has been dubbed.  The whole of the Conservative Party would want to have a proper free trade agreement with the EU but I do not think that this extends to "at any cost" among a significant number of people within the party.  Therefore, when Boris Johnson says he is prepared to leave on Australia-style deal terms, which are pretty much the same as WTO terms, I think he is serious about that.</p> <p>  Building on what Lord Kinnoull said about state aid, again, the rationale behind pushing back on what the EU requires on state aid is not just because there are provisions that are used more normally in trade agreements between different countries, which we would be happy to adhere to.  It is also about the sovereignty of the UK.</p><p>We are coming out of the EU and wish to be an independent nation state and set our own rules.  We do not wish to have legacy arrangements with the EU whereby we are left following rules over which we have no control, although we are prepared to sign up to standard trade agreement-type rules which cover the same issues.  That is where the block is.</p><p> I entirely agree with the Senator that peace in Northern Ireland is of paramount importance.  That is a generally held view across the whole of Ireland and the UK.  I do not think there was any intention to undermine that in Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill, although some people have stated that that is its effect.  I will not go into detail regarding why I do not think it will do so in practical reality, but I can understand that people are concerned in that regard.  I touched on the reason for the Part being included in the first place in my earlier contribution.  If what we are being told is true - I suspect it was a verbal comment and we have not seen evidence of it - there was a sudden realisation that the way the protocol was worded in terms of the joint committee could be used in a way that would be vexatious and cause enormous difficulties for the Northern Ireland economy and, although I hesitate to say it, the peace process as well.  If a comment was made that the EU was serious about designating all products that came from the UK to Northern Ireland as being at risk, then the UK believed it needed to do something strong to fight back, probably partly as a negotiating tactic, but also to show that we were not going to be pushed around and agree to things to which we would not otherwise agree in order to avoid that possibility.  As I stated, I hope it will eventually come out when some form of agreement is reached.</p><p>  On the issue of liaison between Ireland and the UK, I sincerely hope that we continue to have a productive dialogue.  It is useful for both countries.  I hope some sort of committee, such as this one, will continue and that we will have regular contact with it.  I refer to the report we produced and to which the Senator referred.</p></speech>

She told the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, during the committee meeting on 7 October that on seeing Part 5 of the Internal Markets Bill she was gobsmacked.  That is exactly right.  One could say the House of Lords was gobsmacked too.  I think I speak for the committee on that.  Speaking personally, I strongly agree with Baroness Couttie that nobody intends to damage the Belfast treaty and the Good Friday Agreement and that nobody wishes to see the return of a hard border and all the problems that would create.  I am sure she is right about that.<br/><br/>On the Senator's question regarding a level playing field, I am puzzled because I do not understand why the British Government stepped back from the political declaration it signed on 19 October 2019, the same day this agreement was reached.  The language about geographical proximity and economic interdependence requiring a level playing field seems to me to be very reasonable language.  More important, we signed up to it.  I think the European Union overbid by suggesting that the level playing field had to be policed by EU institutions.  That raises sovereignty issues, as Baroness Couttie stated.  It is clear where the landing zone is for an agreement on this issue.  It is clear that Mr. Barnier has stepped back from insisting that the European Union should be the judge and jury and that he is looking for the British Government to commit itself to agreed principles and to an independent authority, future transparency and to a disputes settlement procedure.  That seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable landing zone and I do not understand why the British Government is still finding difficulty with it.  As a former negotiator, I have <i>d'information professionnelle</i>and I believe these problems should be relatively easy to settle.  I think I know how the issue could be solved.  As Lord Wood stated at the outset, the problem is that there are some members of the Conservative Party who would may find any concession on sovereignty grounds offensive, even a level-playing field solution where the involvement of the EU is limited to agreement now on principles and the ability to use a disputes settlement procedure.  The Prime Minister must decide between doing what British business undoubtedly wants him to do and doing what a group within his party wants him to do.</p></speech>

I note that the Chairman is a distinguished co-chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which seems to be an excellent thing.  What I think we are strongly agreeing is that building out the relationship is important.  I am reminded that we stated that not only in our Beyond Brexit report, we also stated it in our first report on UK-Irish relations, published in December 2016.  We are absolutely in agreement with that principle.</p></speech>

I know its members have visited Dublin on several occasions.  Its work is really appreciated.</p> <p>  On the last point made by Senator Chambers, in the current programme for Government agreed between the three coalition parties that make up the current Government here in the Republic there are several commitments to developing the future relationship between the UK and Ireland.  For example, it commits to undertaking a strategic review of the British-Irish relationship in 2020-21.  Significantly, there is also a commitment to develop structures for regular meetings at Heads of Government, ministerial and senior official levels to take forward agreed programmes of work on matters of practical co-operation.  We will lose the ministerial contact between the UK and the Republic of Ireland through the format of the European Union, so it is very important that we put these new structures in place.  There is a commitment by the Government to put new structures in place and to build on the existing structures to which the witnesses have referred.</p> <p>  Is the legal action initiated by the European Commission a factor in all of this?  Obviously, the UK is still subject to EU law up to 31 December.  Is that legal action an issue in the deliberations of the House of Lords committee?</p> <p>  All of those present have referred to the hope for a free trade agreement, but what are the prospects for such an agreement?  At the end of the day, do the witnesses believe we will have a free trade agreement?</p> <p>  I refer to the fisheries issue.  Senator Chambers dealt with the level playing field.  I note what happened at the European Council meeting, where President Macron of France led the way on the fisheries issue and Ireland joined in on the issue.  Is the fisheries issue of practical significance to the UK or is it just a symbolic issue?</p><p>I would be interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on that.</p></speech>

I could pretend to be a fisheries expert but I am not.  The Deputy is right that the contribution of fisheries to the gross domestic product is very small.  The significance of this is partly the historic relationship between the fishing industry and disputes within the EU but it has also become symbolic of regaining sovereignty for a significant part, not just of the Conservative Party, but in public opinion, and that is really one of the issues here.</p> <p>  On free trade agreement prospects, my personal view is that there probably will be, it will be quite thin and will probably satisfy not many people.  I suspect still that a deal is going to be done but at what pace and coverage I am sceptical.  </p> <p>  In terms of the first question on whether the EU proceedings against the UK are a factor, I do not think it is a factor in terms of affecting the political process domestically.  As a moral challenge and an embarrassment, it is atmospherically a big factor.  The timescale on which that would proceed I do not think will have a material bearing in terms of the process affecting the domestic legislative process.  Definitely it has a clouding effect for those people who think that we should not be in bad standing with our allies and friends.</p></speech>

Obviously as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, said in evidence to the committee before, in the post-Brexit environment British and Irish Ministers will not meet in that way so we need to make a special effort.  I noted that he talked about having an intergovernmental conference between the two Governments at least once annually and perhaps twice. That suggestion might be something to pursue and I would certainly be very much in favour of that. </p></speech>

If there is no free trade agreement, do the witnesses think that these issues will not go away?  These various matters will still have to be resolved in some form or other.  There is going to be a hit on the economy of the Republic.  There is going to be a hit on the UK economy and that has been demonstrated by various reports.  There are going to be queues at the port of Dover and so on.  Is it not the case that if there is no free trade agreement Brexit is still not going to go away because the issues that arise from Brexit will still have to be dealt with?  We are just going to have to do that and, hopefully, sooner rather than later.  What do the witnesses think about the matter?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.58" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Kerr" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#H00900"><p>Yes, I agree with Deputy Haughey.  Speaking personally, I think that the Government's view that it would be easy to replace our close trading relationship with our neighbours with new relationships with Asia, the United States and Australasia is a bit of a mirage.  There is an inexorable rule of trade, particularly with traded goods, that distance matters.  I do think we are likely to find, if we end up causing difficulties in Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic, that there will be additional difficulties in securing closer free trade arrangements with, for example, the United States.  If there is no free trade agreement and that, in consequence, complicates the problems of working out the details of the implementation of the protocol, I think that we would go through a rather bad patch that might be quite protracted.  So, I very much agree with the Deputy but then I used to be a diplomat so I believe that agreement is, on the whole, a good thing and should be honoured.</p></speech>

If we get no deal or, indeed, a thin deal, as Lord Wood mentioned, there will be areas where it will simply be mutually beneficial between the EU and UK to sort things out and have further agreements, and further discussions.  The transition if we get no deal or a very thin deal will be bumpy.  Therefore, there will be an incentive to push ahead and get things agreed.  I only hope that it does not take so long and is not so high profile as these negotiations have, inevitably, been.  It is not just about negotiating with the other side to get the best deal.  It is done in a very public forum with everybody criticising and there is the audience of the general public both in the EU and UK, which have to be satisfied, as well as the actual negotiations themselves and the politicians.  That, in many ways, makes it harder to get to a deal.  I would hope that if we do end up with a thin deal or a no deal that we can quietly get on and just sort out some of the issues that may not have been resolved in time.</p></speech>

I am very interested to refer to the point made originally by Senator Chambers about what we should be doing to build out our relationship in the next period.  Looking beyond Brexit is now a real focus of our committee and I wonder what thoughts that Deputies and Senators have had about what we should be doing jointly and together.</p></speech>

Let us consider the institutions of the agreement be it the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, particularly the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.  I have written about this issue a few times and there is a very strong case to be made for the following.</p><p>The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference should mirror the European Council's schedule of meetings so that if, for example, there is a DG AGRI meeting on the third week of May every year, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference could bring the British and Irish agriculture ministers together at that time.  Equally, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly will have a much more important role going forward and must be taken far more seriously by everyone in the context of legislation and co-operation.  It will be very difficult in these remote times but there is no time like the present in terms of beginning the necessary preparatory work.  Of course, as Deputy Calleary said, the basis for a good relationship going forward is making sure that the withdrawal agreement is respected and the protocol is completely implemented as per the agreement.</p></speech>

Both sides have given a shallow interpretation or a broad idea of what we could do next, but we must really think about this because whatever structures we put in place, we want them to last for a long time.  It would be worthwhile for both countries to have a proper engagement on what we think the future relationship between our two countries will look like and how we can work well together.  That said, it is a very positive starting point that both countries are saying that this is really important to us, that we want to do this and that we want a good relationship post Brexit.  We want to have constant connectivity and dialogue between both Governments and Parliaments, which is a really positive starting point.</p> <p>  One of the consistent comments from this country throughout the Brexit process is how utterly saddened we are by the fact that Britain is leaving the EU, and I do not think that is ever going to go away.  We are losing such a close friend and influential partner at the EU table.  Britain was one of the members that helped to establish the European Union and underpinned so many of its fundamental values and freedoms that we enjoy today.  Britain leaving is a huge loss and I hope that the door is always open, although that is not a conversation for now.  Indeed, I do not think the UK wants to enter into that conversation now but I hope that the door is always open.  We live in hope that some time in the future, further down the road, the relationship will become even closer again.  Who knows what might happen?  Future relationship structures are really important for both countries and the work should start immediately on putting them together and finding something that works for both countries.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a practical, day-to-day issue around the transit of goods through the UK, from Dover to Calais, from 1 January 2021.  In terms of minimising the impact on this country, we would appreciate it if every effort could be made to ensure that there are not massive queues in Dover and that our trucks can get through.  That is one practical starting point in terms of helping us from 1 January.  Baroness Couttie made reference to a so-called thin future trading agreement, which is something we would be fearful of too.  We do not want to see something cobbled together at the eleventh hour that is weak and not comprehensive enough to minimise disruption.  I hope we can avoid that.  I agree with her that if issues are not concluded by the end of the year, every effort should be made to tidy up any loose ends as soon as possible thereafter.  That would be in the interests of both countries.  We are under no illusions at this point and accept that not everything will be completed to a gold-plated standard by the end of the year.  That is just not possible at this point.  I thank the witnesses very much for their engagement.</p></speech>

We really must think of a new paradigm of Irish-British relations, and that is a big job of work, but my concern now is the immediacy of the sundering of relations on 1 January next.  Historically, we have had patches of poor relations but we have spent more than 20 years building the closest of relationships between our two countries.  We must think about mitigating the harm of the next few months.  Senator Chambers spoke about one aspect of that, namely, that 40% of our exports to the Continent transit through the UK and if there is a very significant disruption of that, it would compound our difficulties.  If there is a fractious break, it will sour relations and people will start blaming other people.  Fingers will be pointed and accusations made that one side did not give enough or that the other side was too intransigent and <i>vice versa</i>.  Not only do we have to think about our relationship in the medium to longer term, we must also focus on mitigating the significant harm that can be done in the short term.</p></speech>

I just want to follow up on something that was said by Senator Chambers and Deputy Howlin.  It is really remiss of us at this late stage not to have planned what our interactions, as states and really important neighbours, are going to look like.  We have had a really easy relationship at European Council meetings.  Some of us here have had the privilege of attending same in recent years.  I can only speak from experience but when I was new to the European Council, the first person I went to was my British counterpart, even though I had never met her, because I felt and thought, given the easy relationship between our countries, that she would be friendly and nice to me, and of course she was.  We are going to miss that hugely.  We will have no formal interaction other than through the British-Irish Parliamentary Association.  We do have the North-South Ministerial Council, but with so many decisions being made at Westminster about what happens in the North, we should have formal engagements.</p> <p>  Deputy Howlin is right about the concerns if things do not go well, although I really hope they do.  I am really impressed by the pragmatism of everyone who has spoken this morning in terms of what we expect in the coming weeks, but if things do not go well, on 1 January we are going to find ourselves in a "he said, she said" scenario and none of us wants to be the one who gets the blame.  That is not the ideal environment for what has been a hugely fruitful, enjoyable and harmonious relationship for the most part for as long as we have been neighbours.  Somebody should be thinking about that now and starting that process rather than waiting until we find ourselves with a thin Brexit, no deal, an Australia-style deal or whatever.  That is not the best environment for us to continue our enjoyable, fruitful, partner-based relationship for the future.</p></speech>

There is also a complete inevitability about the substantive point that the UK is going its own way in one form or another.  We must look to the future and at relationship paradigms.  While our immediate attention is on the sundering that is facing us, we must also look to the short, medium and long-term relationship.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' views on a suggestion that comes up here from time to time in terms of structures for strengthening our relationship with our friends and neighbours, namely, the Republic of Ireland revisiting the Commonwealth.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is a member of one of the republican parties, Fianna F&aacute;il and a grandson of Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera, raises it from time to time.  Do the witnesses believe that would be constructive in terms of fostering good relations?  I am just broaching the subject today and asking people to consider it.  I have not made up my own mind on the question yet but I am clutching at everything and anything that might foster good relations with our closest friends across what we call the small pond.  We are fellow English-speaking countries, but of course we have the Gaelic language here as well.</p> <p>  I am heartbroken that Britain is leaving the European family because it was pivotal to its greatest achievement, namely, peace in Europe since the Second World War.</p><p>Do the witnesses realise that?  We are where we are, however.  In case I do not get another opportunity to ask this question of the august speakers from the House of Lords who join us this morning, do any of them have a view on the Commonwealth?  Would they be prepared to share such a view with us this morning?</p></speech>

Perhaps I will start with a personal analysis of the sort of work about which we need to think as regards the way in which we interact with each other.  There are a number of dimensions to any such relationship, including, in particular, the intergovernmental and interparliamentary dimensions.  There are also other dimensions involved.  On the interparliamentary side, I have met many of the members' colleagues at the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, over several years and I have always enjoyed very good and fun interaction on all sorts of ideas.  That must be replaced because it was a key part of the interparliamentary dimension and there is every chance we will not be invited, or not fully invited, to its meetings in the future.  It is simply a matter of trying to analyse what we will lose, working out whether that matters and then replacing it with something else.  There is a strong case for a mild increase in the level of engagement at interparliamentary and intergovernmental levels to reflect the closeness of the inevitable relationship between these islands.</p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the land bridge, I was going to ask Lord Wood whether he had any particular views on its importance and on what might be done in order to ensure that, whatever happens, the land bridge continues to operate after the end of the transition period.  I am sorry because it is unfair thing to ask of him, but I feel he is probably the best qualified of us to give a view in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Wood" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020102100002#K00300"><p>I thank Lord Kinnoull.  I have a couple of remarks on the excellent thoughts we have just heard from Deputies and Senators.  Overall, one of the legitimate criticisms made of the UK as regards Brexit over the past two or three years is that we have done inadequate planning for a no-deal outcome again and again.  This has partly been a negotiating ploy on the part of the Government.  In no part of our relations with the rest of Europe and the world is the absence of no-deal planning more important than in respect of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Reluctantly, I believe we have to start thinking hard-headedly about arrangements for closer co-operation, as everyone has suggested, in the event of a very thin deal or no deal whatsoever.  I totally agree with colleagues in Dublin who have spoken this morning about using the institutional network created under the Good Friday Agreement.  This presents many opportunities for reinvigoration.  I had not heard about it before, but I am very sympathetic to the idea of synchronising meetings with EU meetings.  That would be a very good idea.</p> <p>  One of the issues with regard to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain which concerns me most - and it is something on which our committee has pushed the Government - is the question of exit summary declarations and what paperwork Northern Irish traders will have to deal with when dealing with Great Britain and what regulations will apply.  This has become a sort of lightning rod because it looks like a purely UK issue on one hand while, on the other hand, the EU's customs code requires documents to be completed.  We asked Michael Gove about this a couple of weeks ago and he maintained that the Government's position is that no such declarations will be required.  That is clearly contrary to the general view of what is required by the EU's code.  I do not have really hard views on what must happen in this respect but, whether there is a deal or not, an intense network of institutions will be required to co-operate in policing such declarations, if they are required, and state aid.  Lord Kerr raised the issue of policing or supervising adherence to rules.  These will be matters of mutual interest for London and Dublin, as well as for everyone else in the EU.  The sorts of institutional co-operation regarding these issues, which are very small but which could be incredibly destabilising if got wrong, about which we have been talking will be absolutely crucial, particularly in the first year or two.  That is why the committee members' views on the strengthening of institutional relationships at all levels are so important.</p></speech>

I very much share their view.  I have always been most worried about our exit from the EU ultimately ending up with a lot of finger-pointing and everyone blaming each other while possibly having a little bit of right on their side.  That would be terrible and we really need to watch out because, once one goes down that line, things can quickly ratchet up and become very difficult.  We should all do what we can, whatever the outcome of these negotiations, to avoid that.</p> <p>  The issue of the Commonwealth was raised.  Given the history of our islands, those matters should be entirely left to Ireland.  I will leave that there.</p> <p>  I would like to ask a question.  Lord Kerr raised the issue of the level playing field, adjudication mechanisms and possible landing zones.  As one passionately against Brexit, the one thing that seemed a little difficult was the idea that governance arrangements would really be in the hands of the EU institutions.  I noted that a number of the committee's members brought this up when taking evidence from the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  He was understandably very cautious about expressing a view given the ongoing negotiations, but do any members of the committee have a view as to whether this is an area on which there might possibly be some movement from the EU side?</p></speech>

I am quite sure that the co-operation between British and Irish embassies around the world will continue and that the United Kingdom will be willing to help Irish citizens, from North or South of the Border, in countries in which there is not an Irish embassy.  That will not change.  New intergovernmental structures are definitely required.  I was very pleased to hear what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, told the committee about new formal structures between ministers for justice, transport, environment and aid being considered in addition to structures at Head of Government level.  It seems such structures will absolutely be required.<br/><br/>On Senator Martin's question, it is fascinating to see the unthinkable becoming thinkable.  I was struck by the reactions, in both our countries, to President McAleese's invitation to the Queen to pay a state visit.  By the way, that state visit went ahead back in 2011.  The unthinkable becomes thinkable but it is for Ireland to think about these sorts of questions rather than for us.<br/><br/>This kind of interparliamentary contact will also be very important.  Things like COSAC, at which some non-member states may have observer status, will be very important.  Meetings on the margins at bodies such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization and so on will be very important.  Such <i>ad hoc</i>meetings will not be enough.  We will need new formal structures and I am very glad the committee is thinking about them.</p></speech>

I will speak myself and if any members want to follow up afterwards, they can do so.  To go back to the original question of what we can do to look at future relationships, the work has already started, including the work that the witnesses have carried out as a committee on the United Kingdom's Internal Market Bill.  When one goes through it, it is obvious that front and centre of that work is protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  Looking at the witnesses' conclusions about the pragmatic compromise and providing proportionate safeguards, they have really delved into that in the report.  This interaction and engagement is all about building confidence and this meeting has helped things along.</p> <p>  With regard to the Belfast Agreement, we continue to use the language about the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland.  I think everybody knows what we are talking about.  That has been reinforced repeatedly in negotiations between the EU and United Kingdom.  One area where I feel we will have difficulty, as Deputy Haughey alluded to, is with fisheries.  I know everybody raises the issue of fisheries and we are all with Lord Wood in saying we are not experts on fisheries.  We are all experts on what fish tastes like but that is potentially as far as it goes.  I live beside the sea and I am certainly not an expert.  I know that once we get into the realm of sovereignty relating to fisheries, it is not just about fishermen.  There is an emotive connection too.  Great Britain is an island and Ireland is an island.  There is a community connection.  When one considers the pelagic sector, with mackerel spawning off the coast of Galway, spending time off the coast of Mayo and ending up in British waters off the coast of Scotland, we have issues relating to fishermen's rights and claims on the fish.  Upwards of 45% of our fishing effort is in the pelagic sector, which is a multi-million euro industry, and it happens in British waters.  It is a complex area.  I know the witnesses' report did not go into sector-specific matters.  It was a broad report.  In future, if the witnesses are asking what we can do with regard to future engagement, we need to keep that on our radar, both with regard to the sensitivity of it and using language such as proportionate safeguards.  An analysis of that has to be carried out.</p> <p>  We have a few minutes left and will go back to Senators Chambers and Martin.</p> <p>  Lord Oates asked a question about landing zones.  I will be guided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We will leave that in the realm of the deliberations between EU negotiators and the United Kingdom negotiators.  We might park that matter for the important talks that we will have in the coming period.</p></speech>

Lord Kerr initially spoke about landing zones.  It is important that both sides are willing to fly a little bit to land in that zone and that there is compromise.  Lord Oates has been quite persuasive in what he said about the potential need for an independent body to do that.  I take on board that the UK had the right to leave the European Union and has the right to determine for itself as a nation what rules it will operate under.  We fully accept and respect that.  Given Lord Oates's party's position that it is pro-Europe and anti-Brexit, he made a persuasive point.  It needs to at least be relayed that this was discussed but I agree with the Chair that it will be a matter for the negotiating team and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, but it is a fair comment all the same.</p></speech>

I thank Lord Kerr in particular.  I fully accept that it is Ireland's prerogative in the first instance.  That is a given.  When Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others spoke about it, it was about North-South reconciliation but maybe there is an added dynamic that we should look at, of east-west economic co-operation.  Talking about unthinkables, while it is not for this forum, I will out the possibility of a physical bridge or rail link rising from the ashes of this fallout.  The more times that is outed, the better.  There could be some unthinkable brilliance that arises from this, which many would consider to be an economic and social catastrophe.  Maybe the bridge will go back on the table, preferably linking the Republic of Ireland, maybe at Dundalk, directly to our neighbours.  It could be a rail link to carry freight.  Maybe that is something that we could look at in the long term.  It is an old chestnut that raises its head every decade or so.  Maybe Britain leaving the EU might focus people's minds to give that more serious consideration in the long term.</p></speech>

Although it has not tackled those particular issues, because it has been working on landing obligations and such, it knows what it is talking about.  It is quite busy at present.  I will take back what the Chairman said and ask whether it might consider doing some work along those lines.  It is a complex area.  I thank the Chairman for those thoughts.</p> <p>  In closing, I note two things.  The Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol is a pleasing document.  It starts with the recitals, which set the scene and tone, and are aspirational statements that I think everyone who is on this call would agree with all round.  There are two pages of aspirations and behind those are the hard legal terms of the 20 or so articles over the next few pages.  The rest is essentially a list of EU law that will apply in Northern Ireland.  Marrying hard legal articles with aspirational statements is something which will need trust.  I think that trust has been dented in recent times, particularly with the arrival of Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill, for example.  Rebuilding that trust is the sort of thing that interactions such as this will be key to.  I will close by saying that we are keen to be part of that process of rebuilding trust and making sure that there is an enhanced dialogue at the interparliamentary level.  We have a similar intention to have an enhanced dialogue with the Northern Ireland Assembly and we have good relations with it and its committees, and have joint committee meetings with them.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for welcoming us to its meeting today.  I think we have all much enjoyed it and enjoyed the frankness that members have spoken with, as well as the high quality of questioning.  I thank the committee and hope to be able to invite members to our committee.  We certainly look forward to the time when we see the committee again.</p></speech>

That is powerful language.</p><p> This engagement has been helpful.  We are going through a public divorce.  I am not aware of any divorces that went smoothly, whether private or public.  This has been a public divorce over the past several years.  Key to the future is that relationship.  I am reminded of a taxi driver in Armagh during a difficult period of the peace process more than 20 years ago who said that whatever one does, one must keep talking.  Engagements like this and continued conversations are important whether it is through the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly or future mechanisms.  If bigger and more creative thinking is needed, this committee would certainly be open to that.</p><p> Once again, we are grateful for the committee's time.  Apologies for the technical hitches at the beginning.

I raised several issues where I sought reports from the HSE, one of which was on testing and tracing.</p> <p>  Several members made the point yesterday that the anecdotal evidence coming back from people working in that area is that it is a system which is under real pressure.  There is a lack of training and staff with a real problem with morale.  There is also a problem with the ability of that system to work.  What we sought yesterday was a detailed report from the HSE.  That has been overtaken by events today where we had serious information put into the public domain of up to 2,500 sick people who are being asked to become contact tracers themselves and will receive text messages instead of phone calls.  That is completely and absolutely unacceptable.  This is a complete mess for which the Government must bear responsibility.</p> <p>  I am asking that the committee meets next week on this issue.  I know we will be in recess next week but it is fundamentally important.  It is rare that I ask for any committee to meet outside of when it is scheduled to meet, but such is the seriousness of this issue, however, and the impact it is having on people.  It must be borne in mind that this is coming at a time when we are going into more restrictions where much is being asked of individuals in terms of level 5.  The least that people expect is that the State and the Government will get its house in order to ensure testing and tracing are what they should be.  There is a real problem and we have to get a grip on it as a committee.  I am asking the Chairman that the committee will meet next week to bring in the HSE, the Minister, if necessary, and whoever is responsible for testing and tracing in order that we can put questions to them as to what the problems are and why it got to this point.  It is a reasonable request and I ask that it will be supported by other members of the committee.</p></speech>

Does anyone disagree with the idea of having the meeting next week?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#A00500"><p>I am in two minds.  I listened to all the reports and the radio interviews this morning as well.  There is a danger we will further add to the burden faced by those on the ground in trying to deal with testing and tracing.  It is obvious they were overwhelmed last week by virtue of the large numbers of people who were tested, had reported for testing and some who had not reported for second turns.  All of that is creating a burden on the system.  We need to acknowledge the work they are doing in challenging circumstances and recognise they are doing their very best.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.95" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#A00600"><p>I agree with Deputy Cullinane.  It is the context in which one phrases it.  If one married it with what Deputy Durkan said, namely, acknowledged the severe pressure they are under, the number of tests undertaken and how it has been wrapped up, it is appropriate the health committee invites them in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#A00700"><p>There is a dual problem.  There is a problem which testers and tracers face in the context of rising numbers.  More than 1,200 cases on average a day is part of the problem.  Equally, part of the problem is a lack of capacity.  This has been flagged time and again by many of us with staff coming to us telling us there are problems.  Time and again this has been raised.</p> <p>  I have examples.  There are 64 medical laboratory aides who are in a pool who could have been employed since July but have not been taken on by the State.  There are 14 medical scientists.  Why in God's name have those staff not been employed?  There are 64 clerical officers and yet we are told there is not enough staff.  It is the case that rising numbers, in part, are putting huge pressure on the system.  Equally, there are problems with lack of capacity and we did not use the summer months to build it up.  In fact, many staff who were seconded, rightly so at the time, were brought back to what they were doing and not replaced.</p> <p>  There is a real problem here.  I do not believe two hours of their schedule next week - if they can do it remotely - would be too onerous.  Given the scale of the challenge we all face, what people are being asked to do and the sacrifices people are being asked to make, we need to look at this issue.  It really has upset people that more than 2,500 people will have to become contact tracers themselves.  We should meet next week and I am asking members of the committee to support that request.</p></speech>

It was discussed at the private meeting, but because of the new report it is felt that it is vital that we sit as a committee next week.</p></speech>

There is basic information that we need.  We all have lists of people such as science graduates, GPs and many other people well qualified to do it who applied months ago but have not been called.  We need a response on that.</p> <p>  There is also a view that, at this point, when we get to 1,000 cases a day, those cannot be traced.  The numbers involved are just too vast.  That is an issue.  There is no doubt that serious time was lost and an opportunity missed during the summer to do this.  There is a certain amount we can find out from people.  It needs to be a productive meeting.  It would be helpful if we had some of the answers to our questions in advance so that we are not starting from scratch.</p></speech>

It predominantly deals with the testing and has overall responsibility for tracing but it is important to separate the two.  Tracing is predominantly the job of public health experts.  With some of this stuff, when one asks Mr. Paul Reid a question about testing and tracing, he says public health or NPHET instructs the HSE on what to do.  We need a public health expert at the meeting as well, such as Ms Niamh O'Beirne who is the lead on testing and tracing.  She would be the person to see.</p></speech>

They are all presenting remotely and will provide an update on the workforce planning in both acute and community care settings.  I welcome from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, general secretary, and Mr. Tony Fitzpatrick, director of industrial relations; from the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, Ms Susan Clyne, CEO, and Dr. Matthew Sadlier, consultant committee; and from the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, Professor Alan Irvine, president, and Mr. Martin Varley, secretary general.  They are all very welcome to our meeting.  The meeting will be in different sections for the different political groups, with rounds of ten minutes and seven minutes.  We are hoping questions will be asked and answers given within that period.  I know that will be difficult but unfortunately we must stick to the two-hour window.</p> <p>  Before we hear the witnesses' opening statements, I must point out that there is some uncertainty about whether parliamentary privilege will apply to witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Please note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses presenting in Leinster House may not extend to those presenting remotely.  No clear guidance can be given on the extent to which evidence is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Therefore, if witnesses are directed by me to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  I now call Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to make her opening comments on behalf of the INMO.</p></speech>

The INMO is delighted to present to the committee today.  I will briefly go through our opening statement, which members will already have received.  It is broken down into three main parts.  The first part relates to the additional beds that have been announced in the budget as well as the winter plan.  We welcome these beds.  However, we ask members of the committee to be conscious that each time they hear the word "bed" they must think the word "nurse" because without the nursing staff to staff the beds, unfortunately we are not going to make progress in expanding the much-needed capacity in the health service.  In Limerick, for example, we are balloting our members because there is an acute shortage of nursing posts.  We are attempting to open 90 additional beds but we are running with 125 vacancies before we start.  The legacy of the moratorium still stands.  We have to work very hard to recruit and we have to make sure pressure is not put on the system to open beds if there are not sufficient nurses to provide safe care.</p> <p>  At our conference last Friday week, the Minister for Health confirmed that the framework on nurse staffing, which is Government policy, will now be used to determine how many nurses and healthcare assistants are needed to provide care to patients in beds.  This is important and welcome.  It is a scientific method to determine how many nurses are needed.  We understand this is funded for the incoming year.  The settlement of our strike in 2019 stipulated that this funding would be made available for the three years following the dispute, with the staffing to be completed by the end of 2021.  Multiannual funding is required.  Funding for this year is welcome but it will only extend to model 4 hospitals.  We have to be assured that when nurses are looking to their future in the public service, they understand there are commitments behind the correct staffing from a financial perspective.  Otherwise they will leave and go elsewhere.  That has been the practice.</p> <p>  We have set out the staffing levels at which we are running in our submission.  The most recent census produced by the HSE tells us that in the staff nurse grade, which is the main grade of nurse working in the health service, there has been an increase of just under 300 whole-time equivalents since December last year.  There have been significant reductions in our community services.  We have 40 fewer public health nurses and five fewer midwives.  Our midwifery workforce is very important because in order to implement the maternity strategy, we have to meet the ratio of one midwife per 29.5 births and we are far away from that.  That means we are providing unsafe care in sections of the public health service because in some of our maternity units we are now at a rate of one midwife per 40 births, which has been proven internationally to be unsafe and dangerous.  Nurse and midwife staffing is very important.  The good news is that there is a scientific tool to determine staffing levels.</p> <p>  In our submission, we are advocating that in the medium and long term we should look at increasing our undergraduate places in order to ensure we are training sufficient numbers and have room.  The good news is that 5,000 school leavers applied for nursing courses as their first preference in 2019 and we provided 1,700 places to them.  There is room there to increase the number of undergraduate places.  We need to do it fast and we need to be cleverer about retention because it is a big problem.  We are still heavily reliant on overseas recruitment, particularly non-EU recruitment.  We have put those figures in our submission.  More than half the nurses who registered in Ireland in 2019 were from outside the EU, mainly from India and the Philippines.  We are hugely reliant on recruitment from overseas and we have to make sure that continues in the current climate.  It is continuing.  It is slower, but it is continuing.</p> <p>  The children's hospital requires 300 additional nurses just to open and we are already short and are down below that 300.  This means that when the children's hospital begins to operate its services, it will not be able to open all of its beds.  It simply will not have the nursing numbers.  We need to ensure we are training sufficient numbers at undergraduate level to make that timeframe.  Unfortunately, we are two years behind on that already.</p> <p>  Right now, there is a crisis in the health service because of the high number of healthcare workers infected with Covid-19.  Of those, we know that up to 34% are nurses.  We have a high level of absence.  Many of our members are reporting absences stretching into 16 and 17 weeks, particularly in areas where they have been directly caring for Covid patients.  We need a fresh look at the occupational health policies of the HSE, particularly the policy that dictates that workers come back to work even if they have been close contacts of a Covid case.  We believe that is wrong and is not aligned with the testing regime.  There is no routine testing in our acute hospitals.  We have surveyed our members and they want routine testing in acute hospitals.  There is also the added difficulty of childcare.  This committee has heard from us on this matter before.  If there are any changes in Government policy on the closure of schools, we have to make sure that for the female-dominated workforce that is our nursing workforce, thought is put into how their childcare needs will be looked after in that circumstance.</p><p>We cannot have a repeat of what happened earlier in the pandemic, in March and April, when that was basically left to chance.  We must ensure that, prior to any decisions regarding schools, provision is made for childcare for the 91% female workforce that is leading on providing care against this terrible virus in acute hospitals and communities.</p><p> I bring the attention of the committee to the fifth recommendation of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  It states that Covid-19 as an infection should be made an occupational illness.  The INMO previously called for that to be done and the committee recommended that it should be catered for in the health and safety legislation.  We need stronger input into the health and safety of the workforce that is meeting the virus head-on daily and nightly.  The INMO has been and remains critical of the supports available to members of the workforce when they are infected, as well as of their protections at work.  The quality and supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, has improved but, each week for the past two weeks, 50 nurses have been infected with Covid-19 while at work.  That is a very high figure.   I am happy to take questions from committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Clyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#C00200"><p>The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, represents almost 7,000 medical professionals working across the acute primary care community and public health settings.  Dr. Sadlier and I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on medical workforce planning, but we draw its attention to the fact that one year ago, we presented to the then health committee on this topic.  It is a matter of extreme regret that little or nothing has changed since then.  In fact, the situation has worsened despite numerous reports pointing to the chronic shortage of doctors.</p> <p>  Covid does not only expose the fragility of the health service in terms of its infrastructure and bed capacity.  In addition, we are facing the enormous challenge of asking an understaffed and exhausted to deliver Covid and non-Covid care.  It is evident that post Covid we will continue to have too few doctors to meet the health demands of an increasing population unless we act now.</p> <p>  The current picture is one of shortages across the system.  There are 500 vacant consultant posts, leading to growing waiting lists - there are now more than 840,000 people on a waiting list.  That leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment for patients which, in turn, leads to increased mortality.  Ireland has the lowest number of specialists per head of population and not a single specialty has the required number working in it.  </p> <p>  The HSE national doctors training and planning unit suggests that the HSE has a deficit of 1,600 hospital consultants.  If one includes psychiatry, that deficit rises to approximately 2,000 consultants.  Each year, slightly more than 700 doctors enter basic specialist training, while approximately 500 doctors enter higher specialist training.  The HSE estimates that a minimum of 648 additional training posts are needed just to cover hospital-based specialties.  That does not include general practitioner, GP, training places.  </p> <p>  The healthcare system relies on a large number of doctors from non-EU or EEA countries who, up to now, have had no access to training posts.  Although legislation has been passed to enable such access, all that is doing is increasing the number of doctors competing for a static number of training posts, which does not improve the manpower situation.  A minimum of 600 GPs will retire in the coming years.  The HSE estimates that we need an additional 1,260 GPs in the coming years to ensure we can meet the demands of patients.  It is imperative that up to 350 GP training posts per year are funded to meet future needs.</p> <p>  Incredibly, there are only 60 public health medical specialists.  The Crowe Horwath report which was accepted by the Government recommends increasing that number and ensuring they are supported by multidisciplinary teams.  By comparison, New Zealand and Scotland, which have roughly the same population as Ireland, have 180 public health consultants.  Worryingly, 50% of our public health medical specialists are due to retire in the next five years and there are insufficient trainees in the system to match those retirements, let alone to cope with any expansion of the workforce.</p> <p>  We have seen increasingly high rates of emigration by doctors in recent years and can state with some degree of certainty that that trend will continue.  Doctors leave to enhance their skills and receive additional training but, unfortunately, they are not returning to Ireland.  Doctors wish to work in a system that enables them to deliver care to patients and in which they are respected.  For many, that now means going abroad.</p> <p>  For some years, the IMO and other organisations have been highlighting these issues.  Successive Governments have commissioned and produced reports, all of which support the need to plan and resource medical manpower.  What has been lacking is implementation, investment and resources.  At a minimum, there is a need to resolve the disastrous two-tier pay system for consultants.  It is inequitable and unfair and has been the biggest barrier to recruitment this country has ever seen.  This politically motivated pay cut has had a very damaging and dangerous impact on the health services.  Although we welcome the commitment to hire an additional 300 consultants in 2021, it does not even address the current 500 vacancies.  There needs to be far more ambition in terms of recruitment targets to support the clinical programmes and models of care.</p> <p>  Public health specialists must be awarded consultant contracts.  It is particularly galling in the context of Covid that the very doctors on whom we are relying to manage the pandemic are not recognised for their skills and expertise.  We must significantly and rapidly increase the number of training posts across the specialties and ensure that training programmes lead to clear career pathways for trainees.  Far more account must be taken of the needs of trainees and the changing demographic of those coming into medicine.  In general practice, the transfer of care from acute settings to the community must be properly supported.  It is very difficult to manage unplanned care and GPs are suffering from the same capacity issues as the hospital sector.  In light of the demographics of the GP base, who are an older population, supports for GPs who wish to establish in general practice must be delivered.</p> <p>  I ask the committee to note that we have all the recommendations we need in terms of planning for our future needs but what we lack is investment and funding.  This situation is bad for doctors but, more importantly, it is disastrous for patients and health outcomes.  Dr. Sadlier and I are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.117" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Irvine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to participate in this discussion.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghda and Ms Clyne have eloquently pointed out that capacity is not just about beds, it is about people, including highly skilled professionals across all the medical and nursing disciplines that we need.  It is clear that the health system lacks that capacity and has done for some time.   The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, represents 3,200 hospital consultants practising in acute hospital and mental health services, or approximately 95% of the total.</p> <p>  My remarks will mostly focus on the reasons consultant posts cannot be filled.  Ms Clyne pointedly observed that these are not new reasons.  They have been known and pointed out for many years.  One of the greatest deficits is around listening.  Some people will not listen, particularly to craft representatives.  Too often, the offering from the employers' side is a one-size-fits-all, take it or leave it approach.  If the employers' side were to listen carefully and implement what well-meaning and informed professionals from all of the groups represented here today were saying, we would not be in the current position.</p> <p>  As all present are aware, there is a severe shortage of hospital consultants.  As Ms Clyne stated, there are 500 unfulfilled posts.  Government reports itself have outlined an additional 2.000 posts are needed.  The result of that shortage is very damaging for patients.  Waiting lists for hospital care have ballooned in recent years, particularly since the 2012 decision.  I entirely agree with Ms Clyne that that decision was politically motivated and exceptionally damaging.  If the committee wishes to know why there are not enough consultants, it is as a result of policy decisions that were not evidence based or done in a collaborative way but, rather, imposed unilaterally.  The decisions were foolish, absolutely counter-productive and costly.  On every level, it was a gross error.  What worries me is that the errors and political thinking that led to that decision persists and we will probably not fix the problem unless we change the culture and thinking around how we fill those vacancies.</p> <p>  The number of outpatients waiting more than 12 months is a record 250,000.  There are 1 million people waiting for care in the public health service,  including approximately 840,000 on lists and 190,000 waiting for diagnostics such as CTs and MRIs.  More than 17,000 people are waiting more than a year for inpatient or day cases, compared with 131 awaiting such treatment in 2012 when the decisions to which I referred were made.</p><p>We have gone from 131 people waiting for over a year to 17,000.  It directly ties in with a really ill-advised policy decision.  One can see a clear cause and effect.</p><p> We have also had to recruit doctors who are not on the Medical Register.  There are 117 of these in the HSE by the last count.  That has been the result of adverse commentary in the High Court by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly and others.</p><p> What does it look like around the country?  We see in Cork that approximately 35% of acute trauma cannot be listed in orthopaedics because the hospital does not have consultants to do it.  In Cork and Kerry, there are the same number of ophthalmologists as there were in the late 1970s.  We are all aware of the issues there with regard to people having cataract surgery.  There are examples of this all around the country.  The single most significant determining factor is the decisions made in 2012, which have not been corrected and continue to perpetuate these issues.</p><p> As Ms Clyne said, and we completely agree, we have the lowest number of consultants in nearly every discipline in Europe.  That is a false dichotomy.</p><p> I want to specifically address our younger consultants, who are being discriminated against, as we have heard.  They carried an extremely heavy burden of work in the past seven months and will have to do that in future.  These are colleagues who we value greatly, and we, the health service and our people need more of them.  We need to treat them properly and encourage them to work in the health service.  That includes trainees in training schemes and higher specialist training, who want to be encouraged to come back.  I echo Ms Clyne's point on that.</p><p> We are borrowing much money and expanding the health service at pace.  We need the right people and we need to get them in rapidly and on terms they are happy to work on.  We need to see clarity about how many consultant posts will be funded and how they will be filled in a short period.  Some 16,000 additional staff are coming.  The committee has heard from my colleagues about how difficult it might be to fill positions in their disciplines and we agree.  It is the same for us.</p><p> To summarise, given the persistent shortfall of 500 posts, a clear conclusion is that the current offering is simply inadequate, in a broad sense.  That applies to all of the pay and conditions, including the flexibility that is needed to bring people in.  At this stage, most employers and organisations would conclude that maybe they need to engage with the people who are likely to fill these posts and improve their offering.  We will start with a blank sheet now.  I have been a consultant for 18 years.  This has not been the way things have been done or how business has been conducted, and that is why we now have a health service that does not have adequate capacity for our people.  We need to dramatically change the way that we recruit people.  There needs to be much more listening, action and implementation, to echo Ms Clyne's comments.</p><p> There is no time to lose.  Winter is coming.  We need to build for this winter and every future winter.  I will conclude my remarks there and, like the others, I would welcome and be happy to address questions.</p></speech>

I have a question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about the increase in beds and the nurses required for staffing.  Is the funding made available in the course of the summer and budget 2021 sufficient to meet the challenges of recruitment etc.?  Regarding the increase in the number of undergraduates, we are getting applicants from India and the Philippines.  What is the ratio of students from Ireland compared with non-EU countries?  We addressed retention of health staff at all levels in this committee in the last D&aacute;il.  It appears to be getting more difficult.  If so, are prevailing conditions the cause of the problem?  Is any part of it the fact that highly qualified medical staff have the world as their oyster on the world market at present and that we have to recruit against colleagues throughout the world?</p> <p>  Anybody and everybody can answer this last question.  What are the witnesses' views on the extent to which the health services are meeting the challenges which have appeared on the horizon over the past six months?  Do they think it can continue?  Everybody criticises the services for their inadequacies and inability to deal with growing numbers.  At the same time, if everybody throughout the country co-operated and carried out what we should with regard to correction of our interactions with other people and stopping the spread of the virus, I believe that it would make a significant impact on the workload and levels of stress caused in the health services.  The witnesses can comment on that if they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Irvine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#D00500"><p>There was one question for me, three for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha and one more general question.  I am happy to take the first one first.  The question was why I said it was politically motivated.  We know what position the country was in in 2012.  We absolutely recognise the global financial crash and the implications that all of our people had to deal with.  There were mechanisms such as the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts that applied to every group in the public service.  In addition, in a vindictive and vicious way, one group was picked out, namely new consultants.  They had an extra 30% taken from them on top of every other group, in addition to the FEMPI cuts, so I am here to speak for them.  They felt that.  That really hurt people as well as being a financial issue.  They were told they were not valued.  The mood around this was horrible.  I remember it well.  It was depressing.  I am a pre-2012 consultant, so I do not have any financial issue with this personally, but I can see the damage that it has done to our health service and to colleagues.  People are being told that they are less valuable than their senior colleagues.  I believe that for all crafts, but in this case, I am talking specifically about our people.  It is damaging and the mood around it, the opinion pieces launched and the ugly soundbites that we heard in the media all created an incredibly damaging lack of value for new consultants and for people in training posts, looking at new consultant posts.  I tell anybody who wants to listen that that has been incredibly destructive, with op-eds, including one from Deputy Shortall in January 2012.  It was very damaging to people and how they would be valued.  These are the people who we are now asking to go the extra mile, put themselves on the front line and continue under these conditions.  I will finish because I want to give Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha time to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#D00600"><p>In point 5 of our submission, we set out the statistics that we received from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland in 2019, which advised that 62% of newly-registered nurses and midwives trained outside Ireland.  That is the figure as we know it.  There are approximately 1,700 in training every year, which is the number of Irish graduates.</p><p>In addition, we also have nurses coming back to Ireland to register.  However, of those who registered, 62% had trained outside Ireland.  That will give the committee an idea of the numbers.</p><p> With regard to the increase in the numbers of undergraduates, we make the point simply because we will have a greater focus on the need for education.  We know the Minister with responsibility for higher education, in his new brief, is looking to expand opportunities for school leavers as Covid-19 will bring its own problems with employment.  If there are 5,000 people putting nursing or midwifery first on the Central Applications Office form, they should be accommodated, encouraged and funded to undertake the course.  There is a very real shortage and this is about supply and demand.  There is a request from school-leavers and we should accommodate it, encourage and applaud them.  We do not have to reinvent much but we must make a provision for them and ensure they can do it.</p><p> There are absolutely retention difficulties.  As Professor Irvine mentioned, if we remember as far back as 2012, nurses who graduated not only got the 10% pay reduction that all public servants got but they also got a further 20% reduction in their graduating pay scale.  In total they got a 30% pay cut and to a person they took that personally and emigrated.  We are now looking overseas to that group and saying "Sure come home and we will treat you fine and better now".  If they return, we give agency contracts rather than employment in the health service.  There are many fixable problems that currently make no sense.</p><p> Our recruitment practice is bureaucratic.  If I resign as a nurse today in hospital A, it will take a minimum of eight weeks for the director of nursing to get approval to go to advertisement and it would probably take approximately six months to fill the post.  It is pure bureaucracy at work but such tasks must be delegated to the director of nursing.  If there is a job and a person can continue to work, it should be up to that director to put that person on the payroll.  It must be that simple or otherwise we will continually fight against ourselves in order to recruit.</p><p> In 2012 and 2013, all the austerity measures were introduced and on 1 October public servants got the last of those cuts to pay restored, aside from the hours aspect.  Nurses in this country work a 39-hour week, a longer week than any other healthcare professional.  As a result, 1.5 hours per week is owed to them each week by their employer, which they currently work for nothing.  That is how they view it and it must be corrected in order to retain those staff.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p><p> On the broader matter of what can be done, we cannot provide both of these services into this winter.  We had over 100,000 people on trolleys last winter.  If we face that again while trying to provide care for people with Covid-19, we will fail.  It is simple enough.  The people who work in the health services are doing their best, from doctors to nurses to porters to cleaners and everybody else.  They are doing their best but they are human and exhausted.  We did a very intensive survey last week and the main message is that people are exhausted.  The citizens of this country understand the health service has limits but these are being reached and it will not be possible to provide both services.</p></speech>

I have a question on private healthcare.  I listened with great interest to her interview the other day on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 when she expressed concern about nursing pay scales and terms and conditions of nurses working in private hospitals.  Will she elaborate on what, if anything, we can do to help rectify this?  It seems to be extremely unjust.</p></speech>

They are contracted to work at rates between them and their employer.  We are seeking collective bargaining rights for that group of workers across the private sector.  If there is a rate of pay in a country, it should reflect the duties, and there should be equal pay for equal work.</p> <p>  In private nursing homes in particular we have a larger reliance on overseas nurses and there are difficulties in respect of where they live.  In many, although not all, cases there are examples of cost of accommodation being deducted from a salary.  Staffing levels are lower and it is more difficult to supervise work.  In many cases the ratio of nurse to patient is extraordinarily high and therefore dangerous.  These are very real issues.</p> <p>  The comment I made was in respect of an appeal not to "poach" private nursing home staff, although I may be misquoting.  My simple point is that if the conditions exist where workers are happy in an environment, they will stay there.  There would be no need to appeal to the State to block them from going for interviews in State-run facilities.  If the conditions are right, people will stay where they are for work.  Many of these people migrate not just to the public sector but to private acute hospitals, where the conditions of employment in the main are better.</p></speech>

They are very concerned about the infection rate among healthcare workers and, in particular, they are concerned about the infection rate in nursing as it reduces their rosters.  The infection rate is unacceptably high and nurses believe additional measures must be put in place, mainly that the Health and Safety Authority must have jurisdiction.  We were very happy to see that recommendation from the Covid-19 committee.  We request that this committee would reinforce that recommendation and amend the regulation to allow Covid-19 to be classified as an occupational injury.  It is central to the protection of workers in these environments.</p> <p>  Everybody knows Covid-19 is extraordinarily infectious but imagine working with personal protective equipment for lengthy shifts and not being able to get relief because staffing levels are so low.  According to the WHO, fatigue is one of the main problems when it comes to additional exposure to the virus.  In other words, a person is more vulnerable if he or she is fatigued.</p> <p>  Our members have said to us they are reflecting on their future careers and 70% have said they have thought about leaving, with 60% actively thinking about it.  It is very serious.  We want to encourage nurses to stay working in the health service and we do not want this experience to be such that it is really difficult to work in these circumstances right now.  We do not want them to feel they have to change career.  We want the employer and the Government to support them.  We want to ensure whatever it takes is there so that when they are working in these dangerous and high-risk environments, they can be protected.</p></speech>

First, this committee certainly should support the recommendation from the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that Covid should be an occupational illness.  We must put the Minister on notice that it is one of the issues we want him to address in his opening statement when he appears before the committee after the recess.  I fully concur on the issue of student nursing and the problems they face.  It is unacceptable that many of them are not being paid or properly supported.  That is something this committee must flag to the Minister when he next appears before it.</p> <p>  It is very important that we support the front-line staff.  As this session is on workforce planning, I am struck by Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's contribution.  When the committee was in private session a number of weeks ago and considering our work plan, I raised the issue of increasing the number of undergraduate and trainee places across the board, and not just for nurses.  I will come to Ms Clyne and Professor Irvine shortly regarding GPs, consultants and other specialties.  That is an area on which the committee should focus.  It is obviously aligned as well with the Department with responsibility for higher education.  We must see more placements.  Part of that has to be increasing the bursaries and supports.  We must examine the total number of measures that would make that happen.</p> <p>  I have a final question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  I only have five minutes left and I wish to question the other witnesses as well.  She said her members are under major pressure.  We all accept that.  When does the peak arrive in the winter?  That is what people will ask.  We are heading into the winter season, and any winter is very challenging for the front line.  When are we likely to see the peak?  In a normal year, and we are not in a normal year, when would the peak be hit, and is she satisfied that when it is hit this year we have the capacity, resources and supports in place to ensure those on the front line can do the job they need to do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#F00300"><p>It depends on what one is measuring.  What we measure normally is the hospital occupancy.  The hospitals are occupied at a rate that is much higher than the 82% or 83% which is considered safe all year round.  The peak does not happen like it used to, whereby there would be a reprieve during the summer.  That does not happen.  Our trolley count figures are increasing throughout the year but they get increasingly unmanageable in January and February, not so much in December although it is still very high.  January and February are months that become extremely difficult in the hospital setting.</p> <p>  In the community, it is important to examine the public health nursing support and the reduction in numbers there.  Those nurses tell us that the idea that they would have time to dedicate to geriatric surveillance, which was part and parcel of their role, is gone.  They do not have a facility to have waiting lists for their service so each day they must determine what is the priority.  They are not getting to massive areas because their numbers are insufficient.  That is a very big problem at a time like this when people are cocooning and we are trying to support the elderly to stay at home.  That is happening today.</p></speech>

I wish to put questions to Ms Clyne and Professor Irvine.  I attended Professor Irvine's national conference last week and found all the contributions to be very interesting, but the issue of pay parity has arisen time and again.  This has been on the agenda for a long time.  There are 500 vacant consultant posts and unless we deal with the pay issue, we will not be able to attract consultants.  What I can understand from the Minister for Health is that he sees the public-only consultant contracts as the solution to this.  That would mean those who are on the type B contracts being asked to sign up to the Sl&aacute;intecare contracts.  In Professor Irvine's view, does that solve the problem?  If it does not, what else needs to be done?</p> <p>  The same question is addressed to Ms Clyne.  I also have a question for Ms Clyne regarding GPs.  We need more training positions to come through, but also better supports and pathways for GPs to practise when they come through.  The age demographic of GPs is obviously not good.  It is a major challenge.  Perhaps Ms Clyne will respond on the issue of GPs and ensuring there is a better pathway when they come from training to practise, and both witnesses will respond to the question of how we get more doctors and consultants into the system.  Aside from the pay issue, there are other issues relating to caseload, workload, access to theatre space, equipment and so forth.  Perhaps Professor Irvine will address those issues first, followed by Ms Clyne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.138" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Irvine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#F00500"><p>I will be very brief because Ms Clyne has not had a chance to speak and she has two questions to answer while I have just one.  On the question of the public-only contract, one of the reasons we are in this position is that we have a vision that is created centrally by employers that will "solve the problem".  It does not take cognisance of what the people who actually know what will solve the problem will say.  If this is another unilateral offer, it will not work.  Unilateral offers rarely do.  The public-only contracts will work for some disciplines and some people, depending on the conditions.  We have not seen those.  We are not in a negotiating space yet, nor is the IMO.  We are not involved in that yet.  We will negotiate things as we are allowed, but if there is a prefixed ideal from one side of where that should end, it probably will not solve the problems.</p> <p>  There are reasons that people want to retain freedom to work outside the public system, and they are not all financial.  Many of them are due to work satisfaction, having access to a list and perhaps being able to do a procedure one cannot do.  We are going to see procedures squeezed out of the public hospitals because of capacity issues.  We are already seeing the cancellation of routine work.  If one is a physician or a surgeon who does procedures, one wants to be able to keep the skills set in which one has invested heavily over the years in training, and perhaps one cannot express that in the public system.  Controlling every aspect of these senior professionals' lives, over and beyond what they discharge wholly in their public contracts, does not necessarily make good sense.  It will not fill all the gaps in the system.  We need a flexible approach, but we mainly need people to listen genuinely and not come with a prefixed idea.</p></speech>

It is important to know that the Minister has committed several times, both in opposition and as Minister, to fixing the 30% pay cut.  The public health contract that has yet to be negotiated by either the IMO or the IHCA will not solve this issue.  In fact, it will drive more people away.  It must be remembered that there is currently a public-only contract on offer, and there has been since 2008, yet we have been unable to attract consultants on that contract.  The vast majority of consultants who have been contracted since 2008 have been on a type B contract.</p> <p>  If all private practice goes out of public hospitals, the public hospital system will be down by between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million per year.  The Department and policy makers must work with us, not against us, in trying to solve this problem.  However, the 30% must be fixed.  As in the point made by Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha, recruiting doctors is a long-term process.  It can take from 20 months to two years to get a consultant into post.  We have identified the problems, and there are ways to fix them.  We have to start fixing them now.</p> <p>  With regard to GPs, there is a problem in general practice.  That has been highlighted for a number of years.  It is easy to predict how many GPs are going to retire and how many GPs we need to train.  If we fix those two issues, the gap is how we help younger GPs to establish.  Establishing a practice is not like walking into a State facility, where all one's costs are paid.  It is a business, and it is very costly.  There has been little predictability in GP income over the last number of years.  That is changing with the IMO agreement with the State, but there is little predictability about being able to say for sure what one's financial position will be given that the State controls a percentage of one's income without making any payment towards a percentage of one's costs.</p></speech>

For example, in the private sector and care of the older person services that are public services, there is routine testing of all staff every fortnight.  We and our members believe that the same regime should be in place in an acute hospital because we have a lot more information about asymptomatic presentation.</p></speech>

It is not required to report it to the Health and Safety Authority as an occupational problem - an occupationally acquired illness.  If I go into work this evening, work in a ward, am injured in the course of my duty and am absent for three days, there is a statutory responsibility on my employer to notify the Health and Safety Authority if that is a physical assault.  The consequences of getting infected with Covid-19 are such that the long-term effects about which we are now learning are catastrophic in many cases.  The employer is the health service.  If it was a meat factory, it would be exactly the same.  An employer is not going to investigate its own practice sufficiently objectively to determine whether it had any part in that infection.  Therefore, that is the purpose of an independent investigative process, which in this country is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority.  In the event that someone dies from Covid-19, it is not a reportable death to the Health and Safety Authority if the person is a healthcare worker who acquired that infection at work.  This is wrong.  An occupational illness or injury should have that status if it is caused by an infection, assault or anything in which one's employment was the main factor.</p></speech>

The real problem is that there is no resilience in the workforce, so when someone goes out sick, there is nobody to take on.  For both doctors and nurses, therefore, it means that the people who are left are working twice or three times as hard with more shifts and longer hours.  We see that, for our non-consultant hospital doctors, working 24-hour shifts is becoming much more prevalent in the system.  They are working over and above their safe working hours in terms of the European working time directive, so there is no resilience in the health service workforce across all the grades.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on the issue of public health.  Probably before last March, very few people knew there was such a thing as public health.  From the point of view of prioritisation and resourcing in the health service, public health was exceptionally under-resourced.  If we have learned anything from the past seven or eight months, it must be that we must concentrate on public health, resource it properly and expand the capacity, because as it stands, it is very inadequate.  Regarding the point about which we were talking earlier with regard to the collapse of the tracing system, that is a result of inadequate resourcing of public health.</p> <p>  I have a question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about those public health leaders at community level - public health nurses.</p><p>Public health nurses are often a very undervalued group of healthcare workers.  They are the people who have the expertise in child health, care of older people, vaccination programmes, chronic illness management in the community and so on.  Traditionally, it has been very underresourced.  There have been a lot of vacancies.  How adequate is the capacity of public health nursing now?  </p><p> I have a similar question relating to doctors for Ms Clyne.  She said that not only is the provision of public health specialists wholly inadequate relative to other countries but also that public health specialists, unlike their peers, do not have the opportunity to be consultants as there is no such grade in this country.  The Government indicated that it would address both of those points.  What is the status of that?  Ms Clyne said that 180 consultants were needed.  What is happening about creating the consultant posts and expanding them to the level required?</p><p> I have a question for Professor Irvine if there is time.  I would not disagree that serious mistakes were made in cutting consultant pay by 30%.  It was a real slap in the face to new recruits and has done much damage.  If he has time, will he tell us the other factors that discourage people from staying to practise in this country such as culture, career prospects and working conditions, which various surveys have told us discourage people from staying here after training?  What action, if any, is being taken on those issues, which I think are probably equally important as pay, which is undoubtedly a major factor?  </p></speech>

The Deputy is correct about public health doctors.  People were very unaware of public health and all of a sudden the whole nation has become public health experts.  In 2003, around the time of SARS, public health specialists had to resort to industrial action.  We have 60, and it is a mainly female workforce, who are not consultants yet are expected to lead teams to deliver the care.  Recently we had a meeting with our public health members.  They unanimously decided that if the Department and the HSE did not progress this matter they would have no option but to take industrial action.  The Department and the HSE have both confirmed that they would address it, and the Minister confirmed that to the Covid committee.  However, we have not yet had an invitation to the Department for any serious talks.  These people are absolutely on their knees with exhaustion.  Most work seven hours a day, have little or no cover, and have very few support staff.   Both the winter plan and the budget anticipate that support staff will be hired in but there is no definitive commitment to award consultant contracts to the 60 people who are already there and at least increase the numbers to 85 immediately, increasing it to a similar level as Scotland or New Zealand over time.  These public health doctors, no more than other consultants, are like gold dust - every health system wants them.  Our people are being recruited into the UK, particularly Wales and Scotland, where they are told they can work for the NHS but do so from Dublin.  They will not have to leave Ireland while they work for another jurisdiction.  It is so galling for them.  They are managing all the outbreaks in every residential centre, in schools, in work places and they have to train up the contact tracing teams.  We have seen the problems that have arisen with contact tracing over the weekend.  There are just too few of these positions and way too much is being asked of them.  There is absolutely zero respect being shown to them.  Politicians, and many others, are busy thanking public health doctors, congratulating them on all their efforts, yet they are having no meaningful engagement with them to sort out this contractual issue which has been very long standing.  Furthermore, there are not enough trainees.  Career prospects for this specialty are so poor that there are not enough trainees in the system to match the numbers retiring out of the system.</p></speech>

The capacity report recommended that we increase the number of public health nurses by 700.  We are going backwards.  We have 40 fewer public health nurses now compared with December 2019.  We need to increase the training places and we need to greatly improve the circumstances of employment.  Community general nurses are supporting public health nurses in the community.  As I said, they do not have a facility for waiting lists but they tell us.  For example, they have responsibility from a new mother coming home with a baby, where they will make the first visit and undertake domiciliary care for a few weeks where they go into the home and provide the care.  They do the same for those who require palliative care, who have chronic disease and require management in the home, and they also run immunisation clinics and so on.  They have a very wide job description.</p> <p>  We are not training them in sufficient numbers.  Something we could do quickly would be to expand the training places.  There are 13 institutes of education in Ireland that provide undergraduate training but only four areas that provide public health nurse training.  Because it is a postgraduate qualification, people are established where they work.  There should be encouragement for people to go to their nearest educational institution and where they would be provided with postgraduate public health nursing education in all the 13 institutes of education, as well as undergraduate training.  That is something that is sensible and could be done quickly.</p> <p>  We should also encourage those who wish to access public health training.  We need to give them a break so that for those who have worked in the community and are familiar with how the community works, the time required on the public health nursing higher diploma would be reduced.  These are two small things that we think would assist immediately in increasing the numbers working in those categories.</p> <p>  Ms Clyne and others might also want to comment on structures.  We are being told that the HSE is restructuring the community.  Various committees are looking at how the community will be structures from the perspective of management and governance.  It is interesting that nursing is not being consulted largely in that.  Public health nurses and nurses who work in the community have made a massive contribution and will continue to do so.  We need to seriously look at how we align the managerial function and the community with the clinical responsibility and advice.  We saw it during the pandemic when we saw public health nurses coming to the fore -----</p></speech>

There was brief reference to it in her opening statement but not a great deal.  My question has three parts.  What is the status of the 2% target of advanced nurse practitioners?  We were just talking about public health nursing and how we can optimise that through postgraduate qualifications, bursaries and more local access to those types of courses.  Are those things a factor in reaching that 2% target?  How is the creation of nurse practitioner posts impacted by the Covid crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.176" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#H00900"><p>We have a target of 700 advanced nurse practitioners.</p><p>We are about halfway with that, at just over 300 at the moment.  Funding for advanced nurse practitioner training has been committed to us as part of our strike settlement.  In response to an earlier question from Deputy Durkan which I did not answer, we are waiting to see how much that budget allocation will be because we have not been advised about the allocation of that money as yet.  We have been given information regarding the allocation of funds for the winter plan, but not concerning funds from the budget in respect of specific nursing posts.</p><p> We are looking to the Department of Health to ensure that the target of 700 is met and met on time.  In addition, we have a requirement for clinical nurse specialists.  They train in Ireland, and up to about five years ago there was a body to register and accommodate training.  That has now been removed, and clinical nurse specialists find it very difficult to get employment, as clinical nurse specialists, when they move from place to place, despite having the qualifications.  A tidy up needs to be done, therefore, but there is also a need to look at the roles and expertise of advanced nurse practitioners.  </p><p> We know that where and when they work, for example, their statistics regarding hospital avoidance are quite extraordinary.  It is the same in respect of our community intervention teams.  We are very glad to see that there is some focus on community intervention teams for hospital avoidance in the winter plan and we must ensure that translates into additional clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners in the community, and not just focusing on hospital settings.</p></speech>

Advanced nurse practitioners in a community setting, particularly in the context of long-term chronic illness, have excellent outcomes and are important.</p> <p>  I will return to some of the discussions regarding consultant contracts, if I have enough time.  One of the earlier speakers referred to the type B, public-only contracts.  I was glad to hear that because I had gone looking for a mention of it in the submissions, but not found it.  I thought that as a new Deputy I might have been missing something.  In December 2019, the band for that contract was outlined by the then Minister and the then Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il as being between &euro;180,000 and &euro;222,000, rising to &euro;252,000.  Specialists agreeing to take up a public-only contract will make that one of the highest rates in the OECD area.</p> <p>  This would not be a new contract insofar as Sl&aacute;intecare included this kind of a contract idea in the 2017 report, and it was also mentioned in 2019 in the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.  I was surprised, therefore, that it was not mentioned in the submissions.  If we are looking at having one of the highest salary rates in the OECD for a public-only contract, and that is not acceptable to consultants, what does that mean for the future of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

The category B contract is the one which allows for a certain limited amount of private practice.  I think what Deputy Hourigan is referring to is the category A contract, which has no private practice provision and is a public practice only contract.  Heretofore, that has largely been concentrated in several specialties.  It applies to about 20% of consultants, but those are largely concentrated in emergency departments and psychiatry.  The salary scales referred to by the Deputy are for people employed pre-2012, and not those after that date.  If somebody took up a category A contract now, for example, that person would not be on that salary scale.</p></speech>

It is a scale with nine points, so if somebody were to be appointed on that today, he or she would not reach the top of that scale until 2029, and that top rate is less than &euro;200,000.  I think it is in the region of &euro;190,000.</p></speech>

The Deputy is referring to what has been suggested multiple times as the Sl&aacute;intecare contract salary scales.  That has not happened, however, for anybody appointed post-2012 and we are still offering the contract today.</p> <p>  This is not so much about the quantum of money.  I was appointed in December 2012, so I just got in at the very start of this process.  My point concerns people working in a job side-by-side with other people who have identical responsibilities, hours and levels of stress and pressure but who are earning 40% more.  As Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha pointed out earlier regarding the similar nursing situation, this cut was on top of the 10% cut.  In reality, therefore, the vast majority of people on the new salary scale are being paid 40%, not 30%, less than their colleagues.</p></speech>

There have been multiple suggestions, but nobody has offered a contract.  The reality now is that a person employed in the morning on a public-only contract will have a salary scale with nine points.  The top of that salary scale is roughly &euro;190,000, perhaps &euro;193,000, but I cannot remember exactly, but that will be 40% less than colleagues appointed before 2012.

It will be interesting, therefore, as we roll out Sl&aacute;intecare and I think we will need better engagement with people who represent future colleagues to fill these vacancies.  These contracts must be flexible, multifaceted and locally delivered.  There will not be a single silver bullet contract that will fill every vacancy in every discipline that we need filled in our health service.</p></speech>

I thank everybody for their contributions.  My first question is for Ms Clyne and it concerns non-EU doctors.  They now make up 53% of all doctors and more than one third of doctors in the health service are trained abroad.  Those doctors are highly trained and highly motivated, but there seems to be a glass ceiling for them regarding career paths and achieving better prospects in the Irish health system.  Will the proposed change in the legislation under way in the Oireachtas, and which will be implemented in June 2021, make a difference to that set of doctors?  I ask that because the submission from the IMO referred to the major shortage of consultants in the Irish health system.  At the same time, however, we also have this cohort of highly educated and highly motivated doctors who seem to be discriminated against.  Will Ms Clyne please comment on that aspect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Clyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#J01700"><p>I will make the general comment that it is unethical for Ireland to be recruiting so many doctors from countries that need those doctors to look after their own populations.  A better system is one where doctors move around countries to get enhanced training but then return to their home country to practise, in the majority of cases.  The WHO and the WMA, therefore, will state that this is an unethical practice anyway and that we are depriving other healthcare systems of much-needed health professionals.</p> <p>  That group of doctors who come here, however, do not really want to stay here because they have not been able to access the training posts.  While the recent legislation, therefore, is helpful in that it gives them some access, they are merely competing with a greater number of doctors now for the same number of training posts.</p><p>That move is not going to help with our medical manpower shortage in any way.  It will not make a jot of difference or fill one additional post.  Non-EEA and non-EU doctors have been treated very poorly.  They mainly emigrate from Ireland quite quickly because they are treated badly.  To see them as an answer to the consultant shortage would not be a correct interpretation of the situation.</p><p> Consider what we could have done since the Covid-19 pandemic, apart from all the normal planning based on previous reports.  In July of this year, several specialist registrars, SpRs, had finished their training and were ready to take consultant posts.  We asked the HSE to offer each and every one of them a temporary consultant contract.  This was denied.  We now have a situation where highly qualified and trained SpRs are working as registrars or are doing locum work.  It is an absolute disgrace.  We do not value any of our doctors, whether they are Irish-trained or non-EEA doctors.  We are very appreciative of all the work these doctors have done to prop up our health services, but it is wholly wrong and completely unethical to allow such an over-reliance on non-EEA doctors.</p></speech>

They are working as <i>de facto</i>care assistants.  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic they are not allowed to take second jobs, which presents a huge financial burden.  How does Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha feel about the exploitation of student nurses in the health system at this time?</p><p>My second question concerns infection rates among healthcare workers.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said 50 nurses are having to stop work each week.  If that continues the Irish health system will be in serious trouble.  What provision can be made to prevent a tipping point from being reached?</p></speech>

We have commented on student nurses already in this hearing, but it is important to state that we strongly believe that they are being exploited.  There is a shortage of nursing and midwifery grades.  Student nurses are now rostered for the clinical placement part of their training.  They are being used to fill gaps without pay.  It is as simple as that.  We strongly believe that payment is the very least they can expect.  We do not advocate unpaid work for anybody in our health service.  In the middle of a pandemic, when every other student in the country is being told to stay at home and take classes online, student nurses are being told to come in to work in these wards.  Not only are they not paid for that period, but that work costs them money.  Just like any other students, they usually have part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Once employers hear that an applicant is a student nurse working in an acute hospital they do not want him or her.  That is a secondary problem student nurses now face.</p> <p>  We do not want the situation in nursing to reach the point where these students have to leave.  They simply cannot afford to pay for accommodation in cities like Dublin or Cork, where most of the training places are located.  They work 12-hour shifts in many instances, with work expanding beyond the normal shift pattern.  I can find no other word but "exploitation".  We met representatives of the Department of Health last Friday and outlined these concerns.  We have appealed to the Minister and we have appealed to the public to support the student nurses in their campaign to get proper remuneration for what can only be described as work.  </p> <p>  The HSE figures indicate that 50 nurses are becoming infected each week.  That requires a period of absence of 14 days at a minimum.  Many nurses are telling us that the post-Covid-19 infection period can extend to 16, 17 or 18 days or even longer.  That creates a huge gap in the roster.  We must have proper occupational health facilities in place.  I am not talking about a free counselling helpline or a text message asking nurses if they are okay.  We are allowing health service staff who have been in close contact with patients to return to work if they are asymptomatic.  We know too much about this virus to risk that.  Not having a routine testing regime to accompany that policy creates a risk for others who come in contact with that person.  We have to test in acute hospitals and ensure that we identify asymptomatic cases.  We must provide greater protections, in the form of testing, for those who work in our acute hospitals.</p></speech>

I was listening to the hearing from my office before taking my seat.  Ms Susan Clyne's submission states that "[f]or young GPs seeking to establish themselves in a new community, the initial investment costs in premises, equipment, IT systems, insurance etc ... are particularly prohibitive".  How do the primary care centres that have been built in different areas fit into that picture?  Do they alter the situation?</p> <p>  I have previously spoken to this committee about Westdoc Limited and the underfunding that is evident in certain areas.  I am not referring to the most rural areas, but to those in close proximity to Galway city, such as Moycullen and Oughterard.  How offputting is the inability of Westdoc Limited and comparable groups throughout the country to recruit and retain GPs? </p></speech>

They will still have to pay the rent and all the associated overheads.  That does not really help matters.  If the HSE is going to invest in primary care centres I urge it to act in consultation with GPs in the area.  There is little point in building a brand spanking new primary care centre if ten GPs have already built centres in the area.  That would simply be a waste of resources.</p> <p>  Whatever about current GPs and older GPs, who are used to being on a 24-7 contract, young GPs will simply not accept that general medical services, GMS, contract.  Nobody is going to accept a contract under which they have to be available all day, every day.  To a large extent, GPs fund out-of-hours services from their own resources.  Out-of-hours services face problems throughout the country.  They are getting busier and busier, particularly in these times.  We need to separate the issue of funding for out-of-hours services.  That should not be the responsibility of GPs.  Responsibilities are much heavier in more rural areas, which disincentivises younger GPs from establishing themselves there.  We need to look at ways to help GPs establish themselves financially over a period of time.  They need some income certainty in that period of time.  We also need to help existing GPs who are going to retire to take on these younger GPs and transfer practices with reasonable financial models.  We need to grapple with the out-of-hours system.  It is absolutely ridiculous that GPs are expected to pay for locums to work red-eye shifts.  Most GPs work until 8 p.m. or 10 p.m. on the out-of-hours rota.  The red-eye shift from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. is effectively funded by GPs themselves.  A 24-7 contract is not sustainable.</p><p>I thank Ms Clyne.</p><p> My next question is for Professor Irvine.  The year 2012 was a different world, and whatever justification was there at the time, and there were plenty of justifications, I do agree that it is time to look again at that.  I will certainly advocate on behalf of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  Professor Irvine has comparatives to the pre-2012 salaries for Australia, Canada and the US.  How does the public-private model fit in there around consultants working in the private sector as well, or is that excluded under those jurisdictions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Alan Irvine" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#L00200"><p>In Australia, for example, it is quite common for people to predominantly work in the independent sector and do two or three days per week in the public sector.  That is the dominant model in Australia.  I am less familiar with the model in Canada but the remuneration, terms and conditions, and supports are different.  There is also availability of operating lists, of outpatient suites and of the whole multi-professional support.  Doctors are not islands, they work in highly skilled teams.  Nurses and other healthcare professionals are essential and have enough support around those also.  There are lots of differences around the anglophone countries.  North America and Australia are the really only relevant comparators.  That is where we tend to lead people.  One would need to break it down by region.  Certainly, the model in Australia is a very mixed, blended model.  The remunerations in the United States of America are just off the scale and we are not going to replicate those necessarily in Ireland.  We do, however, have to find our own way to bring people in and that means listening.  As I said earlier, we have to listen to people rather than just present them with the take it or leave it option.  That has failed and is failing, and it will always continue to fail if we take that approach.</p></speech>

Deputy Kenny raised the issue of non-EEA doctors in the system, and that they cannot access consultant posts.  If one was to take out the effective embargo on the number of people who can be hired, is there capacity in the system with those doctors to try to make fairly decent headway into the shortage outlined?  Reference was made to the issue going back as far as education and that we are just not educating enough people in certain areas.  What kinds of numbers do those non-EEA educated doctors make up, if there was no block on how many could be recruited?  Would that make any decent headway into the shortage in numbers?</p> <p>  With regard to the recruitment plans for the high-level wholetime staff equivalents for the winter plan, under the heading of nursing midwives, managerial and administration I see that the HSE has proposed employing only 101 more nurses.  Surely this has to be questioned.  The overall recruitment goals, and not just for nursing, possibly need to be questioned.  Based on the presentation the committee has had this morning these numbers seem wholly unrealistic.  What do the witnesses say to this?  What impact will this have on healthcare provision overall?</p> <p>  Student nurses are doing unpaid work, which I believe is absolutely and utterly unseen.  Student nurses are contacting me every single day, including a nurse working on a Covid ward who is not being paid.  It is absolutely and utterly disgraceful that nurses on Covid wards are not being paid.  I wrote to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly, on this matter.  I have heard diddly squat about it.  I am aware that the Union of Students in Ireland have lobbied on this and they too have heard diddly squat on it.  Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha has said that the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation has engaged with the Department.  Does Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha believe that anything is actually going to happen or are we all going to continue to clap for these student nurses and hope for the best?  What sort of engagement has the INMO actually had and is there any genuine intention to deal with this issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.202" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#L00400"><p>I will deal with the non-EU and non-EEA doctor issue.  It is a very complicated issue because one can divide doctors from that category into non-consultant hospital doctors and consultants from those areas.  When we focus on the non-consultant hospital doctors the problem is that they are not able to access the formal training.  The IMO brought up this issue as far back as 2008, and it has taken 12 years give or take for the State to solve this problem.  They can work in posts in Ireland and can work beside somebody who is in a training position.  They are getting the same experience and often getting the same education and the same level of competence as that person, but because of a legal technicality they have not been able to have that experience and education recognised and thus have not been able to achieve the certification to say: "I am a fully trained specialist".  That is their difficulty.  Ultimately, this leads to those doctors having a problem in getting a consultant post because in order to get a consultant post one has to be a fully trained specialist.</p> <p>  On the issue of whether there are enough doctors in the system to fill vacancies in the consultant posts, if we were to increase the number of consultants to get to where we should be at, which is increasing the number of consultants by about 2,000, the answer is "No".  This is because these doctors, unfortunately, have not been able to get the certifications to be able to take on these posts.  As Susan said earlier, there is also a massive ethical problem with countries in the western developed world continually relying on importing healthcare staff, specifically doctors who are being trained in the developing world where we know there are huge heath needs.  The solution here is that we need to have more training places overall; allow those training places to be open competition for doctors, irrespective of what country they trained in; and, increase the numbers of doctors we train in the State so that for every doctor who takes an Irish training post there would be an Irish doctor taking a training post in another country.</p> <p>  The history of medicine has always relied on doctors travelling to different countries either for training posts or for long-term posts for that cross-pollination of ideas and academics.</p></speech>

We put a proposal to them and the Department has confirmed they will revert to us this week.  We await their reply on that.  Our proposal is very simple.  At our conference last Friday week the Minister confirmed that a review will be conducted of the undergraduate payment scheme in general.  That was promised by the former Minister, Deputy Harris in 2019.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has confirmed that the review will be completed within the next month.  In the immediate term, we have sought payment.  It is work, but unfortunately the students find themselves in very busy wards in very busy workplaces where staff are reduced and the qualified staff members are reducing.  The students are being used to fill gaps, as I said earlier.  It is the view of the INMO that these student nurses need the protection of a contract and they need to have the protections of all other workers in those environments in the event that they get sick, which I hope they do not.</p></speech>

My first question is for Ms Clyne.  Ms Clyne has said that GPs need a lot of help establishing themselves.  Obviously it is a huge question, but generally what is Ms Clyne's view on GPs being employed directly by the State?  I am aware that a lot of young GPs do not want to pay rent, rates and staff.  I know it is a very wide question.</p> <p>  My second question is to Professor Irvine on the many people not attending their physicians at this stage because of Covid, and waiting until afterwards with any ailments they may have.  In light of the huge waiting lists outlined in his submission, how worried are his members?</p> <p>  My third question is to Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha, and follows on from Deputy John Lahart's suggestion on childcare.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha said that in London designated schools and cr&egrave;ches are being kept open to facilitate front-line workers in the event that cr&egrave;ches and schools are closed.  Is that a particular request of the INMO?  Deputy Lahart suggested that we could bring this to the parliamentary party meeting tonight, and directly to the Taoiseach and the Minister.  Perhaps I could have Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's view on that also.</p></speech>

The independent contractor model works very well in general practice and can really deliver for patients.</p><p>At the moment, however, the self-employed contractor model is very expensive for younger GPs to get into.  It is not correct to say that GPs are not currently employed.  GPs all over the country are employing other GPs, they just get no support to do so.</p></speech>

The State needs to support new GPs in establishing practices.  In the UK and other jurisdictions, the State assists with the costs of establishment and the ongoing costs of running a practice.  It must be remembered that only 50% of the population are covered by a medical card or GP visit card.  General practice is a mix of public and private and, therefore, the independent contractor model is what works best.  It delivers well and has huge satisfaction ratings.  The younger GPs, however, are not being supported.  The surveys will show that many young GPs do not want to take on the responsibilities of running a business immediately on completing their training.  As they progress through their careers, they become more inclined to do so and are happier to do so.  At the point at which they have just completed training, they need to be able to go into an established practice to get a feel for how things are and to be supported in that practice.  When and if they decide to set up their own practice, they need a pathway to assist them with establishment costs.</p></speech>

It is really important and is a cause for concern for our members.  Many members are saying they are not seeing the volume of people presenting with colorectal or other cancers that would normally be expected based on year-on-year averages.  That is definitely the feedback we are getting.  It is an important message to get out.  There is no question but that we are in the second wave of the pandemic but it is not April.  The health service is better prepared.  People who have urgent symptoms will be seen and assessed and should present to their GPs, possibly remotely if that is the safest way to proceed.  They should also subsequently attend their appointments if they have new symptoms.  We want those people to come because we simply do not know how long this phase is going to last.  Nobody does.  It is not predictable.  People with urgent symptoms need to come and have them investigated and treated.  Time-sensitive cancer care remains in operation, as does time-sensitive care for heart disease.  We want these people to present.  The hospital environment has been made safe and accommodating.  People are much better at dealing with this than we were in April.  We had to learn a lot in April.  Services effectively shut for non-Covid work.  There was a huge burden on us.  Those services are not going to shut again.  We cannot afford to let them.  People should and must present.  It would be welcome to see them.</p></speech>

While I was aware of the pressure on our health workers, I have learned a great deal today about just how bad that pressure is and about how indebted we are to our front-line workers.  Thanks are important but they are just not enough.  If gratitude is to be given meaning it should lead to an overdue reassessment of who we value most in society and how we treat them.  It should not take a pandemic to expose how poorly paid, insecure and badly treated many healthcare workers are.  Society cannot function without them.</p> <p>  I have one question in addition to making that point.  In Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's submission, I read that research has shown that front-line hospital staff and other key workers have a higher chance of experiencing mental health difficulties during the pandemic.  We know the Covid-19 pandemic has created stressful working environments for many people.  I want to again highlight the disgraceful treatment of student nurses who are exposed the dangers of Covid-19 without any payment at all.  This must be corrected.  </p> <p>  I also have a question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  It relates to the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals, particularly nurses.  What supports are needed to address this problem?  I thank all of the groups represented for their fantastic work in looking after the most vulnerable in our society.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#M01000"><p>We surveyed our members very recently.  I do not believe they are out of kilter with healthcare workers throughout the world.  The response rate was very high at nearly 3,000 and nearly 82% of the respondents said that Covid-19 has had a negative impact on their mental health.  That is not surprising.  It is consistent with the findings of other nursing unions across the globe with which we tic-tac all of the time.</p> <p>  The World Health Organization, WHO, says that exposure time must be reduced.  In other words, if I work on a Covid ward, I need to be relieved from work on such a ward and from constantly wearing personal protection equipment, PPE, and to be assured of sufficient rest time to recover before coming back in to face it again.  That is not happening because we are very short-staffed.  We know of instances of nurses across all age groups from students to those who are very close to retirement who must wear PPE constantly for periods of six hours before getting a break for hydration.  One of the simplest things to do is to ensure that nurses finishing a tour of duty have a set period of time, paid for by the employer, to provide relief and to ensure they can look after their own physical and mental health.  This is a very difficult environment.  One gets very warm when wearing PPE.  It is very restrictive.  </p> <p>  Nurses, doctors, speech and language therapists and all other healthcare workers are doing their best to be innovative with regard to communicating with clients.  It is amazing what healthcare workers have done in trying to communicate and get messages across to patients who are intellectually disabled right across the sector, from acute hospitals to community settings and long-term care.  One of the things coming across is exposure to lonely patients.  I refer to patients in the community, particularly the elderly in nursing homes, who no longer receive visitors.  The healthcare workers are now doubling up as their main mental and moral support.  That is fine if a centre has enough staff to provide the required time but staff are feeling guilty because they do not have enough time to spend with these patients.  Of course, there is mental anguish.  We hope not to see a staffing crisis that is even worse than it was going into the pandemic.  We can do things to prevent that.</p></speech>

As I have said, I work as a psychiatrist within the public hospital system.  The pandemic has exposed significant gaps in our mental health services.  The percentage of our total budget we spend on psychiatry is one of the lowest in the world.  I echo what Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has said.  By profession, I am an old-age psychiatrist.  My day job involves me going in and out of nursing homes and visiting people at home.  Isolation and loneliness has been a very significant issue during this pandemic, especially for the elderly.  I welcome the introduction of the concept of the support bubble within the level 5 restrictions.  It was a very good late addition and may help to offset some of the problems we saw during the first wave of the pandemic.</p> <p>  We need better integration of community psychiatry and acute hospital mental health care.  The division of psychiatry out into the community comes with the side-effect of reducing the supports available to the general hospital system in places.  This needs to be seriously thought about.  Liaison psychiatry, the special type of psychiatry in hospitals, needs to be better resourced because not only does it provide care to patients within the hospital, but having a good and well-resourced liaison psychiatry department within a hospital provides a resource for the staff of the hospital.  It is able to look at matters such as psychological first aid, a programme we ran in the Mater hospital in Dublin, and other such initiatives to support staff.  If the staff's mental wellness can be supported, we can prevent mental health problems developing.</p><p>If we can stop it becoming a mental health problem then we can prevent it becoming a mental illness problem.  There is a gradated system from wellness to illness that happens in all parts of the body but specifically with regard to mental health, we have look at the integration of community and acute hospital care.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-21a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2020102100002#N00500"><p>I will be very brief.  What changes do the witnesses want to see with regard to specialist registrars and their training, as well as junior doctors?  I would appreciate a written reply on the changes they would make in order to assist people who are in that category.  There also seems to be a lack of understanding around consultant contracts.  A lot of people do not understand that a lot of consultants under contract are on a one-in-three or one-in-four rota.  That means that they work all day, every day, five days a week and are on call every third or fourth night as well as being on call every third or every fourth weekend.  There are even consultants on one-in-two rotas.  There is a lack of understanding among the public about that.</p> <p>  The other issue that we need to understand is that under the current category B and category C contracts consultants, who number about 2,000, have about 2 million appointments per year outside of their work for the HSE or within the public system.  If there are 3.5 million outpatient appointments annually, this means that if we bring everything into the public sector, we will have to see a huge expansion very quickly.</p> <p>  Another issue I want to raise is the challenges facing GP trainees.  As I understand it, there are currently around 5,000 GP vacancies in the UK.  The IMO referred to the fact that the training of doctors needs to be modernised.  Could we get a written submission on what modernisation is being referred to here?  I ask them to include a response on the number of additional GP training places we need.  I was speaking to a GP last night who told me that one in eight GPs is over 65.  </p></speech>

She referred to inadequate staffing in her presentation.  Does that break down on a regional basis?  I am specifically interested in the mid-west region.  I am a Deputy for Clare and over the past two or three years, the trolley crisis has been at its worst in my region.  I would welcome a brief response on that.</p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Clyne on international recruitment.  I have recently been helping an individual who I do not want identify, except to say that he would be a key individual to recruit into the Irish system, but have come up against a barrier which has not been mentioned today, namely problems with securing a visa from the Department of Justice and Equality so that his family can accompany him here.  He has a young family and will not come here until they can come too so because of an administrative delay, patients are losing out.  My point is that there are barriers other than those already referred to by the witnesses.</p> <p>  Finally, the Hanly report identified the need for 3,600 consultants by 2013 but now the estimated requirement is approximately 4,500.  One can make an analogy with premiership soccer.  There was a time when a decent soccer player would play for any club and be proud to do so but now players only want to play for the London clubs and northern English football has suffered as a result.  There is something quite similar happening with consultants in Ireland.  They do not want to come west of the Shannon.  Endocrinologists, neurologists and all of the other specialists needed west of the Shannon in places like Ennis and University Hospital Limerick are not coming.  I ask Professor Irvine to elaborate on the other barriers that exist beyond the issue of pay which he well articulated earlier.  I think there are unwritten and unmentioned barriers, many of which relate to the unattractiveness of leaving Ireland's cities.</p></speech>

We would argue that we need to decentralise the recruitment process.  It is overly centralised at the minute and our view is that the people in Clare, Limerick and Galway know best how to recruit people into their system and should be given the flexibility to do so, including with regard to contracts.  It should not be a centralised, one-size-fits-all model because that definitely gets in the way of people moving to those locations.</p></speech>

The hospital is trying to open 90 additional beds but it has to fill the existing vacancies before it can start staffing those beds.</p> <p>  There is a great university in the mid-west as well as institutes of technology in Tralee and Castlebar.  They should be running postgraduate courses for nurses in public health nursing, intensive care nursing and so on.  More postgraduate courses for nurses should be provided locally so that nurses do not have to move back to the big cities to further their education.  </p> <p>  I agree with Professor Irvine that the recruitment process is overly bureaucratic and overly centralised.  It needs to be at the level of the hospital and community directors in order to speed it up.  </p></speech>

That is just a simple fact.  It is not always about money.  Doctors and all other healthcare workers want to be able to work in a system that allows them to do the job for which they were trained.  It is time to sit down with us and work through these issues.  We raise them at this committee and similar fora all of the time but nothing happens.  The culture and attitude of the Department and the HSE to the medical profession has to drastically change.</p></speech>
