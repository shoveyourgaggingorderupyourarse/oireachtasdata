We have one apology from Deputy Alan Dillon and Deputy Matt Carthy may be late because he is attending a meeting of the agriculture committee as well.</p> <p>   In order to limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face coverings when moving around the Leinster House campus and when in close proximity to others.  I ask members and witnesses to respect other people's physical space and adhere to public health advice at all times.  Members attending remotely must continue to do so within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  This morning we will engage with officials from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to examine its 2020 financial statements and related matters.  We are joined in the committee room by officials from the SEAI.  They are Mr. William Walsh, chief executive officer; Ms Marion O&rsquo;Brien, director of corporate services; Dr. Ciaran Byrne, director of national retrofit; and Mr. Declan Meally, director of business, public sector and transport.  We are also joined in the committee room by Ms Jenny O&rsquo;Hora, and Mr. Robert Deegan, principal officers from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask those attending remotely to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up any background noise.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are either in silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before starting, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  Within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#A00500"><p>The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which was established in May 2002, works with Irish households, businesses, communities and the Government with the objective of creating a cleaner and more efficient energy future and supporting the development of clean energy technologies.  The authority's income in 2020 totalled &euro;150.7 million, down from &euro;182.4 million in 2019.  In 2020, &euro;145.5 million, or almost 97% of the authority's income, came from Exchequer cash grants via the Vote for Environment, Climate and Communications.  Expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;151.6 million.  Approximately 88% of this expenditure was incurred in a wide range of grant schemes, details of which are provided in note 7 to the financial statements.</p> <p>  The authority also has responsibility for oversight of the building energy rating, or BER, system.  This includes registration of BER assessors, the provision of related information technology tools and systems, the BER national register and overall scheme management and promotion.  BER scheme income for the year was &euro;2.76 million, with expenditure on scheme activities amounting to &euro;2.4 million.  The authority&rsquo;s expenditure on administration amounted to &euro;15.7 million in 2020.</p> <p>  I certified the 2020 financial statements on 29 June 2021 and issued a clear audit opinion.  Given the nature of the authority&rsquo;s main activity as a grant giver, key value for money issues include the extent to which relevant output and outcome targets are set for each of the grant programmes, whether the authority has adequate systems in place to measure and report on the outputs and outcomes achieved relative to measured baselines and whether scarce Exchequer resources are being applied in ways that maximise the long-term benefits to Irish society.</p></speech>

As detailed in his letter of invitation, there are five minutes for an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#A00700"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting today to discuss the SEAI financial statements for 2020.  I am joined today by my SEAI colleagues - Ms Marion O'Brien, director of corporate services; Dr. Ciaran Byrne, director of national retrofit; and Mr. Declan Meally , director of business, public sector and transport.  To assist the discussion today and in line with the letter of invitation, we submitted some briefing material to the committee earlier this week.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to make an opening statement.</p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is at the forefront of delivering a low-carbon economy through measures and activities focused on the transition to a smarter and more sustainable energy future.  SEAI is funded by the Government of Ireland through its parent Department, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, and the Department of Transport.  In 2022, our budget allocation is more than &euro;440 million.</p> <p>  SEAI operates to the highest level of effective corporate governance.  We were the first organisation in Europe, private or public, certified by the National Standards Authority of Ireland to the SWiFT 3000 standard and maintain this governance certification annually.</p><p>In an environment where accountability, transparency and probity are fundamental to SEAI's licence to operate, we work hard to apply best-practice governance processes that deliver consistently high levels of assurance around compliance with relevant laws, regulations and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p><p> Like others, SEAI had to adapt to the unprecedented challenges posed by Covid-19.  Our staff responded in an agile way, ensuring continuity of service while working remotely.  Given the disruption to normal life in 2020, fewer homeowners, communities and businesses availed of grants, such that expenditure across SEAI's various programmes decreased by around 15% year on year.  Much of our work requires access to citizens' homes.  Given the nature of Covid-19, access to homes was very restricted during 2020.  Thankfully, with fewer restrictions, SEAI's support programmes rebounded strongly in 2021, resulting in the highest ever levels of expenditure by SEAI.  This year is set to be another year of significant growth in activity levels.</p><p> SEAI puts citizens, communities, suppliers and other stakeholders at the heart of everything it delivers.  We focus on developing collaborative partnerships, strong engagement and smooth customer journeys for the public we serve.  We provide expert advice to drive positive change through our analysis, modelling and support for policymaking.  We are catalysts for action through grant and incentive programmes we deliver and through our capacity-building processes with citizens, communities and the business and public sectors.  Pursuing our mission, we collaborate closely with a wide range of stakeholders, including Departments and State agencies.  We have had a major and transformative impact on the Irish economy.  In the past decade, our actions have underpinned more than &euro;1.2 billion in energy savings.</p><p> Ireland now has even more ambitious targets and we have been scaling up our operations to meet the challenge.  In the past three years, we have added capacity to deliver capital expenditure programmes and enhance support to our parent Department.  Meeting Ireland's energy and climate targets will require further significant investment by the Government and SEAI is playing a major part, alongside others, to get Ireland on the right track regarding our UN COP21 Paris Agreement commitment trajectory.</p><p> SEAI is at the heart of delivering on the Government's Climate Action Plan 2021.  The plan sets ambitious goals for 2030, including 80% renewable electricity, 600,000 heat pumps, 500,000 B2 home upgrades, almost 1 million electric vehicles, a new microgeneration scheme, large emission reductions in our public service and enterprise sectors and increased investment in research and innovation.</p><p> At SEAI, we have a unique vision for the role we will play in delivering Ireland's energy revolution.  This requires fundamental change across all Irish society.  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the security of supply and cost implications of Ireland's reliance on fossil fuel imports have become very real.  This further underpins the urgency of our energy transition.  We are collaborating with colleagues in our parent Department and State agencies to mitigate the cost and security of supply impacts that will affect all of society.  Through energy independence, we can remove our reliance on imported fossil fuels, lower our carbon emissions and secure our future.  The global pandemic had devastating impacts in Ireland and globally, but the resulting limitations demonstrated that collective and cohesive action can have a significant impact on our energy-consumption behaviours.</p><p> The way in which we live must change, but it will be a change for the better.  This change will mean our buildings will be warm, comfortable and not heated by oil or gas.  Our communities will be leading the generation of renewable energy and our transport fleet will be electrified, charged by a renewable-energy-powered electricity system.  Sustainable energy needs to be the norm.  The quicker we achieve this, the sooner the broad range of benefits will flow to Irish citizens and businesses in the form of cheaper-to-run, warmer and healthier buildings, improved air quality, increased competitiveness, improved security of energy supply and many others.  At SEAI, we are acutely aware that the energy transition must be a just transition.  This is carefully considered across our programmes of delivery, research and policy advice.</p><p> SEAI has a strong body of evidence to illustrate the costs and benefits of the sustainable energy transition.  It is based on research and expertise from two decades of programme delivery.  We are clear that, for much of what is needed, the benefits far outweigh the costs, especially when the multiple benefits &mdash; financial, economic, employment, health, security of supply and environmental &mdash; are considered.</p><p> We passionately believe clean energy transition must happen and we stand ready to support all of Irish society on the journey.  The demands on Ireland's energy and environment require us to work at pace and to deliver ever greater results, learning and improvements.  This work is key to driving Ireland's contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, securing a healthy planet for future generations.</p><p> I thank our colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport for their ongoing support, particularly in the context of the actions assigned to SEAI under the Climate Action Plan 2021.</p><p> I acknowledge the strategic leadership provided by the board members of SEAI, particularly their support in developing a new statement of strategy for the organisation.  The statement will be published shortly.  I pay tribute to the staff of SEAI for their commitment and dedication, particularly for their efforts and support as we addressed the significant challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p> We are a strong and fully co-ordinated team, ready to embrace the next stage of our development.  In collaboration with key stakeholders, we will co-ordinate and lead the efforts to achieve the ambitious targets set out in Climate Action Plan 2021 and the national development plan.</p><p> I welcome the discussion with the committee and am happy to answer any questions members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

I call on the lead committee member today, Deputy Catherine Murphy, who has 15 minutes.  She is to be followed by Deputy O'Connor who, along with everyone else, will have ten minutes.  We will break for ten minutes at about 11 a.m.</p></speech>

The Chair has already outlined that we have a short time in which to put questions and get responses, so I will try to bear that in mind.  The staff complement in 2020 was 93, which was up two from 2019, when it was 91.  What is the current staff complement?  What are the positions SEAI is funded to fill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B00400"><p>I will ask my colleague Ms Marion O'Brien, director of corporate services, to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marion O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B00500"><p>Our current staff complement is just short of 130.  It is about 127.  We are recruiting currently.  We expect to be close to about 200, in total, by the end of the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B00600"><p>Whatever we spend, we have to spend it wisely, but we really do need to spend at scale given the challenge in front of us.  I presume we will see the roll-out of the one-stop shops and all of that.  Will that be this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marion O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B00700"><p>The one-stop shops have been launched.  That is expected to roll out this year.  We are recruiting at present.  In fact, we have advertised and there is quite a strong response to our advertisements at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B00800"><p>Is there a sufficient number of staff to deal with the plans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marion O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B00900"><p>We have a workforce plan that sees us staffing up this year.  There are to be further staff increases next year, subject to approval of budgets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B01000"><p>So it will be ongoing.  Obviously, this will be dependent on having contractors registered.  What kinds of numbers is SEAI at at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marion O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B01100"><p>I will pass over to my colleague.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B01200"><p>I might take that question.  We have been at this game for about 20-odd years.  In our Better Energy Warmer Homes programme, we actually have about 1,300 contractors registered.  This relates to the individual measures.  On the one-stop shops, which the Deputy mentioned, we have 15 larger-scale entities going through the process.  We issued contracts to the first this week, and we expect more to come behind.  We have 33 contractors in our warmer homes programme.  We have a considerable number of contractors with experience.  We have had expressions from others who wish to move into the industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#B01300"><p>Mr. Walsh said SEAI does modelling.  Obviously, it will be advising the Government on public policy.  The kind of stock local authorities will be retrofitting will include old local authority houses from the 1950s with two or three bedrooms.  What is the cost of a deep retrofit of a house fitting that profile?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#C00100"><p>I will give the example of a terraced home which is mass concrete, 1930s with a BER F rating.  This is a cost taken from a pilot scheme we did last year.  The install cost would have been &euro;36,000.  On the current one-stop-shop, OSS, grant levels which were announced in February, the homeowner would have received &euro;18,600 in grants, which is around 50%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#C00200"><p>Local authorities have been allocated &euro;27,000 to retrofit individual homes.  They do not have another income.  Would that be sufficient to carry out a retrofit?  I know there can be economies of scale but is that sufficient?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#C00300"><p>Yes it would.  Unfortunately there is an element of asking how long is a piece of string because one of the bigger costs of a retrofit is putting in the electrical technology of a heat pump.  A heat pump and external wall insulation are probably the two biggest costs.  We have had meetings with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities and have shared cost data with them.  We think the &euro;27,000 is a figure that can bring up a house to a B2 rating.  Again, it depends where you start from and where you are going to.</p></speech>

Obviously the Office of Public Works, OPW, take its instructions from it about what it requires.  Emissions from its previous building were 77,000 kg of CO2 and then 135,000 kg in 2020 in the new building.  Why did SEAI make that move?  Was this considered given that SEAI is the organisation that is supposed to show the way forward?  What was the objective?  What instructions did it give to OPW not only on the energy rating of the building but also its output and the size of the building required?</p></speech>

The SEAI, Science Foundation Ireland, the Marine Institute and IDA Ireland shared a building.  IDA Ireland has similar powers to the OPW to purchase property.  IDA Ireland led an interagency move because we were being evicted from Wilton Park House, as the organisation that owned it was redeveloping it and had other tenants.  We were forced to move in 2019.  As part of that move, IDA Ireland led an interagency process where it went through a significant process to secure and procure offices which SEAI was involved in.  IDA Ireland is the lead tenant in 3 Park Place at present.</p> <p>  On the levels of increase in energy consumption in the new building, our footprint is twice as big as our previous footprint which was 12,500 sq. ft., which we were squeezed into.  We have doubled our footprint to allow us to scale up to what we are doing at the moment and to future-proof our premises.  </p></speech>

It is leased.  At a very high level - because the Deputy has asked that we keep our answers succinct - we had a very low rent in Wilton Park House given that IDA Ireland had entered an arrangement with the landlord back in the 1980s.  The cost per square foot doubled to &euro;57 per square foot and was around &euro;30 to &euro;32 in Wilton Park House, which was way below market average.  The cost nearly doubled but also the footprint because we required more space for the staff that we have now and will have in the future.</p></speech>

At the moment there are around 55,000 of what we class as electric cars, that is, fully electric, plug-in hybrids, any car with a plug on it on the road.

I think some of it may be in the briefing document anyway.  I am noticing my time and I want to ask a final question.  Regardless of how many houses we retrofit, and I hope we can do that to a very significant scale, it will not matter if we do not have the electricity that is generated from renewable sources.</p><p>The Minister projected that significant additional offshore wind will be generated in approximately four years.

There is a focus in government and industry to get those actions taken.  Indeed, a whole jigsaw has to be put together to get there.  The supply chain to get materials in to build the offshore farms is one of them.  The consent in terms of planning and a fast process for developers is another.  There needs to be planning certainty for developers in terms of investment coming in.  Things are moving but from an SEAI and decarbonisation perspective, we cannot move fast enough on this.  We are conscious of the rights of communities to be involved and consulted with, and to benefit from the development of our wind energy ambitions.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I will start with issues pertaining to transport if that is okay.  Mr. Meally is here from the transport section.  I would like to ask about work that is being undertaken by the SEAI to help retrofit the national car fleet.  In terms of grants that are currently available, the SEAI has set a cap at &euro;60,000, which is now in place and correct in terms of the cut-off.  What was the logic around that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Meally" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#D00600"><p>Again, policy decisions are taken at departmental level at the Department of Transport with the Minister.  That looks at the budget that is available in terms of where the best spread of the budget is.  We would, therefore, look at the numbers of cars that are coming in and the affordability.  The decision at the time on the capping was brought in by the Minister, in discussions with his officials and ourselves, to look at where this should land.  The majority of the cars and fleets were coming in at approximately &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000 and those were considered to be the ones that should attract the grant aid as such.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#D00700"><p>Something I have noticed from looking at car prices online is that there seems to be a degree of price gouging going on in terms of the difference for, let us say, a person buying a new Avensis, for example, that would probably have cost &euro;35,000 at the time.  If he or she was choosing the hybrid model of the same vehicle, it was often the case that it could be multiples of thousands of euros more expensive.  Does Mr. Meally think the grant that is in place at the moment is sufficient?  In terms of car brands in Ireland, does he think major dealerships are abusing the Government support that has been put in place to increase the price on hybrid models?  Across a multitude of different brands - not to pick any one specifically - there seems to be a very significant issue that they just jacked up the price of the hybrid and electric models versus that of the traditional diesel and petrol engines.</p></speech>

It has certainly not been impacted through the grant.  That is being monitored.  Again, it is cross-European in terms of what they can attract for the cars and car stock and what they can sell.  It is working.  Obviously, that market is being watched by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to keep an eye on the pricing that is in place.</p> <p>  From the grant point of view, we look at the base metal price of the cars that are coming in and see how they compare across Europe to ensure it is quite even and adequate and that there is not anything going on like the Deputy suggested in terms of gouging.  It is an open market.  Electric vehicles are more expensive but we are seeing the prices coming down all the time in relation to the benefits.  More and more stock is coming in as well.</p></speech>

It is a concern.  Part of my concern originates from the fact that we are now facing a situation whereby the State is pursuing a strategy of banning the sale of new diesel vehicles by 2030.</p> <p>  We have this situation whereby many people are not in a position to purchase new vehicles because of the enormous cost of purchasing cars.  They are faced with the situation whereby they have older cars on which they are paying high levels of road tax.  I do not think the grant that is in place at the moment is significant enough to enable people to make that decision to change to or buy an electric car in many cases, particularly for families who need the space.  Those cars are quite expensive if someone is buying a saloon car or some type of crossover that would be suitable for younger kids.</p> <p>   Does Mr. Meally think the SEAI has any scope in its existing budget, which is quite small?  I think it is approximately &euro;28 million in the year towards transport although I stand to be corrected.  Is there any scope for the authority to increase the supports it has available in that area?</p></speech>

There have naturally been some supply chain issues in terms of demand, obviously, with Covid-19, but also impacts in terms of semiconductors and some activity that is required for those cars that have kept the supply chain at bay.</p> <p>  We have seen that the issue people had originally when they were trying to make a decision was that the ranges were not there on the cars.  The ranges are there now.  The cars can do 400 km and 500 km.  We say to people who are making those decisions now to do the maths on the cars.  When someone takes in the total cost of ownership of a petrol or diesel car versus an electric car, it is much cheaper to run and own an electric car compared to a petrol or diesel car over ten years.  The fuel prices at the moment make it even more of an economic benefit to actually buy and own a car.  If we look at the deals that are available through dealerships in terms of monthly payments on a new car plus the running costs of an electric car, which are actually minuscule in comparison to a petrol or diesel car, the overall total cost of ownership is actually less.  That is affordable for anybody who is looking at the cars right across the board.  There are cars that are now &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000, and that can actually be achieved-----</p></speech>

I thank him for his response on that.</p> <p>  Does he have any concerns or has the SEAI done any analysis overall, and I will open this question to any witness who wishes to answer, when it comes to the strain that is being put on it the national grid the moment?  We are in a very precarious circumstance as we speak in terms of the overall capacity of the grid.  If we are looking at this change in the national car fleet towards the usage of electric charging points throughout the country, however, will that not collapse the grid?</p></speech>

Up to 500,000 cars can be taken on the grid as it stands.  We have 55,000 cars, therefore, there is no issue at the moment.  There may be an issue as we start to evolve towards 2030 but they will be taken into account as the grid expands and develops.  We could not add 1 million cars now but we can add up to 500,000 without having significant changes to the grid.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;100 million is being spent on energy efficiency schemes by the SEAI.  I would like to gain an understanding of the schemes the SEAI is providing for businesses that may wish to go carbon neutral, particularly in rural areas and towns where they may actually have the space behind or above premises for solar and small wind microgeneration.</p><p>This is an area in which we are not at the races at all in comparison to other countries in the vicinity of Ireland.  The Danish, and some other Scandinavian countries, have excellent schemes in place and have very much encouraged people to undertake work in microgeneration.  We have limited solar in this country, especially for the heating of water.  When it comes to Ireland's venture into renewables, does the SEAI believe we could do more when it comes to microgeneration, perhaps by setting a target for each house and individual dwelling that has the capacity to generate its own electricity or be a net contributor to the grid?</p></speech>

They are available straightaway to homes and we have one ready to launch for businesses as well.  We have already engaged through our communities programme and seen tens of millions being invested by farms, businesses and communities in solar, in terms of installing it on their business premises, on farm roofs and on farm sheds.

From the businesses point of view, last year, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we launched the energy hub for businesses to go online to join the energy academy and learn what they need to do to start the process and understand where they can have the savings.  We have been working with large businesses for more than 20 years to understand where they can make savings in energy management standards.

Do its targets contain any reference to geographic or income spread?  Is the SEAI simply interested in the number of raw houses that are retrofitted?</p></speech>

Every parish in this country will require homes to be retrofitted.  The budget between now and the end of 2030 is approximately &euro;8 billion.  Of that, &euro;4 billion is allocated to the energy-poor sector.  For all the applicants at this point, it is a demand-led programme.  The can-pay sector have to apply for it and that is a demand-led programme.  Similarly, the warmer homes programme is also demand-led.  We have been publicising the programme and encouraging people to apply.  In that sense, there are targets.</p></speech>

To be clear, for the energy poor sector, in that particular programme the cost of the retrofit or the upgrade of homes is fully funded by the State.  In the can-pay sector it is obviously up to the homeowners, but within that part of it there is also quite a spread because some people are well able to afford a particular retrofit, while others are not.  In that regard, at the recent launch on 8 February, the Deputy might recall we put in high grant levels of up to 80% for attic and wall insulation, specifically targeting those who are in the can-pay sector but who do not qualify for the full upgrade and do not have a huge amount of disposable income.</p></speech>

My colleagues in the Department are working directly with our finance people on the loan scheme.  They are running the loan scheme through the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI.  They will ultimately set up the scheme and the Government will, in effect, be the first 20% loan guarantee.  In other words, the Government will underwrite the loan to a point which then allows the pillar banks to get involved and offer loans to the public at a much lower interest rate than is currently available.  It is expected that the EIB is currently in its due diligence phase and because it is a regulatory piece - I have to be honest that I am not an expert on this - there is a significant amount of due diligence to be done on the banking side of it.  We expect that to be done by quarter 3 and we hope to be in the process of rolling it out to customers in quarter 4 of this year.</p></speech>

Is it envisaged that the situation will be that those who can afford to pay for everything upfront, for example, the &euro;25,000, will get all the work done without needing to take on the cost of what would be rebated at the other end?  The SEAI's plan is to make it easier again by facilitating, as Dr. Byrne said, hopefully, low-interest State-backed loans.</p></speech>

Under the scheme, they would have to pay twice as much upfront and then wait to seek the rebate.  I asked that question because many people have flagged the issue.  I noticed that the opening statement mentioned "energy transition must be a just transition."  It appears that it is not really.  The options open to people who cannot afford to pay for everything at once are far less.  It comes back to my initial question about geographical and income spread in the scheme.  Has the SEAI recommended income caps or means testing at all?</p></speech>

To clarify the point on individual measures, homeowners pay upfront but they claim the money back from the SEAI.  We have a very efficient grant payback system.  While they pay the money upfront, the turnaround in paying back the grant is not weeks and months; it is very quickly thereafter.  We have been doing the better energy homes scheme for the past 15-odd years.  We have put in hundreds of thousands of measures through that scheme to a significant degree.</p></speech>

It looked across the income spectrum, the age spectrum and the home-owner types and we landed on the current grant levels.  However, we are on a journey so what we start off with in 2022 will quite likely not be what we will be doing in 2028 or 2030.

Within the remaining &euro;4 billion the grant levels have been set, even in February at 80% in terms of wall cavity insulation which are significant measures.

In regard to private rented accommodation, where landlords can avail of the deep retrofitting grant and they can ask a tenant to move out while the work is ongoing.  By law they have to offer the property back to the tenant but because the property has been brought up to a certain BER standard they are exempt from the limits of the rent pressure zone.  While by law they can offer the property back to the tenant, they do not have to keep the rent as it was.  They can hike the rent up.  I asked the Minister who said it would be monitored as the scheme goes forward.  Is the SEAI monitoring that in regard to who the applications are coming from?  For example, is the deep retrofitting scheme primarily going to private rented property, be that landlords or vulture funds?  This could be a real problem.</p></speech>

We are monitoring who applies to our scheme but it will be appreciated we do not have control or sight over the rental piece and what landlords do.  That is a different policy area.  We certainly have good visibility into our schemes.  There is an issue with renting as well in terms of the split incentive situation where the landlord pays but the tenant benefits.  We are working on that with our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage - it is not just an Irish problem, it is a European-wide problem - to figure out how we might address that in order to get more rental homes into the schemes.</p></speech>

While it is monitoring, is the SEAI collecting data to see exactly?  If the deep retrofitting scheme results in people being evicted by being offered the property back but at an increased rent, it is going to add to homelessness.  Has the SEAI spoken to the Minister about this?  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, said it will be monitored.  Has it been discussed indepth?  I am trying to pre-empt something that was not foreseen initially but could become a real problem.</p></speech>

While SEAI would not maintain the numbers for the reasons for those kinds of evictions, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, does.  The evidence in the past has been that there have been very low numbers of evictions for this reason.  It is something they are acutely aware of.  The Residential Tenancies Board has been before a committee where this issue came up.  It is something it is aware of, the SEAI, the Minister and the Department are aware of and we will all be monitoring it jointly.

We talked a little this morning about the increasing use of electric cars and the need to roll out a network of charging points.  The public charge points scheme is in particular, for those who are not aware, for people for whom home charging is just not possible.  In my constituency there are many terraced houses where people park on-street and they would need access to that system.  I understand that as part of the scheme grants of up to &euro;5,000 are awarded to support the development of on-street public charging.  Dublin City Council actually applied and was approved for nine public charge points.  What happened with this funding?  I have been chasing it up and Dublin City Council informed me it has not received any funding under this initiative despite receiving a letter of offer last summer.  The SEAI was repurposing the scheme to reflect the actualities of the market better; that is the phrase that I have from my questions.  On top of this, the Minister for Transport informed me on Tuesday that &euro;143,000 plus some change has been allocated by his Department in total to date.  Where is the funding, where does that money lie?  I understand the Dublin local authority electric vehicle charging strategy is underway and is due to be published soon.  We will see more in this area but that is not really my question in terms of what DCC is doing.  I want to know what has happened to the funding that was supposed to be allocated under the public charge points scheme from July 2021, nearly nine months ago.</p></speech>

Just to explain the way we look at the charging, the charging strategy has four levels of charging, home charging, on-street charging which is called public charging, destination charging which would be for hotels or workplaces and finally the fast charging which you see on motorways.  The public charging is for people who do not have off-street parking.  We brought in a grant two years ago for local authorities to be able to apply and put in a charger, if there is demand from people on their streets who say they want a charger, and the local authorities get a &euro;5,000 rebate from ourselves for it.  That is still an open call available to local authorities to draw down.  What has happened in the meantime is the local authorities are looking at their own strategies, whether it is better to provide local hubs of charging, or is it better to do it on-street, or perhaps to replace and have trickle chargers on street lights.  They have been working through that for the past 12 to 18 months to see what is the best local authority strategy and how to address that.  Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and others have been working on that.  That is why discussions-----</p></speech>

People tell me all the time that they want on-street charging.  There is a significant appetite for it.</p> <p>  I want to move to the one-stop-shop programme.  I am not sure which of our guests is best placed to respond on it.  A constituent of mine has had work done under the programme.  Obviously, it is great to have a one-stop-shop model.  The constituent has a concern regarding the transparency of the programme.  The homeowner asked SEAI for details on what work on his or her home is being claimed for, when inspections are happening and the quantum of the grant provided.  The SEAI responded that due to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, it cannot discuss the status of an application with the homeowner.  Why can a homeowner not get details from the SEAI in respect of work being carried out on his or her home? If there is a dispute between the one-stop shop and the homeowner, for example, simply telling the homeowner to trust the one-stop shop is problematic for the homeowner if there is an opaqueness there.  I appreciate that the contract is between the one-stop shop and the SEAI, but is there anything stopping the SEAI including in those contracts that it will share details on progress and other relevant matters with the homeowner?  Why is a layer of opaqueness being added to the one-stop-shop process?</p></speech>

The one-stop shop as we are launching it forward is slightly different.  We had a precursor pilot programme whereby a contractor would have three or four homeowners together under a project scheme, if you like.  We would liaise with the contractor and the contractor would then liaise with the homeowners.  I do not understand that the homeowner cannot get information on what works were done on his or her home because that is a relationship between the homeowner and the contractor.

The homeowner should be in a position to get the information pertaining to his or her home.  It may be a case involving a contractor, and the project being bundled with four or five other homes.  In the previous schemes, we had four or five contracts bundled together, so the homeowner might have to be able to get his or her own particular information out of that.  A contractor might come to us with a scheme for &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 and within that there might be ten homes.  What we have are the details of the &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000 but we may not necessarily have the full detail on the ten individual homes within that.  I do not know the specifics of the situation to which the Deputy refers but the homeowner should be able to get information about his or her home.</p></speech>

It speaks to that governance side of things.  Coming from the construction industry and having worked in the services and sustainable design area, I am aware that the level of paperwork and regulation can be onerous, particularly for small contractors.  Contractors often take on the burden of regulation and paperwork for the homeowner, for example.  Is the SEAI constantly working to ensure that burden is being lessened as much as possible?  As more programmes are added, a level of complexity will be added.  It is not always obvious.  We need to give people choice, but it is not always obvious which programme one should choose.  Is work being done consistently to ensure there is the least amount of red tape and paperwork for homeowners but also for contractors?  Some contractors are basically a micro-company with fewer than ten employees and the burden on them to access the schemes should be as little as possible.</p></speech>

We have significant targets out to the end of the decade and the only way we will reach those targets is by scale.  To get scale, one has to streamline processes and pare back the non-effective or non-value-adding parts of the process.  One must also bear in mind the other side of the equation, which is that we are dispersing Exchequer money to private entities, be they contractors or, ultimately, homeowners, so we have significant Government requirements to which we must adhere.</p> <p>  As regards what we are looking at, in the case of the new one-stop shops, for example, we took a design-thinking approach to start from the outside in and ask how can we make this as simple as possible.  We are starting to look at all of our other schemes in that context.  It is an iterative process; it will not happen as a once-off.  It is something one constantly trims and changes.  The idea is that we adhere to all the governance requirements, of which there are several, and also make it as easy as possible for companies such as those the Deputy described - two-man-and-a-van companies or firms with eight or ten employees - that do not have the back-up and resources for all of that.  We are moving a lot of the processing to an electronic format and we are streamlining many of the requirements.  It is an ongoing process.</p></speech>

As regards offshore energy, the focus Ireland had in the years up to 2020 was particularly on wave energy because we were going to have enough onshore wind and we were looking at wave energy as a new technology.  We have a fantastic wave resource on the west coast.  That has changed in recent years, however, in terms of policy.  Just this week, a new Bill was launched that relates to maritime planning opportunities.  There are now seven projects in the offing that have been in development and planning and doing their environmental assessments and so on.  Six of the projects are off the east coast and one is off the west coast.  In terms of the offshore opportunity, as Mr. Walsh stated, 5 GW is what is needed by 2030.  The progress that has been accelerated in the past 12 months or more has been on the planning and consenting side and to get the streamlining of those actions in place.</p></speech>

They will be coming on stream in 2025, assuming that all of the ducks - excuse the pun - are in a row in the context of what needs to happen in terms of planning, environmental considerations, consenting, grid connections and all of that.  Much of the environmental work has been progressing in recent years in terms of seabed surveys, bird analysis, consultations and all those kinds of things.  Much of that work has been ongoing but it is about making sure projects follow due process through the maritime Bill.  We should then start to see them being installed and starting to kick off from 2025.  Of course, they will not be completely built but at least the first phases will start to come on stream from then.</p></speech>

That is what EirGrid has in terms of its own grid strategy.  It is not something we are directly involved in.  Obviously, we feed into it.

What is Mr. Meally's perception of that?  The opportunity off the west coast is without parallel.  All the briefing documents, including the documents on SEAI's website, the 2011 to 2050 strategy, show that the opportunity is without parallel.  That document from 2011 suggests that in the period from 2020 to 2030, we would be exporting energy as a consequence of wave energy, but now potentially floating offshore wind.  Where are we on that?</p></speech>

It is a very tough regime in terms of operating there.  What has come on stream much faster than we realised is floating offshore wind.  Floating offshore wind has been tested and proved at scale in the North Sea.  A turbine does not operate at 100% of the time but in the North Sea it is possible to get about 40% to 45% of the effectiveness of the turbine and maybe even a bit higher than that.  If we go into the Atlantic, we could get up to 80% because of the wind.</p></speech>

We have our own Atlantic marine energy test site.  We want to see that operational by 2025 to test floating offshore wind in the Atlantic.  We could see them coming on stream a lot quicker than we had realised.  Again, it will be the consenting because they will be much further out, beyond the horizon but much bigger scale.  It is evolving at a much faster pace than people had originally realised.  We will probably see floating wind coming in by around 2030.</p></speech>

I might put this question to the Department.  I am hearing from Irish-backed operators who are operating throughout Europe that Ireland is not ready in terms of grid.  It is not ready in terms of strategy.  It is not operating at the pace that the market is operating at in terms of being ready for the commercial viability of offshore floating wind.  Is that correct?  Where are we on that?</p></speech>

As my colleague has outlined, the offshore opportunities are like a jigsaw.  The Deputy identified the pieces of the jigsaw - the grid and the investment from developers.  In SEAI we have seen a real acceleration in this.  We have seen the Department focus on addressing the delays in the consenting system.  Within the Department there has been an upscaling of resources in this area.  We are seeing an acceleration of activity to support the deployment of offshore wind based on the timelines outlined in the climate action plan and possibly sooner given the security of supply issues arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>  As an organisation, we are encouraged by what we see but we need that to continue to accelerate.  We also need strong engagement from communities because they are critical to this piece.  Their buy-in, engagement, consultation, consent and promotion of this are very important because we have seen in the past that if we get things wrong, it pulls everything back.  It is a piece that we all need to push for as a society.</p></speech>

That is why I am asking Mr. Walsh.  I think the opportunity is extraordinary.  Given that the pace has increased commercially, which is what we are hearing from industry, and that sentiment is changing regarding offshore wind not because of the climate imperative but because of the energy security difficulties that we have, there is an enormous opportunity.  I see it changing in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire where we are talking about visible fixed turbines off what is a beautiful coastline.  Other constituencies will also have that.  I see attitudes changing considerably and the opportunity is now.  I thank Mr. Walsh for answering my question.  I am very interested in it and I would love to hear more from him about it in the future.</p></speech>

In the North Sea they have looked at storing hydrogen in the base of the floating turbine, decanting that hydrogen and then taking it in ships back onshore.  That technology can evolve in other ways rather than having everything connected to the grid.  That is the other part.</p></speech>

I wish to touch on electric vehicles.  The SEAI annual accounts highlight that half of drivers are unfamiliar with electric vehicles and how they work.  Less than a quarter say they will consider purchasing an electric vehicle for their next purchase.  I think 6,000 EVs had been sold by mid-August of last year.  It is projected that 175,000 will be sold by 2025 according to the Department of Transport.  Is it Mr. Meally's understanding that we will sell 50,000 or 55,000 vehicles per year over the next three years?</p></speech>

Regarding getting that to 175,000, in the past year 110,000 new cars were sold.  We have doubled the number of cars that have received grant aid each year.  The 55,000, which is where we are now, was actually where the trajectory was going to take us to - the 45,000 by the end of last year which we have hit.  In terms of what we can sell between this year and next year, we believe there is definitely the potential and the appetite.</p></speech>

The supply chain issues with semiconductors and with supplies coming from Russia and Ukraine due to unfortunate circumstances there are constraining some of the supply.  Definitely the demand is there and we are seeing the demand increasing.  We are on target to hit that number, the 175,000.</p></speech>

I have come to an average of around 169,000 cars per year for those years.  Would that be correct?</p></speech>

A number of factors affect getting to the 2030 target.  The cars are becoming cheaper.  The battery technology is becoming better.  There are longer ranges for the cars that are there.  The signal is being given that people will not be able to buy a new petrol or diesel car by 2030.  All those factors are changing behaviour and changing people's attitudes.  The survey the Deputy saw from 2020 has changed dramatically.  We have done a lot of work with the dealerships.  They are saying that most of the demand from people coming into their dealerships nowadays is for electric cars.</p></speech>

I am trying to get to the specifics in terms of how many electric vehicles will actually be sold and the benefits involved.  We must consider this matter in the context of average sales of electric vehicles of 169,000 over a period of time.  To put that in context, car sales at the peak of the Celtic tiger were of the order of 180,000 per year.  Our target is to reach the sale of 169,000 electric vehicles per year at a time we are estimating public transport journeys will increase by 15%.  There is also investment going into active travel.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, talks about the 15-minute city and all of that.  How realistic, therefore, is it that we would sell 169,000 electric vehicles each year for five years?  Is that environmentally beneficial when public transport options may be available to those people who may be in a position to purchase electric vehicles?</p></speech>

There are currently approximately 13 million tonnes of emissions, much of which relates to private driving.  We want to get people out of their cars and onto public transport at the same time as moving our car stock to electric vehicles.  Behaviours and habits will change.  We anticipate a fundamental transition between now and 2030.  Will everybody need to own a car by 2030?  That is another question we will be asking.  We are constantly looking at this issue with the Department of Transport.  The trajectory towards the target for electric cars shows we are on the right path.  We are considering other options with the Department of Transport to make sure there are also public transport options.</p></speech>

These are the Government's established targets.  In respect of those targets, is there a further breakdown of those targets for specific locations to deal with, for example, the urban-rural divide?  What are the demographics involved in terms of income streams?  Our guests will know that researchers from Trinity College and Queen's University Belfast have reported that electric vehicles are luxury goods.  That is reflected in the sales statistics.  Electric vehicles favour those who are wealthier and live in areas where there are public transport options.  They do not favour those who are poorer and live in areas where there is no public transport option.  Such people are hardest hit by the taxes that pay for the grants to fund these electric vehicles in the first place.  Do our guests have sub-targets within the target for the overall numbers of electric vehicles that are expected to be sold?</p></speech>

That is what we are working towards and we are on that trajectory.  Electric vehicles are sold right across the board.  We want to see as many electric cars as possible brought into the general stock of cars.  They will then become second-hand cars, go into the fleet and work their way right through it.  That is where the grants are focused.</p></speech>

Electric vehicles differ from internal combustion engines in their technology.  I remind the Deputy of a time when widescreen televisions were luxury goods.  That was not long ago.  Many people now have widescreen televisions because they are available at a very cheap rate.  We have seen improved technology in electric vehicles.</p></speech>

The Government did not give a grant to those people who were already in a position to purchase high-end televisions at that time.</p></speech>

If we come back to this committee room in 2025, we hope to be speaking about internal combustion engines being expensive and electric vehicles being cheap because technology is driving the market that way.  That is, of course, subject to what we are seeing at the moment with the supply chain issues in the world.  We in the SEAI would be delighted if we could see retrofitting follow electric vehicles.  Everyone is going to be driving an electric vehicle by 2030.</p></speech>

There is a grant available for those people who can afford the tens of thousands necessary to buy a brand new electric vehicle.  The Government is giving those people a grant.  Have our guests examined alternative ways of reaching the same objectives in a fairer way?  Interest-free loans could be an example of that.  Are there other measures that will allow those people who are crucified with carbon taxes and have no public transport options to avail of the sizeable level of Exchequer funding that is going into these schemes?  Such people cannot receive that funding at the moment.</p></speech>

There will be options.  Electric vehicles have overturned everything.  Technology is available from particular brands, which I will not name because I do not want to promote them, and vehicles are getting cheaper.  There has been a fall in prices for some types of electric vehicles in recent years.  Brands have come into the market.  We anticipate that trend continuing.</p></speech>

A very good report was issued by Age Action Ireland in respect of the need for a new energy poverty strategy.  The existing poverty strategy is out of date, as I think we all know.  I hope to get a sense from the SEAI of where it sits in respect of ensuring scarce resources are deployed in a manner that ensures those people who are on very low incomes and who live in fuel-impoverished houses can be targeted in a way that makes sure the resources flow down to those who are most in need.  The new national retrofitting plan, which is part of the climate action plan for 2021, has a target of bringing 500,000 homes to a B2 building energy rating by 2030.  Our guests can question my figures, but we know that something like 18,400 retrofits were completed in 2020, approximately 4,000 of which raised the homes concerned to a B2 standard.  We must, of course, take the pandemic and the associated challenges around meeting targets into account.</p><p>That was challenging in terms of meeting targets.  I want to get a sense from SEAI, from a corporate point of view, whether it sees its role as one that ensures it is not just people with means who take the lion&rsquo;s share of the grants available for retrofitting because right now that is the case, and we can argue justifiably that that is the case.  I want to make sure we have a system in place that ensures people who are fuel impoverished and who are on lower incomes get a greater chunk of that grant aid.</p></speech>

There is a revised energy poverty strategy in production at the moment.  I am not entirely sure if it is has been completed yet, but it is being developed.  On the schemes themselves, we have a very significant target.  We have identified 500,000 B2-rated homes by 2030.  A budget of &euro;8 billion has been allocated to achieve that target.  Half of that budget, &euro;4 billion, is to go to the energy-poor sector.  That, in itself, ring-fences that sector.  Homes that meet a number of different eligibility criteria will be able to achieve that.  Those homeowners get fully funded.  Their retrofit, predominately as we move on and go to a B2 level, will be funded by the State.  It is fair to say that half of the entire budget will go towards the energy-poor sector.</p> <p>  There is another subgroup in the can-pay sector, and we touched on this earlier.  There are certain people who can afford a retrofit right now because they have the means and resources.  There are other people who, for various reasons, do not apply for the fully funded scheme, but who are in the can-pay sector.  Within that context, we are looking at and are in the process of developing a low-interest Government-backed loan scheme to allow them to be able to fund their own retrofit.  The Minister also recently announced significantly enhanced grant levels for attic and cavity insulation.  That figure is up to 80%.  Those two measures alone are relatively quick, easy to do and can have a very significant impact on the energy and thermal performance of a home.  We are taking that important principle on board.  It is part of the climate action plan and the just transition that we make sure nobody is being left behind.</p></speech>

We are all talking the language of the just transition but nobody has been able to identify what that means in real terms.  Dr. Byrne talked about "energy poor", but that does not necessarily mean income poor.  A distinction has to be made here.  I could be living in a well-appointed, high-value house in south Dublin, for instance - I do not mean to unfairly target south Dublin or characterise it in a particular way - and it could be worth up to &euro;1 million, but it could be energy poor.  Yet, the income coming into the house might a multiple figure of what might be coming into a typical 1970s bungalow in rural north Cork, for instance.  In the income levels there could be a massive disparity.  I am seeking an understanding from SEAI on whether or not Government policy is being directed to ensure that SEAI targets fuel-impoverished or energy-impoverished homes, but also households where the income levels are much lower.  That is the key.</p></speech>

Previously, the eligibility criteria were disjointed from the home.  The Government's decision on 8 February was to focus on the worst performing homes, which were the E, F and G rated homes.  Those homes are the worst-performing homes from an energy performance perspective.  In the warmer homes scheme we are prioritising those homes at the lower end of the BER scale.  There is, as the Deputy can imagine, a quite significant overlap between the worst performing homes and the-----</p></speech>

However, you could be living in an E, F or G BER-rated house and be a multimillionaire with plenty of cash in the bank.  I am trying to get a sense as to whether the SEAI has received direction from the Government from the point of view of having a social policy instrument that targets people who depend on the State for their income, who are on meagre pensions or who are on low incomes.</p></speech>

This includes the energy poverty scheme, the incapacitated child allowance and the disability allowance in that if you are on it for more than six months or have a child under seven.  Those eligibility criteria are focused on those who are at the lowest end of the scale.</p></speech>

The recent report, which was published late last year, from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs for a zero-carbon economy identified that approximately 17,000 staff are required to satisfy this part of the industry.  We have been liaising with our colleagues in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Some &euro;22 million was allocated this year and &euro;70 million is going to nearly zero energy building, NZEB, and green economy for the creation of additional places.  We are basically going to double the number of training places from about 2,500 up to nearly 5,000.  We are also plugging directly into the education and training boards, ETBs, two of which are up and running, and three of which we are in the process of establishing, for the expressed purpose of training operatives in relation to the retrofitting industry.  Areas such as Laois and Offaly have a training centre in Mount Lucas.  We have linked our own contractors to the education and training board in Mount Lucas to join hands to help to get staff trained.</p> <p>  The point about training is very interesting.  A significant amount of academic training is not required.  Relatively short courses can get people upskilled, reskilled in many cases, or new into the industry.  There are a number people who are starting to reskill.  There are people, for example, in the plumbing industry, who are looking at how to reskill in heat pumps.  There are a number courses being put on by the ETBs in that regard.  It is about scaling up.  We are lifting all the boats, but we have been plugged in very closely to the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the ETBs on that.</p></speech>

Does that mean that when the technological solution becomes cheaper, that is where things will land in terms of a demand, supply and a price point?  I ask this because, based on Dr. Byrne&rsquo;s previous replies in respect of electric vehicles, that while it has built in thresholds in terms of grants, it seems it is ultimately waiting for the market to decide the cost of the vehicle.  With respect, I am not sure if that is the right policy intervention.  I would be glad to hear his views on that.</p></speech>

The lower limit is &euro;14,000.  There are no cars at the lower level.  The grant is even right across the board.  Originally, we were giving grants to plug-in hybrids, which also had petrol and diesel.  That was phased out because, there was a battery plus an engine on that car.  The grant is now only for battery electric vehicles.  This is about making sure as many emissions are removed from the system as possible.  It is emissions based, rather looking at what the market is doing.  We are narrowing the bands as necessary.</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Carthy&rsquo;s question, the total cost of ownership of an electric car, for anybody doing the maths, is way less than a petrol or diesel car.  It is about anybody right around Ireland looking at what it costs them to run on petrol and diesel, as well as the cost of their loan or whether the vehicle was second hand.  They could probably get a new electric car and run it for less than they would for a second-hand petrol or diesel car at the moment.  We are encouraging everybody to look at this, anywhere in Ireland.  Everybody should be doing the maths and seeing that this is an opportunity.</p></speech>

A grant is an incentivisation to address a market failure.  The Department of Transport makes policy in the area of supports and subventions for electric vehicles  We have demonstrated through the recent policy adjustments we can be agile when we see market interventions that are required, such as the &euro;60,000 cap that was put in or the PHEVs dropping from the scheme.  When we see these measures, they can be responded to in a flexible and agile way.  That is important in terms of ensuring that Exchequer funding goes to support market failure and to incentivise technology that we want.</p></speech>

With that in mind, I am very concerned that not only might we not meet targets but that we might not be anywhere near them.  When you are looking at infrastructural construction projects like we are, 2030 is not that far away.  Particular to that is a wind farm energy hub or construction base that has been proposed for Rosslare Europort.  Many of our own experts say it is the ideal strategic place for an infrastructure hub.  Given our nearest neighbours are no longer in the EU, does the SEAI have any input into where we should place a construction hub?</p></speech>

It is not something the SEAI is directly involved in.  The Irish Maritime Development Office, IMDO, looks at it and it would have been looking at the ports development.  It is part of a wider cross-departmental group that is looking at the infrastructure and the evolution as to what needs to happen.  We in the SEAI are looking at the research area, the technologies and what needs to happen, for example, across the grid.  The ongoing discussion is about where they are going to be located, because we are not going to be manufacturing a lot of them but they will need lay-down areas close to the ports, such as at Rosslare or even Killybegs, which has started into that area as well.  It is going to be deciding where is the land that is needed and how can they have quay access to it.  It does not need large infrastructure but will need quay access and that is going to take some time.</p></speech>

That is fine.</p> <p>  Going back to what we said about electric cars, everything related to our 2030 targets is based on cars because it is not based on commercial vehicles.  There is not, as yet, any suitable replacement.  They cannot correlate the weight increase in the batteries and the unladen weight of the vehicle for the payload.  Does the SEAI have any input into that?  Does it have any engagement with the commercial sector on where it may go with electric vehicles or ones that use alternatives to fossil fuels?</p></speech>

There are a number of engagements.  Over the years we have had much work with the commercial operators on efficiency opportunities.  That was with bus operators and including the public buses, Dublin Bus and the operators of the bus fleets.  One group we work with that the Deputy may know is Matthews Coaches.  It goes up and down the east coast.  We went through much efficiency training with that operator and it was able to save &euro;60,000 off its annual fuel bills just by looking at how to operate the fleet more efficiently.</p> <p>  On fuels of the future, the Deputy is right to ask whether it is going to be electric for the large-scale commercials.  It is unlikely.  It may be some form of hydrogen or the liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, in terms of some of the gas operators.  We obviously work with the Department of Transport as well as the commercial fleet operators to see what the opportunities are and to do some research into this area and what the technologies will be.  They are very expensive at the moment.  On what is there, the Department of Transport provides some opportunities to do some research and to trial some vehicles in that area.</p></speech>

The Department and all of the relevant groups that attended were advised that it was not a viable option to only have gas trucks, particularly for an island nation, because gas trucks cannot be shipped in a ship's hull.  It just cannot be done.  There has to be a level of engagement greater than that required to just tick the box.  Input from the sector, which has knowledge of what it is doing, must be recognised.  That is very important if we are ever to have alternative energy in the commercial sector on an island.</p></speech>

I am a politician on the Committee of Public Accounts and as much as it is my responsibility to show that up, it is the authority's responsibility as a sustainable energy group to make sure its input recognises it in all of these gatherings.  That is what is wrong.  We are not actually getting the message out there.  Representatives of the sector are brought in, a box is ticked and then we move on.  That has happened over the years, particularly in respect of that grant.  The sector has proposed grants to the Department and I hope the SEAI will get sight of these proposals and take a look at them because, if the sector is proposing grants, it is prepared to roll them out.  Over its lifetime, a Euro 6-compliant diesel-engine truck is as clean as a Euro 6-compliant gas-engine truck.  There is absolutely no difference when it comes to the environment.  There is a difference in the fuel that goes in and where it comes from but the reality is that, from a sustainability perspective, we need to move with what the sector can afford and Ireland is an exception in that we are an island nation.  There must be regard to that.</p></speech>

I will move back to the issue of electric vehicles.  The target is to have almost 1 million such vehicles by 2030.  We currently have 55,000 totally electric plug-in vehicles, as opposed to hybrid vehicles.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The figures I have seen show that more than 13,000 such vehicles were bought last year.  To ramp this up to 945,000, close to 1 million, by 2030 we would need an average of 130,000 per year or, if starting at our current pace, to scale up to 170,000 or 180,000 in the second half of this decade.  The average number of cars sold in a year veers between 90,000 and 110,000.  I have been following very carefully Mr. Meally's comments on the desire for that total increase and on why it makes sense but, if there are only 100,000 cars being sold a year on average, how realistic is it to ramp up to 170,000 or 180,000 and meet those targets by 2030?</p></speech>

It was roughly 12% and could be a quarter of cars this year, depending on the supply chain.  It will then be half of all cars the following year.  That is the way the market is going.</p></speech>

I follow that.  The problem is, even if 100% of cars being bought are electric, that will be insufficient at the current rate at which new cars are purchased.  Cars are also going to become more expensive, disposable income is going to drop this year and many people will be facing greater financial pressure for the next couple of years.  The first thing people do in such circumstances is not to change their car as quickly.  The point I am trying to make is that, even if 100% of cars bought are electric from 2024 onwards, we will still not reach that target of 1 million.  That is the point I am making.  We will not do it for the simple reason that the total number of cars sold is not high enough, even if every one of them is electric.  At this point, it does not look like a realistic target.</p></speech>

Like all of our targets, there are challenges involved.  There are 2 million cars on the road and we are looking at close to half that number being electric.  The number is 870,000-odd.  With regard to the trajectory, we are going in the right direction and hitting the targets.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that there is a cap on it, but I would argue that the cap is too high.  The point I make is that the people who purchased them had cash, or had a very friendly bank manager and the ability to repay the loan.  They were able to afford them.  An average worker on the median wage, as opposed to the average wage, of approximately &euro;30,000 and living in a rural or semi-rural constituency such as Laois-Offaly would not have a hope of being able to buy even a small electric car at this point, in addition to paying a mortgage and the costs of commuting and everything else.  Such workers are essentially paying the carbon tax for the cohort that are able to afford to buy these vehicles.  I got the full list from the Department of Transport of what was bought last year and, to be honest, I was taken aback.  Instead of welcoming the cap of &euro;60,000, I would argue that it is too high.  Does Mr. Meally not think it is too high, especially given the fact that the price of electric cars is going down?</p></speech>

The State is getting the benefit of that.  Any of the cars that were incentivised above the limit in the early days were a benefit to the State.  It is good value in terms of the emissions reduction and the reduction of the fleet of petrol and diesel vehicles.  The cap of &euro;60,000 is constantly reviewed and we consider whether it needs to be reduced.  For anybody who is considering buying a car, there are still lots of SUVs and other cars that are being bought in the &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000 range.  We are trying to incentivise as many people as possible to purchase an electric car and to get them into the fleet.  That is what we are working on with the Minister and the Department to ensure that the &euro;5,000 grant is going to result in getting as many cars as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#O00300"><p>A lot of the vehicles on the list are SUVs that will never be off the road because they were purchased in the Dublin area.  The other figures I got relate to where cars were bought.  The latest figure I received for the total number of electric cars in County Laois, for example, is 457 and there were 349 in County Offaly.  In Dublin there were 21,519.  If we look at the figures for cars bought last year, 210 were bought in County Laois, 167 were bought in County Offaly and 9,816 were bought in Dublin.  The list from the Department shows that of the charging points available, there are just ten in County Laois, eight in County Offaly and 159 in Dublin.  If we look at the grants that were paid last year, 153 people in County Laois received grants, a lesser figure in County Offaly of 145 received grants, and there were 5,087 in County Dublin.  I want to be clear that I am not having a go at people who live in County Dublin, but there is a very high percentage of the large vehicles, which are worth between &euro;50,000 and &euro;60,000.  It is possible to buy a good electric car for &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000, and as Mr. Meally pointed out, the price is going down.  He mentioned the value to the State.  In effect, what is happening is that people living in rural counties are driving the longest distances because they are not living within the 15-minute city that is promoted by the Minister.  It is good for people who do live in such areas.  We want people to live nearer to where they work.  The point I make is that a greater level of benefit would be achieved environmentally if people in rural areas who are on average incomes or the median wage were able to buy an electric car and had the charging points, which they clearly do not have, because across two counties in the midlands there are only 18 charging points, as opposed to 159 in Dublin.  Given the way this has worked out, people in rural areas, who will be caught for higher carbon taxes, excise and everything else, are effectively subsidising others - in general, a better-off cohort who live in County Dublin and who travel short distances in areas where there is public transport available - to buy very large vehicles, according to the figures given by the Department of Transport.  There is a significant transfer here.  It goes completely against logic.  There are issues to be addressed in that regard.  I know there are many poor people in Dublin.  There are tens of thousands of people in Dublin on very low wages, but the figures show that the vast majority of cars are being bought in city areas or close to city areas where there is the least environmental benefit or need because there is public transport available and they are travelling short distances.  Does Mr. Meally accept the logic of what I am saying, that there is an issue there to be addressed?  People on the median wage in rural areas are effectively subsidising the purchase of luxury vehicles where they are least needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Meally" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#O00400"><p>Obviously the spread of where cars are being bought is based on population numbers.  I do not accept that people in rural areas are subsidising the urban spread.  As you are aware, Chairman, cars are being bought right around the country.  The percentage of sales varies, obviously in regard to the overall numbers because we would expect more to be bought in Dublin due to the higher population there.</p> <p>  The carbon tax goes towards home upgrades to address fuel poverty.  It is not the case, as you stated, Chairman, that it goes to wealthier car owners in the Dublin area.  It is right across the board.  For every petrol or diesel car that we can replace, it is important to the State and it is a benefit to the State to make sure that cars are electric.  There will be continual reviews regarding the grants.  That is what the Department officials, the Minister and the SEAI look at in terms of the caps to see what opportunities there are to change them.</p> <p>  When people do the maths on the overall cost of running a petrol or diesel car - there are cars available at all different price bands - it is way cheaper to run an electric car whether one lives in Laois, Offaly, Dublin or in my area of Longford.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#O00500"><p>I accept that.  There is a problem here and now and for the coming years for many people in those areas or people who are living in Dublin and have to travel to Kildare to work.  This is not exclusive to the midlands.  People in Dublin who have to travel out of Dublin for work are affected.  Workers on the median to average wage who are not in a position to buy an electric vehicle, who do not have the cash upfront, and who cannot raise the finance are effectively caught.  They have to do considerably longer journeys.  I am a great advocate of getting people working close to home and, if possible, from home.</p><p>We need to move people away from commuting, which is important.  For now, as things are designed within the economy, that is where matters stand.  Those to whom I refer are not in a position to make that change at this point.  They have to pay the extra carbon tax while those who can afford to purchase electric vehicles up to the value of &euro;60,000 get a grant of &euro;10,000, which is substantial.  I would argue that the cap should be looked at again in terms of the vehicle involved.  I worked in the motor trade a long time ago.  I am no longer involved but one of my family is.  Should we be subsidising luxury cars?  That is the question.  People who have to travel a distance need reasonably good vehicles; they do not need luxury cars.  I am not sure that we should be subsidising them to that level while people who cannot afford these vehicles are stuck in high-emission petrol or diesel vehicles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#P00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for his analysis.  It is very helpful to us in reflecting on the issues that are faced in communities.  A couple of points occurred to me as he was outlining the position.  The policy changes will adjust a great deal of the information that the Chairman has on the types of vehicles involved.  Some of those luxury brands simply are not the subject of a grant any more because they are not fully electric battery models.  I would be interested to see the figures for next year when we have a full year of information on the new policy change and the reduction in the cap.</p> <p>  On the price, we have discussed the fact that it is less that the price is coming down but that there are more models available now in a lower price band.  Undoubtedly, supply chain costs have increased the price of everything, including steel and semiconductors.  That has been reflected through to the prices of certain models.  However, there are more vehicles available in the cheaper bands because there are new models.</p> <p>  Technology will be of extremely useful for people in rural communities.  What we are seeing now - my colleague Mr. Meally, has outlined this - is that range anxiety is not as strong an issue.  Albeit that matters are evolving, there are plans to put more infrastructure in place and to have home charging points to encourage 80% of people to do it.</p> <p>  We have the policy adjustments, the changes to technology and the introduction of a second-hand market.  There is simply no second-hand market for electric vehicles at the moment but as the numbers increase, we will see a functioning second-hand market.  The motor industry has also stated that this is the very first time that a completely new type of vehicle has been brought in to replace a completely old type of vehicle.</p> <p>  My final point on the carbon tax is that it is not hypothecated for electric vehicles.  Exchequer funding pays for the grants that have been issued to people for vehicles, but not the carbon tax specifically.  Much of the carbon tax has been ring-fenced for some of our retrofit works and for other environmental initiatives, which they are dictated by policy.</p></speech>

Obviously, it makes recommendations to Government.  I am of the view that the information needs to go back to the Government.</p> <p>  I do not expect Mr. Walsh to have the answer for this next question but could he furnish it to the committee later.  The number of charging points is outlined in the figures we received about a month ago from the Department.  Can Mr. Walsh provide information on the increase in the number of points planned across the country?  If we are going to get people down the country into electric cars, there are only 18 points across the midland counties.  In that context, it should be remembered that the distance from Carlow to Shannon Harbour is 90 miles.  If someone parks at Portlaoise railway station in the morning, plugs in their vehicle and goes off on the train, that charging point is taken up for the entire day.  Can Mr. Walsh come back to us with information on what is likely to happen this year and on the plans are there to increase the number of points, perhaps by way of a table?  I do not expect him to provide that information now.</p></speech>

I apologise to him and to our guests for being late for the meeting.  I had a number of prior engagements.  I thank our guests for their presentation.</p> <p>  I wish to raise number of questions, some of which may have been covered already.  My apologies if that is the case.  One of my concerns relates to the timeframe, namely, from the time an application is lodged to the inspection taking place.  I was contacted by one person recently and it took two years from the time the application for the inspection to be carried out.  Are there targets in place?  I am aware that Covid happened during those two years.  The house of the person involved was built with cavity blocks, not cavity walls, so one can imagine the waste of energy involved.  The person made an application for approval by the SEAI but it was two years before someone came to inspect the house.  This person was also told that the SEAI would engage with the contractor to do the work.  What is the expected timeframe from start to finish?  Have targets been set?  I accept that there may have been a problem with inspectors.  Additional moneys have been allocated and staff are to be employed.  Will targets be set over the next 12 months?  If so, what will they be?  How will the SEAI assess matters in the context of delivery?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#P01300"><p>That question pertains to what we call the warmer homes scheme, which is the energy poverty scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheme was very much buckled by Covid-19.  We were stymied in being unable to go out to and get into homes because many of the homeowners on the scheme are vulnerable.  The cycle time, from the time of the first application to completion, was 17.5 months.  It was up to 24 months, again, because we had substantial closures of the building sector.  Even when the commercial building sector opened up, the warmer homes scheme was somewhat delayed because we were going in to individuals homes who were vulnerable.  The cycle time then is 17.5 months and we have built up a waiting list because of the Covid-19 period.  As of the end of December 2021, there were 7,500 homes on that list.  We have a target of 4,800 homes to complete on the scheme this year and we expect to get another 3,000 applications in on the scheme.  We intend to bring the closing balance of the waiting list down and achieve, approximately, a 30% reduction on the waiting list in 2022 and, ultimately, it will be in 2023 that we intend to remove the waiting lists.</p></speech>

We are now running to two and a half years.  From the time that the application went in then to the time of the work being done, it is going to run from three to three and a half years.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct on the survey time, because we have changed the average time from the application date to a survey being allocated.  This has now been reduced to seven and a half months but there is a backlog going back to 2021 and will last until 2023.</p></speech>

From the works being allocated to completion, the period is five and a half months.  We have 33 contractors in the scheme and we have been increasing the number of allocations to the contractors.  That is, giving the work to them and driving the output.  Of the 7,500 applications on the work in progress, approximately 3,000 of those homes have been allocated out to contractors, as we speak, and we will be doing the next allocation in May and April.</p></speech>

It should be remembered that it has a great deal of additional money in its budget for this year.  If it only has 33 contractors for the entire country, does Dr. Byrne not accept that is too low a number to get delivery of the volume of work the SEAI wants to be achieved?</p></speech>

I want to clarify that of those 33 contractors, many are doing work directly themselves and many also utilise a range of subcontractors on the scheme.  Part of the Government announcement on 8 February was to increase the volume of output of the scheme so we need more people participating in the scheme, which I accept.  We are putting measures in place to try to get greater output from the contractors and to try to attract more people in the industry into the scheme.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the current market conditions in supply chain and labour but there is also a significant push in the new build housing market.  We are working to try to attract more contractors in and what they are looking for, which we are trying to work towards, is aggregation to make it commercially viable for them.</p></speech>

They have decided not go ahead with their house extensions or renovations.  I spoke to one builder who lost three building contracts in one week and they were contracts for new houses.  We may well have a situation where contractors will be out there looking for work.  People are looking at cost and everything else but this scheme provides a huge saving to the State and the homeowner in energy efficiency.  Is it time to focus on trying to get new contractors in and, at the same time, work with the existing contractors to improve the delivery time?</p></speech>

We are looking to get greater and deeper output from the current cohort of contractors and we are trying to attract more contractors in.  We are not just talking about today, next week or next month.  We have targets out to 2030 so we are starting to build that scale.</p></speech>

It is a big complaint that I constantly receive.  What is the average time from when a contract is finished to the contractor getting paid?</p></speech>

Normally, when a bill is sent out it must be paid within 30 days.  A period of 12 weeks is equal to three months or 90 days.  If we want to get people into this scheme to deliver on projects then surely we will have to deliver payment.  I presume the contractors would provide materials at a cost and materials are extremely costly.  Therefore, should the SEAI not try to bring forward the payment time?</p></speech>

We have looked at bringing that payment cycle much closer so the contractors do not have a cash flow problem and so they can deliver more homes.  We are engaged on that issue.</p></speech>

The average time would not be 3 months for all payments; it might be for the final payment.</p></speech>

The number of penalties we have to pay in that regard are minuscule in our overall budget and they are rare cases.  When we get a final invoice on account we pay it within the 30 days that is required of us as a public body.  As a body that deals with builders, contractors and staged payments, there is a little bit of nuance that Dr. Byrne and Ms O'Brien have touched on but we pay contractors.  Suppliers like working with us because we pay on time as agreed in the contract arrangements.</p></speech>

Supplies are even more difficult to get so a lot of builders are having to pay up front for them, which puts even more pressure on them.  That is why I am raising the importance of this issue.</p></speech>

I am looking at the SEAI's accounts, which comprise government grants with a small proportion coming in through the BER.  Is the State missing out on European funding?  Is it drawing down everything that is available to us?  What can be expected when it comes to European funding?  Is the SEAI concerned about inflation in the construction sector and can that be mitigated by bulk-buying, for example?  I am specifically thinking about retrofitting in that regard.</p> <p>  I refer to the public charging points.  The local authorities are slow on this.  When somebody is considering buying an electric car, for example, the range of that car is important.  People have to know that when they get somewhere they will be able to charge up and come back.  That should not involve having to knock on somebody's door and ask to plug one's car in.  I live in Leixlip and yesterday I looked up where the public charging point is, and there is one in the railway station.  Some 16,000 people live in Leixlip so if that is an example of how it is around the country we are far off the mark because people would be competing for that one charging point.</p></speech>

In some of our research we are involved as a partner organisation to European projects such as offshore wind.  For example in the North, there is a European electric vehicle charging project.  We also play a role as the European delegate in allowing both academic and industry access to European funding.  We are the conduit with which bodies can apply for European funding.</p></speech>

In 2021, we were able to reclaim 50% of our warmer homes scheme expenditure from 2014 to 2020.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reclaimed half of the cost of our warmer homes scheme for that six-year period.

There were headlines in the paper about 40-year highs in inflation.  The accepted figure at the end of last year was about 7%.  Even within that 7%, the wholesale price index showed higher price rises in some of the fittings used in retrofits.  Plaster and electric fittings went up by 20%, insulation by 11% and pipes and fittings by 10%.  That is all effectively history because of what has happened in the past month in Ukraine.  Things have taken another hop up.  We are keeping a close eye on it and are in contact with our suppliers, particularly on the warmer homes scheme.</p> <p>  We have considered bulk buying but there is considerable risk to an organisation like ours, so we typically fund grants through others to do it.  We have been talking to local authorities and things like that.  One of the ways to try to mitigate inflation is aggregation.  If a contractor goes into a housing estate and does a home here and there, it is expensive.  If a local authority or approved housing body, for example, can go in and do a range of homes in one go, it gets economies of scale.  Inflation is running at a rate we have not seen in 40 years.  </p></speech>

From a human resources perspective, we have been fortunate that Government has seen fit to support the organisation with increased resources to hire people.  We have a strategic HR plan that has a module looking at induction.  It has been difficult with all that has happened, including people working virtually and that, to get people upskilled and trained but we have worked with our managers and heads of department to ensure our new staff are trained and fully productive in their work.

In the discussion earlier, the SEAI's point of view was that there would not be a problem in relation to extra EVs, EV charging points or retrofitting and heat pumps.</p><p>However, we are planning to install 600,000 heat pumps, according to the briefing, and there will be 945,000 electric cars and the charging points for those.  EirGrid is saying everything is okay, but there were a number of reports over the winter, and we had a very mild winter, of the grid being on orange alert.  If we were on an orange alert when there was no fuel supply issue, what is the situation?  If we add another 600,000 heat pumps and 1 million electric vehicles, are we sure we will have enough electricity on the grid?  Is this not going to cause problems and potential blackouts?  It is to be hoped it will not.</p></speech>

The climate action plan and the energy plans are being progressed in a very integrated way, looking at both demand reduction and electrification and then making sure there is the relevant supply of electricity and the grid capacity to deal with that.  There are the existing plans and a forthcoming energy security plan.  That will make sure that we have relevant security of supply and that the required generation capacity is there.</p></speech>

We have a great resource and we are lucky.  It is to be hoped that we can develop that, particularly the powerful offshore element of it and floating wind turbines.  However, wind is not a dispatchable power.  We do not always have it.  At the times of the greatest energy needs on this island, and there were a number of big freezes, the wind did not blow and there was no solar energy because it was dark.  In one of those dark nights the temperature hit -16&deg;C one night outside my house and it was -17&deg;C in the midlands.  What happens then?  We have not cracked the nut of large-scale storage.  How much effort is being put into biogas - I am aware that Bord na M&oacute;na is moving in that direction - along with biomass and hydro?  I know hydro has limited capacity, but we have a lot of potential for combinations of small-scale hydro.  Is there is a concern about the lack of dispatchable power when there is the greatest need?</p></speech>

I will return to retrofitting for a moment, and the warmer homes scheme and value for money.  You outlined that 50% for the warmer homes scheme comes from the EU.  This is the scheme for people who are on the fuel allowance.  That has been expanded a little, which is welcome.  There are many homes in the State that still have single glazing.  In general, they are the poorest households.  They are the least energy-efficient or have the highest inefficiency.  They are still, perhaps, burning coal or solid fuel of some type.  I know single glazing was part of the pilot scheme the Department ran - I forget the name of it but it was warmer home, better health or something like that - in part of Dublin.  In the current warmer homes scheme, can one replace single glazed windows?</p></speech>

The warmer homes scheme started as a fuel poverty scheme and it has transitioned to an energy efficiency scheme, so we are getting deeper measures for homes and the average cost per home has increased.  The surveyor goes in and looks at the package of measures required for the home.  New windows and doors are available under that package of measures if the surveyor deems it necessary.</p></speech>

The issue is to try to get every house double glazed.  Obviously, it is a good place to start.</p> <p>  I have another question and it relates to mass concrete housing.  Your Department does not do the local authority retrofit scheme.  A typical mass concrete house has 9 in. walls.  There were tens of thousands of them built in the 1930s and 1940s.  If they are privately owned the owner can get the 80% scheme or the 50% scheme, but the ones owned by the local authorities are the last being done.  I see estates not too far from where I live that were built in the 1990s and they are being retrofitted.  I saw the man in the van yesterday morning at one of them.  We welcome the fact they are being done.  When they were built, they were double glazed.  It would not have been great quality double glazing because at that time it was skinny double glazing.  They were not the most energy-efficient but they had a reasonable level of energy efficiency.</p> <p>  However, down the road, for example, at O'Moore Place in Portlaoise, the houses have 8 in. mass concrete walls and one would freeze in them.  They are not being done.  Demographically, they are low-income households, many of them with health problems, and there is no prospect of it soon.  The local authorities are anxious to do it, and we have certainly been banging the drum to try to get them done.  That type of house is replicated throughout the country.  One sees those houses in Sligo and all over.  The same design was used and in their day they were good houses.  However, they would be very poor in terms of energy efficiency.  Can anything be done?  I understand the logic of picking the low-hanging fruit, but if houses that were built in the 2000s are being done but houses built in 1937 or 1938 are not being done, there is a huge discrepancy.  What is being done to address that at Department level?</p></speech>

This year, the budget for the scheme has been increased greatly to &euro;85 million, which is a significant increase on what it was in previous years.  They are gradually moving towards the deeper measures and the installation of heat pumps.  There are particular issues, as you mention, with the concrete walls.  As the low-hanging fruit have been picked off, they will have to move to the harder-to-treat houses.  That will be partly enabled, also, by forthcoming guidelines that are being developed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding traditional buildings and the best treatments and approaches to retrofitting those.</p></speech>

It is more urgent now because solid fuel prices are rising.  These households really have their backs to the wall.  One can ask anybody in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul around the country.  They have their backs to the wall because they have high energy usage.  The heat is flying out through the walls and the windows and they need to be prioritised.  The number of them is reducing.  Work is being done on houses built in the 1980s and 1990s.  In the 1980s, there was a level of insulation.  In the 1990s, there was a slight improvement with the introduction of skinny double glazing, at least.  There was gradual improvement and that is all welcome.  Some of that is now being completely replaced.  While people are on their second set of double glazed windows, these houses with no insulation whatsoever are freezing, which is the only way I can describe it.</p></speech>

They are absolutely a key priority.  If they need to be separated into groups, we have also put new measures into the approved housing body homes as well.  There are enhanced grant rates being-----</p></speech>

In the round this year, there is &euro;352 million in Government funding and 58% of that is going to either dedicated energy poverty schemes through the SEAI or the &euro;85 million through local authorities, which, again, should be targeted to the lowest income households.  We will certainly feed back the point about the mass concrete.</p></speech>

The majority could be private on some of those estates and on others the majority are still local authority-owned.  Therefore, there needs to be some joined-up thinking in terms of where person in No. 30 is a local authority owned home and person in No. 31 is not.  It is a mix and match.  There needs to be a lot of consideration given to how that will work out in assisting the person living next door who would be on the same kind of an income basically.</p></speech>

We were only in contact with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage colleagues in recent weeks about how we can ramp this up and use it as an approach for aggregation and standardisation of approaches, and then driving down costs and getting houses done as an area-based approach rather than picking them off one by one.  It is very much in our agenda.  The new schemes that have been introduced will also facilitate that type of approach as well.</p></speech>

The feedback that I am getting from local authority is that the amount that is being allocated for the retrofitting with local authority is approximately &euro;10,000 short of what is required and it does not have the capacity to raise that from any other source.</p> <p>  Could somebody drop us a note on the number of charging points and if the local authorities will be the primary ones providing those?  I am sure there will be some at petrol stations and so on, but we need to get some idea of what the scale is so we can follow it up with our individual local authorities as well.  It certainly is way short.</p></speech>

As usual, they will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  The second item is accounts and financial statements.  Five sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the Houses between 7 and 18 March 2022.

Three of them relate to education and training boards.  No. 1 is the 2020 annual financial statements for Tipperary Education and Training Board.  It received a clear audit opinion, but I draw attention to its disclosure of non-compliance with procurement rules.</p> <p>  No. 2 is the accounts of the University of Limerick, UL, for 2019-20.  Again, it is a clear audit opinion on its financial statements.  However, I am drawing attention to an emphasis of matter paragraph that I have included in the certificate with regard to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset for one of the university's pension schemes.  This is a standard inclusion in the audit certificate so it does not result in a qualification.  However, I am also drawing attention to four other matters and some of these were responsible for some of the delay in completion of the audit process in respect of these financial statements.  The first is a significant level of procurement non-compliance and detail in that regard is given in the statement of governance.  The second one, and the committee is aware of this, is that I am drawing attention to the ongoing investigation of concerns raised about the purchase in 2019 of a site for a city centre campus.  When I signed off in December on these financial statements that process was ongoing and, as we have heard more recently, the process is still in train and has not yet completed.  Third, I am drawing attention to a disclosure by the university in the statement of governance with regard to the findings of an investigation that there was an override of internal controls by a senior manager of the university in respect of HR and procurement issues.  The members, if they wish, will get the information relating to that by clicking on the link in the schedule.  Finally, I am drawing attention to the existence of an agreement with the former president in respect of his resignation.  In my view, this had the typical characteristics of a severance agreement, but it was not submitted for sanction to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as is required for any severance agreement with a departing chief officer of a public body.</p> <p>  Financial statement No. 3 relates to the Insolvency Service of Ireland 2020.  It is a clear audit opinion-----</p></speech>

I also wish to bring it to members' attention that representatives of UL have confirmed attendance for 12 May, as can be seen in the work programme.  They will be here seven or eight weeks hence.  I do not intend to have a full discussion of any of those issues now, but do any members have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

The previous Committee of Public Accounts did a piece of work on some of the universities, and UL was one of them.  If I recall correctly, there were issues with people terminating an employment and being taken on as consultants afterwards.  Some of that had to do with severance agreements.  We did quite a solid piece of work on that.  Having done that, one would have hoped that lessons would be learned.  Does this fall into the same type of category?  That is my question on that particular one.</p> <p>  With regard to the city centre campus on the Dunnes Stores site, is that complete at this stage and not available for publication?</p><p>What do we know about that?</p><p> On the significant level of procurement non-compliance, is that on one item or on multiple items?  How would the Comptroller and Auditor General categorise "significant"?  Perhaps Mr. McCarthy will enlighten us a little bit on the categorisation of that.</p></speech>

More issues were raised in the previous case.  The specific aspect I draw attention to here is that there is a process that requires the approval of the Department and the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to any severance deal it is proposed to make with a departing chief officer.  I do not want to downplay it.  It is a significant matter.  Where there is a process, a public body should adhere to that, seek the approval, and explain the circumstances in relation to it.</p> <p>  There was slight hitch in connection from the Deputy.  I believe the Deputy was asking about the KPMG report and whether it is completed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.396" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#AA00500"><p>The latest correspondence the committee received from the university is indicating that the process is not complete.  There is a draft, which was circulated, but there are issues that are holding up the completion of the matter.  The Deputy asked if there was any advance on that.  It is about a month now since the university wrote to the committee on that.  It may have moved on since then, but that was certainly the last position.</p> <p>  With regard to the non-compliant procurement, I draw attention to non-compliant procurement where the total value of it is in excess of &euro;500,000.  In one of these cases with one education and training board, ETB, the amount in total was some &euro;850,000, just from memory.  It other cases it was &euro;1 million or several million euro.  It is of the same order in the University of Limerick.  Typically, it will involve multiple suppliers rather than single suppliers.  More detail certainly is given in the ETB financial statements in relation to that.  It is more aggregated for the university, but there is a good explanation there of what is the type of non-compliant procurement and the circumstances that gave rise to it.</p></speech>

Does that Department pick up on this or is it notified?  Or is it something we need to do in addition to the Comptroller and Auditor General drawing attention to it?</p></speech>

Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  We will move on now to correspondence.

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, and follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p>  No. 1116 B from Marie Mulvany on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, dated 4 March 2022, provides information requested by the committee at our meeting with TII on 3 February 2022.  It provides responses to 18 questions across a range of areas.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It has been flagged for discussion by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#AA01000"><p>It is a very useful response, which obviously follows on from our hearing and some issues that we had asked to follow up.  That is always very helpful.  Page 5 gives information with regard to tolls and the M50 e-Flow system, with figures for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021.  These are very similar to some of the figures I got back by way of parliamentary questions.  I believe, however, that they are exclusive of legal costs relating to debt recovery and private investigation costs.  Can we just double-check with TII that this is the case?  If it is, can we amend the figures and show those particular aspects separately also?  That would be useful.</p> <p>  My second point is about the M7 bypass.  It is 36 years since there was an initial project.  These projects have a very long lifespan and we have had a number of them in Kildare.  After 20 years or so, they will strip out the pavement and do a substantial four or five inches of tarmac, or even more, to give it some extra longevity.  TII have said that it does not have the original data on costs and so on.  It would be quite useful to ask TII how long it holds on to material.  There can be a validity to this, and institutional memory can be lost.  Holding on to some records is quite important.  It would be useful if we could establish with TII the length of time it holds on to records.</p> <p>  My final point is on the metro and the Luas green line.  There is a huge amount of development happening in the Cherrywood, Sandyford and Dundrum area.  They are saying that they have no plans for any expansions there and they may well elongate it.  It would be useful to ask TII if it is aware of the extent of the work that is happening there - it is actually breathtaking how much it changes even over a 12-month period - and why TII would not take into consideration the extent of the development.  What we tend to get here, and we all complain about it, is infrastructure in retrospect rather than in parallel.  It can be a real source of frustration because people have an expectation when there is a lot of housing that there will be the services and facilities to go along with that.  A lot of that development is intended to be low-car or no-car use.  It is deliberately built along the public transport corridor there.  It is important that we do not have a short-term view on that, given the magnitude of the development happening there.  We should go back to TII to ask it what the rationale is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#AA01100"><p>One area of the correspondence I am concerned about is the forecasted costs for completion of the projects under the national development plan.  TII has indicated various reasons as to why it is difficult to give estimates but the cost ranges that have been provided are quite broad.  That is being generous.</p><p>Prices range from &euro;250 million to 1 &euro;billion, which is as broad as one can get.  Another project has a cost range of between &euro;1 billion and &euro;3 billion, which again is very unspecific and makes it very difficult, I would argue, to plan accordingly for what are considered essential infrastructure projects.</p><p> During the discussion with TII, it will be recalled I asked the question as to whether a political intervention could reverse the decisions in regard to funding allocations for this year.  In fairness, TII was quite honest about it and indicated that this would be the case.  Since then, some of the projects that had been denied funding this year have had that funding restored.  Unfortunately, the specific case I raised regarding the N2 Clontibret to the Border road scheme has not been included among those projects, which is disappointing because this is a vital infrastructural project.  It services and goes through my county, but it is essential for the economic and regionally balanced development of the central Border region and the broader north west.  It has been part of numerous discussions and negotiations on the peace process and it has formed part of several key Government policy initiatives, including the national development plan as well as Our Rural Future and a number of others.</p><p> The timeframe given for the completion of this project is now set at 2033.  I ask that we write to TII to get a detailed breakdown of the phases from now to completion, the dates by which those phases are expected to be met, considering the next stage has essentially been stalled, and if the TII could be more specific in terms of the estimated costs of each of those phases.  As well as the infrastructural need for this project, there is also the other issue that hundreds of landowners and communities are essentially sterilised because this projected route has been earmarked.  If we are saying to them they cannot develop until 2033, that is something of great concern.  I ask we write in regard to that specific project, if that is in order.</p><p> The former CEO of TII was paid in excess of &euro;29,000 in accrued leave, representing 41 days.  Assuming the holiday year runs from April to March, even accounting for no holidays taken since the onset of the pandemic, it seems to be a large amount of accrued leave and would be out of line with holiday pay policy in most places of employment.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General comment on that or should we seek guidance or clarification from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard?</p></speech>

Sometimes when somebody comes to the end of his or her expected employment, there may be circumstances that give rise to a higher level than usual accrual of untaken leave.  I do not want to give a definitive view on this because I have not looked at it in detail, but I am happy consider that and perhaps come back to the committee and advise on how it might be brought forward.</p></speech>

On the Portlaoise-Cullahill M7-M8 scheme, we received detailed figures from the TII in regard to the costs to the agency to date and the projected costs by the end of the contract.  TII has paid &euro;83 million to the company to date, and &euro;173 million has been collected in tolls.  The figure we do not have is what the construction cost for that phase of the motorway was.  I ask the secretariat to include that in the list of questions to the TII.  We have fairly good information on the M7-M8 project, but what we do not have and which is the missing piece is the construction costs to the company that built it.  What were the overall costs?</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence No. 1121, which was flagged for discussion by Deputies Munster and Catherine Murphy, from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 8 March 2022.  It provides further information requested by the committee regarding the steps and timeline of the Department&rsquo;s investigation into contractors engaged by RT&Eacute;.</p></speech>

On this item, I am unsure about the S class contributions.  My understanding is the scope section would have identified issues and RT&Eacute; paid all the PRSI at the A class rate and paid its share of the employee class.  Can RT&Eacute; clarify the position in regard to the S class contributions, which it appears to be retaining?  I know that, with pension entitlements, a person can opt for an S or A class.  Did RT&Eacute; retain the S class because it paid the A class?  I am unsure about it.  It is probably just a matter of clarification.  A letter to RT&Eacute; requesting clarification would be sufficient.</p></speech>

It is proposed to note and publish that correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#BB00800"><p>Can I come in on that point?  The correspondence makes great play on the fact that each case is assessed on its own merits.  It then refers to the scale of the RT&Eacute; investigation, the significant period of time being reviewed and the number of workers involved, which is fair enough.  It essentially says that the investigation will conclude in 2023, at some stage.  If cases are to be decided on their merits, and acknowledging that the entire process might take until 2023, surely some individual decisions will be made in advance of that.  I very much doubt that all investigations are progressing simultaneously with no decision made on any case until the end, or that may be the case.  I ask that we seek clarification as to whether the Department can provide interim reports as to the number of decisions relating to RT&Eacute; that have been made to date, whether results have been confirmed, and whether any of them have been appealed.</p></speech>

It has been agreed to note and publish that correspondence.  I refer to No. 1119, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Health, dated 7 March 2022.  It provides information requested by the committee on the national paediatric hospital, which arises from our consideration of previous correspondence from the Department on 20 January.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I flagged this for discussion, along with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Carthy.</p> <p>  The letter of 7 March from Robert Watt has six bullet points on the first page.</p><p>The question regarding the number of staff on-site and whether staff levels are impacting on construction targets was not answered in the letter.  The fourth bullet point provided clarification regarding the discrepancy in the number of design changes previously provided by the board at the meeting of 9 February and the corresponding number provided in this correspondence.  That query was not answered either and the clarification was not given.  The aspect I wish to highlight is the fifth bullet point concerning further information regarding the two-stage procurement process, why that was chosen and where it was used before.  No information was given about that in the letter, unfortunately.  It does give the total approved final cost as being &euro;1.73 billion.  It will be recalled that when Mr. Watt was here he was not in a position to confirm if that figure would go over &euro;2 billion.</p><p> We asked specifically about staff numbers on-site and what impact low levels of staff on-site would have on construction inflation; the number of design changes; and why the two-stage procurement process was chosen and where it might have been used before.  I will ask for a further response with more information on those specific questions that we asked.  Deputy Murphy also flagged this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#CC00200"><p>We are all acutely aware of the number of claims.  I am sure the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is doing its best to adjudicate on and reduce those claims.  They are over and above the &euro;1.73 billion estimate we have been talking about.  There are a substantial number of those claims.  I agree entirely with the Chair on the points we raised.  We made a specific effort to identify some issues, including whether insufficient numbers of staff are working on the site.  That was the case at times during this contract and it is part of the reason this contract has run as long as it has, with construction inflation now a real issue.  That is built into the contract.  It is entirely valid for us to satisfy ourselves about whether sufficient numbers of staff are on the site.</p> <p>  The price of the national children's hospital is almost like the third secret of Fatima.  It is being guarded.  I can understand why a bad situation should not be made worse.  It is valid of us to ensure we do not make a bad situation worse.  That includes, for example, ensuring sufficient numbers of staff are on the site and this project does not run longer than it needs to, not least because we require this hospital.  It also means we have a significant problem with inflation.  I do not see why this question has not been properly answered, in addition to some of the other points we made.  Care was taken to put this letter together to ensure it would specify exactly what information we were looking for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#CC00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for that contribution.  She is correct that the concerns we raised were specific.  I refer to whether there is a shortfall in the numbers of staff on the site and if progress has slowed.  The most recent information we had referred to a date of 2025 for delivery.  Each month this project is prolonged impacts on the cost.  Inflation in the costs of construction, especially in the prices of timber, steel and other such materials, is skyrocketing.  The reply falls very short, I am afraid, on the three questions we asked.  They are not addressed at all in the response.  Deputy Carthy indicated he wished to speak on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#CC00400"><p>This committee and the Irish public generally are being insulted, quite frankly, by the Department and the board regarding this project.  We are now being told that the project approval cost is &euro;1.73 billion.  The response from the Secretary General, however, indicates that several items are not included in this investment figure, including construction inflation, which we know, unfortunately, is substantial now.  I refer as well to the impact of Covid-19, statutory changes and any changes in scope resulting in healthcare policy changes and employment orders.  Regarding those last three points, those are matters that will be decided by the Government and the Department.  Therefore, they are matters over which we would have some control.  Also mentioned as not being included are risks such as Brexit, local supply chains and shortages of construction raw materials.</p> <p>  Is the Secretary General telling us that the Department has not factored in or assessed what the completed cost will be in the context of the combined impact of all those factors?  We have not asked for, and no one is suggesting that we get, a definitive final price.  We know that fluctuations in costs and factors outside the control of everyone involved in this project will affect the final price.  There must be an assessment of how much that will be.  It is unacceptable that information on the specific questions raised by the Chair, as well as the wider implications, is not being shared with the committee, which has a job to do on behalf of the Irish public concerning public finances.  </p> <p>  There is no reference in the letter that I can see, unless I missed it, to the KPMG report that has formed the backdrop to many other items of correspondence and responses we have seen previously.  There has been a refusal to publish that report or even to provide it to the committee.  If we are writing back to the Department, we should again ask for a copy of that report, even on a confidential basis, if that is what is required.  There must be clarity on this matter.  As I said, this is a scenario where no one believes the final cost of this project is going to fall below &euro;2 billion.  I fear the final prices could be significantly above the &euro;2 billion mark.  All of us involved in future planning have a right to have a sense of what the final cost of this project will be.</p> <p>  I wish to raise a second issue concerning the Department in question.  Can I do that now?</p></speech>

My understanding is that the committee had also written to the Secretary General of the Department asking for clarification as to when he ceased waiving the additional portion of his salary.  It will be known and recalled that the waiving of that portion of his salary was announced by the Secretary General on his permanent appointment to the post.  I would like clarification as to whether that letter was sent by the committee and if a response has been forthcoming yet.  If not, I suggest we write again to request that information.</p></speech>

There is an obligation on the contractor's side to carry out the project as it was outlined.  That would have meant having sufficient staff working on the site.  I would like us to ask specifically if a counterclaim is being taken, or considered, in respect of non-compliance on the contractor's side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022032400002#CC01000"><p>The committee is at a big disadvantage here because we have not seen the KPMG report, which we have requested sight of on several occasions.  More than a year ago, we sought information on what timelines were indicated in that report and what had been agreed with the contractor.  We do not have that information.  All we have is the statement that the project will now be completed in 2025.  The completion date has moved out several years again.  That is the disadvantage we are working under.  We will ask if a counterclaim is being considered if the project has gone beyond the timeline for the contract, if that exists.</p><p>That is another question.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.</p><p> If members online wish to speak, I ask them to indicate using the "raise hand" signal.  With regard to No. 1116 B, the TII has requested that its answer to question No. 9 not be published and there is a briefing note on this.  The question is on the unforeseen costs and losses of income borne by private entities in public private partnership, PPP, schemes broken down as far as possible.  There is a briefing note attached on costs and losses.  I want to point out this request in the information provided.</p><p> Item No. 1123 B is from Ms Bernie McNally, who has succeeded Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; as Secretary General of the Department of Education.  It is dated 8 March 2022 and provides information requested by the committee regarding outstanding Caranua cases and issues.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Munster and I have flagged this.  It sets out that the amount of money remaining in the funds is just over &euro;160,000.  The letter states the committee may wish to note that a significant proportion of the remaining funds will be required to discharge the legal costs and other outgoings.  The legislation on dissolving Caranua has not yet appeared.  This is something that members on both sides of the House could try to push.  It has been sitting there for a long time.  We will note and publish it.</p></speech>

I have not flagged it but I have read the correspondence and the Department has given a huge amount of information  in it.  I suspect the Committee on Disability Matters would like to see the information.  Is it possible to forward it to that committee?  There was a long discussion with the Department of Social Protection at its session this morning on this very issue.  Is it possible to formally send it to the committee, which is charged with implementing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD?</p></speech>

I am one of these nerds.  Something that jumped out at me is the statement that there is a significant appetite for high quality online cultural material.  There definitely is.  The pilot cultural digitisation scheme from 2017 to 2022 will be continued.  There is also the digitisation of the 1926 census, which several of us have raised over the years.  It is good there is funding for it and it is in train.  There is another issue on which perhaps the committee will write back to the Department.  It is with regard to records held in a different location, namely, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These are the records of the Land Commission.  Money was made available and there was an announcement on these.  They are a real treasure trove.</p> <p>  There has been resistance.  They exist North and South and the records prior to 1922 are open in the North but closed in the South.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine hold the records but they are of significant cultural value.  Money was made available specifically for this but when we drill into it we see it will not deliver anything in the short term.  It would be useful if we could write and ask about it.  There is a set of working records.  Can we ask the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to liaise with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the Land Commission records and a timeline for their digitisation?  These records get down to a granular level whereby individual families can be tracked.  They are of great historical importance.  I would like the Departments with responsibility for culture and agriculture to speak to each other to try to get a decent timeline that does not mean it will be 30 years in the future.</p></speech>

The only way to trace them is through the old Land Commission records.  It would be great if they were digitised.  Are they digitised in the North?</p></speech>

There was downtime for a couple of years.  It has transformed things in the North.  There is a good relationship between the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland and the National Archives.  There was an announcement but when you start to look at the timelines, you see they are not very clear.  The Department with responsibility for culture places a different value on the records because of their cultural value.  They are also important from the point of view of being a working set of records.</p></speech>

On the section 102 referrals that relate to the death of or serious harm to a person, we are given figures there in the final section of the table.  It tells us there were 43 referrals in 2020 and 59 in 2021.  It would useful for us to get some additional information on that.  It would also be useful to ask GSOC if there are international comparisons.  We need a breakdown of the circumstances in which the referrals arose.  Was it in custody, during an arrest or a warrant search or was the officer on duty?  A breakdown along those specific lines would be useful.  The number has gone up significantly - from 43 to 59 - in 12 months, so it would be useful if we could get that information.</p></speech>

However, as a private company, Eir is not accountable to the committee.  I advise that the topic of Eir's current and future investment strategy on the telecommunications industry and market in Ireland might be more appropriate to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  Another option would be for this committee to cover Eir&rsquo;s investment strategy and its engagement with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and the Department on the NBP in correspondence with Eir.  That said, the committee&rsquo;s related draft report is before the committee this afternoon so the material would not be of benefit to it in that regard.  We can take either approach to the issue.  We can refer it to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications or cover Eir's investment strategy, engagement and relationship with NBI and the Department on the NBP in correspondence with Eir.  We deferred discussion of this matter because Deputy Dillon was not with us the last day.  We can defer it until he is here.  It is up to members.  Does anyone have a strong view on it?</p></speech>

It is proposed to refer the correspondent to the committee's last letter to Screen Ireland, which was circulated to members for today&rsquo;s meeting.  Therein we addressed the matters raised, including the matter of loans to the company referenced, which are detailed in Screen Ireland&rsquo;s annual reports.

Deputy Munster is not with us.  It is proposed we note that correspondence.</p> <p>  No. 1134, dated 11 March 2022, is from an individual requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  It is proposed to advise the correspondent that while we can examine the audited accounts of the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, our role does not extend to investigating individual cases or reviewing decisions of the ombudsman.  That was flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.  I advise against involving the committee in this because doing so would mean the committee is interceding on behalf of a consulting firm and its client in relation to a decision of a statutory body about an individual.  It could give rise to an expectation that the committee can assist in resolving this issue.  Such an expectation has led to significant difficulties with other correspondents.  It would also be at odds with the general approach to dealing with correspondence from individuals, which was agreed in December.  Deputy Carthy flagged this matter.

Engagements are confirmed with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on the morning of 7 April and the Policing Authority that same afternoon.  It is proposed to have separate speaking rotations for the morning and afternoon of 7 April.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will try to manage that as best we can.  It does mean tightening things up a bit but I will try to ensure everybody gets a fair crack.  The speaking rota and work programme will be updated next week to reflect that.</p> <p>  There are two non-sitting weeks over Easter, which means our next meeting will be on 28 April with the Department of Justice and the Prison Service.  Following that, on 5 May, the meeting with the Department of Finance has been confirmed.  As I pointed out earlier, a meeting with the University of Limerick is confirmed for 12 May and I understand the chancellor, as requested, and the president will be in attendance.  We await confirmation from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on its availability for a meeting on 19 May.  The Department of Health and the HSE have confirmed their availability to appear on 26 May to address a number of issues that are in the public domain.</p><p>We had looked to schedule that engagement on 5 May but the earliest date we have free on which both bodies are available is 26 May. </p><p> As usual, if there are any specific areas of interest to members that you wish to raise with the bodies on the work programme, please let the clerk know in order that briefing material can be requested in advance and the bodies can bring the relevant information and prepare for the meeting.

The D&aacute;il's lack of ability to hold to account the substantial Exchequer expenditure that goes into our local authorities is something that arises regularly.  This committee does not have a remit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit the accounts of local authorities.  That is something that needs to be addressed.  I would welcome an opportunity for this committee to have an engagement with the local government auditors, the Department responsible and representatives of the local authorities themselves to assess how we might ensure there is proper transparency and accountability in respect of the Exchequer funding of local authorities.  We do not have real local government in this country.  I say that as someone who was a proud member of a local authority for many years.  Essentially, we have local administration of national policies and very limited powers for elected representatives at a local level.  Where power does reside in local authorities it is generally in the hands of unelected officials.  In that context, there is a need for full accountability and transparency in this sector as in all public sectors.  I am raising this issue to try to initiate a debate in the first instance but we should look at arranging an engagement, which could be informal if needs be, with the local government auditor, the Department and representatives of the local authorities to see whether we can bring forward proposals that this committee would play a role in ensuring that accountability and transparency.</p></speech>

Some of what was highlighted was scandalous.  It shows a major fall-down.  The thinking to date has been that local government is local government; it is separate.  There is a local government auditor and there are audit committees on each local authority that are charged with overseeing these.  The abuses highlighted in the programme by officials and former officials do a disservice to local government.  It is very unfair to the officials in the local authorities who are there working every day.  The councillors have to deal with the public on these matters and the vast majority stand for election and are elected to do their best in their own local area and county.  The committee can schedule a discussion with the local authorities.  I suggest that a representative of the County and City Management Association be present and a representative from the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, which is the new body representing local authorities.  It would be very important for it to be represented, if it is agreed.</p></speech>

I strongly believe that the Committee of Public Accounts should look into the particular area of local authorities and their expenditure and management.  There is another Oireachtas committee but it is similar to what we do with the HSE and the Department of Health and we should be looking at local authorities.  From my own experience of working as a councillor and coming through here to the Oireachtas, looking back, there are many things that we need to highlight, including, quite frankly, the amount of power that civil servants have within senior management of local authorities across the country.  In some cases the budgets they control are astronomical.  They are much larger than many people realise.  The scrutiny they deserve should be applied to them by this committee.  I fully support any mechanism by which we would undertake work on this area.  It is definitely something that the Committee on Public Accounts should look into.  I support that if that is the view of the room.</p></speech>

I did not get a chance.  Hopefully I will see it later.  I share the view that we have a system of local administration, rather than one of local government.  As I spent decades on the council, it is an area I know very well.  I would say to Deputy O'Connor that the officials in the local authorities did not assume power; they were given it.  That has been the case for decades.  Some of us yearn for the reform of local government that would really democratise it and give a greater level of functions more akin to those in other European jurisdictions.</p> <p>  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General has a relationship with the local government auditor or that they share information as appropriate.  Will he explain what kind of relationship is there?  It seems there is a very clear distinction between local government and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Why were they separated in the first place?  I know local government has been included in the Constitution in its own right in recent years and we must be aware of that too.  </p></speech>

That goes back very many years.  In all the jurisdictions in these islands, you will see there are separate arrangements for audit of local authorities as from central government Departments and agencies.  The amendment recognising local government in the Constitution some years ago has probably copper-fastened that.  It creates an obligation that there would be separate arrangements.  We have very little overlap with the Local Government Audit Service.  I do not have the power to seek information, receive records or to go into a local authority to examine issues.  I do not have power to follow money there.  It is specifically precluded from me under the 1993 Act under which I operate.  We basically do similar things but in completely different jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I have always felt that councillors can be busy.  They are not full-time people.  Spending is something that needs to be scrutinised and not when the thing is cooked and the budget is prepared and ready to go but rather during the budget process when it is being put together.</p><p>Greater care also needs to be taken in the budget process in terms of passing it and following the codes.  Everyone can see there is a code number beside everything on local authority budgets.  It is a case of following that, questioning that, and following the expenditure over the years.  The surest way of putting the brakes on some of the stuff we saw is councillors raising those questions.  They may be counted as awkward at times for raising these and they may not be thanked for it sometimes in council chambers, either by some other councillors or indeed by the executive of the council.  However, it is very important they do so because they have the mechanism of a public forum and they have the audit committee, which is another mechanism they can use.  There are supposed to be at least two councillors on those audit committees and they have to bring a report before the council each year.  That is another mechanism they can use.</p><p> It would be worthwhile seeking a meeting with representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  Deputy Carthy had other suggestions with regard to who else should attend that meeting.</p></speech>

It is helpful that all of us are former members of local authorities because it will send out a signal that this is not about putting additional pressure on local authorities.  This is about ensuring there is full accountability and transparency.</p> <p>  I understand what the Chairman has said.  I was a member of an audit committee on a county council.  It is a very different experience from being a member of this committee because, as the Chairman mentioned, councillors are essentially full-time people operating on a part-time basis in terms of remuneration.  They do not have staff, advice or access to independent research and guidance as we do on this committee.  In some cases, councillors deal with elaborate multi-annual budgets where funding streams come from several different sources.  If they are dealing with, in some cases - it is a minority of cases but it does happen - officials who are reluctant or resistant to providing the information, local authority members simply do not have the wherewithal to get to the type of answers we would have on this committee.</p> <p>  We should operate on this and if we can agree to have an engagement, we should do so on an informal basis and on the basis of a constructive approach from this committee to ensure we can assist councillors and those staff and officials within local authorities in providing the public with the confidence, in this regard and in every other respect, that when taxpayers' money is spent, it is spent with full due diligence and the public interest at its heart.</p></speech>

I remind members and officials to ensure their mobile phones are switched off for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent mode.  The meeting has been convened to consider the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in this session and if a vote is called.  As agreed, the meeting will adjourn at 11 a.m., if not before, depending on where we are with the amendments, and will reconvene at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31 March 2022.</p><p> I welcome the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and his officials.  I remind members that should a vote be called, they must be physically present in the committee room to vote.  Since other committees experienced technical issues over recent weeks, I ask for forbearance when votes are called.  We are now moving to voting digitally.  If a v&oacute;t&aacute;il is called and a technical problem arises, the clerk will revert to conducting it in the traditional way.  We will now proceed with our consideration of the Bill.</p></speech>

This Bill and the 1971 Act create a body whose only legal name is &quot;An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas&quot;.  There is no Higher Education Authority, HEA, established in the Bill or the Act, yet the &uacute;dar&aacute;s has referred to itself in branding exclusively as the &quot;HEA&quot; or &quot;the Higher Education Authority&quot;.  Given the commitment in the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 to naming new State bodies in Irish only, and as a way to reinforce the Irish language in the identity of the body responsible for the regulation and promotion of the Irish language at higher level, the Title of the Bill should reflect the actual title of the body established, following the precedent of the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Act 1979.  That is my rationale for the amendment.</p></speech>

The organisation is the first significant organisation to see reform since the commencement of the Official Languages Act.  The provision in that Act is very clear so I do not believe there is any coherent reason the official title of the organisation should not be &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas.  There is nothing to prevent it from referring to itself as "the Higher Education Authority" or referring to itself bilingually, but officially its title should be &Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas.  There is no coherent argument to be made against that.</p></speech>

It does not relate to this matter, but I believe I am meant to put on record that section 1 is proposed to be revised in regard to collective citations.  It is largely a technical matter but this legislation is dealing with the Universities Act, the Technological Universities Act, the Institutes of Technology Acts and the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  Significant amendments have been made to the latter, and collective citations will now be considered by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p> <p>  I thank Deputies Conway-Walsh and &Oacute; Laoghaire for the amendment.  I am introducing ten amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the role of the Irish language in this legislation.  I genuinely acknowledge Deputy Conway-Walsh's work on this and her highlighting the matter on Second Stage and at meetings with my officials.  I also thank Conradh na Gaelige, with which I have had several significant engagements over recent weeks.  There was a quite detailed meeting in my Department at which we went through a long list of ways in which the body believes we can strengthen the legislation, most of which I have been able to accommodate and facilitate.  No doubt we will tease through the rest as we go through the legislation.  There are to be ten Government amendments on Committee Stage to strengthen the promotion of the Irish language in this Bill.</p> <p>  I do not propose to accept amendment No. 1.  I happy to consider the matter it further between now and Report Stage and to engage further with the Deputy on it.  However, my rationale is that the Bill is replacing and amending the Higher Education Authority Act 1971.  The proposal was that we would retain the same name for the 2022 legislation.  The 1971 Act and this Bill refer to the Irish name, an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas.  There are several references to "An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s".  The body was established in 1971.  Section 7 provides for the continuance of "An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas".  "An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s" is defined in the Bill.  The Higher Education Authority is most commonly known as the Higher Education Authority or as the HEA.  It is anticipated that a proposed change of the name to the Bill could cause some confusion.  There are significant references to the Irish language in the Bill.  More important, there will be more references and protections as we go through Committee Stage.  I understand the point being made and am happy to reflect further and engage between now and Report Stage, but I am very satisfied that the substantive amendments we are introducing to promote the Irish language within higher education will make a real and meaningful difference to the Irish language when the legislation is passed.</p></speech>

That is why I believe this amendment is really important.  It would guide other amendments throughout.  For that reason, I intend to press it.</p></speech>

It is used in amendments to section 37 and other amendments.  I am open to views and input on the most appropriate definition for the commonly-used concept of core funding, but it is important that we set it aside because when we listened to witnesses who appeared before this committee regarding additional funding, core funding is integral to everything that we do.  The intention of amendment No. 94 to section 37 and the reason for including the definition is to ensure that for-profit private colleges could never be eligible for core funding.  It is, in effect, to make it impossible for private colleges to receive State funding in the same manner as public institutions.  I limited this to core funding only, since private colleges currently receive funding in a number of ways.  It is important to note, therefore, that this amendment does not change the current <i>status quo</i>.  It will only ensure the continuation of the current approach to funding higher education. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-03-24a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022032400002#D00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for tabling amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 94.  I will deal with the two issues they relate to.  I will deal with the matter of the "relevant body" in a constructive fashion and I suggest that if we need to tease through it more on Report Stage, we can do so.  I am informed that the term "relevant body" is already defined in section 36(7) of the Bill in the same manner as the amendment and is already used in sections 35 and 36 of the Bill.  As these amendments are linked to section 37 and they need to be considered in the context of the meaning of the proposed amendment to that section.  I contend that the "relevant body" piece, as defined in amendment No. 4, is dealt with in the Bill as I have outlined.</p> <p>  I genuinely see what the Deputy is trying to achieve on the core funding piece.  I will be very clear that there is no policy intention, nor any entitlement in the passage of this legislation, that even a designated institution automatically has a right to core funding.  There is no policy intention whatsoever to provide core funding to for-profit private institutions.  I take the point that the Deputy wants to legislate against that.  The current provisions of section 37 of the Bill are that the HEA, with the approval of the Minister of the day, prepares and establishes the funding framework for the allocation of funding to those institutions of higher education and other bodies that we specify in section 37(1) of the Bill.</p> <p>  This amendment seeks to extract, as the Deputy outlined, a subset of that framework and provide that the HEA may provide core funding to universities, technological universities, institutes of technology or the National College of Art and Design, NCAD.  Without being too technical about it, it is not that the HEA "may".  The HEA already provides core funding to these institutions but it also provides core funding to a small number of other institutions that are not universities, technological universities, institutes of technology or the NCAD.  I am not trying to misrepresent the Deputy as I know this is not her policy intention, but if we take this amendment as worded, the advice available to me is the National College of Ireland, NCI, for example, or Mary Immaculate College, MIC, would not be captured in that amendment.  In short, we believe it is too rigid and does not provide the flexibility for the institutions that do not fit within the definition outlined by the Deputy, including MIC and NCI.</p> <p>  We have tried to keep section 37 at a high level in primary legislation to allow that flexibility in funding that is needed from time to time.  I again acknowledge the Deputy is trying to not interfere with that flexibility.  I get that but there is a concern among officials in my Department that it could be too prescriptive for scenarios that can arise from time to time where funding needs to be provided.</p> <p>  In summary, we believe the "relevant body" piece is already defined in the legislation, that the amendment, unintentionally, would leave out a small number of institutions that are not-for-profit, which is not the Deputy's intention, and that it is too prescriptive an amendment to put in primary legislation.</p></speech>

Certainly, I would not want to exclude the institutions the Minister has named.  I am seeking to make a distinction between the public higher education institutions, HEIs, and the designated institutions.  My concern is that the Bill provides a pathway for private colleges to become designated institutions of higher education and that there are a number of grey areas in this.  The Minister can see that is my rationale for this amendment.  We need to protect the public nature of third level education throughout this Bill.</p></speech>

I accept her bona fides on this and I am not trying to be argumentative about it.  One of the purposes of the Bill, however, is to provide a pathway to become a designated institution for institutions that are not currently designated as such.  We could pick a number of examples throughout the country.  What if a private college wished to become a public one?  People will be aware of the issue around Carlow College at present.  I am not proposing this is the path it is on; I am just using it as an example.  From time to time, issues can arise where institutions can look to become part of the higher education public landscape.  In this legislation, we are trying to do something we have not had before, which is to define a pathway to becoming a designated institution.  When I meet NCI representatives, for example, there is no doubt in my mind that it will be on this pathway.  I see the Deputy and I do not disagree on that.  I ask the Deputy to perhaps reflect on the policy intention she is trying to ensure between now and Report Stage.  I have genuine concerns that, as currently worded, there could be unintended consequences for the flexibility we are trying to put in for a pathway to designation.</p></speech>

These amendments proceed from the sustainable development goals, goal 4 in particular, which references quality education.  The sub-target SDG 4.7 specifically sets out a target of 2030 to ensure all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and recognises the important role of education in an increased understanding of sustainable development.</p><p>While sustainable development is referenced in particular in section 47(1)(j) of the Bill, amendment No. 3 is a definitional piece because the term &quot;sustainable development&quot; can be fluffy, for want of a better word, poorly understood and poorly defined.  In amendment No. 3, therefore, I am seeking to use a definition that is readily available.</p><p>The UNESCO definition is that "Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) empowers learners of all ages with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to address the interconnected global challenges we are facing, including climate change, environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, poverty and inequality."  Unfortunately, it is difficult to see a scenario whereby education of that type, and the role of higher education institutions in delivering that type of education, does not become more important in the future.</p><p> Amendment No. 3 is definitional.  Amendment No. 9 is the more substantive one because it seeks to introduce within the object of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s that designated institutions of higher education have a role in "contributing to sustainable development, climate and biodiversity action, through research, innovation, leadership and governance",  I am aware that some reference is made to those goals in the lifelong and flexible learning provision in section 47.  I make the argument, however, that to include it further and in a more important place in the Bill, under the objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, would give it a higher role, a higher profile and increased importance.</p><p> There are two factors at play here.  One is that definitional piece.  If we have a definition available that defines properly what sustainable development means, then perhaps we should be using it to give it a higher profile role within the objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p><p> Amendment No. 124 makes much more specific reference to sustainable development goal No. 4.7, which deals comprehensively with issues around sustainability education.</p></speech>

The short answer is I am happy to work with the Deputies between now and Report Stage to see how we can strengthen the legislation in respect of this matter.  As is often the case on Committee Stage, we can highlight all of the reasons we cannot do it exactly as it is outlined here.  That is a normal part of the back and forth.  I will work with the Deputies between now and Report Stage to see how we can try to achieve what the Deputies are endeavouring to do here.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 9, we contend there is already an object in the Bill, as the Deputy has acknowledged, relating to environmental development and sustainability.  Under section 8, objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, subsection (1)(b) provides that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s should have regard to this object in performing its functions: "to support designated institutions of higher education in contributing to social, economic, cultural (including the promotion and use of the Irish language) and environmental development and sustainability through leadership, innovation and agility".  Environmental development and sustainability are stated as part of the objects of the Higher Education Authority, which is important to say.  We would want to tease through what amendment No. 9 is doing that the object is not already achieving.</p> <p>  On some of the other amendments, there is a view we should not be overly prescriptive or detailed in primary legislation, because even for things that seem to last such a long time, the world can change so fast and primary legislation does not.  Definitions and goals can change from time to time.  We believe the reference to sustainable development is deemed sufficient and the provisions outlined in these amendments could be incorporated in these provisions when they are operationalised.  For the record, I also note that, under section 126, guidelines codes and policies can be issued to the designated institutions of higher education by the Higher Education Authority.  The HEA can issue guidelines codes and policies on sustainable development, including how this would link to lifelong and flexible learning.  The legislation is enabling the HEA to do things it has not been able to do before around guidelines, codes of practice and the like.  There is no doubt sustainable development is an area in which the HEA needs to be active.  I propose to work with Deputies between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am happy the Minister is prepared to work with me in developing that definition in particular.  It is one of these terms that can be almost universally applied and very often ill-understood.  On the basis the Minister is happy to look at it between now and Report Stage, I am happy to withdraw the amendment at this time.</p></speech>
