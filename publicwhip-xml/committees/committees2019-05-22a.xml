However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have made will be published on the committee's website after the meeting. <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind delegates and members to turn off their mobile phones because they interfere with the sound and broadcasting systems, even when left in silent mode. <br/><br/>I invite Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#B00300"><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirleach, agus go raibh maith agat as ucht an cuireadh a bheith i l&aacute;thair anseo inniu.  </p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to attend this meeting to discuss the national broadband plan, NBP.  The Minister attended a meeting of the committee last week to discuss the plan, during which he answered questions and provided extensive detail for the committee.  Accordingly, I do not propose to cover the detail addressed by him; rather, I will focus on the three themes identified in the correspondence received from the committee as being of particular interest - roll-out time; value for money, including the cost benefit analysis; and ownership.  These themes were also addressed in some detail by the Secretary General of the Department in his letter of 24 April which has been published on the Department's website.</p> <p>  In the first year of roll-out National Broadband Ireland, NBI, will deploy approximately 300 broadband connection points, BCPs, across all counties.  It is anticipated that between seven and 23 BCPs will be deployed in each county.  They will provide a community based high speed broadband service, enhancing online participation and allowing for the establishment of digital work hubs in these locations.  A deployment plan will be made available by NBI once the contract is signed.  NBI is aiming to pass 133,000 premises by the end of the second year of deployment, with between 70,000 and 100,000 premises being passed each year thereafter until roll-out is complete.  This means that by the end of the third year of roll-out, almost 40% of premises in the intervention area will have been passed.  The timeline for deployment is informed, in particular, by the deployment of Eir&rsquo;s rural fibre network and learning from that project.  After the contract is awarded, the Department will continue to work with NBI and Eir to identify means of potentially reducing the overall roll-out time. </p> <p>  Value for money has been a key consideration in preparation of the NBP contract in the past three years.  The contract contains strong provisions in that regard.  The contractual controls will play a key role in ensuring costs are minimised and deliverables are met.  I highlight a number of the extensive controls included in the contract, including the subsidy only being released on the receipt of proof that a relevant deliverable has been achieved, which has to be established by an independent certification process; oversight of the purchase of materials and sub-contractor contracts year on year; substantial oversight arrangements to monitor progress, costs, and uptake; significant checkpoints at various stages of the project, in addition to ongoing monitoring; substantial claw-back provisions for cost savings achieved or a share of future excess profits; key performance indicators to ensure the service will be maintained appropriately; and significant penalties to address under-performance, should it occur.  </p> <p>  From a governance perspective, there is a stand-alone board responsible for the ring-fenced operations and day-to-day management of NBI, with a requirement to report to Minister monthly, quarterly and annually.  In addition, the Minister has an appointee on the board, while there will be an independent audit of the accounts.  As noted in the KPMG report published on the Department&rsquo;s website, value for money in the NBP can only be measured during the deployment and operation of the contract and will be dependent on the State putting in place an oversight and governance regime that is fit for purpose.  A strong governance team will be established within the Department initially to oversee the contract.  In line with the public spending code, a cost benefit analysis was commissioned by the Department and it has been updated throughout the procurement process.  This has been an iterative process, involving extensive engagement by the Department with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform throughout.  The most recent final version of the quantifiable cost benefit analysis demonstrates a positive benefit to cost ratio of 1.15:1 in a pessimistic scenario but that is estimated to be as high as 2.14:1 in an optimistic scenario.  I am sure we will return to the cost benefit analysis in questions, but the point I want to note at this stage is that the analysis was based on a conservative estimate of benefits and did not include unquantifiable benefits in areas such as e-health, e-education, social inclusion, rural development, tourism and climate. </p> <p>  The Minster addressed the question of ownership in some detail when he attended the committee last week.  Therefore, I do not propose to go into extensive detail at this point, although I will be happy to answer questions about it.  However, I re-emphasise three points.  Re-using existing infrastructure minimises cost and the impact on the environment and is in line with the relevant state aid guidelines.  In looking at the ownership model it is important to look at what is being owned versus what is rented.  The ownership decision was taken in July 2016 and it would not be possible to change the ownership model without a new procurement process.</p> <p>  We are quite happy to respond to questions with as much detail as we can.  If issues are raised by members of the committee which require a more detailed or technical response, we will also be happy to revert to the committee after the hearing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#B00400"><p>I thank Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in for coming before us.  I have three quick questions, some of which have been raised by members of the public.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in may have answered some of them in his statement.</p> <p>  The maximum capped cost to the State is &euro;3 billion.  Will Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in illustrate how that figure could be reduced and what measures are in place to reduce the amount?  Are there examples from other countries which how the use of claw-backs has been successful?  Can ESB infrastructure be used instead of Eir infrastructure?  What engagement has the Department had with the ESB?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#B00500"><p>I will ask Mr. Mulligan, the programme director, to take the first two questions, and Mr. Neary, the chief technical officer, to deal with the third which concerns a technical point.  </p> <p>  In dealing with the cost the Minister was very clear in his presentations to both the committee and the D&aacute;il that the cost we were seeing was the maximum that could be envisage.  The committee will see this coming through in the answers to questions.  It is a capped cost, from which one will have to work back to assess what the actual cost could and is likely to be.  We have very clear views in that regard.  </p> <p>  I ask Mr. Mulligan to pick up on the first two questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#B00600"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and members.  I will address the subsidy because, like everything else in this project, even the make-up of a simple number can be quite complicated.  The overall capped subsidy is &euro;2.9 billion which includes VAT of &euro;355 million.  In net terms, the maximum cost that could go to third party operators and the bidder is in the order of &euro;2.6 billion.  The &euro;355 million in VAT would not leave the Department but would go straight to the Revenue Commissioners; therefore, the amount of the subsidy paid outside the Department is up to &euro;2.6 billion.  Within that amount, &euro;480 million has been set aside to cover unforeseen and potentially unavoidable eventualities, the incurring of which expenditure will have to be proved on a case by case basis by the bidder.</p><p>We will be working with the bidder during the next ten years in terms of passing and connecting homes.  The seven-year deployment plan includes connecting homes and runs for years and years.  The &euro;480 million will not go outside the Department until the actual cost incurred is verified as a cost that was not foreseen.  It is for 14 discrete cost activities which we have identified with the bidder and which it could not, with any reasonable degree of certainty, put into its bid because they are subject to future events in years two, three and four.  If we did not agree a contingency fund, the bidder would probably have brought it into its bid price as a risk premium price.  We have provided this &euro;480 million contingency in a very controlled manner.</p><p> That brings us back down to the overall gross or the cost that is committed within the 25 years of &euro;2.1 billion.  Within that figure, &euro;1.8 billion is committed up to year ten and the balance is thereafter.  The difference between &euro;1.8 billion and &euro;2.1 billion is for the cost of connecting premises and for the rental and infrastructure.  Again, the capital related cost beyond year ten is only paid once it has been incurred.</p><p> In response to the question as to where we can reduce costs and where do we plan to reduce cost, these are numbers in a spreadsheet at the moment.  We hope they will be much less than that when we return in five or ten years' time.  That is the expectation.  The figure will not and cannot be higher than provided for, but we expect it will be much lower.  Why do I believe that will be the case?  I will break down the capital cost of the project into three categories.  The first is the cost to pass premises and there are 540,000 premises to pass.  The second is the cost to connect the premises.  The third, which is included in the first two costs, is the cost of renting infrastructure.  We have a very good handle on the cost of passing, as did all bidders.  It will cost, give or take, &euro;1 billion to actually physically pass all premises in the State during the next seven or eight years.  This includes BCPs and all the material that one has to buy, be it brackets and poles, including new poles, and fibre cable.  There is also a requirement for 144,000 km of cable, which I will address shortly.  It may not be 144,000 km of cable because that is based on bringing fibre to every single home, which we know is not likely to be the case.  However, we factored that cost of fibre cable into the bid as the worst case scenario.</p><p> The other major cost in the cost of passing is the optical line equipment that one would have back in the Eircom and Enet exchanges.  The bidder has said publicly that its preferred partner is Nokia.  If it is Nokia or another company, one has to pay for the equipment.  We have estimated all those costs in our internal models and in the models of the bidder and the other bidders.  In terms of the cost of connecting and passing premises, our internal model up to the final tender stage showed a 5% difference because it is the most clear path of costs.  How much does it cost to upgrade the MANS for the equipment, the Eircom exchanges and bring fibre cable from the poles?  The cost of upgrading and remediating the poles and ducts sits with OpenAir.  That is within the rental agreement with OpenAir.  If we pay &euro;20 per pole, the cost of replacing that pole and maintaining it for the next 35 years sits with Eircom.  That is the rental cost.  As we know, the rental cost is around &euro;900 million over 25 years.  As to how we will look at that rental cost of &euro;900 million, we do not do this because ComReg will look at that.  ComReg is 100% responsible for whether we pay &euro;900 million, &euro;800 million or slightly more.  If ComReg were to determine that the pole and duct prices should be slightly more, we have factored that into our contingency of &euro;480 million within one of the 14 buckets to which I referred.  Again we have provided for a capped amount and the bidder is on the hook for ComReg making a determination over the next 35 years that the regulated price should be more than is currently provided for.  That risk sits with the bidder, except for the small amount of money within the &euro;480 million that we have set aside for the eventuality that ComReg raises the price.  If ComReg were to reduce the price, we would take back 100% of what was factored into the bid.  We will only pay the actual regulated price on the day or month or in a given year.  We are not in a position to determine what that price might be because it is an independent process run by ComReg.  As we speak, the regulator is going through a detailed review of the pole and duct prices and other relevant prices to the market generally and it will presumably publish documents in the coming six months on what the pole price should be for Mbp in other areas of the country.</p><p> The third area, which is the biggest unknown, is the cost of connecting to broadband, in other words, how much it costs to get from the curtilage of every single road into every single premises and farm.  For all the companies that were at the table for the past three years, that was the major debating point in every single dialogue and every modelling session with the technical staff and engineers.  It is very difficult to estimate costs in this area so what we have accepted in the bid model is a cost of between &euro;400 million and &euro;700 million to connect the 540,000 homes.  We have to assume the number that will be connected in the next 20 years.  That price paid will be paid based on the actual costs.  If it costs &euro;300 million, we will only pay &euro;300 million.  The maximum factored into the cost of connection is under &euro;700 million.</p><p> We will work on every eventuality, be it technology choices or doing it in the most effective way, depending on the premises and where it is located.  The demographics and geographics of the locations of premises off the curtilage of every road are unique to each single premises.  We have to decide whether to go underground or overground, whether there is existing infrastructure from Eircom or the ESB or whether it requires a wireless solution.  Those decisions will be made area by area and bit by bit over the next seven years with the bidder, with our full oversight.  The bidder has our full oversight month by month and quarter by quarter in terms of what it actually spends.  Month by month and quarter by quarter, we will seek to reduce the maximum subsidy provided for to the least amount required.  We stated in previous documents that in a very optimistic scenario, which is quite doable, we could see that subsidy fall by up to &euro;1 billion.  We could get a cheaper passing cost, although that is not likely to be the biggest saving, and there are potentially significant savings to be made on the connection costs.  Maybe ComReg will reduce prices and the company may not need any of the &euro;480 million we have set aside for weather events, inflation and other eventualities in years two, three, four and five.  If, in the best case scenario, none of those events happens and they are all avoided or avoidable - we will look at other ways of mitigating having to dip into those buckets - we will not touch the &euro;480 million.  Those are the elements we will look at in the next number of months.  We are constantly working on this to find out ways in which the engineers and accountants can come together to reduce the cost.  Ultimately, however, we must achieve the objective of passing and connecting all of these premises.  That is the answer to the first question.</p><p> In terms of other countries that do clawback, the system we are applying is the same as the systems applied across every member state in Europe.  It is required under state aid guidelines.  These guidelines, which the European Commission views as legally binding on member states, specifically set out that all members states must include clawbacks, wherever possible, in contracts because it is so difficult to predict the future in terms of the cost of passing and connecting, the cost of regulatory prices or the demand on the network.  We have had many discussions with Broadband Delivery UK, BDUK, the authority that oversees all broadband delivery projects in the UK on behalf of the local authorities.  BDUK works with the European Commission in the same way as the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in Ireland works with the Commission.  It negotiates relevant clawback provisions with bidders.  Again, the percentage clawback achieved varies from case to case and country to country.  In Ireland, we have achieved a 60% clawback on excess profits.  We also have a 100% clawback on any cost savings on the majority of the costs the bidder incurs.  For example, if the bidder gets cheaper fibre prices in the market, we will only pay the market price it achieves and we will not pay the bidder a subsidy  in excess of that.  If the bidder has assumed a cost of fibre of &euro;100 per metre and it turns out to be &euro;70 per metre, we pay &euro;70 and the bidder does not get the additional &euro;30 per metre.  That 100% clawback is provided for on what is in the bid.</p><p> Clawback is not unique to Ireland but standard across France, Germany and the UK.  In the most recent example in the UK, BT submitted a bid which took a very pessimistic view of the number of people who would use the network but it turned out within one or two years that demand increased from 20% to 40% overnight.  BDUK clawed back &pound;700 million from the figure initially agreed to be paid out in subsidy.</p><p>That is going on continually in every single authority in the UK.  The most similar project which will have similar clawback provisions, the R100 scheme in Scotland, has not been concluded.  It is going through similar processes to those we have undergone.  It has been decided to go with three lots, which is how we started.  A gap-funding model will be used.  In terms of the governance, the contract is quite similar to ours.  It follows a very similar template and many of the advisers we have used have been on board.</p><p> What we are doing is not uncommon.  There are concession models in different local authorities in France, but contract and clawback provisions within the first 20 or 25 years are also relied upon very heavily.  That is the standard form for any gap-funded or concession model.</p><p> I will touch on the ESB before Mr. Neary gets into it.  He is the technical expert on the differences between using ESB networks, Eir networks, and the tower and mast networks that would be used should a wireless option be chosen.  The initial engagement with an ESB network solution occurred when SIRO was at the table.  We had more than 880 hours of dialogue with all bidders.  Between mid-2016 and when SIRO pulled out in September or August 2017, we went through what it would mean to use these networks with many representatives from the ESB Networks team, including engineers and accountants.  We had the benefit of a couple of hundred hours of talking through the challenges, benefits and all of those things.  Mr. Neary was at all of those workshops.  We have a very deep understanding of what it would mean to use the ESB network.  ESB Networks gave us all of that detailed information over many presentations.  SIRO then pulled out and, as part the contingency planning we carried out, details of which can be seen in our reports and documents from the latter part of 2018, we engaged with the ESB in meetings and went through things with it in the context of the challenges involved and what would be possible both within any contingency plan and the current plan.  Again, it is absolutely open to the current bidder to make use of ESB networks where it is most cost-effective and practical to do so.</p><p> Another actor that is very important in this regard is the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, because it sets the prices for access to that network.  We have engaged with the commission, as has ESB Networks.  That engagement is ongoing and will continue.  I will hand over to Mr. Neary to discuss the technology aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Neary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#D00200"><p>I will cover ESB infrastructure.  It is important to state that while NBI's bid is based primarily on use of Eir and Enet infrastructure, using ESB infrastructure in the course of the roll-out is absolutely still an option.  It will be an option in instances where that infrastructure is most appropriate and cost-effective to use.  During the roll-out and prior to starting to build in any location, NBI will carry out a detailed site survey.  It will identify the existing infrastructure and come up with a detailed design that is cost-efficient and appropriate for the particular area involved.  As we have discussed before, it has chopped the country into 110 deployment areas.  It will identify the most appropriate infrastructure for a deployment area and will then propose a solution and seek authorisation from the Department to proceed with building.  NBI is engaging with all infrastructure access owners to agree the processes by which that infrastructure would be used and an appropriate price for that use.  These owners include the ESB.</p> <p>  Mr. Mulligan touched on the fact that each type of infrastructure presents its own challenges.  Throughout the bid process and the SIRO engagement I got very familiar with the challenges associated with ESB infrastructure.  A number of ESB experts were brought to the table to demonstrate the very stringent health and safety requirements which must be adhered to in using ESB infrastructure.  Such use is governed by the primacy of the electricity network.  The infrastructure is there to serve electricity customers in the first instance and that has to be respected by any other user of the infrastructure.  There are a number of physical barriers to using the ESB's pole and duct infrastructure.  For example, it has a lot of pole-mounted equipment.  In certain instances, using a given pole can be a mini-project in itself.  The ESB has developed a process by which it can be used so, to answer the question of whether it can be used, it absolutely can.  NBI will have the option to pursue that, which it will, but, as with other infrastructure, there are challenges involved.</p> <p>  With regard to the overall engagements, we have examined the use of the infrastructure through the bid process with SIRO.

There was a discussion at that meeting, which was minuted, which talks about the make-up or potential change in the consortium.  Frank McCourt of McCourt Global LLC was present.  Subsequently, his company was relied on to act as a guarantor or to assist Granahan McCourt and David McCourt still being a qualifying bidder.  The process auditor who investigated this, to the best of my recollection, never interviewed Frank McCourt and perhaps assumed that he just happened to be having lunch with his brother for the purpose of welcoming the Minister to New York.  I do not know.  Peter Smyth did not carry out any analysis of the presence of Frank McCourt at that meeting.  I am at a loss to understand what was the purpose of Frank McCourt's attendance.  One would not have to be Einstein to figure out that soon afterwards, he gave a letter of undertaking to his brother to get him to pass a certain milestone within the broadband process.  That does not look great.  I certainly think there is an issue.</p> <p>  David McCourt's company, Granahan McCourt, started a process a long time ago.  It changed in character and nature almost monthly.  It was like "Lanigan's Ball", with companies going in and out.  There were different points at which he relied on the financial strength or ability of another company.  That allowed him to progress a stage further and then his brother said he was on his own and that he got him this far.  Does Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in not think that this raises very serious questions about the capacity of the company to which he has decided to grant preferred bidder status?  We understand that the risk being taken by all concerned is &euro;175 million of capital investment.  The Taoiseach told us in the D&aacute;il Chamber today that this is being put in by Tetrad.  David McCourt, the actor for Granahan McCourt, is not putting any money in.  We have had this company come all the way through, bringing different people along, potentially providing money, and now it turns out that he has found a company but it is not his company.  The State is still carrying all the risk.  Will Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in confirm that the &euro;175 million in capital is coming from Tetrad?  Was the Taoiseach clear on that today?</p> <p>  We talked about the holding company.  Is Tetrad a shareholder of the holding company?  Is it held equally with Granahan McCourt?  We understand that all the capital is coming from Tetrad.  What is its share of the ownership of the holding company?</p></speech>

As I indicated to the Chair, we will provide this in the form of a diagram.  It may be helpful for the Deputy to have this in front of him to engage about it.  The Deputy referred to a meeting.  The note on the meeting last year is in the public domain and the process has been dealt with.  I do not propose to comment further.</p> <p>  The capacity of the bidder has been clearly established through the evaluation process, right through to procurement.  To get through the gates of this procurement process, there were detailed criteria.  Five parties applied to come through the gates of the process and three were qualified.  For those three parties to remain in that process, if there were any changes within their bid, they had to revisit and go through the pre-qualification test again.  Where there have been changes in bids in this process, they have gone through that process, it has been evaluated in accordance with the rules of procurement, and they were approved.  Most importantly, the final tender received went through an extensive, rigorous evaluation.  The first conclusion from that, which allowed for the decision that the Government took earlier this month, was that the bid had been evaluated as meeting all of the requirements of that procurement.  There was a bigger decision to be taken about moving ahead with the project, the cost etc.  By coming through that evaluation, it is a categoric assertion that this entity which is sitting before us today, and that is the preferred bidder in the national broadband plan procurement process, has met all of the requirements of the procurement process at PQQ stage and at final tender stage.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to two companies.  It is important that, at the PQQ stage where the financial resources of the McCourt Global company referenced and Tetrad were assessed by the Department's team and our advisers.  The conclusion was that either company would have passed the test if it was the sole party, to allow the bid to proceed through the PQQ.  At the final tender, while they both provided letters of support, Tetrad provided the commitment to the &euro;175 million of equity.  It is Granahan McCourt, not McCourt Global, that will provide the working capital.  That is information which the Minister has been very clear on in responding to parliamentary questions in the House this week.  I understand that the Taoiseach also referred to it.</p></speech>

If one goes through the work of KPMG and PwC at the time, it seemed like a good option when looking at the pros and cons.  It was the cheapest overall, with the lowest level of subsidy required upfront and it minimised State exposure to risk.  It was all good.</p><p>It went with the gap funding model and it was hard to disagree with it at the time.  When SIRO and Eir pulled out, I am at loss to understand how the project team and the Department did not revisit the ownership model, recognising that all of the pros had effectively evaporated, and consider how it still made sense to go with the gap funding model.  Following the passage of 20 months, the State now has to carry all of the burden of risk with the figure of &euro;3 billion.  Was it a bad decision not to re-evaluate the situation at the time?</p></speech>

The complexity of it is such that the pros change.  Some actually remain at the core and we could usefully address that aspect.  There was a reappraisal at a point in time when we had a single bidder.  I fully accept that it challenges the Department.  The question is did it not look at and fundamentally assess it and then, if it was on track, should it have continued with it.  The answer is we did.  We tend not to come outside the front door to set out what it is we are doing.  When we are inside the door, we are absolutely asking ourselves these questions.  We will talk through the process.  We are confident that it is the right outcome and that the analysis is still right.</p></speech>

There are many reports, but I will take the Deputy through six points I would like to articulate.</p> <p>  The gap funding model still achieves the policy objective which is to provide people in rural and other parts of Ireland with high speed broadband.  In our view, the gap funding model and the solution we have on the table will achieve that objective.  The contract we will have in place by the time it is signed will ensure that objective is met with the necessary rigour and oversight to ensure these guys deliver.</p> <p>  In terms of where one&rsquo;s starting point is, what is one trying to achieve?  One is trying to achieve a policy objective of ubiquitous high speed broadband.  Regardless of which model one chooses, the gap funding model will achieve that objective.  I assume a concession model would achieve the same objective.  Before and after Eircom left, the gap funding model would have achieved the same objective.</p> <p>  I think the question the Deputy is asking and what some commentators have said is the gap funding model is based on two premises, namely, competition in the process and it is much cheaper.  The premise for the decision was not those two issues.  What can be seen in the 2015 consultation reports and the reappraisal report is a wide array of matters which were taken in the round in considering what was the most appropriate model.  The policy objective is the starting point.  The gap funding model, similar to a concession model, supports all state aid and market requirements.  It is a wholesale open access network, fully regulated, with products and prices and allows for effective competition at the retail level.  Both models do this.  The gap funding model is positive in terms of meeting not only state aid requirements but also market requirements.  It is akin to what ComReg tries to achieve with the private operators that it regulates such as Eircom.</p> <p>  It will all be on the basis of appropriate governance.  It is all absolutely wedded to the appropriate governance model being in place from day one for 25 years.  Everything carries that big health warning.  Whatever model one chooses, one must have appropriate governance by the Department, or whatever it decides to do in the future with an agency.  That is absolutely fundamental.</p></speech>

No matter what model one chooses, one will have to have one&rsquo;s infrastructure provider, builders of the network and an operating company.  We chose a design, build, manage and operate model.  We still believe the most efficient way to run it is through an integrated model where the operating company is working with the building company.  It is better that they are working together, as opposed to having two contracts, with two separate companies that could be pulling and tugging at each other for the next 25 years.  Again, that was a critical point.  One is creating an incentive for these guys to be efficient because they will want to maximise profits.  We hope they will because then the project will be successful, the policy objective will have been achieved and we will have a 60% clawback.  They are our objectives and we hope the private sector has the same ones.</p> <p>  We believe it does protect the public interest because we have protections in place on the three factors of passing, connecting and renting infrastructure whereby the public purse will be protected.  With the governance process in place, effective regulation by ComReg and the other measures we have in place in the contract in terms of accounting and oversight, we believe it is achievable in the short term.  It does not require us to start a new process and kick the can down the road for another two or three years before it starts.  That is not a key determinant, but it is an important factor in that everyone wants this to happen quickly.  We believe this model does that but in an appropriate fashion.  We are not doing it just because it works and we have two or three years to wait.  It works because of what I have outlined.  We believe it brings in an appropriate allocation of risk.  It is said there is no risk on the private sector side.  It has a mammoth task to build a network in the next seven years.  It will have to set up the project management office and manage the make-ready programme with Eircom.  It has been with the latter for the past year and a half, with a good process set up, with Eircom engineers with 30 years' experience working together.  All of the people and systems are in place.  The private company will take the risk that Eircom will go slower or that demand on the network will not arise as quickly as it thought it would.  It is also taking the risk of operating the company from year ten to year 25 and up to year 35.  There is an allocation of risk in a context where it really needs to make this work.</p></speech>

While Mr. Mulligan was speaking, I read through a reply, dated 15 May, to a parliamentary question.  It states: "The holding company will be wholly owned by Granahan McCourt Dublin (Ireland) Limited, subject to the Minister's special share".  This does not seem to suggest Tetrad Corporation has any ownership of the holding company.  I am not being niggly, as this has to do with who is carrying the risk.  If the only risk being carried is the initial &euro;175 million of equity, it does not give me much confidence in going to years ten, 12, 15 and onwards.  In the memo circulated by the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Mr. Watt, which formed part of the documents that were released he made it clear that all of that money would be paid back to Granahan McCourt, Tetrad or whoever was the beneficial owner within eight years.  That would be before many of the people in question had even signed up.  I am trying to figure out whether there will be any purpose for Mr. McCourt or his myriad of companies to remain around after year ten, as they will already have got their money.  My concern which tends to undermine the reason for following the gap funding model is the State is carrying all of the risk.</p></speech>

We hope the design, build and operation of the plan will be successful.  If everything is a roaring success, like any equity put into any company, the equity providers will be entitled to take their money back with a rate of return.  That is what Mr. Watt would have said.  If Mr. McCourt is successful in rolling out to 540,000 premises, connecting them on time and meeting all of the KPIs, requisite milestones and every other part of the contract - it will be a significant burden on any private operator over ten years, but I hope to be sitting here in ten years' time saying he has done it - he will be entitled to take back the money he has invested.  If he does not meet the requirements, he will have two choices.  His main choice will be to invest more equity.  If there are fewer customers in year four or five and a cashflow shortfall, he will have to make up the equity.  He will not get more of the subsidy.  The equity in the company being established is to be &euro;175 million, but who knows what additional amount might have to be invested by year six or seven to avoid us stepping in.</p> <p>  The Deputy should not forget that we have a choice.  If Mr. McCourt has 150 or 200 people working in a company, we will not be starting from scratch.  As long as it is appropriate to do so, we have the choice, not the obligation, to take that company and keep everything going.  Much of the subsidy will not have been paid at various checkpoints.  There are 110 deployment areas.  If 40 are delivered by year four, the network will have been built for those 40 areas.  We would take on those 40 areas and have a choice about whether we shouold keep the process going with the operating company or doing it differently.  I assume the operating company would be working in the way it should, with experts and people in place.  It might just be the case that Mr. McCourt had ran out of road and money.</p></speech>

That is why we have taken this approach to a contingent subsidy and a maximum capped subsidy.  On the other side, we have considered what would happen if the process was to be very successful and the uptake was fast.  In the Department we are positive about the project and considering what is happening in urban areas.  We have the figures for Eir's 300,000 households, but we cannot share them.  There is frustration about that, as figures are sometimes thrown around that are below them, although I will not say which.  Everything we are seeing in the market suggests we will not have the worst case scenario; rather, we will be somewhere in a mid-to-positive case scenario.</p> <p>  On how the contract is structured, it has to protect against the very positives and the very negatives.  Governance will lead towards the place one will expect to be in - the middle case scenario.</p></speech>

The past few weeks have seen startling revelations.  What we have been told publicly by Ministers and so on has not matched what has been happening behind the scenes, some of which we suspected.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about governance.  I would like the delegates to keep their answers short, as I have a number of questions to ask and they will appreciate this is the first opportunity we have had to ask some of them.  </p> <p>  There will be nine representatives on NBI's board.  At a recent morning briefing by officials in the Department, we were presented with a diagram.  One of the board members will represent the Minister and the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is putting in up to &euro;2.95 billion.  According to the Taoiseach today, Tetrad is putting in &euro;175 million.  It has only come into play in recent days or, rather, we have only been told about it in recent days.  The entity has changed numerous times in the three years I have been following this process.  As far as I can ascertain, Granahan McCourt is putting in a maximum of &euro;45 million in working capital.  The taxpayer is investing up to &euro;2.95 billion but will only have one representative on the board.  I do not know whether any of the delegates has ever been a member of, for example, a residents' association, sports club or some other committee.  I do not mean this to sound smart, but if there are nine people at a committee meeting and a decision has to be made, it can come down to a vote.  If there are eight people representing the interests of the private investor of &euro;45 million, &euro;175 million or whatever else and only one person representing the 4.7 million of us who inhabit the State, do the delegates believe the governance model is sufficient to provide for the interests of the Government, the Oireachtas and the taxpayer?</p></speech>

I have been involved in committees and have scars on my back after chairing a GAA club on the north side of Dublin for nine years.  The Minister's appointee to the board is just one of a suite of governance measures.  The board has only one purpose in life - to deliver on the contract it has signed with the Minister.  It is a 1,500-page contract, with a suite of governance measures.  That is where the key controls are for the Minister.</p></speech>

Therefore, the Minister's appointee is a very important person to have on the board.  The sole responsibility of the overall board, whether it is made up of five, seven or nine people, is the delivery of the contract for the Minister and the board will report to the contract regularly.

If I was part of the consortium and I put eight representatives on the board, I would be clear about who they were representing and to whom they were reporting back.  The entity, National Broadband Ireland, is flawed because of that.  I get no pleasure in pointing this out to the Department officials.  The structure is flawed from the point of view of the taxpayer, the State and protecting the interests of the taxpayer.  With representatives allocated eight and one, the balance of power on the board is overwhelmingly weighted in favour of the investor.</p> <p>  I want to move on to discuss the risk to the taxpayer.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform described the risk as a leap of faith.  Mr. Brendan Ellison, principal officer, strongly recommended against it.  We have seen that in the documents released.  The Department called into question the financial and technical ability to deliver the project.</p> <p>  Deputy Dooley referred back to where it started but it actually started long before that, because Enet was the company in the bidding.  Then, Granahan McCourt entered.  We have seen all the changes since.  SSE pulled out.  John Laing pulled out.  All of the others who were part of that consortium have pulled out.  Now we hear that there is another investor.  This morning, the Taoiseach said a total of &euro;175 million is being put up by Tetrad.  Is that written into the contract?  Has that money being lodged into an account?  Is it simply an A4 sheet of paper?  Is it simply a letter of comfort from an entity called Tetrad to say that it will commit a given amount to the project?  Can the Department officials clarify that?  The Taoiseach mentioned that letter.</p></speech>

In the procurement process we needed to know that the financial standing was in place.  We needed to know that there was equity to be invested and we needed to know the amount of that equity.

After that the Department drew up two contingency plans.  I want to move on to that.  In his opening statement, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in pointed out that the Department investigated the need for a plan B.  The Department published two contingency reports, one in 2018 and another in 2019.  Both reports concluded there were viable State-led alternatives that could deliver high-speed broadband in rural Ireland.  Will Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in outline to the committee the strengths of each of those State-led alternatives that the Department concluded were viable?</p> <p>  The Department officials referenced the contingency report.  Page 111 of the 2019 document states that a significantly more robust and thorough analysis would be required before the preferred plan B approach could be confirmed.  Will the Department officials tell the committee whether this thorough analysis was ever carried out or whether a cost-benefit analysis was commissioned by the Department on the plan B options?  If that did not happen, why did it not happen?</p></speech>

First, I will not dare to attempt to go into the detail of all of the contingency options because they are in detailed reports that have been published.  Having said that, we are happy to drill down on any specific questions on individual options.  Under the 2018 and 2019 processes there was extensive engagement internally in our Department and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We were looking at this in the context of the procurement process ending without a successful conclusion for any reason.  We looked at where we would go.  Then, at a later stage, we had a final tender in.  We understood that it could be delivered but we also understood what the cost was at that point.  We had to look again to see where that would bring us.  There was extensive analysis.  Across the analysis there were some common themes.  There were options that we could proceed with in the event that plan A did not go ahead.  Under any of the options the first thing we would have to do is effectively go back to the drawing board and consult on the strategy.  Then we would need a decision and we would need to publish a new strategy on the way forward.  It would not matter which option we took, whether we took one that was going to depend entirely on the market or one of several options around the establishment of a State agency.  One factor with a State agency option is that we do not have a State telecommunications body so we would have to establish that and build it up.  The obvious starting point would be to look at the resources in place.  There is a small team within the Department and we would have to try to build from that.  That of itself would take a certain amount of time.  We would expect a legislative element involved in that scenario.  Then we would need to go back to the market no matter what model we took.  Time was certainly an issue.</p> <p>  The Minister answered questions in the House yesterday around a cost-benefit analysis for those alternatives.  It would not be possible today - I would challenge anyone who could claim to do meaningful cost-benefit analysis on any of those options - because we are too early in the process.  Let us suppose that at this point we considered those options, allowing for the fact that we would have to consult on strategy and the amount of associated time we would lose once we have ended the current process.  The first question is what the scope of the intervention area would be.</p><p>Would it be 540,000 premises?  What would have changed by the time one had moved on that strategy?  If we consult on a new strategy, we must be open to different approaches that could affect it.  We would have to consult the market in terms of the infrastructure that would be used, because infrastructure was central to the procurement process that we have just come through, whether we plump for fixed line infrastructure of the two main networks, Eir and ESB, or whether somebody might come forward with or press for a more of a mobile solution.  Until there is clarity on the scope of the area, the nature of the technology and the scope affect the revenues plus the timing.  Again, some of those options that we looked at were to do a project very similar to the current project but over a longer period and gauging the impact of that on revenues.  Until we could lock down those factors, investing money in cost benefit analysis or CBA would have been meaningless.</p></speech>

The Minister said it would cost &euro;1 billion but Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said today that it would cost &euro;0.9 billion over 25 years in rent.  If the ESB model had been used, the infrastructure would have been in place.  The taxpayers will subsidise the project to the tune of almost &euro;3 billion, of which &euro;1 billion or almost &euro;1 billion will be spent on the model that the Department will use which, in turn, will go to the company called Eir, which was purchased by a French investor about two years ago.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Of that, Eir is allowed a return on its investment, which is 8.2%.  Let us do the maths.  It means over 90% of that money is to meet the cost of keeping the infrastructure in place.  What one is paying for is the fact that poles need to be replaced and for all of the costs of operating a network over 100,000 km of road in rural Ireland.  This is not money for jam.  This is money where one gets a rate of return that was set by ComReg, and ComReg can change the rate of return - the pole price.  On the basis of the model that we have before us, 8% of that money is the return to Eir on its investment in that network but the rest of it is for meeting costs.  The ESB would have costs of maintaining the network, equally.</p></speech>

One can see when one drives around the country that a lot of Eir's poles are falling over into ditches and there has been very little investment in the basic infrastructure since it was privatised in 1999.  First, Eir has got the 300,000 easiest to reach and most profitable households that banjaxed this process, which I will discuss in a minute.  Second, Eir needed an investment and a subsidy to modernise and repair its poles and ducting network in every county throughout the State.  Eir now has it in the form of the &euro;0.9 billion or &euro;1 billion that it will get over the next 25 years, so well done to Eir.</p> <p>  Thanks must go to the taxpayers for the contingency fund, and I am sure they will be happy with it.  In terms of the contingency, the Department's position was pointed out in the opening statement.  In 2018 and 2019, the Department produced two contingency reports and outlined alternative models.  At what point or date was a decision taken to produce the contingency reports?  Why did the Department feel the need at that point, in 2018 and 2019, to produce the reports?  I ask because the decision by the Government to go with the gap funding model was made in 2016, yet there was no contingency report or, seemingly, no sense until two and three years later that there was a need to draft contingency reports.  Was it only in 2017 that the Government realised that the project was in a more precarious state following Eir taking away the 300,000 easiest to reach and most commercially lucrative households?  Is that the reason for the timing?  Is that the reason contingency reports were drawn up in 2018 and 2019?  As someone looking in from the outside, it seems that was all we could do at that point and we had to figure out what was going on behind the scenes.  It looked to me, which I said to the Minister publicly in the Chamber and privately outside the Chamber, that the whole process at that point was fatally undermined and banjaxed.</p></speech>

The key factor influencing that piece of work was the fact that we were in a single bidder situation.  Earlier in the year we had carried out a project reappraisal, which led us in the direction of continuing with the procurement process, but notwithstanding that, it was determined that it would be useful to carry out contingency planning.</p> <p>  The second element, in 2019, as I alluded to earlier, was triggered by the fact that the evaluation of the final tender had reached the point where we understood what we had by way of a bid and we understood the cost.  We had to be realistic and say that here was a very big decision the Government was going to make in this space and, in advance of that, we had to look and ask, in the event that we were not to proceed, what else we might do.</p></speech>

It has now been clarified that the Government and the Department have moved away from that.  Even though there is not going to be fibre broadband delivered to every home, and we do not know how many homes it will not go to, the subsidy has increased to &euro;2.95 billion, which is amazing.  I know that politicians will sometimes reject the advice of civil servants at either local or national level.  We have all had bits of arguments with civil servants either at local government level or at national level, and I have had arguments and disagreed with civil servants on occasions.</p><p>There is a memorandum, dated 3 April 2019, by Mr. Brendan Ellison in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which states:</p><blockquote>However, we strongly recommend against approval of the appointment of the preferred bidder to the current NBP procurement process, on the grounds of:costs and affordability;<br /><br />impact on the NDP and on projects foregone as a result; [We know the list includes schools and other infrastructural projects.]<br /><br />value for money and, specifically uncertain benefits;<br /><br />unprecedented risk to the Exchequer; [The phrase &quot;unprecedented risk&quot; is very strong language.]<br /><br />and compatibility with the spatial objects of Project Ireland 2040.</blockquote> <p>That is just one quote.  The documents are littered with such statements.</p><p>Mr. Watt in the Department stated in another document, &quot;I want to again reiterate my gravest concerns about all of this&quot;, which he outlined.</p><p>Is the Department certain that it should go against this advice and the advice of the officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who are charged with looking after the State finances?  The public is looking at this and those who have been looking at the issue over the past ten days or so see that the costs have not shot up, and that the nature of the investors and who they are has not changed dramatically.  We were given to believe there would be a 50:50 split, even if it was not said explicitly, and that if the taxpayer put in &euro;1 billion, the investor would put in &euro;1 billion.  The main investor now appears to be putting in &euro;45 million.</p></speech>

There has been significant engagement between the two key Departments - my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform - throughout the process and that is continuing.  Where one finds oneself working as a civil servant is something of an accident.</p> <p>  The Deputy pointed to some material that is in the public domain and it is a positive aspect of the decision making around the national broadband plan that so much information has been put in the public domain.  It does not always help with the discourse because there is a lot of material, but key documents are critical.  In the letter from the Secretary General of my own Department in response to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the former goes through all the issues that were raised at great length.  The conclusion was that the analysis of civil servants in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was that the project is the right project and that it can be recommended to Government, even though there was disagreement across points between the Departments.  This Department is not an evangelist promoting the digital agenda or connectivity.  We have a responsibility to provide policy advice on the implementation of projects.  Having done the critical analysis and taken the expert advice available to us, from experts on our own team and externally, we have come to a clear conclusion and the Secretary General articulated that at a meeting of this committee.  His letter of 24 April should be accessed by people who want to understand the position of the Department on the matter.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said it was a matter of accident what side of the line a civil servant might be on, but I would always be on the side of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, possibly because of my own past experience as a Minister of that Department.  I generally take a dim view of most advice of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because, as sure as eggs are eggs, it always says we should not be investing in digital or renewables etc.  It has an instinctive desire to protect the public purse and is sceptical of most initiatives coming from line Departments, so I expected the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be concerned about the proposals.  Despite its opposition to the fundamental strategic decision to invest in fibre to the home, I think it is the right decision as it is ambitious for the long term.  I am more concerned about the fact that it is more concerned about the rate of return to the private developer, which is not its normal <i>modus operandi</i>.  When it expresses concern about the transfer of ownership to the private sector, which goes completely against its traditional outlook on the world, I really sit bolt upright.  Why is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is not accustomed to using exaggerated language and normally couches its ideas in subtle ways, giving such stark warnings?</p><p>In the response from Mark Griffin of 24 April there is small detail at the end stating the Department would incur a cost of &euro;10 million per year to maintain a team to oversee the project.  I presume that &euro;10 million is not included in the other project costs that have been itemised.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As the Secretary General pointed out, the expectation is that the Department would engage in the Estimates of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and raise a flag to indicate, at the early stages, what it might cost.  There is an intent to move to a separate governance agency to manage State telecoms contracts.</p></speech>

If the State is investing &euro;3 billion, the actual cost of the project is &euro;3.25 billion, because that is the total when the &euro;10 million is added for 25 years, even if it is not index linked.  This additional cost has not been discussed in the public arena.</p></speech>

However, the cost of governance will be much more significant in the early years when deployment is being undertaken.  It is a signal in the context of the letter. It was raised by the Secretary General during his communication with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the wider costs of operating his Department.  I would not extrapolate to say it is to be multiplied by 25.  The figure is conservative on the upward end and the costs will be higher in the early years.</p></speech>

It had similar characteristics in that we ended up with a single bidder.  The speeds were not the same - we had 3 Mbps - and the design and contract arrangements were done in two years, after which we delivered very quickly.  One of the differences, however, is that we were dealing with Hutchison Whampoa, one of the biggest private utility infrastructure companies in the world which owned massive assets everywhere.  I have nothing against Mr. McCourt and I met him when I was Minister.  He was involved in a speculative, high-tech satellite project.  SSE, Laing, Enet, Eir, Vodafone and the ESB pulled out to leave Granahan McCourt, but there is no comparison between Hutchison Whampoa and Granahan McCourt in terms of scale or expertise.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in said there had been various qualification processes for bidders, but was one done at the final stage, when all the other bidders had left?  As Deputy Dooley said, all Granahan McCourt is providing is the working capital and that is not even upfront but is a contingency cost in case its costs go over what is projected.  It is actually providing nothing but a letter from a bank to say the working capital will be provided if projections are met.  We are dealing with a developer who does not have any of the experience of SSE, Vodafone, Laing or even Enet.  Did the Department have a final check at any stage in this process to determine whether it was dealing with a substantial company that could bring the necessary international, industrial utility scale to the project?</p><p>When was the final qualification in respect of the bidder process?  When was the scale of the bidder in the context of adding value most recently assessed?</p></speech>

To clarify, however, Enet is a sub-contracting part of the bidder.  That is where it has been from the outset.  Enet is still there.  Mr. Neary will outline the final evaluation process, who is managing the company that will build this network and the subcontractors who will build it on the ground and their experiences.</p></speech>

The formal process has been the pre-qualification process.  The last change was concluded in September 2018 just before the final tender was submitted.  As part of the final tender there was an evaluation of the technical capacity and the plans the bidder would have to deliver the project over the 25 years.</p> <p>  An independent evaluation team was set up on the technical side to consider the deployment capabilities and the plan to deliver that in a credible and robust fashion, the technical solution, the partners underpinning that solution, the operational organisation that it will put in place, and how it will put that in place, the processes, procedures and tools that would govern the operation of the contract once it has been put in place.  That evaluation concluded earlier this year.  It has come through that independent evaluation.</p></speech>

The model used was that the Department managed the overall contract development or the delivery.  The Department was the central co-ordinator of all these contracting companies and delivered the networks.  In a sense, the Department played the role that Granahan McCourt is playing, namely, it managed the contractors.  Given that we are paying &euro;10 million a year for that Department, that it has real expertise, experience and capability in this area and that it has managed the bidding process over seven years, there are no better people in the world to deliver this type of project than those sitting in front of me.  Did they not at any stage think that they could do it themselves in the same way they delivered the MANs previously?</p></speech>

There are certainly some very good people on our team and Mr. Neary has significant experience of building telecoms networks.  Our team is able to manage this project but, while the Department was the lead entity, the role played by the local authorities in respect of the MANs was significant.  It would be useful for Mr. Neary to talk about the depth of expertise within this NBI company already before it builds it out further and a bit more about who the sub-contractors are and their experience in Ireland and elsewhere of building fibre networks, something the Department does not possess.</p></speech>

It is a large-scale roll-out over initially 100,000 km of roadway and up to 140,000 km of fibre.  It has a substantial amount of activity to kick off, getting its IT systems ready for onboarding service providers and getting the products to market, as well as commencing the design activities and starting to roll out to the different deployment areas.  To design a solution that we feel is credible and robust, it has put together a team of people who are highly experienced in rolling out networks in Ireland and internationally.  It has brought in people with deep experience of using the Eir infrastructure, one of the lead technical people has over 40 years' experience in rolling out networks.</p></speech>

The billing is to other businesses.  It is a business-to-business billing system and that is where we would have placed an emphasis in our procurement, to ensure that all service providers get equal treatment from the wholesale company.  It gets equivalence of inputs, that is the regulatory term.  Any service provider would be treated equally by the wholesale provider.  That is through the interface into its IT systems which is a particularly important interface.  There is also an operational side to the IT systems which maintains and monitors the networks.  Between the operational systems and the billing systems there is quite a substantial IT challenge for it to kick that off and get it in place.</p></speech>

Let us say the figure is 15% or 20%.  That is the return on their initial capital investment of &euro;175 million and that is ongoing over the lifetime of the project.  I presume it goes up if they put more capital in and so forth.  Why do they end up owning the asset?  If they get a rate of return of 15% or 20%, that would be deemed profitable in a regulated market, with a long lifetime of 25 years so why do they own the asset at the end of the period?  Is a 15% or 20% rate of return on capital not enough?  Why do they get to own the asset?</p></speech>

It comes back to the ownership issue because the ownership issue sends one to that place.  If it is gap-funded, it stays with the bidder.  When one looks to the engagement between the two Departments, what one sees is questions being asked about the risks to the project and about the potential for a significant downside.  The engagement is also saying that there are risks in the project if there is a significant upside.  The discourse is appropriate in the sense that people are looking at the entire spectrum of issues.</p> <p>  The Deputy has asked about the asset and the value of the business.  The asset is the physical infrastructure that is in place.  The Deputy also asked a question last week about the science and research around the durability of fibre, to which he has not received an answer yet.  We will explore that further but there is no question but that after 25 years or even 35 years, given the potential for a ten-year extension of the contract, we are in the space of renewing infrastructure.  There is a cost there for somebody, either the private entity that holds it, as per the gap-funded model or the State.  The Minister's response to parliamentary questions yesterday was helpful.  Deputy Dooley spoke about doing the maths in terms of 400,000 people paying &euro;30 per month.  In that context, by the time we get to year 25, we could be talking about a turnover of &euro;150 million.  Who knows what pole prices will be by then but even using today's figures, one could be talking about &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million for pole rental.  Let us say the company has 150 employees, it has poles that will need to be replaced following storms, equipment that will need to be upgraded and so on.  There is not a likelihood of very high profitability in this business at year 25.  This all relates to the ownership issue in the context of the gap-funded model, so I will not go on at length.  In terms of the pros and cons, it really depends on what happens at year 25.  If this business is very profitable, one would like to have it.  If it could pay its way in terms of any reinvestment, one would like to have it.  However, if it is the case that at year 20, the profitability was such that it required a significant judgment as to whether it was worth reinvesting and this was to come back to the State, the risk for the State would be that the private investor would not reinvest further and would not be incentivised to do so because it would not own it.  It is caught up in that but we must keep sight of the fact that the value of the business at year 25 is likely to be relatively low because the potential profitability is very low at that point, post deployment.  There is a risk up to the point of deployment but post deployment and post people coming on board, what we have is a regulated utility that is limited to selling wholesale services.</p></speech>

It is full of risks and the job of the political system sometimes is to take risks.  I am perfectly willing to take risks in funding the provision of fibre broadband to rural Irish homes.  However, given the fact that we are potentially investing &euro;3.25 billion while the developer is investing &euro;175 million, I see no reason not to go for a concession model under which we own the asset at the end.  That way, the upside risk belongs to us in the end.</p> <p>  Mention was made of the ESB and negotiations with that entity.  I have also been talking to the ESB and others in the last year about the possibility of using their pole network.  There is a certain strategic sense in doing so because we do not really need two sets of poles across the country.  My understanding is that the technology, regulatory and other risks are minimal because the ESB is already out there, rolling out to half a million homes.  We know that it can do it and has learned a lot in the last few years.  The biggest risk is getting anything done across a field rather than down a road.  The Eir poles are on the road network, by and large, at the edge of fields whereas the ESB network crosses fields.  It is my understanding, having spoken to many of those involved in recent years, that the biggest problem will be getting the agreement of landowners.  It is not that landowners will be discommoded in any way and I am sure that farmers like Senator Lombard would readily agree to a line going straight across his land-----</p></speech>

Any time one tries to do anything in Ireland, getting access to land can be problematic.  Even though it would not take more than an hour or two to run a cable across a field, access could be an issue.  What if we had tackled that issue and had got agreement from rural Ireland on it because this project will be so beneficial to rural Ireland?  If we had tried to get people to co-operate in order to ensure that the ESB has no difficulty in getting across fields, would that have made a material difference?  Am I right in my assessment that land access was probably the biggest challenge for the ESB?  I am thinking of the scenario in John B. Keane's play, "The Field", and the notion that no-one can cross a person's land.  Was that the biggest problem in terms of amalgamating the network so that there is a single set of poles?  As Deputy Stanley pointed out, the ESB poles are probably in far better condition than the Eir poles.  What stopped us using the ESB network as the preferred route?</p></speech>

We discussed access to the ESB network, how broadband and electricity could cohabit without discommoding electricity consumers and the impact on wholesale and retail prices for electricity if poles and ducts are being shared.  Connecting rural homes is different to connecting urban homes.  The latter is predominantly done underground.  Customers can be switched off in one area because there is broadband but connected in another.  There is an array of issues which we would probably get through.  We planned to get through them with the ESB so that its network was available but in the context of the programme that we have in place, it is not clear that it could be done faster or that it would be cheaper.  While we do not know for sure, we do not believe it would be.</p> <p>  In terms of the road network in the context of Eircom, it has just connected 300,000 customers and has learned a lot from that.  It worked very well so we have a proven network as opposed to an unproven one in the form of the electricity network across private land and across every part of rural Ireland.  The bidder has chosen the Eircom network because it wants to have lesser risk on that roll-out.  KN Networks and other companies, as the contractors, are now very familiar with what it takes to put fibre on Eircom poles and under Eircom ducts.</p><p>Other contractors do not have the same experience of using the ESB network and getting authorisation to climb its poles.</p></speech>

It is great to have everyone here.  We are debating a very important issue.  Could our guests provide clarification on the cost&ndash;benefit ratio and how it operates?  In the presentation, a ratio of 1.15:1 was referenced as the most conservative estimate.  The higher estimate is 2.14:1.  These are competing figures.  The delegates might elaborate on why there is a difference.  How was the analysis carried out?</p> <p>  Our guests might also elaborate on the key indicators that were not taken into consideration.  One of these was e-health.  An unusual indicator mentioned was climate change.  I have never come across the latter being used in that way until now.  We have obviously gone through a very extensive process in the Oireachtas producing a climate change report.  All Departments told us what they need to do to ensure that we will meet our targets for 2030 and 2050.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in might elaborate on why this was not considered a priority when it came to the issue itself.  The lack of broadband in rural Ireland and the climate change issue are tied together.  Why is the climate change element not central to the figures?  Why was it excluded?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#N00600"><p>I will talk at a very high level about what was not in the cost&ndash;benefit analysis.  Perhaps Mr. Mulligan will talk about the pessimistic and optimistic ratios.  Regarding the cost-benefit analysis, there is a methodology in the public spending code.  It is a very good discipline.  One cannot make it up as one goes.  One has to have the same set of rules for all cost-benefit analyses in order that the Government can have the ability to compare projects A, B and C over time.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct that the Minister called out benefits that cannot be captured under the public spending code, such as e-health, e-education, social inclusion, rural development, tourism and climate.  Yesterday, in responding to parliamentary questions, he focused on the statistics that exist with regard to the percentage of time spent on remote working.  A figure of 4% is given but it is recognised that this is increasing.</p> <p>  I refer to the reality when dealing with a technology project.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform called this out in his response.  The cost&ndash;benefit analysis is important as a tool the Government so it can understand, having gone through the rigorous process, the answer it gets.  The answer is positive.  One must recognise, however, that the methodology has limitations as an analytical tool in that the benefits that will result cannot be measured at this point.  If one were to have conducted a cost&ndash;benefit analysis on the introduction of a smartphone and follow the set of rules, the benefits one would have included would have been limited to the use of the phone for calls and texts, yet we now recognise all the other applications, such as online banking, email, social media, and entertainment.  It is a question of the rigour of the process.  One cannot invent a process to match a project but one has to recognise, as a decision maker, that there are limitations in a cost&ndash;benefit analysis of a technology project.</p> <p>  Mr. Tom McCormack might explain the pessimistic and optimistic elements.</p></speech>

The scope of the project does not change so the benefits remain the same except that, in the central case, we are saying there will be a figure of &euro;2.1 billion, excluding VAT, as Mr. Mulligan alluded to.  The other scenario includes the additional cost, the &euro;480 million.  When this is factored in, one gets a central scenario of 1.3:1 and the pessimistic scenario is 1.15:1.  The additional costs are included as contingency.  There is a differentiation between the two points.</p></speech>

The process is to cater for events such as storms.  The contract has key performance indicators on the repair and maintenance of the network.  The contractor is held to these.  The contractor has a reporting obligation to ensure that, on a monthly basis, the governance agency is supplied with information that gives visibility on what is happening in the field.  We considered resourcing in this regard and whether the contractor has subcontractors arranged to put the necessary staff in place in the relevant locations as the network is built and retain the ability to satisfy the criteria on the performance level being signed up to.  There are a key repair times included.  As demonstrated through the resourcing and subcontracts that underpin it, the ability to deliver on the targets has been demonstrated.</p></speech>

I will make a statement at the outset and then ask some questions, some of which have already been touched on.  We are all individually answerable to those who elect us so we have to ask the questions again.  I am happy we are here discussing the working out of a scheme to give the same opportunities to the people of rural Ireland as their urban cousins.  Had a cost-benefit analysis being done of rural electrification before it began, it could in no way have encapsulated the subsequent value that was realised.  The same applies here.</p> <p>  Let me move on to specifics.  Am I correct in saying the contingency figure of approximately &euro;500 million that was built in to avoid overruns will address all the issues associated with the other celebrated project, the national children's hospital?</p><p>Are our guests confident that, within that figure, they have dealt with all eventualities, we are safe, we are good to go and we can assure those watching us today that there will be no further costs?</p><p> Given a rate of 20%, the figure for the VAT return is discernible.  I gather it could be &euro;345 million.  The witnesses might give us the specific figure.  With my previous question in mind, how would a clawback to the State work?  Although they are slightly intangible, I would assume that the trends and other factors in society mean that the uptake will increase constantly until there is blanket coverage.  Not to harp on about it, but it will be equivalent to rural electrification.  There will be no home or premises in the Ireland to come without this broadband.  In that good scenario, how will the clawback to the State work, how well has it been proofed and what will the percentage be?  Are the witnesses confident in that regard?</p><p> There is a recurring theme in all of the questioning on and media coverage of this issue.  Apart from the initial equity, which is not necessarily a huge issue, are our guests satisfied that NBI has the financial capacity to meet its obligations continuously over the period?  Has it been stress tested properly?  From my limited understanding of business, that is more important than having a nice flowery figure at the outset but no durability to last the long haul.  While some of the points I have raised are obvious to those immersed in the situation, there are those watching who expect us to establish them in lay man's terms.  We have within this room an immersed group of people, but not everyone outside understands.  Beyond the down payment, what did the Department do to establish that NBI has the capacity to meet its commitments for the duration?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#O00300"><p>I am nearly there.  Regarding the idea that we should get the asset after 35 years, I will ask two questions.  What will the asset be after 35 years?  I understand that our guests cannot account for technological advances in the interim, but what is the projection based on our current knowledge?  What will happen in the lacuna between 25 and 35 years?  If I understand it correctly, the contract lasts for 25 years.  The Department seems to be looking towards a 35-year period and tightening it to 25 years.</p> <p>  Will our guests comment on a certain popular belief?  It kept being raised in responses on my social media pages when, as we people do, I put up a standard message welcoming the plan.  I was asked why we were not opting for 5G.  People watching this broadcast and who follow this issue will have at the back of their minds the belief that 5G would do the business.  Our guests know otherwise, but I would like them to elaborate for the sake of those who have doubts.</p> <p>  Why the ESB is not used is another classic question that arises.  Will our guests explain the reasons for that?  The idea of using the ESB has a certain traction in the public's consciousness.  People relate to it as an entity and have confidence therein.  They are asking why it is not the delivery vehicle.  It would have to go through a similar process, of course.</p> <p>  Will our guests also explain the graduated nature of the payment?  Taxpayers have the perception that someone will hand a cheque for &euro;3 billion to Mr. McCourt next September and that we will depend on his goodwill and competence thereafter.  What will the relationship between the work done and payment be and what are the projected payments over the period?  Paying X amount over so many years is a different proposition than making a down payment of so much.  Will there be a return over the period?  My colleague referred to the non-established benefits that will accrue as we go along, for example, taking commuters off the road and letting them work from home in dispersed areas instead of having them seek accommodation in Dublin.  My question is about the graduated payments.</p> <p>  There is a procurement process, but is the Department satisfied with NBI's technical competencies as well as its financial ones?</p> <p>  Why is it a seven-year period?  It seems long.  If I understand what they said correctly, our guests are suggesting that 134,000 premises will be completed in the first year.</p></speech>

That seems inordinately long.  Are attempts being made to shorten the period?  Surely there would be a commercial imperative for the company to shorten it.  That might help.</p> <p>  A popular question is being asked, so let us address it once more.  Why was Eir allowed to cherry-pick its 300,000 premises?  We have been provided the official answer, but the people who elect us would wonder if the question was not addressed.</p> <p>  I have nothing more to say.

He put a significant number of questions to us but, in fairness, he did so articulately and briefly.  We will try to match that in responding.  I will pass over to Mr. Mulligan in a moment to deal with the Senator's first five questions and one other.  Mr. Neary might address the questions on 5G, the technical competence of NBI and the seven-year roll-out.  I will conclude by dealing with the questions on the ESB and Eir's 300,000 premises.  We will see if we can match the Senator's brevity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal Mulligan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#O00800"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  Every day, Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in and I ask Mr. Neary why the period is seven years.  Since we will continue to do so, we will let him answer that question.</p> <p>  As to whether the contingency is adequate, it has been assessed over the 2016-18 period with all the bidders, including the most recent one.  We considered everything they told us that would be a risk to the project, including risks that they could not quantify.  Through that dialogue and 800 odd hours, we came up with everything in respect of which we as the State viewed it as being reasonable for us to share the risk with the bidders.  For example, if there is a construction risk and it is not one of the 14 activities, it is for the bidder to share.  With the best will in the world, we have assessed and quantified them, be they tree trimming, fibre cables or subcontractor labour rates, and a risk assessment has been carried out on where they might go in the worst case scenario.  That is what we have addressed in the &euro;480 million.  It is what we believe is the maximum cost that could be incurred in the worst case scenario without there being a need to revert to the State for another penny.  From the experts and our assessments, that is our current informed opinion.  We went to the Government with this.</p><p> Clawback is in three areas.  There is clawback on the costs.  If it does not spend money we claw it back, if it has excess profits we claw it back and if there is a significant value on the business at year 25, we claw a percentage of that back as well.  I will not speculate on what clawback amounts might be as it is difficult to say.  As we said previously, how well this business does over the next 25 years is a big question.  Some people say it is doomed to fail, some say there will be no take-up and others says it will be a huge success.  Hopefully, it will be somewhere in the middle and clawback will be based on that.  It is based on very thorough spreadsheets, which are calculated based on the bid model submitted versus actual outturns.  The ring-fenced nature of the numbers will be done by accountants and locked in so it will be whatever percentage it is.</p><p> We touched on the capacity of NBI.  It is not a matter of opinion.  It has passed a strict bar of evaluation tests.  It had to prove to us that it will have the capacity and the teams to do it.  It passed that test, not just barely but quite well.  On the basis of the evaluation, we are satisfied on that front.</p><p> On the ownership of what will be there at the end, we hope that at year 35, there is a successful wholesale open access business that is creating plenty of retail competition and consumers are getting a good set of services at prices akin to those in urban areas.  That company will be in a competitive market with companies such as Open Eir, BT and others which will buy services from it and possibly even sell services against it.  That is what we hope will be there if it is a successful outfit.</p><p> As regards year 25 and year 35, as part of the outcome of the dialogue process the Department wanted to avoid a cliff edge at year 25 so we insisted on a ten-year commitment beyond year 25 where the current owners of NBI will continue running the business at no cost to the State beyond year 25.  There will invariably be customers who remain uneconomic or at a cost that may not be profitable, but NBI is committing to honour the contracts on all services in the area for a further ten years at no cost to the State.  That commitment is in the contract with us this year.</p><p> Mr. Neary can discuss 5G, the ESB and the seven years.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that the payments are incremental over the next ten years.  Payments continue from year 11 to year 25 as well because we only pay it as customers are connected.  There are payments for designing the network, passing the networks and for connections.  That is in 110 deployment areas.  Some money will be required next year and more the following year.  When there is a mass roll-out of 100,000 premises a year, there will be significant subsidies in years three, four and five.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulligan is thorough.  Would it not be helpful if the great taxpayers of Ireland were aware of that?  They should be made aware of the incremental nature of it and what it will be year by year.</p></speech>

It invited bidders to come forward with what they felt was the most suitable technology.  We did not specify a fibre to the home technology in the procurement.  The most efficient and economical way to do this project was examined and all the bidders that participated in the process concluded that fibre to the home was the best way to do it.  Alternative solutions such as wireless or 5G were certainly considered.  We modelled that in terms of mixing different technologies, perhaps using wireless in certain instances and fibre in others.  There are challenges in many technologies.  On the 5G side, it would require thousands of new masts to be built around the country to reach all premises.  That is a challenge for the deployment.  Those sites would also have to be maintained and there would be rental costs for them over the full 25 or 35 years.  Obviously, 5G will turn into 6G, 7G or 8G over the long term so technology upgrades would be required as well on the wireless side.  All technologies were considered and it was concluded that fibre to the home was the best one for this project.</p> <p>  The technical capacity and competencies of the bidder were evaluated as part of a substantial evaluation test, particularly in the final tender.  We published the technical capabilities that we tested.  They related to the technical solution itself, the products that were going to be produced and offered, the deployment solutions and the operational solution.  An independent team was put together to evaluate those and the bidder passed the final tender evaluation.</p> <p>  Why is it seven years?  The scope of the project involves a substantial ramp up period.  In the first year the IT systems are put in place and service providers who will sell the service are brought on board so they can sell the services.  Parallel with that the bidder will be doing detailed designs.  That involves people going down every road and boreen in the countryside to identify what existing infrastructure can or cannot be reused and then producing a low level design that is the optimum design for the location.  That is the first effort involved.  That leads to an order to be placed to Eir to remediate its infrastructure if that is the infrastructure that will be used.  That is substantial work in itself.  Parallel with that the bidder would do other preparatory activities such as tree trimming, brackets on poles and so on before it starts laying the fibre.  In addition, it is looking at the local authority applications for licences if it needs to carry out any road closures or digs for broken ducts and the like.</p> <p>  All these tasks and issues came to the fore through the dialogue with the bidders.  The rate of throughput that can be achieved by Eir in preparing its networks, the local authority applications and the subcontractors came together in the final tender submission from the bidder last year.  In that process it had to demonstrate that its plan was credible and could be achieved.  The outcome was that it could do this within a seven-year period.  There are opportunities and there are certainly attempts to bring that timeline forward, in particular working with Eir to see if it can make its network ready earlier so the NBI contractor can roll out its fibre earlier.  Through the work of the mobile telephone and broadband task force, we are working with the local authorities on ensuring they are ready for the applications that will go to them through the broadband officers who are now in place.  There are attempts to bring that seven-year period forward and there is a commercial imperative as well to do it as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

In terms of an infrastructure provider, as Mr. Neary outlined, the country is broken into 110 deployment areas.  When it comes to the point of designing the low level design for how to reach the 5,000 premises within the deployment area the bidder will be looking at all existing infrastructure and options.  It will predominantly be based on the Eir network but it will also look at using the ESB infrastructure.</p> <p>  We have discussed the 300,000 premises previously.  The procurement had a process that recognised one is operating in a live market and the environment is subject to change and that telecommunications companies could come forward with proposals that could impact on the procurement for the intervention on the map.  Eir engaged with that process.  It was assessed and it was concluded that it had followed the process, it was consistent with state aid rules and the 300,000 premises were removed from the map.</p><p>That had some implications for the procurement process in terms of costs, benefits and duration.  The learning from that and from operating in a live environment has influenced the approach to the contract, which is to recognise that as we go forward over the next 25 years, this bidder with a contract will be operating in a market that is subject to change, so in the contract we have sought to tie down and close out the areas of risk in that market because we cannot anticipate exactly the direction of travel of such change.</p><p> Senator O'Reilly will be aware that for public representatives in rural Ireland and that in parliamentary questions to the Minister, the most topical issue relates to the people who live closest to the Eir 300k because they are getting a wonderful service over the Eir 300k and their neighbours are envious.  We are seeking to fill that void through the NBP.</p></speech>

We have the ultimate company that will do the work, then there is this holding company and then there are the shareholders.  In the event that the broadband company does not perform and, as a result, develops a significant liability or requirement for investment, what guarantee does the State have that the shareholder will invest further share capital or make good any liabilities that are there?  I am somewhat concerned that there is National Broadband Ireland, a holding company, Granahan McCourt (Dublin) Ireland, which in effect is another subsidiary of Granahan McCourt, and then we have Tetrad Corporation over here.  Tetrad Corporation seems to be the company with the money and I want to understand what encumbrance is on Tetrad Corporation or whoever the money person ultimately is because it has changed along the way and it was McCourt Global LLC for a while.  What instrument is used to retain Tetrad Corporation, if it is Tetrad Corporation, at the table over the protracted period of this contract?  In essence, if there is further capital required, what encumbrance is placed on Tetrad Corporation and what legal instrument?  Quite frankly, the contract is different.  As I understand it, the contract is between the State, NBI and perhaps Granahan McCourt.  I want to know what grip the Department has on the people with the money to put it in if it is needed.</p></speech>

In any of these public private partnerships, PPPs, or large infrastructure projects, there is a spider's web of contracts that are signed by lots of different individuals, including the Minister.  For example, we have direct agreements with the subcontractors and we will even have a direct agreement with KN Network Services and Actavo, for example.  It will always go above National Broadband Ireland in the context of the committed agreements and legal ability to enforce the contract.  NBI is the broadband company but the obligations do not just sit with it; they flow all the way to the people who have put in their bid.  They have to honour the contract.  What is the cause and effect?  They could lose all their money.  If they put in more money and it collapses they could lose that money.  They can lose all that and we have a charge over all the assets that are built until the full contract is honoured for 25 years.  It is like any bank that has a mortgage with a homeowner.  The homeowner is not off the hook until he or she fully honours the mortgage.  We have the same arrangement with this bidder and the assets.  If there is an asset there of fibre cable, we have a charge over all assets that are built and funded through National Broadband Ireland.</p> <p>  That is just one aspect.  It also has to put a bond up and there are a lot of warranties and indemnities that it has to honour in the contract, and if it does not fulfil them, it could be sued by the State.  It has to sign up to all of those measures.  That is why we will spend the next two or three months contractualising all that to the nth degree, all the way from NBI, Holdco and up to Tetrad Corporation and Granahan McCourt, as the Deputy mentioned.  That is all in place with the contracts and that is why there is a data room as it is called.  I found out this morning that a contract closed for two weeks because there are myriad documents, which are signed by all of those people and the Minister to ensure that over 25 years somebody cannot just walk away and that is the end of it.  There are big consequences to walking away from this contract.</p></speech>

It all speaks to the ownership model associated with gap funding versus the concession model because when myriad companies are involved, obligations denigrate somewhat over time, and they certainly denigrate as one goes from one holding company to the next.  I would like to see that direct link back to the people who have the money-----</p></speech>

Whoever is the final money entity needs to be connected.  Will the Department commit to providing us with whatever documentation it can to demonstrate the linkage between all these companies, which shows who owns what, the shareholdings and what instrument is used to ensure they remain on the hook for any additional moneys that have to be invested?  Clearly the witnesses do not have that information available to them and they are not fully aware of who owns what in the shareholdings but perhaps they can provide that information to us.</p></speech>

The cost and value for money are important and we have to address those but rapid deployment of high-speed broadband is the major issue because that speaks to the policy behind all of this and seven years is not rapid deployment.  I want to try to understand the contingency plan that the Department looked at in 2019, in particular, when it stated the following: "The information presented in this document has been developed with the intent of illustrating what could potentially be achieved in a plan B scenario using high level assumptions and assuming favourable timelines to complete a number of complex tasks."  Does that imply that the costings of the alternative were not detailed in nature and it was more high-level analysis or was it detailed?</p></speech>

The other part of that is, if for some reason there was a plan B, we do not want to give away our hand on what the internal workings are and what it would cost, for example, to bring fibre to a certain point in the village or outside the village.  Of course, we got detailed costings of all of that.  If we ever had to go to the market, inevitably, the market would provide very different costings.  That is the challenge one has on a plan B.</p></speech>

As politicians, we are charged by the Taoiseach to consider alternatives, examine what the Department is doing and not rule out the plan the Department has in place, but without information it is difficult to make a value judgment.  I am not calling into question Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in's judgment if we are all in this together in an attempt to address the critical element, which is the roll-out.</p> <p>  I examined some of the alternatives.  In 2019, the Department considered three options.  In 2018, it looked at six.  The language here is absolute - to do something to 100% of the homes.  Did anybody look at where the sweet spot is between timing and costs based on fibre and wireless in terms of trying to get it deployed as quickly as possible using as much fibre as possible, but not using all fibre?  From my experience representing urban, suburban and rural parts of my constituency, there are people on the periphery who, if they were told they would get a fixed wireless option - I will not get into the technologies of wireless, whether 4G, 5G, 6G or 7G, or whether it is packet radio network or whatever - in three and a half years, would take the hand off whoever would offer that versus being told that they will now get fibre with all the facilities of our friends here so that they will be able to monitor their temperature, their health and their heartbeat in seven or eight years.  A good number of them will be dead by then.  Children who are starting secondary school in September next will be through university before that is deployed.  There seems to have been this absolute position that there has to be fibre to the home in 100% of the cases with the exception of 1% or 2%.  Did anybody look at bringing back the scale and ask, "What if we did it to 70% or 80%?"</p></speech>

The technology was not being driven by the Government.  The technology came from the industry.  We all absolutely understand that frustration - I know it from the team here - about the time it will take to get to the last home.</p> <p>  It would be useful for Mr. Neary to address two points.  One is the practicality or otherwise of a hybrid model where one was going for 30% or 40% of wireless in terms of the work that we did when we modelled what it looks like and what that would mean in terms of what one has to cover by fibre, which I understand to mean that one would still cover most of the same area if one goes for a hybrid approach.  The second is work that ComReg has done.  I refer to the Plum report in terms of if one is going 100% wireless, the scale of additional masts that one would require and the roll-out and build-out time there because it could be quite significant.</p></speech>

I am wondering what analysis was done or what information the Department could provide on that optimum model somewhere between 20% and 25% wireless.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Neary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019052200002#R01000"><p>We definitely looked at mixing the technologies and having different percentages of fixed wireless and fibre.  Other technologies were considered as well.  We looked at having a predominant solution, say, fibre and then the delta being used by a fixed wireless, say, 20%, 5%, etc.  We have looked at lots of different variants of this.</p> <p>  Going back to what Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in was hinting at there, when one deploys a fixed-wireless network, one may pick up a number of homes through that deployment but, ultimately, one needs to bring fibre out to the backhaul in those particular sites and one is building a lot of fibre to those particular sites anyway.  What one finds, if one mixes that then with a fibre deployment, is one ends up building a lot of the same infrastructure anyway because a fixed-wireless service will not take every contiguous home along a road.  It might take 60% or 70% and then one must still build the fibre down the same road to get to the last three.  One is not substantially reducing the fibre cost by introducing an overlay of a fixed-wireless network.  It is not a case where one can say, "Okay, I will do this section here with fixed wireless and all of those premises are then removed, and then I will do the remainder with fibre."  One is overlaying two networks, one on top of the other.</p> <p>  We have done a lot of analysis on what works best.  Ultimately, we have had serious teams of bidders with real in-depth technical expertise examining the same question.  Two of the bidders have mobile arms - Eir and Vodafone, which was backing the SIRO bid.  They had serious mobile expertise and wireless expertise to draw upon to look at that as well, and they all concluded that a predominantly fibre-to-the-home network is the best way to do this.</p> <p>  Obviously, we looked at a full fixed-wireless access topology deployment as well.  Independent of the Department, ComReg's Plum report shows that more than 4,500 new masts would require to be deployed.  The deployment time of that is quite substantial.  They estimated it was well over ten years.</p> <p>  We would look to how the bidder has come to the conclusion.  We have examined that thoroughly to see have they robustly examined the variance.  That certainly was part of our analysis.</p></speech>

I can anticipate the answer but I still want to ask it, if the Chairman does not mind.  If the entire NBI or part thereof was to be sold or be taken over or flipped and sold on, all things remain the same.  Are there mechanisms for that?  How would it work that there would be no interest lost, if in a year's time they found someone to take them over?  It is a question that will occur to those watching it.</p></speech>

Shareholding changes are allowed under the 25-year contract but they must go through the Department and Minister for approval.  Within the first nine years, the Minister has a specific veto over any change of ownership or majority change of ownership should he or she have any issue with who a new owner might be in the context of honouring the contract.  The most fundamental point is anybody looking to take a shareholding in NBI would have to meet the same responsibilities of the contract.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation and the engagement that I know we will have.  I welcome Mr. Paul Reid, the new director general of the HSE, and his colleagues in the HSE.  I wish Paul well in his new role, as I am sure we all do.  He is a very exciting and important appointment for our health service at a crucial time when we have record levels of investment but also an ambitious reform programme that we need to deliver on.  I also take the opportunity to thank Ms Anne O'Connor, the deputy director general, for her tremendous commitment while serving as the interim director general of the HSE for the past months.</p> <p>  I am happy to be here to give an update on recent developments in the health sector and issues affecting the Department of Health and the HSE.  I am particularly pleased to report on a number of positive developments.  We have spoken at length in this committee about the need to transform how our health services are delivered.  Our population is rapidly changing and brings with it changing healthcare needs.  Like other countries, the Irish health service needs to change radically if it, too, is properly to meet the health needs of our population.  We need to rethink how we deliver services, placing a greater emphasis on prevention and population health initiatives to support people to live independently in their communities for as long as possible.  We need to deliver efficient, effective, sustainable health and social care services to meet the needs of all of our citizens.  This will require a whole society approach with new ways of thinking and of working together.</p> <p>  The good news is that Sl&aacute;intecare provides us with that roadmap and vision for the future of healthcare.  We have talked a lot at this committee about where we are with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am pleased to say that we are now making substantial progress.  The focus of our implementation plan is on establishing the building blocks for a very significant shift in the way in which health and social care services are delivered in Ireland, through the provision of four overarching goals and ten high level strategic actions.  These include changes and improvements to our health services and a range of new measures to strengthen structures, governance and accountability.  This system-wide reform process commenced with the appointment of Laura Magahy as the executive director to lead the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office.  I know Ms Magahy has engaged and will continue to engage with members of this committee because it is important that we retain that cross-party consensus and buy-in to the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  We have an action plan for 2019 in place.  This sets out a detailed and programmatic approach to the delivery and clear structure of how we will deliver this ambitious reform programme.  We have had many strategies in the past.  There is now a very programmatic approach led by Ms Magahy saying exactly what we will do, when we will do it, and how we will track that delivery.  The Sl&aacute;intecare team published its report for the first quarter recently and that showed that 28 of the actions that were due for delivery were all on track.  Every quarter, we will publish a progress report on how we are getting on in that regard.  I will also report to Government every quarter, with a memorandum for the information of Government.  There will be nowhere to hide for anybody who does not want to get on board with this reform agenda.  There is great enthusiasm across the health service, including the HSE and the Department of Health, for the delivery of this programme.</p> <p>  The budget provided more than &euro;200 million of additional funding to support a range of priorities proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy.  This includes funding for a modernised general practitioner, GP, contract and ultimately for the expansion of free GP care; new therapy posts to address waiting lists for children with disabilities; new development funding aimed at further enhancing mental health teams; reduced user charges and out of pocket payments for prescription charges on the drug payment scheme; and increased investment for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which will be used to treat 70,000 patients on waiting lists this year.</p><p>The overall additional funding also includes the &euro;20 million Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund, launched in March.  This is very exciting and a different way of doing business.  The health service is putting a dedicated, ring-fenced fund in place and inviting people involved in the delivery of healthcare to pitch their ideas.  It asks how people can make Sl&aacute;intecare happen in their primary care centres and organisations.  Organisations do not have to be a part of the HSE.  They can be voluntary organisations which provide health services.  The enthusiasm for this fund has been overwhelming.  Many people have put forward very good ideas.  The fund will focus on proposals that support the development of existing and new best practice projects that deliver integrated care, which shift services to the community and which have the potential to be scaled nationally.  We will be announcing the projects to be funded by this year's integration fund in the next number of weeks.<br/><br/>I am delighted to say that the transformation process required to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare is well under way.  However, there is a lot of work left to do.  I am sure that this committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Harty, will lead in that regard.<br/><br/>I have been asked many times when talks on a new package for GPs would conclude.  I have always said that they would be finished shortly, and now they are done.  I am particularly happy that my Department has concluded a landmark agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, on a major package of GP contractual reforms.  As I said in Killarney at the annual conference of the IMO, this is not the end of our engagement with GPs.  We are far from finished.  Indeed, the new agreement commits to a strategic review of general practice.  This is a landmark agreement which will help transform and reform the Irish health service.  It will help to stabilise general practice after very significant cuts during the austerity years and restore levels of funding.  In return, GPs will sign up to do things in a new and different way.  It represents a &euro;210 million investment in general practice over the next four years.  This is a 40% increase on the funding currently available.<br/><br/>A sum of &euro;80 million will be available for the management of chronic diseases, which is a crucial Sl&aacute;intecare initiative.  The idea is that people with certain chronic diseases such as certain heart diseases, diabetes and asthma can now be treated in the community under this deal, seeing their local GP rather than going to the hospital.  A wide-ranging set of modernisation measures has also been agreed in the areas of e-health, medicines management and multidisciplinary working.  That agreement has been published on my Department's website, and I am sure it will be happy to continue to engage with the committee.<br/><br/>We are making good progress on our primary care centres.  We now have 127 fully operational care centres, up from 70 at the end of 2012.  In 2018, 18 primary care centres became operational, a further nine will open this year, and 11 more will open in 2020.  We are beginning to fill in the gaps throughout the country in terms of the provision of primary care centres.  These should not just be viewed as buildings but also as infrastructure that can help enable change.  In addition, eight primary care centres are at the<b></b>advanced planning stage.<br/><br/>We are expanding our community intervention teams, CITs, and have increased the number of paediatric home care packages, PHCPs, being provided.  The HSE is also progressing the improvement of access to radiology services for patients in primary care.  There is no point in just having these buildings.  We also need diagnostic tools in the buildings where appropriate.  I recently saw an example of this in the Athlone primary care centre, where X-rays and ultrasounds are being carried out, taking significant pressure off the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.<br/><br/>I will comment briefly on the progress we have made on the industrial relations front.The Labour Court recommendation on nurses and midwives envisaged a range of tangible and specific nurse practice measures that the court viewed as the basis for a fundamental change in the role of the staff nurse grade.  It spoke of the need for a new enhanced nurse practice role.  I welcome that there was a positive ballot by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation accepting this Labour Court recommendation.  This will result in a new contract for a new enhanced practice nurse who will be working in different, more flexible ways, help us realise transformative change in the nursing profession, and help us to better support many of our nurses financially as well.  I had an opportunity to speak to the INMO at its annual conference in Trim on that issue.<br/><br/>We need more capacity in the health service.  We can carry out many reforms in the primary care system, but it does not get us away from the fact that we still need additional capacity in terms of beds.  I am now regularly publishing an open beds report.  I have or am about to publish the latest report, showing that the number of open hospital beds in Ireland continues to increase.  The graph is very clear.  After dips during the recessionary years, and perhaps before that, the number of hospital beds in our system continues to grow.<br/><br/>I have received the report of the de Buitl&eacute;ir group to examine the removal of private practice from public hospitals.<b></b>This was a key recommendation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I have nailed my colours to the mast politically.  I am in favour of it.  Not everyone else has.  I welcome people's views on the matter.  My Department is considering the report and its recommendations.  We cannot have a situation where public patients are deprived access to healthcare in busy public hospitals when private practice continues, in some cases unabated, in those settings.  This will not be done overnight but will involve significant work and consideration by the Government.  We will consider the report and its recommendations, engage with other relevant Departments and ultimately go to the Government for its decision.  Under Sl&aacute;intecare I gave a commitment to carrying out this independent review, and I thank Mr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and his colleagues on that group for their work.  It is a very comprehensive examination of private activity in public hospitals and contains a small number of recommendations.  It takes a practical approach to removing private practice from public hospitals and details the impacts this removal would have, the timeframe that should apply and how it should be phased out.<br/><br/>The committee will be aware that we intend to bring in a new independent board and governance structure for the HSE.  This will be very important and will coincide with the arrival of our new director general, who will become the new CEO.  I have engaged with the Opposition on this, Deputy Donnelly in particular, in terms of amending the composition of that board.  I expect to return to the Seanad next week to finalise the amendments we agreed in the D&aacute;il.  I certainly hope the Seanad will consider it.  I will then return to the D&aacute;il finally to adopt the Bill with a view to that board taking up office in June.  It is very important.  This was also a key aspect of the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<br/><br/>It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the Cross judgment.  I have discussed it in the D&aacute;il with the Chairman and other colleagues present.  I continue to consider the judgement with officials, the State Claims Agency and the Office of the Attorney General.  As discussed, we received correspondence from the HSE which sets out potential implications for, in particular, screening services arising from the judgment.  It is important that we be allowed some time to tease through these issues and that we collectively work to address them.  I ask those in leadership positions in the medical profession to work with me during this time as we reflect on the judgment and form a fuller understanding of the potential implications and what other jurisdictions do in this regard.  I want the clinical community to know that I, as Minister for Health, the Government and the Oireachtas understands its concerns.  We are committed to working with it to address its concerns.  I intend to meet the leadership of the medical profession as part of my response to the issues arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.250" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#C00200"><p>I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Anne O&rsquo;Connor, deputy director general, Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute services, Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer, and Ms Grace Rothwell, general manager of University Hospital Waterford.  I commenced my role as the HSE director general last Tuesday, 14 May 2019.  Prior to this I was chief executive of Fingal County Council for the past five years.  Before that I was the chief operations officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Most of my previous career has been in the private sector, mainly as an executive director with Eir.  During my time in Fingal County Council I worked closely with community healthcare organisations, primary care centres and, indeed, many community-based projects and Healthy Ireland initiatives.  In 2017, I was invited by former Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to be vice chair of the national task force on youth mental health.  I was also a member of the advisory council on Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p>  As a committed public servant, there is no greater role than to be working with a dedicated and valued workforce, striving to make people&rsquo;s lives better.  I have set out three immediate priorities for the organisation and, indeed, for the new chairman and board.  These are the delivery of quality and safe services to the public, including patients and service users; transitioning to a new model of integrated care; and strengthening the confidence and trust in the organisation from many of our stakeholders, including the public and patients.  I look forward to working with the chairman and members of the HSE board, together with health services staff throughout the country, to achieve these important priorities.  I also look forward to working with the Chair and the members of this committee and commit to providing them with the information they need to carry out their important role.</p> <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare report for 2017 signalled a new direction for the delivery of health and social care services in Ireland.  It sets out a new model of regional and integrated care to deliver quality and safe services to our patients and service users.</p><p>As mentioned by the Minister, to support early implementation, in budget 2019, &euro;20 million was provided for the establishment of a Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund to test and determine how services could best be delivered.  I have been really impressed by how the system has responded overwhelmingly to date, from the bottom up, with initiatives that will ensure the integration fund will support reform in front-line services where we can make the greatest impact.  </p><p> On financial matters which are very challenging for the organisation overall, I issued a memo within the organisation on 14 May.  I understand it has been made available to the committee.  It highlights the need to  break even financially, while prioritising the safety of services.  In the next week or so the chief financial officer, CFO, of the organisation and I will be meeting senior management to review plans and assess how we might be able to achieve this outcome.</p><p> Notwithstanding the strengthened controls, it is a fact that the health service is dealing with increased demands.  This process is internded, therefore, to ensure we will commit resources, where required, within the available resources.  It is a very challenging process, but we must build a culture where we deliver within the budget allocated to us by the Oireachtas and the State.  We will be in a stronger position in the future to invest in the new models of care.  </p><p> On scheduled care, it is a fact that waiting times remain too long.   Notwithstanding this, there has been considerable progress made in reducing the numbers waiting for access to surgery.  The figures published for April show that the number of patients waiting for inpatient/day case procedures was 70,295.  This represents a decrease of over 9,000, when compared to the figure for April in the previous year.  The investment made by the Government is greatly welcomed and supported by collaboration between the HSE, the Department of Health and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  </p><p> Outpatient waiting lists remain too high, with 551,965 waiting for an appointment.  The numbers waiting were adversely impacted on in the early part of the  year as a result of strike action.  To ensure a consistent approach to the validation of waiting lists, the HSE and the NTPF have worked closely to establish a central validation office which is supporting the adoption of a consistent approach to the validation of waiting lists across all of the acute hospitals.</p><p> On unscheduled care, the demand for emergency care continues to grow year on year.  The figure for the first quarter of the showed a 7.6% increase, at over 23,700 patients, compared to the figure for the same period last year.  I fully acknowledge that there is a need for a significant improvement in waiting times for patients.  It is a key area on which we will focus.  </p><p> We have initiated a review of the winter planning process in 2018 and 2019.  With the agreement of the Minister, the HSE is extending the review to include the commissioning of an independent expert group to carry out a review of emergency department performance and activity over the winter period on nine individual hospital sites and in their associated community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  The expert group will examine emergency department performance, but in so doing will have regard to capacity, bed utilisation, internal capability, including consultant manpower, medical, nursing and overall staffing levels.  It will report its findings and recommendations as part of the winter review report for 2018 and 2019.  It is expected that it will be completed within a three month period.  We believe it can result in some good evaluations and learnings, not just from the winter planning process but also overall as to what is best practice across the various hospitals and groups.</p><p> On the subject of mortuaries, the mortuary at University Hospital Waterford, UHW, is the south-east regional centre for autopsies.  I recognise that the current facilities are not compliant with contemporary requirements.  On my second day in this role in the HSE I visited the hospital and the mortuary and spoke to local management, staff, consultants and a pathologist.  Interim control measures are now in place and additional refrigeration capacity is also being made available.  In acknowledging the issues raised and concerns expressed by staff at University Hospital Waterford, a review of mortuary services is planned.  It will include a review of existing mortuary facilities.  The terms of reference for the review are being finalised and it is hoped the final report will be available in September.  Mortuary capital development is included in the HSE's plan and has been approved since March, with approval to go to tender in May.  The expectation is a new building will be in place within two years.</p><p> On HPV vaccination, provisional uptake of the girls' programme is at 70% in respect of the first dose in 2018-19, which represents an increase of 60% on the figure for the school year 2017-18.  Older girls are coming forward to receive the vaccine where they had previously refused.  This has to be welcomed by everybody.  The second dose is being delivered in the period March to May and final figures will be available later in the year.  Ongoing concerted efforts are required to be made by all healthcare professionals and opinion leaders to improve and maintain the level of confidence in the HPV and all other vaccines.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s first gender neutral HPV vaccination programme is due to be rolled out from September. and a communications plan is in development.  The vaccine to be used is HPV9 which offers protection against an additional five cancer causing strains of HPV compared to Gardasil4 which is currently being used. </p><p> A key message from the national patient experience survey from our reviews of adverse incidents and complaints concerns the critical importance of listening and responding to patients.  The national patient experience survey is under way for the third consecutive year.  During the month of May 28,000 patients who have had an inpatient stay in hospital will be invited to give feedback on their experiences.  Over 84% of respondents rated their experience of hospital care as either very good or excellent.  I look forward to engaging directly on the surveys with patients in the coming weeks.  Some 83% of respondents stated they had been treated with dignity and respect and that they had full confidence and trust in the staff providing care.  Some 96% of respondents rated their hospital room or ward as being very clean.  This year the survey programme will be extended to maternity services.  In February 2020, 11,000 women will be invited to give feedback on their experiences.  I personally intend to visit a number of hospitals in the coming weeks to promote the patient experience survey and thank staff for all of their valued hard work and commitment to the programme.</p></speech>

I wish Mr Reid the very best of luck in the not inconsiderable task he has been handed.  There is a huge amount of work to be done.</p> <p>  I will return to the question of access,  but I will start by making two specific points.  One concerns the availability of Spinraza, an issue we have all been following closely.  There are families who are watching intently and will have noted that the NHS recently approved Spinraza for use. The clock is ticking for their children and they asked us to put the following three questions directly to the Minister.  Is there a definitive date on which a decision on funding will be communicated?  Is the answer "yes" or "no"?  What is causing the delays in the decision-making process relative to what is happening in other EU countries?  Is there an explanation for them?  Is there a definitive timeline for how quickly access to the drug will be made available if the decision is positive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#D00400"><p>I genuinely recognise that it is a very stressful time for families, that they have been waiting more than patiently in very difficult circumstances and that they are worried about their children in the context of the availability of this drug.  It is also important to recognise that the HSE has the statutory power to make such decisions.  Neither I nor the Deputy has that power.  It is very clear that under the Health Pricing Act responsibility lies with the HSE.</p> <p>I am also conscious of the fact that it takes two sides to negotiate an agreement.  The HSE has been working to try to secure a good agreement, but I am very clear that we need to make the drug available.  The HSE is aware of my views on the matter.  While being very respectful of the processes that are being and have to be gone through, I am very clear that the drug needs to made available.  I ask the director general to comment on the specifics.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#D00500"><p>I will ask the chief clinical officer, Dr. Colm Henry, to comment, but in response to Deputy Donnelly's questions, like Minister, I completely understand the concerns of the families and children involved in raising this issue which is very real.  To put it in the context of drugs approval, 23 drugs have been approved by the HSE and the drugs committee that oversees the process within a budget of &euro;10 million.  Decisions are made based on a number of criteria, one of which is cost effectiveness.  On the availability of Spinraza specifically, the drugs committee has gone through a process and by a small minority considers it would not be cost-effective to make it available.</p><p>It used a range of criteria in making that recent decision.  I have asked for that decision to be brought back to my leadership management team and that will be done in early June.  As the Minister has said, there is an ongoing process involving negotiation and cost-effectiveness.  I have asked for the issue to be brought back to my management team in early June.  I am very conscious of the NHS decision and where Ireland now stands in that regard.  Everybody wants to make the right decision about this drug, including me, and that is the track I want to get us on.  I just need space and time to bring the process back to my leadership team and assess that decision.  We will make the decision.  That is exactly where we are. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#E00200"><p>That is fine.  The second issue I would like to touch on is the decision to move the Coombe Hospital to the St. James's Hospital site, which the Minister and I have discussed previously.  I believe everyone understood at the time that tri-location was the main argument in favour of moving to the St. James's site.  I will put aside the question as to whether the St. James's site was the right one, it came as a surprise to me to learn that planning and design had not started given that in 2015 the then Minster for Health, now the Taoiseach, gave a commitment that the development of the national children's hospital and transfer of the Coombe would be progressed in parallel.  The last time the Minister appeared, he informed the committee that no funding was available in this year's allocations to even start the Coombe project.  I asked him to give a commitment to see if he could allocate new funding to start the project.  What is the current position?  Has new funding been allocated to at least get the design and planning process under way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#E00300"><p>The Deputy has been pursuing this for some time so I will not go back over old ground other than to make two brief points.  Under the national development plan, we are planning to move all of our stand-alone maternity hospitals to the site of an acute adult hospital.  The Deputy will be aware of plans to move Limerick maternity hospital to University Hospital Limerick, Holles Street maternity hospital to St. Vincent's Hospital, the Rotunda Hospital to Connolly Hospital and the Coombe Hospital to St. James's Hospital.  That is Government policy and all of those moves are funded in the national development plan.  I am not suggesting the Deputy is doing this but some people, particularly those opposed to the national children's hospital, have suggested that somehow we are not planning to move the Coombe to the St. James's site.  We are planning to do so, as I know the Deputy is aware.  Tri-location is still the intention.  In terms of capital projects in maternity services, we will go ahead with Holles Street first.  We have secured planning permission and started the enabling works and the plan is to move Holles Street hospital to the site of St. Vincent's Hospital.</p> <p>  There is an issue with logistics.  We have obviously taken advice on this and even with all of the money in the world, it would still make sense to build the children's hospital first rather than do two major projects on one site.  I accept that the Deputy did not ask me to build two major projects on one site.  The logistics or sequencing is that one builds the children's hospital and then the maternity hospital, and I am satisfied that this approach makes sense.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether there is preparatory work we could do in the interim to avoid a major time lag between the completion of the national children's hospital project and the move to the St. James's site of the Coombe Hospital.  That is a logical point and he has won the argument in that regard.  When I met representatives of Children's Health Ireland recently I asked them to think about what sort of preparatory work could be done by Children's Health Ireland and the Coombe.  As the Deputy knows, the Department is finalising its capital plans with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I expect to be able to move ahead with some of the necessary preparatory work and I will inform him of progress once those talks have been fleshed out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.259" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#E00400"><p>Access is the big issue.  I acknowledge that some progress has been made on reducing inpatient waiting lists through the deployment of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  That figure is beginning to come down, thank goodness.  However, right across the system access is continually worsening.  For the first time ever, we have more than 550,000 people on the outpatient waiting list.  The number of people waiting for more than a year and a half is particularly striking.  The figure, which was 13,000 about three years, has climbed to more than 800,000 people.  That is an 800% increase in just three years in the number of men, women and children who are waiting to see a hospital consultant.  We all know that children around the country have been waiting up to three and half years just to get an initial special needs assessment and therapy in various areas.  I looked at the current waiting lists while preparing for this meeting.  As well as the longest outpatient hospital waiting list ever, they show massive geographic variance in waiting times.  There is a postcode lottery that differs in different parts of the system.  More than 40,000 people are waiting for an outpatients appointment in Galway University Hospital.  In Limerick University Hospital, the figure is nearly 35,000 people.  In University Hospital Waterford it is 40,000 and the figure for Tallaght hospital is more than 30,000.  In other areas such as waiting lists for physiotherapy, there has been a big spike in Waterford, for example, where nearly 2,500 people are awaiting an initial physiotherapy appointment.  In County Wicklow, more than 1,000 people are waiting for an initial assessment for occupational therapy.  A postcode lottery exists depending on whether one needs to see a doctor, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapy or another specialist.</p> <p>  I have a broad question for Mr. Reid and the Minister.  Given that there has been an unprecedented increase in healthcare funding, with nearly &euro;3.5 billion extra provided in the past few years, why are people waiting longer than ever to be diagnosed by doctors and receive treatment?  What is going on that these two things are occurring at the same time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#E00500"><p>I will start with the Deputy's final question.  The plan this year, for the first time in many years, is to have fewer patients waiting for an outpatient appointment by the end of the year than at the start of the year.  I accept that is not a radical advance but it will be the first year in a number of years that we will end the year with fewer patients waiting for an outpatient appointment than at the beginning of the year.</p> <p>  We have talked about there being more people than ever on waiting lists.  It is important to acknowledge that outpatient waiting lists were not kept and published until 2011 or 2012 so that is a new departure, which is good.  Every year, the health service sees about 3.3 million outpatients so this number of people will go to an outpatients clinic this year.  Only about 1 million of them will be first appointments, which means about 2.3 million will be repeat appointments.  One of the challenges for us is to reduce the number of return appointments to the hospital that are needed.  This means the patient will see the consultant, as necessary, but the ongoing management of the chronic condition will be done in the community.  One of the big wins in the GP contract is that, over the lifetime of the agreement, 400,000 patients will be treated in the community who would have been treated in the hospital previously.  The Deputy asked how we will fix this.  We will do this by significantly reducing the number of people who must repeatedly return to the consultant by trying to have more of them seen in the community.</p> <p>  This is the first year for many years that we are using the NTPF to provide support for outpatients.  We have asked, through the HSE, all hospital groups and hospitals how can we help them using a fund in the NTPF for outpatients.  Until now, we have only used the NTPF for inpatient day cases.</p> <p>  I make this point because we must grapple with it.  About 500,000 people missed their outpatient appointments last year.  People do not miss appointments unless they have a good reason or the lists are inaccurate.  We need to get under the bonnet and I have asked the HSE and NTPF to do some work on the matter through the central validation office.  If 500,000 people or thereabouts were offered an outpatient appointment last year but did not turn up, what does that tell us about the waiting lists?  We will do a number of things this year, primarily using the NTPF to provide extra support on outpatients for the first time in a number of years.</p> <p>  The strike definitely had an impact on the outpatient lists at the start of the year but it remains the plan that there will be fewer patients waiting at the end of the year than at the start of the year.  We need to look at what we are measuring in terms of waiting if 500,000 people did not turn up for appointments last year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#E00600"><p>I will make a few general comments before asking some of my colleagues to make some specific points.  In terms of what the Minister referenced, I have strongly heard from all across the organisation the requirement to conduct a deep assessment of the validation lists.  As the Minister has touched on, we have kicked off that process with support from the NTPF.  I am hearing it from consultants, staff, nurses, etc., that a wide assessment is needed and that process will help us.</p> <p>  Without doubt, and to state the obvious, the demographic pressures are all upwards in terms of requiring outpatient appointments and that has been well proven.  Deputy Donnelly is right that there are certain demographic issues in terms of geography and different spread and some of the impacts on us.</p> <p>  I should also mention the new models of care.</p><p>One of the big strategic intentions behind Sl&aacute;intecare is the move to an integrated model of care whereby we increase capacity in the community.  In my previous role I visited many primary centres and supported the building of them.  There is no doubt that they have capacity for the future when we can invest in some of the diagnostics for them and so on.  By continuously running with the same model, we will chip away at it but our real move has to be to transition to the new model of integrated care.  My role is to work with the team in Sl&aacute;intecare and with the Department in order to start moving us in that direction and, as the Minister stated, to leverage off the agreement with the GPs, and how that agreement can be deployed locally, and to leverage off the recently concluded nurses' agreement, and how we can move to the implementation of that for the deployment of nursing care into the community in a stronger way.</p><p> Reference was made to the budget, which is a very real issue.  I touched on it in my opening statement.  The national service plan budget for the start of 2018 was &euro;14.5 billion and the outturn was just over &euro;15.2 billion.  This year we have &euro;16 billion.  We have to assess how to deal with the upper pressures on the HSE, which are very real, with the demographic issues that press on the health service and with the move to the new model.  It is a very challenging environment of assessing every cent and euro we have and where we currently put that money.  It is my early assessment that if we continue to put it into the current system of congested acute care and outpatient care, we will make slow progress.  I really want us to transition to the new model on a collective basis.</p><p> While the assessment we have kicked off primarily focuses on and relates to the winter programme and emergency departments, it will tell us a lot about where there are better processes for management of the patient through group hospitals and CHOs.  I visited Waterford and Tullamore last week and I will be visiting other hospitals.  One can see variance in respect of how outpatient progress is managed.  I want to ensure that we have best practice and that we understand what is best practice.  I am hearing a major call from across the service to really look at that.  I am seeing some excellent practice, including in Waterford and Tullamore, regarding the management of the outpatient experience and the follow through.  We will have to focus on all of these matters.  I appreciate that it is a challenge.  I shall ask my colleague to provide some specifics.</p></speech>

From our March data, we are aware that more than 94% of people who were referred to speech and language therapy and physiotherapy were seen within 52 weeks.  One could argue that this is still a long time if one has a child waiting for a service, but it is more than 94% now, which is better than it used to be.  We are definitely challenged in the context of occupational therapy and we are working on this.  There are some important aspects to note.  There are 100 posts, as the Minister indicated, notifications of which are going out to the CHOs this week.  These posts are particularly for disability services and will help with some of those therapy waiting lists.</p> <p>  On shifting the model of care, we also have a therapy in schools project in CHO 7 in the Kildare area.  We are aware that early prevention is key, especially with children, and the initiative has some 30 therapists working across all the schools.  The idea is to pick up children much earlier in order that they do not require the service further down the road.  This pilot project has proven to be very positive and successful.  We are looking at models and building on this integration across our community services.  Within the community we are not always that integrated, never mind between community and hospital, so our first step is to have the community services integrated.  We will have nine learning sites for community health networks this year and that will allow us to apply a population view in how we deliver services.  There is a lot of duplication with people sitting on different lists; the same child could be sitting on a number of lists.  If we tackle it from the population perspective within the network, this will allow us to co-ordinate the delivery of care in a much more streamlined and effective way.  We have a number of things going on but I take the point that was made.  We are absolutely trying to improve access to community services.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we lost approximately 13,000 outpatient appointments on each of the three strike days.  We must work this back.  That is the most recent significant negative shift associated with that.  When we consider the specialties, the GPs and the specialist consultants in the ENT unit in Letterkenny, for example, have agreed a protocol of care, as Mr. Reid stated.  They have undertaken an exercise to clear backlogs in waiting lists in order to guarantee priority access for urgent cases and to support that with diagnostics in the hospital.  This is part of what is needed.  This pilot worked and I believe the GP contract will enable that to work further.  The orthopaedic programme has identified that musculoskeletal physiotherapists can remove 85% of the people from the waiting lists now.  We are investing in that because it is a critical resource and a community investment.  Those physiotherapists really need to be out in a community space.  We are aware that there are some 4,000 hip fractures per year and a lot of work has happened to see how falls can be avoided.  The outcome of a hip fracture is very difficult for individuals and we are looking at strategies around falls prevention, which will avoid the original need.  This is very important.</p> <p>  A final example is ophthalmology.  We are now looking at working with clinical leads and some of the hospitals, including the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, to provide ophthalmology services at primary care centres.  The crossover is important in order to begin to look at this as a whole system challenge and not an outpatient list sitting there in isolation.  We are going to have to address it specialty by specialty.  It is also a reality that the referral rate is higher than the treatment rate.  There is no question that we must change this.</p></speech>

As someone who does not have private health insurance, I genuinely wish Mr. Reid the very best because I am relying on him - as are many people - to do a very good job.  I am sure he will.</p> <p>  The nurses were on strike for three days but the HSE has no excuse for the other 362 days.  Every person who has spoken - bar one - mentioned the three days of strike as if this somehow explains the massive and ongoing waiting lists.  I do not believe that is very fair.</p> <p>  I have some questions on the recent settlement reached with nurses and the ongoing issue around the recruitment of consultants.  Has the HSE set itself any targets for this recruitment?  The nurses' strike took place in the context of what is known as the recruitment and retention crisis.  I am aware that the word "crisis" loses a bit of meaning because everything is a crisis at the moment.  Presumably, the settlement of that strike should result in additional staff being recruited.  Has a budget been put aside for the additional staff?  Has the HSE set any targets in respect, for example, of how many nurses it wants to attract home from abroad?  Survey after survey shows that nurses leave Ireland after they graduate because they believe the health service in Ireland is not an attractive place for them to work.  The purpose of the settlement - as I understand it - is to see more nurses in the service but we will not be able to quantify this unless targets have been set.</p> <p>  Mr. Woods and I have spoken several times about the setting of targets for the conversion of agency staff into directly employed staff.  We are all going to agree - because we do agree - that the use of agency staff does not represent good value for money.  Years ago, agencies were used a temporary stopgap but now entire shifts rely on agency staff.  It is expensive and I believe that it is a form of outsourcing by stealth.  Has the HSE set any targets for this in the context of recruitment?  I had asked this question previously of the Minister and he indicated that he would get an answer for me.  While the answer is not overdue, I just wanted to know if the Minister has a response regarding the urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  It was promised to be open from 8 a.m. to midnight seven days per week.  I do not believe the staff will be in place to do this.  Will we be fobbed off with a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. service, a press announcement and a ribbon-cutting ceremony? I do not think is very fair.  Is the Minister in a position to confirm that the staff have been recruited?  If letters and start dates are not already in the pipeline or on their way then the service will not be able to operate as was promised from 8 a.m. to midnight seven days per week.  It would only be able to operate on a short-term basis.  If the staff are not in the pipeline, they will not be there for the scheduled opening date at the end of June.</p><p>Can the Minister confirm that?</p></speech>

The opening of Connolly Hospital this summer, at the end of July, will result in an additional 6,000 children being seen through outpatient clinics there.  Additional children will benefit from the opening of this facility this year.  It is a facility which when it opens for a full year will cater for 33,000 additional appointments.  It is not overdue and I appreciate the Deputy saying that.  The answer remains as it was last week in that I am waiting to hear back from Children's Health Ireland on its decision about opening hours.  From memory of the question last week, all the nursing posts have been identified and significant recruitment has been made in the area of consultants.</p> <p>  Importantly, it is not just me, the Government or the HSE which is saying that the nurse's deal will help with recruitment or retention; the INMO is also saying that.  This was stated clearly at its annual conference in Trim two weeks ago, which I attended along with the director general.  The union genuinely believes that this deal will help us retain our nurses, which is the metric by which we can measure the success of the deal, if we are honest.  For the third year in a row we will offer every nurse graduate a full-time job in the health service, which is the easy bit; the challenge is retaining them.  As the INMO acknowledges, we are training more nurses than ever and we are training enough of them, but we are not retaining them.  Where we offer every nurse graduating a full-time job we must ask how many are still in the health service after several months or years.  That is how we will judge the deal's success or otherwise.  Now that the deal has been just accepted by the INMO we will move to the implementation phase.  We will have to establish structures and these will have union representation.  It is important to acknowledge that the deal includes nurses working in new and different ways.  It talks about flexible working, changes to contracts and new contracts etc. ----- </p></speech>

There are approximately ten consultants and the Deputy had asked if they were all additional.  We checked this.  One appointee was an emergency department consultant in Tallaght who will become a paediatric consultant in Connolly Hospital but all the other posts are entirely new.  A locum is in place to backfill the consultant from Tallaght.  The staff going in are new additional staff.</p></speech>

I have met its general secretary several times.  We share a view and interest that the agreement be maximised and implemented to its fullest.  Details of that will be discussed further by the Department and the unions involved.  </p> <p>  To give some context on staff recruitment, in the first quarter of 2019, the total staffing numbers for the HSE increased by approximately 1,100 of which 550 are graduate nurses, so that is not included in the whole-time equivalent count.  If one removes the graduate nurse recruitment, the figure is approximately 600.</p></speech>

The highest proportion of that 600 is in the nursing sector.  There has been significant recruitment throughout the year.  The national service plan provides for approximately 2,000 overall in its budget for total staffing so there is a facility for further recruitment.</p> <p>  On the plan for the rest of the year, the Department has set out some of the challenges to coming in within budget but there is no recruitment embargo.  All the individual areas and the current process will have to be approved in budget.  That is continuing to happen.  Recruitment, particularly in nursing, will continue for the rest of the year.  It has been the highest proportion in the first quarter but approvals will have to be within budget.</p></speech>

It might have been quicker to say, &quot;No&quot;.</p><p>As an aside, Ms Rothwell is welcome but her presence was not flagged to committee members in advance and was not referenced in any of the opening statements.  I have some questions for her but we were not prepared or alerted to the fact she would be here and I assumed that there would not be a representative of University Hospital Waterford when I checked the opening statements prior to the meeting.  If Deputies from Waterford had advance notice, they would have rearranged their schedules to be here.  While we will have a separate session, I wanted to point that out.  I do not mean any disrespect, but to say that, I had assumed there would be no representative here, although we had flagged that there might be discussion on University Hospital Waterford.</p><p>The issue of consultants who are not on the register is serious and we have discussed it previously.  I had a detailed discussion on this with Ms Rosarii Mannion<b></b>the last time we had a session.  I am still at a loss to know whether anything has been done to prevent this from happening.  We are all aware of the rights and entitlements of a person to a contract of indefinite duration.  An increasing number of consultants are engaged in specialist activity who are not on the specialist register and they are being paid as though they are on the register while fulfilling those roles.  Every day that goes by they come closer to a legal and lawful entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration.  Those conversions are just being repeatedly rolled over.  I asked Ms Mannion about this on the previous occasion.  I pressed her on it and I will ask again.  I ask whoever responds not to go on a tour of the houses; if the answer is &quot;No&quot;, that is fine.  Is there any plan to deal with this issue?  It has been raised in the courts and the officials do not need me to tell them it is a serious issue.  Is a plan in place in advance of what has been done, because we can all agree that whatever was done in the past clearly has not worked because more consultants continue to be added to it?  We all know how contracts of indefinite duration work.  There are people who are currently on the road towards a contract of indefinite duration and the HSE will not be in a position to do them out of their rights, nor should it, but is there any plan to put qualified consultants in these posts?</p></speech>

There is now a plan.  A group has been established that I am chairing which is focused specifically on medical recruitment, supervision and patient safety.  There are several work streams within that.  The first relates to the issue raised by the Deputy where doctors who are not in the specialist division are employed as consultants.  We will also examine non-training scheme doctors, the recruitment processes relating to non-consultant doctors and consultants, retention, and configuration of services.  Taking the Deputy's point, we know that we are very challenged on this.  We have had a team working under Professor Frank Murray, which has gone around the country to assure itself of governance and to ensure adequate supervision is in place today and that there are no risks in this regard.  Much work has gone on but we know that strategically we need a far more robust plan which looks at how we address this now and in the future.</p></speech>

We have been out to each area to check them.  Consultants do not work under supervision <i>per se</i>but there is a governance framework within which they must work.  We have been around and checked with executive clinical directors as to how that framework works in each area.  The team is satisfied there is a process in place now in every area when there had not been.  The process we have started is about developing a much more robust approach to how we bring in consultants in the first place.  We know about the concerns and there was reference to courts etc. and we share such concerns.</p></speech>

There are over 3,300 consultants in Ireland and off the post-2008 non-specialist register, there are approximately 106, with a third of those in mental health.  It is important that patients or people relying on services understand that consultants do not work in isolation but rather as part of a team.  They all report to a clinical director, whether or not they are on the specialist register.  The difference with the specialist register is that it is a badge of quality following the enactment of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007.  It allows us to know that somebody has been trained according to our training schemes and in line with other European Union training schemes.</p> <p>  Based on those site visits that Ms O'Connor referenced, no safety concerns were raised about the practice of these consultants.  It is clearly our preference to move towards a position, as outlined in many reports, where we have no junior doctors who are not in training schemes and no consultants who are not on the specialist register.  There are considerable challenges for us, not least the fact that these people were delivering unscheduled care in 26 sites around the country.  In an environment right across Europe where recruitment is quite difficult, it is becoming increasingly challenging for us to provide unscheduled care on so many sites.  There is a context in recruitment that requires understanding, and it is not just being felt here but in other European countries as well.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated there are 127 primary care centres that are fully operational.  I have one in my area that I have referenced many times.  Mr. Reid would be familiar with the one in Balbriggan.  No additional staff were provided for that, despite the growing population, and no diagnostic equipment was provided either.  I asked about this via parliamentary question recently and the answer I received was that there are no plans in place currently to provide additional diagnostic equipment.  This is a local issue but it is extremely important if one has to travel to town all the way from Balbriggan for every little scan.</p> <p>  When will we see the capital plan published and will it contain references to the primary care centres and additional diagnostics for the primary care centres?  The reply I got from the Minister's office indicates there were no plans to put in place any additional scanners or diagnostic equipment into Balbriggan.  While that was a response to a question on a local matter, is that response being replicated everywhere else or is there a plan in place to have diagnostics in primary care centres?  Will additional staff be recruited?  I have asked parliamentary questions on all the primary care centres and the answer is the same.  I am sure much care and thought goes into it but it is really just the exact same words in every reply.  The indication is that services will be provided from within existing resources, which is code for there not being new or additional staff.  Is there a staffing plan for the primary care centres?</p> <p>  I am conscious of the time so I will be brief.  I absolutely welcome the Damascene conversion to public provision of healthcare rather than private provision.  It does not really gel with the National Treatment Purchase Fund but, that aside, how is this squared with the building of a private clinic within the proposed national children's hospital if the plan is for private provision of healthcare to be phased out?  We are really stacking in private healthcare and paying for the infrastructure in order that private healthcare can be delivered from within our public services.  Now that the Minister has seen the light, that piece of infrastructure might be put to put to better use for the public service.</p></speech>

I very clearly nailed my colours to the mast long before any de Buitl&eacute;ir report that I do not believe such a position was appropriate.  Deputy O'Reilly would never do it but she could never cast any doubt over my position or the position of the Government on this matter.  I want to see public practice in public hospitals.  Quite frankly, what consultants do outside those hours in private hospitals is a different discussion but I want to see public beds used in public hospitals for public patients.  That is how capacity can be increased and while it might make both me and the Deputy somewhat uncomfortable, it is something on which we genuinely agree.  It is in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  It indicated this should be mapped and we should work out how to do it rather than just jumping right in.  That is what I have done with the de Buitl&eacute;ir report.</p> <p>  If the contracts and practice change, the use of any facilities will change as a result and it will be no different for the national children's hospital either.  Mr. Reid can comment on the staffing issue with respect to primary care.  It is important and we are increasing staff right across the health service.  We are continuing to increase staff in primary care and we have just referenced 100 more therapy posts as well.  They will work in primary care and some will work in primary care centres.  We are increasing those numbers and I will ask the HSE to come back with specifics.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked an important question about diagnostics.  If we can put more diagnostic equipment into primary care centres, we would decrease the number of people going to hospital and would be providing more services locally and at greater convenience to the patient, which makes sense.  I am not talking about any specific primary care centre but we know there cannot be diagnostics in every primary care centre.  There are different types of primary care centres, with some being larger or built for diagnostics while others are not.  While some serve large enough catchment areas, there are clinical issues with respect to safety and the number of patients that are seen.  Oversight must also be taken into account.  I visited Castlebar primary care centre, which has an excellent radiology facility but the clinical governance is done by Mayo General Hospital.  There is an exercise going on as part of Sl&aacute;intecare to map where we should have our diagnostics within the community.  There is no doubt that will require funding.  The Deputy asked about the capital plan and it will show how we intend to advance that.  I expect the capital plan to be published by the end of June.</p></speech>

I am basically saying that regardless of the hospital, the rules will be the same.  If the rule is that there should be no private practice in public hospitals, there will be no private practice in any public hospital, whether it is the children's hospital or elsewhere.  In fairness to people developing hospitals, that is not the position now and our consultants are not operating under those contracts, so private practice is taking place in public hospitals.  I am saying that if the practice changes - I cannot pre-empt Government decisions on the de Buitl&eacute;ir report and all that stuff - the use of those facilities will change as well.</p></speech>

The Minister touched on the plan for further and current deployment.  I relayed earlier some of the recruitment that has happened, and some of this is within primary centres.  The 100 therapy posts have just been approved and they will be deployed to communities, specifically in primary care centres to enhance them.</p><p>The intention has never been that diagnostics would be in every primary care centre.  It will depend largely on proximity to acute hospitals and it is intended for some.  Primary care forms an element of our capital plan in terms of employment and the current service plan.  Over &euro;15 million is committed to service redesign, to which I referred earlier, to move it further into the community.  We touched within that on community health networks, which are about people working at local level, specifically in primary care centres.  That will form part of that &euro;15 million investment in the service plan.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with him.  A great deal of focus this morning has been on healthcare in Dublin.  I want to get the message across that healthcare is provided in other parts of the country too.  In particular, I want to focus on Cork.  I submitted a question to the health committee last November on the elective hospital for Cork.  I was advised that no progress had been made on that matter in real terms.  However, I received a document dated September 2018, which sets out that the HSE proposed the establishment of a project team.  That project team has now met and consists mainly of people from the HSE.  There are 12 people on the board, nine of whom are from the HSE, one is from the South Infirmary hospital and one of whom is from the Mercy Hospital.  However, the South Infirmary is the main elective hospital in Cork, which suggests the board is not properly constituted.  I want some explanation as to why the joint committee was not given the full information in November when the question was put in and as to what the proposal is now on prioritising the building of an elective hospital in Cork.  There has been a huge growth in the population of Cork and the southern region generally.  While we are building three new hospitals in Dublin, we need to focus attention on the regions also.  I seek clarification on how it is purposed to move forward with the project team for this hospital, on the timeline for identifying a site and on the planning process.  That is my first question.  I want to ensure the focus is not totally on healthcare in Dublin.  There are also places outside Dublin which provide healthcare.</p> <p>  My understanding is that there are more than 500 vacant consultant posts currently.  People go on about waiting lists, but one will have waiting lists if one does not have someone available at the head of a team to conduct clinics and so on.  Across Europe, one third of all medical practitioners are over 60 years of age.  That is the figure for every country across Europe.  As such, we are now competing for consultants in a world market.  I understand that some consultant posts are being advertised in respect of which no applications are being received.  How do we propose to review that issue to make it attractive for people to come back to Ireland or stay if they are already here?  We are competing with New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the UK and the USA.  What are we going to do over the next 12 months to make it more attractive for people to apply for posts being offered in Ireland?</p> <p>  We talk about waiting lists and hospital clinics.  Over 12 months ago, I raised the issue of haemochromatosis and a very straightforward procedure for blood to be taken monthly to address high iron levels.  I have worked with GPs in Cork who wanted to provide this service to avoid people having to attend hospital.  I cannot understand how such little progress has been made on this issue.  There are a number of other areas where GPs are prepared to provide services and, as a result, to keep people from having to attend outpatient clinics in hospitals.  Has the HSE or the Department identified services which are currently being provided to large numbers of people in hospitals that could be provided in the community?  In relation to haemochromatosis, the GPs involved had long discussions with UCC, the medical practitioners in Cork and the blood bank on co-ordinating a service.  I ask the Minister and Mr. Reid to deal with those three issues.</p></speech>

While they might be located in Dublin, they are national services.  For example, 3,081 sick children from Cork attended our children's hospitals in Dublin over the past two years.  As such, while the national children's hospital and other major national projects are located in the capital city, as opposed to the real capital, other areas are benefitting from the investment in services.</p></speech>

Every child will have a single <i>en suite</i>room and proper facilities.  However, Senator Burke's point about the elective hospital in Cork is important.  We have the funding in place to deliver three new elective hospitals in Cork, Dublin and Galway, respectively.  This will transform the delivery of scheduled healthcare in Ireland.  I visited the elective hospital in Glasgow last year.  Scotland had a similar outlook in its health service to Ireland.  It is similar in population and there are similar demographic issues.  However, it is not that long ago that Scotland had waiting lists of approximately two years for some procedures whereas it is now fulfilling the Sl&aacute;intecare target of seeing people within 12 weeks.  The hospitals in Dublin, Galway and Cork are three key pieces of infrastructure that will help us to realise our dream and to implement and deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare.</p><p>We have heard very clearly from Oireachtas Members, including Senator Colm Burke, the South/South West hospital group, clinicians and many others in Cork of the importance of moving on with preparations for the elective hospital.  The message is not to waste time or to wait until the profiling arrives for all of the capital for the hospital.  We are being asked to do the preparatory work now.  There are two distinct streams of work that need to be done here.  First, the question arises as to what we are going to put in our elective hospitals because that varies from country to country.  It might even vary from one part of the country to another.  The question of what an elective hospital will provide is very important when working out where it needs to be located and what staff it needs.  The second issue is site selection.  While those streams of work are distinct, they complement each other.  After considering this and having heard the feedback of Senator Colm Burke and others, including concerns about groups not being fully represented or boards being properly structured, the Secretary General of the Department of Health wrote to the chair of the South/South West hospital group in recent weeks.  The letter noted that we want the group to do these two streams of work and to come back to us with the membership of the group's committees.  The group has sent in some draft membership documents and has been asked to come back with the final membership lists and to have those two work strands completed by the end of this year.  That is the timeline to which we are working.  We have not done this for the other elective hospitals.  As such, we are recognising that there is an energy in Cork around this and a determination to get moving.  The hospital group wants to get moving on it.  I expect to have those two streams of work completed by the end of the year and back in the Department, which will leave us well placed to advance the elective hospital.</p><p>I have two comments on the issue of consultants.  I accept that we have a recruitment challenge in relation to consultants.  It would be foolish to say anything else.  However, I do not accept the narrative that is sometimes put out there that the numbers are declining because that does not stack up.  The figures show that we are continuing to see extra consultants working in the Irish health service.  There have been significant increases in the number of people taking up consultant posts in the Irish health service albeit I accept there are still vacancies.  I repeat what I said at the IMO conference in Killarney.  We had a number of major HR and IR issues to work through in the health service.  With the GPs, the job is done and a new agreement has been made.  With the nurses' dispute, the job is done in terms of them accepting the agreement, which is being implemented.  Logically, the next group with which we need to sit down is consultants.  I made a commitment at the IMO conference that the Government would follow the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission and put in place a process.  As Senator Colm Burke was right to say, we live in a globally competitive world and we need to attract consultants to our country.  We need to get some of our Irish consultants to return while keeping others here.</p><p>I will be working with Government colleagues to work out what that process will look like.  We need a process and to engage with consultants in the same way as we must engage with GPs and nurses.</p><p> On the point made about haemochromatosis, I am pleased that under the new GP agreement, GMS patients with the condition will no longer have to attend hospital for therapeutic phlebotomy.  Instead, the service will be provided locally by a GP.  This will obviously be more convenient for the patient.  It will benefit about 7,000 to 8,000 patients who normally require three therapeutic phlebotomy sessions per annum.  It is taking approximately 7,000 to 8,000 patients out of hospitals and transferring them to the primary care service.  The Senator is correct that GPs wanted to do this.  They, rightly, only wanted to do it when resourced to do so.  That is fair.  We now have resourced them under the new agreement.  It will see a transfer, a real shift of approximately 7,000 to 8,000 patients out of the hospital setting into the community setting.  I do not know whether Dr. Henry wishes to add anything to what I have said.</p></speech>

The Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Henry, will then say a few words.  </p> <p>  I reassure members that I am very conscious of the service provided by all our staff throughout the country.  In my first week I spent time in Tullamore and Waterford and plan to be in Mullingar next week and also Sligo.  I am fully conscious of the work that is taking place across the service.</p> <p>  Specifically on consultants, reference was made to some of the vacancies.  I will give some up-to-date information.  Overall, there are 3,388 consultant posts, of which 3,029 are occupied by permanent and non-permanent staff.  We had a discussion on contract holders.  There are 359 posts unoccupied across the country.  The consultant posts unoccupied are across a range of specialties and hospital groups.  Psychiatry is the specialty with the most posts unoccupied.  As the Minister said, we are working on the challenge.  Let me give a figure for last year.  We are up by 119 consultants by comparison with the figure in March last year, which represents an increase of 4%.  The process is ongoing.  We are up by a further 16 since the start of the year.  It is a process we are working through, challenging though it is.  </p> <p>  I ask Dr. Henry to comment on the haemochromatosis issue.</p></speech>

Their main concern was access.  It is an interesting example of the shift we need to make in healthcare.  There are patients who are travelling from counties Kerry and Donegal to avail of a phlebotomy service in Dublin.  It service could be provided in a GP's surgery, but it also could be provided in a blood transfusion service van at the side of a road.  As anybody knows, giving blood is not a difficult procedure.  It is very welcome for the model of care and the patients involved that we now see, under the GP contract, that this is a line of work that they will be expected to do in engaging in chronic care services.  It is an example of what we have to do in dealing with other chronic diseases.  We need to take out of hospital work that does not need to be done in it, clogging access and increasing waiting lists.  We need to bring it into the primary care service and the community, working not only with GPs but also, as in this case, with the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.</p></speech>

On the growth in staff numbers in the HSE, there was 17% growth in the numbers involved in administration.  There was 3.7% growth in the number of public health nurses.  If one wants to take patients out of hospitals, one has to grow the number providing public healthcare services.  That is the very area where the number of staff has not grown in the past four years.</p> <p>  I have a question which I believed had been received by the clerk to the committee.  I wanted to receive up-to-date figures for all staff numbers in the HSE on 30 April.  I will submit the question and will be looking for an answer to it.  There was much talk about the embargo and the recruitment of staff, but very little information was given on the real growth in numbers in the past four years.  I am concerned about disproportionate growth in some areas and, in particular, how the number of public health nurse numbers has not increased.  Why has this not occurred if we want to keep patients out of hospitals?</p></speech>

There were some very active individuals involved in the conference from north Lee in Cork.  Their most consistent request was for more administrative support because they believed so much of their time was devoted to administrative tasks, thereby preventing them from doing other work.  There is a balance to be struck.  Some clinicians in the community argue that they spend a lot of their time performing administrative duties.  They would prefer to be using their high-end clinical skills.  It was an interesting debate at the conference and we are going to look into the matter in more detail.</p></speech>

There was an increase in the number of administrative and managerial staff of 2,600.  In the same period approximately 50 additional public health nurses were recruited, which is disproportionate.</p></speech>

We actually found that it was very beneficial in the community, as the Senator is suggesting, and in a primary care setting outside hospital.  It is using hospital resources and we will be seeing more of it.</p> <p>  We have just started pilot work on blue light or National Ambulance Service calls where falls are involved.  On appropriate triage, we are sending occupational therapists and potentially physiotherapists to people&rsquo;s home from hospital, with a view to determining whether we can address issues there.  The data are very new.  It has happened on 40 occasions and 28 patients did not need to go to hospital.  That kind of work, to which the Senator is pointing, is exactly where we need to go and we need to do more of it.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Paul Reid all the best in his new role.  If I was to suggest to my daughter that I take a certain initiative, she might reply, "Best of luck with that".  I wish Mr. Reid the best of luck way more empathetically.  He has a difficult chalice in his hands.</p> <p>  I was struck by Mr. Woods' response on dieticians, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  Since the HSE was set up 15 years ago, we have been hearing about transformation and reform.  We had beautiful documents depicting butterflies flying around.  There were also enhanced transformation programmes.  As we have had all these, I cannot figure out why we keep talking about this issue.  I am not trying to blame anyone, but there is something really wrong if, 15 years on, we are  only training 25 dieticians per year in one college, quite a number of whom enter private industry.  That is just one example which I did not have in my head before Senator Colm Burke mentioned it.  There are major issues and we keep talking about reform and change.  The Minister has stated there is no place to hide for people who are not getting on the reform and change bus, but they have been somewhere for the past 15 years.  Is there something with which we are not getting to grips in introducing some simple reforms?</p> <p>  I listened to the statements made by the Minister and the director general of the HSE, Mr. Reid, and was struck by what was absent in both.</p><p>They both went through the industrial relations processes, reforms, Sl&aacute;intecare and so on but there was no mention of disability.  It was almost 10 a.m. before disability was mentioned in this room and it was brought up by Ms Anne O'Connor.  We have a cohort of people who are return users of services.  They need clinical services for chronic conditions.  Three chronic conditions were mentioned but there are more chronic conditions than I would name in a week.  Some of them, thankfully, do not have many people suffering with them but an enormous amount of work is needed in this area.  </p><p> A very important statement was released yesterday on behalf of the Rehab Group, which provided relief for more than 3,000 people.  They have been given an assurance that the services they receive from Rehab will continue.  It is interesting that there was no mention of that this morning.  There was no mention of the work that has been going on with regard to the section 39 organisations.  We ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in April 2018.  We have been told repeatedly that almost &euro;2 billion is going into the disability services programme every year and yet it does not merit a particular reference in all of the documentation before us.  </p><p> It has been suggested that the word "crisis" is overused because there seems to be one all of the time.  It is only when one puts the term "crisis" alongside going into the public space and protesting that something actually happens.  Rehab has been talking about its funding shortfall for a long time and other disability organisations and community groups have been talking about underfunding and deficits but it was only when one group decided to go public that &euro;2 million was somehow found.  I am not making that point to have a go at anybody.  I submitted two questions late last week and I am sure I will receive a response in due course.  They related to the issue of the quantum of need and the amount of unmet or only partly met need in the context of disability services and connecting that up with very useful things that were mentioned by the Minister at the start of this meeting.  He spoke about amelioration, prevention, population health and so forth.  These are critical issues for people with disabilities and their families but we do not seem to be able to turn the corner.  I go up and down the M7 regularly and have watched as the motorway is significantly upgraded while the road is still in use and the service is maintained but that seems to be impossible to do when it comes to health.</p><p> The letter that Mr. Reid sent us was written on his first day of service in the HSE which in itself, is a very significant event.  I wish to speak about the mindset of a person with a disability reading that letter.  The letter refers to living within budget, which is not a bad thing to do.  Mr. Reid also refers to the need to ensure the quality and safety of the services being provided to people.  Under the feudal system, one built a big stronghold which was the castle.  If one was inside the gates, one had protection but if one did not get to the gates in time, one could be knocking on those gates for a long time.  We do not have the honesty or the information to show how much unmet need exists or we are not making those data available.  </p><p> The cynical view would be that Mr. Reid is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's man in health.  We keep hearing from that Department and others that approximately one third of the public purse is spent on health.  The implication of that statement is that there is plenty of money in health.  I will make no judgment on that but if there is plenty of money, why are so many people not getting services?  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I, as well as others, were engaged just over a year ago on the issue of personal assistants.  The departmental officials and the Minister accept that personal assistants support a person's independence.  That requires more than half an hour in the morning to get a man to the toilet, shaved and so on and another half an hour at night to get him back into bed.  A personal assistant can enable a person to get out of the house but the average service provision is less than two hours per day.  Out of a total of around 2,500 people, only 65 get 40 hours per week.  It is a lie to say that is a personal assistant service.  It is a bum steer.</p><p> A range of organisations are now in very severe territory with regard to governance and funding.  Rehab came out publicly about this.  I ask Mr. Reid and the Minister to respond to the statement I am about to make.  It is my view, based on what we know about unmet need in the sector, that we will not get to the end of this year without the system cracking open.  What happened with Rehab has opened up that possibility.  Other organisations will now be saying that they should have done the same thing because they have deficits and unmet need.  They will be lining up, one after another, looking for a meeting.  How will that be dealt with?  </p><p> Some work is being done on the pressures in the section 38 organisations with regard to staff churn and so forth.  We also have the very specific issue of the underfunding of the disability services programme to the tune of &euro;16 million.  That programme was based on what was delivered last year but there were some deficits in that.  While I would love to be wrong, I cannot see how we can get to the end of this year without some very serious cracks appearing in the disability services programme.  </p></speech>

I will respond to some of the issues raised and I am sure my colleagues from the HSE, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will also respond.  The Senator makes a very interesting point about reform and transformation.  He points out that the HSE was set up 15 years ago and asks why we have not got there yet.  While Senator Dolan has not done so, it is very easy for Members of these Houses to blame the HSE.  Indeed, it might even be a popular thing to do from time to time but-----</p></speech>

He asked why reform and transformation have not happened after 15 years.  Having been three years in my current job, I want to give the Senator my perspective on that question.  It has not happened because of a failure of collective political leadership and a failure to both make and stick with decisions on health.  In fairness to people in this room, including the Chairman of this committee and others, the first time we did that was with Sl&aacute;intecare.  We can have the debate about whether setting up the HSE was a good or a bad idea or whether it should have been done differently but if we park that, over the past 15 years political parties, including my own, were talking about abolishing the HSE, about the Dutch model of healthcare, about going back to the old health board system and so on.  There has not been a certainty of policy direction in relation to health care for a generation, up until now.</p><p>People ridicule new politics and minority Governments and sometimes I share the frustration with new politics but one of the good things that has come out of the lifetime of this Oireachtas is the fact that on a cross-party basis, we have an agreed policy direction for health.  This means that when I am no longer Minister for Health and Fine Gael is back in government after the election with a new Minister or whatever else might happen with an election, we will still have a clear plan with which all the parties agree with the exception of People Before Profit and Solidarity.  Everybody in this room agrees with the direction, which means that the people sitting to my right, all the people they represent and all the people who work to them now have a clear policy direction.  I believe that for the first time in a generation, we have a chance to crack this.  What we are not going to do is what we have done far too many times, namely, start a bit of reform, change a Minister, have another bit of a different reform plan and go off in that direction.  We have a clear reform plan to which we have all signed up.  We have all said that regardless of politics, the name of the Minister or who is in government, this is what we are doing, which is a massive opportunity and prize for the health service and, most importantly, for the people of our country.  </p><p> Regarding what is and is not in my opening statement, as members can imagine, when one is Minister for Health, one can only touch on so many issues in an opening statement or I would still be delivering it.  Disability was mentioned on page four of my opening statement with regard to the extra 100 therapy posts to help deliver access to services for people with disabilities but I take the broader point made by Senator Dolan.  He asked a very important question, namely, how disabled people or any of us read a letter issued by the director general or me or a comment made by any of us regarding fiscal prudence and living within budgets.  What I would say to those people is that I hope and believe they should read the letter this way because that is the way it is intended.  The opportunity cost to service users - to citizens - of a budget overrun is significant.  Again, I am not apportioning blame but imagine if we had a situation where we did not have to find &euro;600 million for an overrun.  Imagine what, as a country or as a health service, we could have done with that money.  What the director general is correctly doing is saying to everybody, and I know he said it in his opening statement, that if we can make a real push here and a real collective effort to deliver services but remain within budget, it means that the extra investment we will inevitably receive in budget 2020 can actually deliver more services and begin to address some of that unmet need referenced by the Senator.  </p><p> Senator Dolan referenced Rehab, the broader sector and the implications for that.  The first thing I want to say is that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, co-chaired three meetings on this.  This was a very intensive process that is ongoing.  There is still intensive ongoing engagement.  We continue to engage with sectors.  We do not just have a conversation.  Our priority was service users and making sure services continued to be delivered.  It is not a case of "come on over and receive additional funding".  That is not the case.  The case is that if there was an acute pressure that would have damaged services or detrimentally affected service users, we wanted to work constructively together to try to address that.  The broader issue of the section 38 or section 39 bodies will require a forum, process or engagement.  The report by Dr. Catherine Day has been quite instructive and helpful in that regard.  That is a matter for the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who will comment on that.  There needs to be a conversation about the voluntary sector and the public health service, how they interact, mutual respect, clear understanding of roles and a clear understanding of funding.  I might ask the director general to comment.  </p></speech>

We have some detail on the responses and I am happy to pick them up with him.  Regarding finances and the memorandum referenced by the Senator in terms of my own communications, as I said in my opening statements, it was not my only message on day one but I appreciate that it will get wider attention.  There were three messages.  The first one very strongly focused on patient safety and care, in particular valuing the work across the health service and the people who work in it, what they do and their commitment to that, but it also focused on strengthening controls and governance issues that have been highlighted and that we must address.  The second issue, on which the Senator touched, concerned the reform agenda to which I wish to return.  The third one was a wider message around building trust and confidence, one aspect of which will be moving to managing within budget.  That will build trust and confidence not just on the part of our funders - the public, the Oireachtas and the Government - but on the part of our patients and in terms of our capacity to invest in the future.</p> <p>  Regarding the comment about the perception that someone from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is in the seat, I have worked full time since I was 16 for 39 years.  I spent less than three years in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I have had a very successful career in the private sector, the not-for-profit sector, central government and local government so my career has spanned a wide range of sectors.  I am a committed and passionate public servant.  That is why I want to be in this role.  As I said in my opening statement, one can make no greater impact in the public service than in the sector that is committed to people's lives and safety.  That summarises who I am and I hope it provides a more rounded context.  The Minister touched on my next point.  I know I have two very clear mandates, one of which concerns what the Minister touched on, namely, an agreed Sl&aacute;intecare strategy.  The appetite for that within the service is very strong.  A lot of organisations talk about reform and restructuring a lot and one can get weary saying the same thing but since the announcement of my appointment six weeks ago and since I took it up, I have spent a lot of time talking to people in the service.  There is passion and appetite to move to a new model of service.  The fact that we have a model approved by the Oireachtas into which staff buy is a great factor.  Staff need support and help in terms of change management and how we get to implement that but I sense a strong desire for people to move to a new model.  </p> <p>  There are two mandates.  One relates to the Sl&aacute;intecare change plan while the second is our overall service plan and budget.  At the start of 2018, the national service plan had &euro;14.5 billion and the outturn was &euro;15.2 billion.  We have &euro;16 billion this year so we are up &euro;2 billion overall on the original national service plan for 2018.  That is the budget within which I must manage.  In doing so, I must deliver quality services and deliver on our commitments in the national service plan.  Like many of the other sectors that are under pressure such as justice, education and local government, from which I have come, I feel the wider pressures for us, particularly given that it impacts on people's lives.  It is a challenging issue.  I have a mandate, budget and change plan and must work towards all of them.  No public servant, myself included, has a mandate to spend overall above what is committed to him or her.  That is my challenge.  I am committed to public services, want to get value for money for them and want to deliver quality services.  I may have referenced Dr. Colm Henry as the chief medical officer.  My apologies if I did.  The chief clinical officer and the team are working very closely on this as we work through in terms of delivering to the budget.  How do we do it in a manner that delivers services and provides good-quality care and safety?  That is a very strong driver as we work through this process.  Ultimately, I am clear and as a public servant, I know the funds that have been committed to me.  I do not have a mandate to spend beyond them.  I want to bring the whole organisation along with me.  Long before I arrived, the team here, including Ms Anne O'Connor, who has been interim director general, took some very good actions in the first quarter that I recognise.  They took some really good actions that I hope are beginning to constrain the overrun we saw throughout last year and set us on a way forward for the rest of the year to make some decisions and difficult choices we will have to make to work through that process.  We will do so in a balanced way and that is the message I want to communicate clearly.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#N00100"><p>I assure Senator Dolan that there is a plan and strategy to develop and progress services for people with disabilities.  We have to accept that in the HSE service plan for 2019, &euro;1.904 billion is being invested in social services for people with disabilities.  This is a significant investment in our disability services, the highest amount in the history of the State.  This means that, as I speak, 8,600 people are in residential places, 27,000 people are in day services, there are 182,500 residential respite support overnights, 1.63 million hours for personal assistant services, 3.08 million hours for home support services and approximately 160 people who are now in institutions will be moving out of them.  While I acknowledge there are problems in disability services which we are trying to fix , it is also proper to acknowledge the tremendous work being done by the HSE on this.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan's earlier point on disability was correct.  I am smiling privately because we are discussing disability at 11 a.m.  I have been at many committee meetings where we did not get to discuss disability until 12.30 p.m. or 1 p.m., three or four hours after the meeting had started.  This is a reflection, and I have seen this in research from the National Disability Authority, of the need to make disability more mainstream in society.  There is a lot of talk about disability but in broader society and the political system disability needs to be brought further into the centre.  This is my job as the Minister of State and I try to do it every Tuesday at the Cabinet table.  Every Minister has a role to play in this regard.</p> <p>  With regard to Senator Dolan's questions on unmet needs in disability services, we are updating the data as part of Transforming Lives.  We all accept we need to plan the services and they need to be provided in a structured way.  A total of 13.5% of our population, which is 643,000 people, have some form of disability.  This is the reality.  Most do not require disability services because their needs can be met in the primary care services, which is good.  The figures Senator Dolan spoke about include the 60,000 people who have their needs recorded for the next five years.  A total of 1.6% of these are aged under 65.  We need to plan for these services.  What amount of money are we speaking about?  A residential place costs in the region of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;500,000 per annum.  The figure of &euro;500,000 is for high dependency adults with disabilities.  A day place can cost as low as &euro;5,000 per annum per year and up to &euro;50,000.  I make this point with regard to the funding.</p> <p>  What I believe is required over the next five years to meet unmet needs is additional funding of &euro;10 million for respite services.  We have done a fantastic job this year with the opening of 12 new respite houses but over the next five years we will need another &euro;10 million for respite services.  We also need &euro;90 million to develop support needs for people with disabilities in day places and other places.  We also need another &euro;6 million for therapy posts.  We have 100 therapy posts this year but I know from speaking to people what we need.  Personal assistant services and home support hours need an additional &euro;30 million.  They are part of the plan over the next couple of years.  To be upfront about it, the figure we are looking at is in the region of &euro;286 million in additional money over the next five years.</p> <p>  To answer the points on Rehab, the organisation provides a very important service.  I thank the Minister and the HSE for the tremendous support they have given me on the resolution of the issue with Rehab.  They have been very supportive of the 3,000 people with disabilities involved and their families.  The Minister makes the point that the work goes on.  We are looking at the report from Dr. Catherine Day.  We have a deficit issue, about which I speak to Senator Dolan regularly.  We will come back with a plan on this.  We have to deal with these issues.  We will work constructively with all of the service providers because we need proper plans and proper budgets.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, I will always be looking for extra money.  Sometimes I do well and sometimes I do not but the bottom line is we have to make the overall view.  When we ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities last year it helped to change the mindset.  We still have a long journey to go to bring this human rights approach to our disability services.  These are citizens, many of whom now work, which is a good thing, and more have the ability to work.  They pay tax and make a contribution to society.  They should not be left behind in any way.  From this point of view, much work has been done but, of course, we need to do more.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Reid and wish him well.  He will need all of the good wishes and help he can get.  He has a formidable task, one which has not been successfully achieved so far.  That is not a reflection on any of Mr. Reid's predecessors but simply a statement of fact that the objectives some of us saw as being primary and necessary have never been achieved.  For instance, staying within budget is one thing that has not happened so far.  I agree with Mr. Reid that if there is no budgetary structure he can rely on and that he knows from the beginning of the year will be available and capable of discharging the services required, he is going nowhere.  He cannot run an organisation in that manner.</p> <p>  Another issue I have raised in the past, as the Ministers know, is the efficacy of the structures of the HSE.  I know this is being changed and the Minister will have regionalised authorities within the system.  I have always been of the opinion that the amorphous mass of the HSE, which replaced a regional system, has not worked and will never work.  I hope I am wrong but I have not yet seen proof to the contrary.  My point is that it is like building a wheel in that the further we go from the centre, the less clear the remit becomes and the greater the difficulty of ensuring the outer reaches are capable of operating in the way it was intended and that they are committed to it.  For example, the team needs to pull together.  Everybody needs to be heading in the same direction at the same time.  If we are to run a proper service capable of meeting the needs of the Irish people, we do not need to have different opinions emerge daily as to who should do what, when and how often.  Simplicity should be the order of the day as we proceed because complications lead to various culs-de-sac into which everybody will sneak from time to time and emerge when it is opportune.  This has to stop.  If we do not have a chain of command where responsibility comes from the ground up and the top down, we will not be able to provide a service that meets the requirements of the people of this country or provide a reliable, safe, available and cost-effective service.</p> <p>  I want to revert to cost-effectiveness briefly.  Cost-effectiveness comes in many shapes and forms.  It comes in the administration of the services in general, the administration of purchasing and the approval of drug refunds.  Something we seem to get bogged down in from time to time is a debate on whether we should do a particular thing on the basis of it being too expensive.  If it is too expensive, that has to be taken into account and it should not enter the equation in the first place.</p><p>If we cannot afford it, we must state publicly that this is a very expensive issue and will have to tax the public somewhat further in order to ensure we are capable of doing this.  There comes a time when the buck must stop somewhere.</p><p> On the chain of command, I firmly believe it must apply, particularly in the health services where decisions made at the top of the HSE are carried out and applied at ground level without exception.  If people are going in different directions, thinking their own thing and identifying different objectives, that chain of command weakens and we will have more explosive issues appearing daily.  Incidentally, from 2004 until 2012, one could not debate, discuss or raise a question about the day-to-day running issues of the HSE.  Many people have forgotten that, but I have not.  I was one of the people who tabled questions daily to challenge that on the basis that we should know whether the system is working properly and within budget and its remit.  It is a matter of history that I was ejected from the House on at least 20 occasions on that issue.  People think that is funny, but it is not.  I was seeking information that should have been available.  The matter was smothered at the time.  As a result, we have a situation whereby we daily debate the internal running of individual aspects of the health services to such an extent that the chain of command is no longer in command.  That is how it works.  I am a mechanically minded person with a reasonable understanding of the integrated working of the gear system.  The new director general also has a knowledge of that area.  The gear system works in a way such that if one element is operating at variance to the rest, nothing happens and everything goes backwards.  I wish Mr. Reid well.  I hope it goes well for him.  He will certainly receive the full support of everybody I know in the system because everybody wants to make it work.</p><p> The Minister promised to regionalise within the HSE, a step which is long awaited and greatly anticipated.  I hope that is done in the very near future and that with it will come responsibility at regional level.  Sadly, responsibility at that level has been missing since the abolition of the health boards many years ago.  I did not get my wish back in the discourse that took at the time, nor did I get it at the Sl&aacute;intecare committee, of which I was a member.  Whatever reasons were behind the abolition of the health boards, people do not wish to go back to them.  That may be a good thing or a bad thing.  We may have to reconsider it in the not too distant future if the system does not work.  I am not convinced by some of the excuses for not being able to go back to that regional system, such as that it did not work.  Things happened more quickly under that system.  If an issue was raised, it was dealt with quickly.  If it was not, one knew what the problem was.</p><p>  I wish to briefly refer to the issue of waiting lists.  There is an ongoing requirement within the system.  Whenever a waiting list occurs, two things must happen: one must remove some of the people from the waiting list - which is being done effectively and, I hope, efficiently - and one must deal with new people joining the waiting list.  If that is not done, we will be forever beset by waiting lists.  The problem is that we seem to accept that waiting lists are inevitable and go on forever almost everywhere.  That is not the way to deliver services.  It does not work that way.</p><p> The Chair thinks I should resort to a question.  At this time in my life, I have the answers to most of the questions I have asked, and I am still waiting hopefully for answers to the others.  The Chair will be glad to know that I will not go into that today.  I do not wish to take up any more time.  The Minister and the delegates will answer in due course.  I stayed within the half an hour guideline.</p></speech>

The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has been reasonably successful in dealing with some waiting lists.  Have all the referrals gone outside the jurisdiction or have some been dealt with within the jurisdiction?  If so, how many?  Are there facilities in the private or public sectors within the jurisdiction that could deal with some of those on waiting lists?  I do not have an ideological hang-up about people receiving services in the public or private sector as long as they receive the required service at the required time and are not told that if they wait for four years, something will be done for them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#O00600"><p>I am almost afraid to endeavour to answer the questions considering that the Deputy answered some of them more ably than I could.  I reassure him that it remains my position to advance the restructuring of the health service in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Regional integrated care organisations - we will not call them RICOs because that relates to racketeering in South America - will achieve the aim of having integrated structures that deal with acute hospital care and primary and social care.  There will be one structure in each region rather than multiple structures.  It is my intention to go to Cabinet before the summer recess to seek approval for those structures in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  That will be a very important moment for the health service because one does not change structures for the sake of it; one changes them if they will be enablers for change and reform.  There is no doubt in my mind that one cannot reform the health service while continuing with two separate structures in the hospital groups and the community health organisations.  We must have one structure that provides an opportunity, as alluded to by the Deputy, for greater devolution to the regions, a smaller national centre and HSE, more devolved responsibility to the regions and more accountability and oversight at regional level.  I do not mean this as a criticism, but it is often a source of great frustration to Deputies that they must ask questions on certain issues on the floor of the national Parliament.  They would prefer to get more efficient and localised answers from a regional structure.  The bringing forward of those proposals before the summer recess will be a very important moment in terms of advancing Sl&aacute;intecare and ensuring there is no going back, that the Sl&aacute;intecare train has left the station and everybody needs to get on board.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced chains of command, governance and so on.  I reassure him that it is still my intention that the new HSE board will take office in June, which is very important.  At this and other committees, Mr. Reid's predecessors and other HSE representatives have alluded to the somewhat bizarre governance structure which is in place and which needs to be reformed.  The new board will take office in June, subject to the Oireachtas doing its business. I hope to have the co-operation of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in that regard.</p> <p>  On the issue of waiting lists, as we all know, there will always be a list because as soon as one person is treated, another will need treatment.  The issue is how long people wait for treatment.  We are making good progress.  I accept that we have a significant amount to do in the area of outpatients - there were some good exchanges earlier in that regard.  It is important to note that there are 9,119 fewer of our citizens awaiting a hospital operation or other procedure at the end of April this year than at the end of April last year.   That is a direct result of some of the investment decisions we made in recent times.</p> <p>  I will revert to the Deputy in writing with the exact breakdown on the NTPF.  Almost all NTPF expenditure is within the jurisdiction.  A very small number of procedures for scoliosis and so on were carried out elsewhere, but almost all procedures occur within the jurisdiction.  Importantly, a higher percentage of the NTPF budget is now being spent within the public health service.  I always remind my HSE colleagues that the NTPF should not be seen as just a fund for private hospitals.  That may have been the case in the old days.  There is every opportunity for public hospitals which have capacity.  We have capacity to do more, particularly sometimes in our smaller hospitals, and we have seen some exciting proposals in that regard.</p><p>I refer to the &euro;1 million we gave to the NTPF to open a new cataract theatre in Nenagh hospital last year.  In that instance, we used a public hospital and NTPF money to sort out cataract waiting lists in the mid west.  Perhaps Mr. Reid might like to add something.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.341" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#P00200"><p>I agree on how important it is to deliver on the funds committed to us in our budget.  I reiterate the Minister's point that in going through this process we will need to invest in transformation in the future.  I have never been involved in any major transformation that did not need investment.  Everybody understands that and it is explicit in Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am wise enough to state that we first have to do what is necessary to strengthen trust and confidence and then invest funds in the future model.  I am committed to doing that.  The Minister remarked on the structures of the HSE.  I welcome the new board and, although not yet appointed, I have met all of its members individually.  They will bring great expertise as well as a level of challenge to the executive structure.  We look forward to working with the chair and the board on our current priorities and also on those that the board will set for us, in conjunction with the Department and the Minister.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the making of just decisions in situations where things are too expensive.  We have to make those decisions.  As I stated earlier in the context of the discussion on Spinraza, I thank the drugs committee for doing fantastic work overall and making those difficult decisions for us throughout the year.  The committee makes decisions using a wide range of criteria and has approved drugs that would not be cost effective but that are necessary for the people impacted.  Many of the 23 drugs approved this year have not been cost effective.  We have to make some decisions, therefore, in the public interest.</p> <p>  Turning to the chain of command and regionalisation, I agree completely that people in any large complex organisation, particularly the workforce, mostly identify with their local unit, manager, hospital or primary care centre.  A stronger identity will emerge, therefore, as we move to a regional model.  It is a model derived from the policy of the HSE and the Department of Health.  As we move to that model, in respect of central policy making, involvement, employment and particularly achieving consistency, the last thing the public and the public health service need is a regional model with different models applying in different areas.  That is my view and it is also reflected in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will be regional and that will encourage people, and in particular the workforce, to buy into the service while a level of consistency and control is retained at the centre.  That is the model we all want to see.  </p> <p>  The Minister also referred to the NTPF and its impact on waiting lists.  I see the NTPF as a great lever.  Many local managers in our acute hospitals, including Ms Grace Rothwell who is here today, are leveraging and using it in a proactive way to address waiting lists.  In Irish private and public hospitals, people travel overseas under the auspices of the HSE and not the NTPF.  It is deployed in our public and private hospitals.</p></speech>

His employment history demonstrates that he is a dedicated public servant.  I hope he will deliver in his role for the people of Ireland.  I agree with my colleague, Deputy Durkan, that many have failed in this same role before.  I also believe we have political buy-in to the ten year Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  Some of us here sat on the committee that produced it.  I also agree with Mr. Reid that buy-in is needed from the public and that confidence is a prerequisite.  There will be a lack of confidence if it appears to the public that we are not in control of a budget and that there is not a steady hand on the reins.  I wish Mr. Reid the very best in his new role.</p> <p>  I do not want to rehash some of the previous comments regarding governance.  In many of the recent crises and scandals, or whatever word we use, however, there has been a constant narrative regarding a need for a change of governance structures.  That has been the case not just in the Department of Health but also in other Departments.  A new board is being appointed in the health service in June and that will represent the required change in governance structures.  Governance has often been blamed for failings in the past.  If the governance will now be right from June, there will be no excuse anymore in that regard, as far as I am concerned.  I do not expect to have to come in then and listen to governance being blamed for whatever incidents might happen from June.  I refer to there being a proper chain of command, the spokes on the wheel not being too far from the centre and there being appropriate accountability. </p> <p>   A number of eminent general practitioners, GPs, addiction specialists and consultant psychiatrists wrote a fairly clear letter in the newspapers during the week.  I do not have it in front of me but it concerned the effects of the recreational use of cannabis.  As the Minister is aware, I and the Chair spent much time working through the Bill that was before this committee a year or more ago.  Despite the massive volume of legal advice to not proceed with the Bill, it somehow managed to proceed to the next Stage.  I know it has now been halted by the absence of a money message.   Eminent psychiatrists, GPs and addiction experts are stating one thing.  It would be helpful if Mr. Reid would outline the difference between legalisation, decriminalisation and harm reduction.  I really object to the word "medicinal" being used in respect of cannabis.  It is a controlled drug.  Until it gains evidence to justify the medicinal name, then we are just dealing with a schedule 1 drug.  </p> <p>  My focus regarding this issue has always been on protecting our citizens.  I also want to focus, however, on protecting our regulatory processes.  No drug is allowed onto the market unless deemed safe by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  It would never allow any drug get onto the market via a regulatory process that was circumvented for whatever reason.  Doctors, in particular Dr. Walley, have spoken in the media about the prevalence of this issue in the business pages of newspapers and the push towards allowing investment in this area.  The Minister is familiar with this area.  He took the lead on the compassionate access programme and some 15 or 16 patients are benefiting from that scheme now.  Given that level of take-up, we as legislators and people in charge of our health service have to stand back and ask questions.  </p> <p>  If only 16 patients have been granted use of this product by the consultants allowed to prescribe it, why is there such a big push in the business world regarding legal changes in respect of this drug?  We are in a precarious position as legislators.  Those of us with a medical background feel strongly about big business being able to negate the existing body of evidence.  That body of evidence underpins what was stated by medical professionals regarding this issue in newspapers and other media this week.  I ask Mr. Reid to outline where we are on this topic.  The message circulating at the moment seems to suggest that everyone is going to be legalising drugs.  Parents are concerned, as are people who have experienced this issue with their children, teenagers and adolescents.  They feel strongly about this matter. </p> <p>  I also want to address the issue of vaccination and the worrying decrease in the uptake of vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella.  We have spoken about measles in recent months.  That illness has rightly been the subject of publicity internationally and domestically.  Measles is a serious illness which can cause life-altering conditions and even death.  A number of GPs have told me that there is a huge upsurge in cases of mumps.  I refer to mild forms of mumps.  Children who have been vaccinated are presenting with symptoms that may be retrospectively recognised as a mild form of mumps.  The HSE needs to work on education in this area.</p><p>Children who have been vaccinated and are exposed to mumps can be left deaf and have other complications throughout life.  With respect to those parents who are responsible and make their informed decisions based on the evidence about their children's health, there is almost a belief, although perhaps I am reading it wrong, that if one vaccinates one's child, he or she will be grand but that is not the case.  If one has a child who is immuno-compromised with cancer or who is simply vulnerable at a particular point or if one is an older person, if they get a measles or a mumps infection they can be very seriously ill and that can have lasting effects.  </p><p> The Minister was doing some work with the Attorney General on the mandatory vaccination.  If it was as easy to force everyone to vaccinate, this would have been done back in the day when Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine.  I agree with him that moves need to be made to prepare in the event of an epidemic to address what we should do if we were to end up in a situation such as in the United States where people are not allowed leave their homes or there are issues in airports.  We need to prepare for the worst-case scenario.  With respect to where we are on the issue of mandatory vaccination and bringing people along with us, based on my experience it is not a lack of information that results in people failing to vaccinate their children rather it is oversupply of the wrong information.  People often make informed decisions but the information on which they base their decisions is not scientific.  I am concerned when I hear views on this issue from people such as Andrew Wakefield, the discredited doctor, who apparently is currently dating Elle Macpherson.  There is a celebrity element to this.  Kim Kardashian's baby's birth by surrogate had a CBD theme.  The Minister probably did not know that.  He is probably too busy running the health service.  A celebrity element is coming into issues that have a serious effect on our public health.  We as legislators must be strong on this.  If we let the Kardashians or Andrew Wakefield into the mix on this, issues in respect of which there has major investment in our universities and our institutions over the years can be diminished by a reality TV star, not into getting into the President of the United States while we are at the health committee.  However, I feel strongly about this and about the impact of social media on people's health and bad information.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of folic acid with him previously.  Have anything been done to provide free folic acid supplementation for pregnant women and babies?  Ireland has the highest rate of neural tube defects.  The incidence here is increasing at greater rate than anywhere else in Europe.  There is a cost in terms of money and on families but providing education on this is a simple thing to do.  It would not require too much money.  I gave the Minister the figures on how cheaply it could be done.  A first step would be to provide free folic acid for everybody sitting beside a pregnancy test in a doctor's surgery or in the newsagents.  I do not care where they sit once people have access to folic acid.</p> <p>  What is the status of the group dealing with the issue of providing free contraception?  Members of the Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution parked the idea of exclusion zone legislation because we wanted the service to be provided as promised from 1 January.  We are now heading towards the summer.  As the Minister will be aware, families are experiencing negativity in various centres and GPs are under pressure.  If we do not get a handle on this soon, GPs will give us doing it.  It is not worth it.  There are some things that are not worth it in one's life if one is being attacked on one's way to work everyday.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for these questions.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to discuss cannabis because there has been a great deal of coverage of it.  It is important for me to set the record straight on this.  There are no plans to legalise cannabis or any other illicit drugs in our country.  What there are, though, are two important and distinct streams of work.  The first relates to a compassionate access programme for cannabis for medicinal reasons.  I intend to set that up over the summer months.  I expect to sign the statutory instruments in the coming weeks.  A great deal of work is being done with HSE colleagues to prepare for that.  That programme has been designed in consultation with clinicians and clinical guidelines have been published, which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  It came about after I asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority to carry out the first ever review in Ireland of the potential use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.  It reported back indicating there were three areas it could be used for: multiple sclerosis, MS, certain types of epilepsy and vomiting and the likes from chemotherapy.  There will be a scheme set up before that and that is a separate and distinct matter which I believe we are supportive.</p> <p>  The second issue is one in respect of which we are fulfilling a commitment in the programme for Government and a commitment of a former Oireachtas committee, which was chaired at the time by Deputy Stanton, who is now a Minister of State.  There is also our national drugs and alcohol strategy, which deals with how we can take a health-led approach to drug addiction.  It is not about legalising drugs, but when we come across somebody with a drug addiction should we be giving them a helping hand or a handcuff?  It is wrong, stigmatising and dismissive of our obligations to people with an addiction if we take only a criminal justice approach to that.  It is about recognising the fact that behind every addict is somebody&rsquo;s son, daughter, mother, father, brother or sister and that the war on drugs around the entire world fails.  If we want to break the cycle of addiction, we must take a health-led approach.  Deciding that the only thing we will do for a drug addict is put them in touch with the criminal justice system will not break addiction.  That approach would be a failure in our duties in terms of a modern health service and a compassionate, tolerant society that wants to look after and care for people in difficult times.  When it comes to drug addiction, there but for the grace of God go I.  It is not about legalising drugs; rather it is about being compassionate and offering the helping hand rather the handcuff tor people who are addicts.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and I have established a working group on this issue with colleagues from the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health, the HSE, drug addiction services, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and so on.  It has reported and we will consider that report and bring it to Government in the coming weeks.  There are no plans to legalise cannabis but there is a plan to have an access programme to it for medicinal reasons and a plan for how we can tackle the underlying issues of drug addiction, recognising than no one is born wanting to be a drug addict.  Many people become drug addicts by circumstances of birth.  We must ask why are people taking drugs and how we can break the cycle of addiction.  I hope that clarifies what I believe has been a misrepresentation by some and, in fairness, a genuine concern on the part of our medics and medically qualified people that their voices were not being heard on this.  I assure them we will continue to work closely with clinicians on this and even on a medicinal programme.  Clinical guidelines have been drawn up and an excellent body of work done in that regard.</p></speech>

If the message in the past week has been corrupted to such an extent, the messages our young people are getting are subject to corruption.  There is work that could be done in the early stages of secondary school where the facts are put out.

I believe the Deputy and I agree on this.  The lock them up mentality has dominated many of our debates on tackling difficult social issues - lock them up, brush the problem under the carpet, pretend it does not exist and send it abroad.  We have heard all sorts of different versions when people have come upon hard times in this country.  We must face up to drug addiction.  That does not mean we should legalise drugs.  Educating our children about the serious dangers of taking drugs is key.  They are dangerous and can destroy one's life but responding to a person who has become an addict with more than simply a blue siren is important.</p> <p>  I am passionate about the issue of vaccinations.  Later today, we will bring my baby to get her latest vaccinations.  Vaccinations save lives.  We have to start pushing back against the misinformation in this area.  I want to set up an alliance to be proactively on the pitch because when we are not on the pitch; all those people the Deputy mentioned and others are on the pitch spreading this misinformation.  We need healthcare professionals, patient advocates and policymakers working together on this.  I have a number of meetings this week on the issue.</p><p>I hope to be in a position to announce a new alliance to promote vaccination, just like we successfully did together in respect of the HPV vaccine.  The director general referred to the really excellent increase.  There is a 70% uptake rate.  Therefore, it is possible.  We will do it.  Issues relating to mandatory vaccination, etc., will be examined.  Many of my colleagues are looking at those.  Members will have heard the comments from my UK and German counterparts.  Ireland needs to be involved in these discussions because they are happening right across the globe.  However, no decisions have yet been made.  The alliance absolutely needs to happen because, unfortunately, diseases that we had thought had become confined to the history books because of the success of vaccination are now creeping back and having a devastating impact on some people.  I expect that we will make progress on that in the coming weeks.</p><p> On the issue of folic acid, that will be looked at in the context of the women's health action plan.  Work is under way on that plan.</p><p> On the issue of contraception, the working group has been established and is under way.  I had a good meeting with colleagues from the HSE's sexual health unit last week on that and I expect the working group to report to me in September in time for me to try to make provisions in the forthcoming budget.</p><p> On the exclusion zones, I am pleased that the number of GPs signing up to provide termination services continues to rise.  It is well above 300 now.  It was 160 when we started the service.  There is a need for safe access zones.  I am absolutely committed to bringing forward that legislation.  I expect to bring the general scheme of a Bill on that to Cabinet before the summer recess.</p></speech>

The plan contains a strong reference to changing the model of care and reorienting the health service away from hospital-centred care.  The current model of care is not capable of meeting the demands on the system.  That is reflected in the service plan.  There are issues regarding the level of care in the hospitals, particularly at weekends.  We tend to move from a different level of care Monday to Friday to weekend care.  There is a deficit in the hospital services whereby there is a lack of diagnostics and access to specialist consultant care at weekends because of the model of care we are using.  We do not have a 24-7 model.  We tend to have a five-day-week model at one level and then a model of care weekends that inhibits the flow of patients through the system.  Perhaps Mr. Reid and Ms O'Connor might comment on that.</p> <p>  The national service plan also indicates that the allocation of funding this year will be challenging in the context of meeting the service level provided in 2018, particularly under the existing models of care, and that we need to innovate and have integrated models of care.  Perhaps Mr. Reid and Ms O'Connor might expand on how they see that being delivered.  Sl&aacute;intecare is strong on that matter.</p> <p>  As a result of increased demand, with a 5% or 6% increase year on year in attendances at accident and emergency departments, elective beds are being flooded by emergency care patients.  We will soon move to a level of care whereby we can only provide emergency care through accident and emergency departments.  Emergency cancer care and elective care are being pushed out of public hospitals.  I have been contacted by a number of consultants who are providing more care through the NTPF in private hospitals than they are able to deliver through their work in public hospitals, particularly in circumstances where hospitals are operating to 95% capacity.  There is a reference in the service plan that the national cancer control programme allocation for 2019 will not allow the services to match referral demand in areas such as radiotherapy, rapid access cancer clinics and diagnostics.  In the context of the HSE's move to remain within budget, which, of course, is absolutely correct, how can it match the demands that are being placed on the system while remaining within a budget, which, even the service plan states, will give rise to challenges in the context of delivering services?</p> <p>  The development of elective-only hospitals is absolutely essential.  This needs to be prioritised within the capital budget and within future service plans.  Unfortunately, we cannot have acute hospitals delivering acute care and also expect them to deliver elective care in a timely manner.  We need to move to putting in place elective-only hospitals as rapidly as possible.  Mr. Reid and Ms O'Connor might comment on those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Reid" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#R00700"><p>I will make a few comments.  I might ask the chief clinical officer, Dr. Henry, to come in on a couple of them.</p> <p>  The first point the Chairman mentioned relates to the challenge of delivering the service plan in light of increased service pressures.  That is a matter on which we are working through with the team.  In terms of the processes that have kicked off, I will get a review back from all areas.  That review will include proposals to come in on budget but within an overall framework of quality and safety.  When I get all of that information, we will be in a position to review and assess the overall commitments on the plan that we will set out to deliver, which areas of the service are under significant pressure and what choices we must make.  It is a process that we are working through.  The Chairman summarised it well.  It is a challenging process because of the upward pressures that exist.</p> <p>  On the overall perspective of the service plan, moving to new models and innovation, I referred earlier to the community health networks that are being set up across the nine areas.  That is the start of the process to examine the issue of acute hospital services and community and primary services working closer together.  It is a pilot programme across the nine sites.  Ultimately, it is at a micro level and the model that we are moving towards will be at the macro level.  We will assess the benefits as we move forward.</p> <p>  The Chairman summarised where matters currently stand, namely, we have an acute service under pressure in terms of capacity and demand and a community service that is under pressure in terms of the availability of step-down facilities, etc.  Those are some of the areas we want to look at in greater detail in the context of facilitating better alignment and with regard to the working relationship between the acute facilities and the community side.  Overall, it is, as the Chairman described, very challenging.</p> <p>  On elective care, earlier I summarised that there has been some progress.  The NTPF has been part of the solution, but so have our own services and the work of consultants.  Dr. Henry may want to add to that overall.</p> <p>  In summary, it is a very challenging process.  We will be working through it over the next few weeks in the context of looking at the outturn for the year, providing a safe quality framework and making judgments in terms of how we prioritise within the budget for this year.  Notwithstanding the challenges we face, we have significant extra finances available this year as a result of uplift we have been given by the Government.  We want to ensure that we use this money in the most focused way possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#R00800"><p>The Chairman is absolutely right.  The models of care are key.  In the absence of a model of care for chronic disease - be it congestive heart failure or chronic bronchitis, which are well known to the Chairman from his other career - we are going to continue to invest in the wrong way, namely. waiting until patients arrive in hospital and join waiting lists or are placed on trolleys in emergency departments.  We need to invest in the whole spectrum of care.  We spoke about vaccinations earlier.  I refer to self-care, self-management and creating hubs of care in the community built around increased capability of nursing to deliver care long before people reach hospital.  The key to this is a reform of public health.  This is a piece of work that is being undertaken by my office in conjunction with the Department.  We want to build up the capacity of the public health workforce to deal with health service improvement.  When we are looking at models of care, we do not rely on the expertise of hospital clinicians alone; we look at the entire spectrum of care required, from prevention and promotion right through to specialist care.</p> <p>  On elective care, there has been a move in recent years, perhaps out of necessity but also, going back to the model of care design, to work with the national clinical programme of surgery - led by Professor Frank Keane previously and now by Mr. Ken Mealy, who is with the RCSI - which has done sterling work.  What we have seen is a dramatic increase in the number of day cases.  We have seen a shift from procedures being done over a few days now being performed on a day-case basis.  Some 20% or more of day cases do not need to take a full day, they can be done in outpatient surgeries or even GP surgeries.  That is the context in which the GP contract and enabling primary care are really important.  We are putting the pieces in place, namely, a stronger public health workforce focused on health service improvement, a stronger more resilient primary care model and building hubs of care in the community rather than waiting for patients to arrive in hospitals and join queues.  That is key to reform.</p><p>With regard to the attempts to come in under budget in the HSE, Mr. Reid mentioned that there is also increased funding to allow this.  We have spoken about moving to changed models of care, where everything can be done more efficiently.  There are many processes within our hospital structure and the clinical and management element of hospital services that quite often inhibit patient flow through the system.  If we allow certain practices to continue in our hospitals, we will be promoting them.  Many structures within our hospital system do not work in the best interests of patients.  That is where efficiency and cost effectiveness can be applied.  Our hospital structures are not in keeping with modern medicine delivery and many of them are 20, 30 or 40 years out of date.  Those models are inhibiting patient flow through the system.  If there are to be visits to hospitals on a regular basis, we should examine the way hospitals function as there is much inefficiency in that process.</p></speech>

The winter plan review process that we have kicked off across nine hospitals has been broadened, with the agreement of the Minister, to consider best practice in respect of a range of issues.  This does not just take in emergency departments but the relationships between emergency departments, acute and community care.  There has been strong feedback from clinicians, nurses and the general work force about variability of processes across acute care.  There can be significant variance in decision-making in emergency care.  There is some good practice and the winter plan demonstrates where that is.  We need to capture that, and this relates to the issue we touched on earlier with respect to consistency in models.  Last week. I spent a little time in emergency departments and one can see different practices, including some really good examples.  It is about getting the best and making sure those practices are implemented.  I will not be able to do that in all hospitals but the process we have kicked off will give us a greater depth of insight and best practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#S00300"><p>We are undertaking some work post winter, as the director general has just mentioned.  There was mention of weekend working and over the course of the winter we specifically funded access to diagnostics on the weekend to encourage or enable flow.  We will learn from that.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund will work with us now in acquiring diagnostics and it is something it started doing over the winter.  It is happy to do that as part of supporting emergency flow.  That is quite important for us, as the committee will understand.</p> <p>  In terms of process we need optimum discharges on a Friday, as hospitals with a high clearance rate on a Friday tend to get through the weekend in reasonably good shape.  Difficulties arise when that does not happen.  We are looking to learn from this winter with respect to flow and we are doing substantive work using both international and local expertise.  That will inform where we go for the coming period and the approaching winter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1321" speakername="John Brassil" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#S00500"><p>There is no problem.  It is enlightening to have listened to what everybody has said and I have removed all the questions I had that have been asked.  I welcome Mr. Reid and wish him the best of luck in his new role.  I have great admiration for him for taking on the challenge, and the fact that he is willing to take it on demonstrates that he is a committed man.  I wish him every success.  Following the Minister's comments, there is a unique opportunity here and the witnesses have been given a political &quot;free pass&quot; in the form of Sl&aacute;intecare.  If they implement that policy, nobody in this room could fault them in any way.  Any time anybody might try to do so, we can be referred to the document that we in this room produced, which was endorsed by the entire Oireachtas membership.</p><p>Senator Dolan is on my immediate left and I will start with disability matters.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is present and I endorse the point made about Rehab.  I am delighted that matter has been resolved but I anticipate a number of other organisations awakening to those events.  The Kerry Parents and Friends Association, which does excellent work in County Kerry, issued a statement indicating its budget is severely challenged for 2019.  I might speak a little more about that offline.  The disability sector is an area for which we must continually fight as those involved are so tied up trying to look after their loved ones and care that they do not have the time or energy for it.  It is always left to us to advocate on their behalf and the Minister of State knows I will continue to do that.  I have brought to his attention a number of individual cases and he has made time to meet those people.  I thank him for that but I would like some follow-up so I will speak to him offline in that regard.</p><p>I will comment on Mr. Reid's opening statement and the letter he sent about financial control.  I greatly welcome that and it is a good starting point.  I will throw into the mix the &euro;100 million overrun that he is seeking to avoid but there is also &euro;100 million available in savings in biosimilar drugs.  I have been going on about it <i>ad nauseam</i>for three years now.  This biosimilar policy is meant to be coming and money could be saved.  The HSE is looking to make savings and they are available.  Mr. Reid should not take any more excuses or reasons for deferral; the money should be taken because we need it.  When the Minister of State is looking for &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million and there is &euro;100 million available, is it not time to avail of it?</p><p>I am aware of a review of Ireland's reimbursement process in its entirety that is ongoing and I have some very specific questions on it.  I might ask them afterwards.</p><p>I would like progress on group recruitment for hospitals.  The recruitment area is in itself a minefield.  I am most familiar with the hospital in Kerry and trying to recruit for a slightly isolated hospital when doctors want to go to a centre of excellence in Cork.  There should be recruitment on a group basis across the board and if there is a shortfall in one hospital - perhaps a category 3 or category 2 hospital - the category 4 hospital should intervene and send people to those facilities.  Along with that is the consultant pay discrepancy, and I do not foresee any resolution to the recruitment crisis until that is dealt with.  Sl&aacute;intecare recommends that we do that.</p><p>I have stated many times that savings could be made as the budget for the fair deal scheme and home care packages are dealt with separately.  The cost of a patient in a fair deal scenario is at least double, if not triple, the cost of keeping him or her at home.  In most cases the person would want to be kept at home but he or she is dealt with under two budgets.  When a family seeks home care, the district nurse will ask if they have considered the fair deal scheme because he or she wants to hold on to the budget.  Those budgets should be in one pot, as this would generate significantly better value for money.</p><p>The Minister met pharmacy representatives at their recent conference.</p><p>I understand there was a very positive exchange.  The advancement of the minor ailments scheme would provide great value.  There is the issue around the provision of contraception, which is another area where significant savings are to be made.</p><p> I am a pharmacist and will declare my conflict of interest, but we have not yet dealt with financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, restoration for pharmacists.  As a group, they are a very underutilised resource.  It is only fair they get the same treatment as every other healthcare professional.  Will the Minister look at that?</p><p> With regard to ophthalmology in my area, as far as I am aware, the National Treatment Purchase Fund does not cover ophthalmology for patients in the Cork and Kerry region, for some reason.  If I am mistaken, that is fine, but I do not think I am.  I would like it to become available because there is a very large waiting list for ophthalmology in the Cork and Kerry region which I very much wish to be tackled.</p><p> On the recruitment issue again, by way of an example, this time last year the cardiologist in University Hospital Kerry handed in his notice.  Following parliamentary questions and so on, we were told the recruitment process had begun.  Following up almost 12 months later, I got the same answer except it was said that the advertisement for the job would commence shortly.  Therefore, 12 months after the person handed in his notice and we were told the recruitment would start, the job has not even been advertised.  When Kerry Deputies met University Hospital Kerry management recently, they were as frustrated as we were.  It is a systems failure.  It just goes up to the national recruitment agency and seems to go round in circles.  Nobody seems to have responsibility and, as a result, it has not happened when it should have happened.  In the early part of his role, will Mr. Reid try to come to grips with that recruitment issue and to cut out whatever red tape can be cut out?</p><p> I would ask a similar question about nurses.  How many nurses are in the system and how many nurses are needed in the system?  Again, when we met management at University Hospital Kerry last week, I was pleasantly surprised that the number of nurses recruited in the past 12 months has been significant, but that message perhaps does not get out there and gets lost in all the different controversies.  I would like to know the facts as to how many nurses are in the system compared with how many we need.  It is sometimes easy to make political points but they might not be entirely accurate.</p><p> I will leave it at that for the moment.  I will come back to the witnesses in my second contribution on the specific issue of the review of the reimbursement process.</p></speech>

We need to pick up the pace on this and we will take away what he said on that.  I assure the Deputy it is a priority for us collectively because, as he said, there is a chance to make significant savings for the health service while also doing the right thing by patients.</p> <p>  On the pharmacy-specific issues, to recap briefly, I addressed the Irish Pharmacy Union annual conference in recent weeks and I also had a very fruitful meeting with the IPU at the Department of Health.  We agreed there is definitely scope to do an awful lot more with the minor ailments scheme, very much in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  I very much see our pharmacists as a potential shopfront in many towns and villages for accessing Sl&aacute;intecare and for providing services in the community.  We have suggested to the IPU that it needs to do a piece of work with the Health Research Board on what that scheme would look like and, crucially, how we record the data in terms of making sure we are seeing the benefits.  Nobody wants just to duplicate services and we certainly do not want to pay for the duplication of services.  We want to pay for services either in terms of moving them to a more appropriate location or bringing additionality, and the Health Research Board could help with that.  The IPU is aware of our position on that.</p> <p>  On contraception, I am aware the IPU is going to make a submission to the working group and we will see where the expert view comes to.  It has been very helpful in providing expertise and guidance, for which I am very grateful.  In particular, it provided an international perspective on what other countries have done.</p> <p>  As I said at the conference, and I am happy to say it again, on the issue of FEMPI we are happy to begin the process of engaging on contract talks by the end of this year, so we will do that.  I also made the point that, sometimes, when one sector sees another sector getting something, it becomes a little misrepresented or there are Chinese whispers.  The GPs agreed to do a lot of new and different things in return for sustained increased investment.  That is the sort of space we will need to be in collectively, but I think we can have very productive talks, which we will start this year. </p></speech>

The Deputy made very helpful suggestions in regard to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, and savings in regard to biosimilars.  I spent an afternoon last week in our PCRS centre on the northside in Finglas.  It is an excellent centre and is as good as many centres I have seen operating in the private sector.  It is staffed entirely by HSE staff and they certainly have some excellent data in terms of the use of biosimilars, and they are capturing better data as they go along.  The Deputy raised the issue about policy change but we can certainly see the variance in the use of it around the consultants and across all the different hospitals.  We can see an opportunity in that regard and, as the Deputy said, it is part of our savings measures, given there are some areas we have to deliver on this year.  The Deputy also mentioned the reimbursement process overall.</p> <p>  On the issue of using skills across the groups, I agree with the Deputy that it is a question of how best to use them within the group in regard to deployment, and the nurses agreement certainly facilitates and supports that further.  That is simply a good use of resources across the group.</p> <p>  On the recruitment issue, we are looking at dealing with clogs in the system.  As I have mentioned, there is certainly a lot of recruitment going on.  Sometimes it can be done directly through the Public Appointments Service, which is dealing with a significant number of sectors and pressures on recruitment.  We are happy to look through that and get back to the Deputy in regard to any logjams we see in the system overall.</p> <p>  Dr. Henry might want to comment on ophthalmology and care.</p></speech>

Trainees now want to work in bigger centres dealing with cancer or more specialised work, for example, in cardiology with primary PCI.  We see a gravitation of trainees coming out who want to work in bigger centres.  I do not believe it is just an issue of pay.</p></speech>

The hospital groups represent a very good vehicle for group-wide recruitment.  Instead of having a department of cardiology for Kerry, there should be department of cardiology for the south west, which would see an integrated approach to cardiology and standardised care.  Most importantly, it is about patients, after all, and standardising the care for patients in Kerry, Waterford, Clonmel and Cork.  It is not based around the needs of doctors based in one specialised hospital but based on the needs right across the region.  I completely agree that is the way we need to go and, to do that, we have to recruit across group lines.  That represents one way we can mitigate the effect of trainees not wanting to work and not applying for jobs in model 3 hospitals.</p></speech>

I need the right decision to be made as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I will ask about the valproate response project and the rapid assessment report.  I was disappointed that the Minister, or a representative of his, was not at the recent conference with the HSE and the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome Ireland, OACS.  It was a very good conference.  I will go back to the point I made to the Minister some time ago about the need for a judge-led public inquiry into this.  We have had 40 years of this and we really need to know who knew what and when and on what basis Epilim was approved for the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder.  That was approved for pregnant women.</p> <p>  Does the Minister agree that there are issues of accountability here as to who knew what and when, particularly prior to 2014?  That was when the European Medicines Agency, EMA, implemented the first series of risk reductions.  The time path can be followed all the way along as the effects of Epilim in pregnant women became more certain.  There are now between 43 and 95 children with major congenital malformations and another 1,200 children who have been impacted.  It is very important that we have an inquiry into that as soon as possible and all of the documentation is made available.  OACS Ireland, through Karen Keely, has obtained a lot of documentation.  In the international context, there are hundreds of cases being brought before the French Government for consideration.  There is also an investigation ongoing in the UK as to how this drug was prescribed.  Will the Minister comment on the need for an inquiry into valproate?</p></speech>

I had a good meeting with OACS Ireland.  I have told OACS in person and in writing that there are three priorities.  The first has been to ensure that Ireland acts speedily on the EMA advice and warnings, which we have been doing and I think considerable progress has been made in that regard.  The second has been the overall response team and the work that has been done by the HSE in that regard, including the response project and the conference to which the Senator referred.  The third has been to focus on putting in place supports for the people who have been impacted.</p> <p>   We need to ask if there is a need for an inquiry to look backwards at what happened.  I have kept an open mind on that and neither the Department nor the HSE has reached a decision on the matter.  Our focus, from a sequencing point of view, has rightly been on putting supports in place for the people impacted and also making sure the EMA advice is acted on.  I keep an open mind on that and have not made a decision.</p></speech>

Imagine the anxiety of mothers and parents who knowingly took Epilim and the impact it had.

The impact that Epilim had on babies is beyond doubt.</p></speech>

We are beginning to have a big debate on this.  I am starting to wonder if we are reaching a point in modern medicine where doctors use the tools available and some of those tools have limitations.

We have been talking about screening for a long time.  We know that a false positive or negative is not a misdiagnosis or a missed cancer.  Similarly we know there are limitations to medicine.  Dr. Henry, as chief clinical officer in the HSE, may give the Senator more specifics.</p></speech>

The fact is that screening programmes are at best 80% to 90% sensitive.  That is more effectively communicated to people now.  In breast screening, for instance, the best-case scenario is 90% sensitivity in picking up.  We had a useful discussion at a hearing here before on the importance of people not seeing screening programmes as a diagnostic pathway.  An all-clear from a screening test does not mean that symptoms are insignificant.  It is really important that people understand that about the development of symptoms, even if someone has received an all-clear.  The two are completely different.</p></speech>

The difficulty in misdiagnosis to which I refer is the number of people who are turned away from hospitals; these are people who present and are told to go home, and they present again because of symptoms and this can go on over weeks.  I have been to funerals where this has happened where I was told that people were turned away from hospitals.  I am worried that because of staff shortages, ambulances lining up and all those things, vital diagnoses are being missed out on and people are losing their lives.</p></speech>

The fact is that screening and diagnostic pathways are not 100% sensitive either.  As the Chairman will know, when a doctor is faced with a clinical scenario, he or she makes a decision and assessment in real time based on the information available.  Sometimes looking back there is what we call a bias looking back where, with the benefit of knowledge, everything becomes clearer.  We know, for example, in radiology where there are good standards in radiology, if one looks back with the knowledge of a cancer developed, for example, one will see something in 5% or 10% of cases that had not been seen at the time.  Unfortunately we cannot provide 100% sensitivity in the care pathways we provide.  That is not to defend poor practice or appointments or impaired access but while clinical medicine is improving and is safer now than ever, it is not 100% perfect.</p></speech>

If he needs to go we understand as he indicated he would have to leave at 12.30 p.m.  We will go into a second round of questions.  The Minister may have to leave but his officials and the HSE representatives will remain.  Ms Grace Rothwell is here from the South/Southwest Hospital Group.  There were issues in relation to the mortuary in Waterford.  If anyone has questions on that, they might include them in this round.</p></speech>

I am very grateful to Ms Rothwell for being here today and for her leadership in the hospital in Waterford.  She has taken very swift action to improve the situation including putting an interim solution in place.  It is now on site and is greatly assisting.  It is important that the new HSE director general visited the hospital and met with pathologists and saw the situation for himself.  I appreciate that he did that.  I want to make two points here.  The new mortuary facility will be going ahead in Waterford.  Permission to tender has issued and that is something people will see as advanced.  We know that it will take some time to build the mortuary and that is why it is important that the interim facility is in place.  I did make the point that it is important that there would be some form of review.  This was a view shared by Ms Rothwell, the HSE, and the South/Southwest hospital group to look at internal processes and pathways on where remains are received, retained and released from the mortuary and to review management and governance arrangements for the mortuary to ensure that they are consistent with contemporary practice.  This morning we signed off on the terms of reference.  While I have been here a letter was sent to Oireachtas Members from Waterford outlining the terms of reference and the proposed membership of the review team.  It is expected that the final report will be available and finished in September and will inform the short and medium-term arrangements for the mortuary facility and its effective operation, and any broader learning for the health service.</p></speech>

It was said earlier that non-specialist consultants were being overseen, however I understand that they operate as fully-fledged consultants, and therefore while they might report into a clinical director their work has not been checked.

Indeed, many have accrued a great deal of experience not only here but also abroad; it just so happens that experience and expertise is not aligned with the criteria required to be on a specialist register, hence the difficulty.  Currently, no systematic themes on safety issues in relation to these consultants are coming through.  That does not take away from the fact that we need to be in a position where all consultants who are called consultants can be on the specialist register, which is a condition of employment since 2008.</p></speech>

One point they made, and they did not hold back, was that regardless of the pros and cons of the new oral health strategy, they were not consulted.  Does the Minister accept their position on that?

We have been waiting for a Government or HSE-approved costing for Sl&aacute;intecare for about two years.  Sl&aacute;intecare came up with its own fairly rough and ready figures to begin with.  We disagree on whether the amount allocated to date is closer to &euro;20 million or &euro;200 million.  We probably all agree that it is significantly below the Sl&aacute;intecare figures, which called for about &euro;500 million or maybe a bit more for the first year.  Does the Department, the HSE or both actually have a set of figures for implementing Sl&aacute;intecare?  I am referring to year-on-year cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#W00300"><p>I am happy that we have come back to Deputy Donnelly on this.  I know what the Deputy wants and I am happy to provide it to the Joint Committee on Health, namely, the cost of delivering the individual elements of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The reason there is no single document outlining the costs is that several parts of Sl&aacute;intecare present different options.  There are also several parts of Sl&aacute;intecare on which negotiations must take place.  For example, I refer to the de Buitl&eacute;ir report on removing private practice from public hospitals.  First there is the question of whether we should do it.  I have made my view clear, but there a cost arises whether we do it or not.  Then we must determine how to do it.  There are costs there too.</p> <p>  Moreover, a massive body of work on eligibility is ongoing.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report does not say everything should be free.  The exact phrase is "either free of charge or at a low cost".  Costs depend on where we land on the eligibility question.  There are several forks in the road which will determine the overall cost.  If it is helpful to the work of the Deputy and the committee to know what each of the elements will cost, we can certainly ask the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office to provide a note.  There need not be any secrecy around that.  I am simply making the point that there are some figures we cannot provide with absolute certainty as they will depend on policy options and negotiations. </p></speech>

However, I am hearing directly from paediatric consultants who express very real concerns.  We are in the middle of a recruitment and retention problem with consultants.  We have about half the number that we need.  We are about 40% below the average for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries.  Children were marching in Cork today or yesterday because they have been waiting for two years for a paediatric consultant specialising in diabetes.  There are a lot of issues around a lack of consultant specialties and subspecialties.  One of the concerns raised with me in the last few weeks is that in order to get the satellite clinics open, consultants and paediatricians within the three existing Dublin-based hospitals are being encouraged, some might say pressured, to move from the three Dublin children's hospitals out to the satellite clinics.  Can the Minister give an assurance that no such pressure will be applied?  I wish to make sure the service level provided within the three children's hospitals will not be disrupted or pressurised in order to get the satellites open.</p></speech>

I met Children's Health Ireland, CHI, on this recently.  To make the obvious point, outpatient clinics will be provided in the satellite centres that are being provided in the children's hospitals today.  Obviously Dr. X, who provides a service in one of the hospitals, will go out to the new outpatient centre to provide his clinics.  That movement will take place but that is not what the Deputy is talking about.  Thus far ten additional consultants have been hired for the centre at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  The Secretary General confirmed to Deputy O'Reilly earlier today that nine of them are new consultants.  One of them has come from Tallaght Hospital.  That post is now being backfilled.  My understanding is that all the nurses who need to be in position are in position.  In response to an oral question last week I said that in one or two areas, such as radiology, the clinics are working on a contingency plan or locum cover in case they cannot get a permanent post.  The HSE remains convinced that this facility will open at the end of July, which I presume means 31 July.  This year it will provide just over 6,000 more outpatient appointments than are provided by the current system.  Those ten additional consultants have been hired.  I am happy to ask CHI to send the committee a note to that effect-----</p></speech>

Of course it would be better if we were not spending on that, but that is the Government's own business and its own ideology.</p> <p>  I have a few very quick questions.  A couple of weeks ago my colleague, Deputy Funchion, filled in for me and the Minister made a commitment to give us an update on the CervicalCheck backlog.  Can he give us that update now?  What additional laboratory capacity has been sourced to clear the backlog?  Where is it, has it been quality-assured and is the Minister confident that it will make a real difference to the backlog? </p></speech>

The backlog is decreasing.  From my memory it was above 80,000.  The last figure that I saw was about 71,000.  Earlier I confirmed this in writing to Deputy Donnelly.  I will get Deputy O'Reilly a copy of that letter today.</p></speech>

I said at this committee before and I am happy to say again that I expect the backlog to continue to significantly decrease over the summer months.  We will achieve much better turnaround times.  Additional capacity has been identified by the HSE.  That capacity is with Quest Diagnostics.  It will ensure that the programme can continue to operate at 100% and will prevent the need for a pause in it.  The legal details are being finalised.  I do not know if HSE colleagues have anything further to add to that.</p></speech>

The committee had told the Department that we expected the representatives to be here but the opening statements did not indicate that there would be such a representative here.  All the information we had to go on was that we had made the request, not that the request had been acceded to.  While I have Ms Rothwell here, I have two very quick questions, if that is okay.</p> <p>  Will Ms Rothwell advise as to when she first became aware of the issue around bodies decomposing and all the issues that have been referred to in the media?  Was she aware of these issues in March when she met the consultant pathologists?  The contents of the October letter, which is now in the public domain, brings into sharp, unfortunate and regrettable focus the awful and horrific treatment of people who have died, and of their families.  When Ms Rothwell had the meeting with the consultant pathologists in March was, she aware of that?  The letter referred to the pathologists having raised the issues over a long period.  Separately, there is also a contention that senior management was not aware of it.  This lacks credibility but maybe this is me just being a bit cynical.  Will Ms Rothwell let the committee know if she was aware in March?</p></speech>

I have already apologised to the pathologists in the hospital.</p> <p>  I started in post on 14 January.  I received an email from one of the pathologists on 29 January, and I met them on 11 March.  At that stage it was flagged to me, specifically in the context of a lack of refrigeration capacity and particularly in advance of the summer.  I took action on that in the form of linking with technical services to secure additional refrigeration.  That was my knowledge of it at that time until the media controversy.</p></speech>

I am not a scientist but I certainly know what happens to a dead body if it is left out in the open without adequate refrigeration.  Would Ms Rothwell also have been aware of this, as any one of us would be?  Maybe she was aware but just did not like to think about it, which was a luxury the families did not have, unfortunately, because they had to deal with it.</p></speech>

I very quickly learned that it has been there since 1991.  I have no issue with the fact that the facility is no longer fit for purpose with regard to post mortems.  I discussed with the group the approval to go to tender for the new build for the mortuary, which was received before the end of March.</p></speech>

This is not exactly a ringing endorsement.  Nobody wants to have to go there.  Except the staff who work there and have no choice, none of us wants to have to go to that part of the hospital with regard to our loved ones.  The State pathologist is not happy with the facility.  Is Ms Rothwell confident that it is a decent and safe place to work for staff and visitors?</p></speech>

Second, we have a senior anatomical technician starting next Monday.

I am also mindful, however, that the structure was built in 1991 and, in the context of post mortems, the post mortem room is not fit for purpose.  I believe that the primary concern of the Office of the State Pathologist relates to potential contamination of evidence.  The post mortem room is not in accordance with air conditioning and air handling.  That is the specific issue for the State pathologist.</p></speech>

What degree of supervision continues and what action has been, or can be, taken to prevent a recurrence?  It was a most embarrassing and insensitive occurrence from the point of view of the relatives of persons who were in that mortuary or who had gone through it.  What is the position with the others?</p></speech>

There are also health building notes.  When that premises was built in 1991, it complied with the building notes at the time, but the building guidance has since been updated so our facility does not comply.  The building that will be on site within the next two years will comply fully with the health building notes that are available.  I have met the pathologists in the hospital and have asked them to identify anything else I can do in the interim pending the new build.  Equally, the review process will determine any required actions or improvements that we can implement pending the new build.</p></speech>

What standards apply in all the other mortuaries in the country?  Have they been examined to assess whether they are compliant with modern regulations?  Is there a system in place whereby it can be reported that a location is no longer fit for purpose?  Has any action been taken or will action be taken?</p></speech>

One is that we have a design and dignity programme with the Irish Hospice Foundation.  It is for end-of-life care, including mortuaries, so it is other facilities for families and the bereaved.  That programme has invested in 13 mortuaries over the last period of time, with 41 projects in total.  Through our estates function we have also looked at mortuaries nationally, their condition, what the investment programme is, whether there has been investment in mortuaries over time and what we think will be needed.  I suggest we get a briefing from the estates function so I can revert to the committee with its view on that, but such work has been undertaken.</p></speech>

We do not have a chain of command.  The morning after that issue became public, a message should have gone out to all posts that this had happened, what the cause was and stating what action was being taken nationally to deal with a potentially similar issue.  It is not enough to say it is being looked at now.  The HSE has either been monitoring this or it has not.  If it has not, some questions have to be asked.  The distress of relatives has been mentioned.  It is a serious issue.  It is also a serious issue of disrespect for families in a very sensitive situation.</p> <p>  I will return to my question.  I do not believe a review is necessary.  We should have a report now, and the HSE should have the report weeks after the issue arose, outlining the standard and quality of the accommodation available in all the mortuaries in the country.  There is no sense in having this issue hanging about in the background and suddenly there is an embarrassing situation and the Taoiseach and the Minister are doorstepped to deal with it.  That is not the way things should work.  There is a simple way to deal with these matters - there is either ongoing supervision and appraisal of the quality and standards of conditions applicable at the locations or there is not.  If there has to be an emergency every time we decide to improve the situation, that is unacceptable.  Has any communication gone to the various authorities to whom we might apply to ascertain whether there are similar situations pending in other areas and, if so, to what extent?</p></speech>

The estates function of the HSE, as the Deputy correctly suggests, is aware of the state of the capital infrastructure of the HSE.  There is already knowledge about that.  All I was referring to was that the estates function is not represented here today.  However, there is such an assessment so it is not the case that the HSE needs to go out to understand it.  On the wider issue of end-of-life care and the condition of mortuaries, of course there is an alertness to the issue, but that is already determined at the level of capital planning, as one might expect it to be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#Y00700"><p>What worries me is that I have heard capital planning mentioned three or four times.  This is all supposed to have been dealt with in the context of capital planning if we are doing our job.  We must have advance planning.  If we do not have it, we will not know what we are going to do, what will happen down the road, or what embarrassing situation will pop up out of the woodwork.  I am sorry to have to say this but that is not acceptable.  That is a very serious flaw in the administration of the system.  If anything else in the HSE is being dealt with in the same fashion, there will be further and more embarrassing issues arising in the future.  I make my appeal again, and I do not want the capital plan as the response.  The Waterford issue should have been dealt with in the capital plan, and presumably it was, but there was some type of glitch in the system.</p> <p>  I deal with glitches in the system every day.  I do not report them all but many of them should not occur at all if we are running business the way it should be run.  That means there should be nothing pending which is likely to present a flaw in the delivery of the services that we are expected to deliver.  Going back to 20, 30 or 40 years ago, at least we could do something about it then, and if a report was done last week, it would all be done and dealt with.  I realise there was a response to it, but there should have been a response long before this happened.  I cannot understand why that did not happen.</p></speech>

That is what I am doing.  With regard to the provision of private accommodation in the children's hospital, I do not have an ideological problem with a crossing over between the public and private sectors provided that is necessary.  If we are building a very modern hospital, the like of which has never been embarked on previously in this country, I hope nobody is suggesting that we should exclude private patients if the services in the hospital are appropriate to their needs.  Private patients pay tax as well.  That must be borne in mind.  Playing around with the situation in that area is not acceptable.  We have a serious requirement on hand to provide a modern service and a children's hospital comparable to anything available globally.  Any attempt either to segregate people or prevent them from gaining access as required is unacceptable.</p></speech>

I cannot understand how access to those eight rooms would be through one door while everyone else has to go through a different door.  We will establish the position and confirm it with the committee, but I do not want this to be taken as fact.  I believe it is probably not the case.</p></speech>

All services are accessed via the main door of the hospital.  That is the message I received from the hospital group.  I will confirm in writing to the committee the exact position, as agreed with Deputy Donnelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019052200002#Z00400"><p>I suggested that people with disabilities might be thinking that Mr. Paul Reid is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's man in the Department of Health.  Is Mr. Reid referring to the former Department when he mentions the funders of the health service having trust and confidence in the HSE and that this is a bedrock or foundation from which to progress?  My issue is that we now have a certain level of services in the disability programme.  It is clear that some people getting those services have a greater need than is now being met.  Mr. Reid mentioned a figure of 5% per annum and the criteria or scope around the service plan for this year.  Given demographics, people are going to have enhanced needs.  Some 15% of the parents of users of St. Michael's House in Dublin are aged over 70 and they have sons and daughters living in the community with them.  The same is the case all over the country.  While we are waiting for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or the funder, to have trust and confidence, there are people with needs who are practically hostages.  Their needs are increasing and they are going to be waiting until that imprimatur is given.  That issue must be fixed now and triaged.</p> <p>  I asked the Minister of State a question about the &euro;16 million deficit in the disability services programme.  After yesterday's news, has that figure increased to &euro;18 million?  That was all done in the knowledge that there are soft areas where there are deficits.  I made a statement, to which I have not received a response, that as things stand there will be a major crisis in terms of the delivery of services committed to in the service plan.  That is to say nothing of the people who are waiting.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State also mentioned that 160 people have come out of institutions.  This is not news to the Minister of State - he knows this fact well and is concerned about it - but there are 1,300 people under the age of 65 in nursing homes.  None of them should be in nursing homes populated by people over the age of 80 who are in the last two years of their lives and quite fragile.  None of these people should be in those institutions.  The HSE is putting people into these institutions while taking a couple of hundred out of other institutions.  That must be admitted.  I suggest that this is happening not because of the bag of community-based tools - I refer to personal assistants, home supports and a range of other services - that can postpone the day people have to go to these places, or indeed stop them from having to go to them in the first instance.  Recently, a 33 year old man went into a nursing home in north Dublin on the basis of having previously been admitted to hospital for a number of weeks.  While he was in hospital, the few hours of home support and personal assistance he had were swiped from under him and are no longer available.  There are crazy things going on. </p> <p>  I would like the officials to deal with those three points.  I thank the officials, and Senator Rose Conway-Walsh in particular for raising the Epilim issue.  Karen Kealy from my organisation provided support on this issue at the very start, and it is great to see other people taking it up now.  </p></speech>

The Senator has correctly stated that many people are managing in very difficult circumstances.  Some people go into placements, while we try to support other people through respite and different types of home support.  We are very conscious that we get very different responses across the sector in terms of the placements we purchase.  We are now conducting a review of all placements.  The costs of placements in the disability sector increased by 22% between 2014 and 2018.  The range of costs for placements is very wide and we are very focused on trying to provide very good quality and person-centred care and standardising placements around the country.  In different parts of the country there are different practices and different reasons for putting people into placements.</p></speech>

The review is being headed by a consultant in the west who has carried out this work in the UK with therapists.  We will review placements, consider the decision making around placements and examine how we can get the best placements for people so that their needs, which are often very complex, can be met.  That work has only kicked off very recently.  We are hoping to get a much better view of placements on its completion.  At the moment, we are often responding in emergencies.  We do not always have providers available and it can often be some time before placements are made available.  This initiative is considering all of those issues because we are conscious that there is a major need out there that we cannot meet with the resources available.  We can, however, satisfy ourselves that the resources we are currently putting into placements are providing the best approach to care for some people.  We want to look behind all of that.</p></speech>

The reality is that there are 2,200 people in congregated settings and we are trying to move 160 people out this year.  We would like to do more, of course.  Young people in nursing homes is an issue that is closely linked to the debate around personal assistance hours and home support hours.  It is also linked to the broader issue of the cost of having a disability.</p><p>I work closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the issue and we are carrying out a study at a cost of approximately &euro;300,000 to deal with the high costs for persons with a disability who must buy aids, medical equipment, drugs and so on.  The plan is that the research will be completed by the end of December, with an interim report due by the end of August.  Therefore, we are taking action on the matter which we take as the reality.  It is linked with the Senator's strong point about people living in the community.  When trying to keep people out of institutions and help them to live independently, a value for money argument must be made.  That is part of my role.  The bottom line is that for people living in nursing homes to whom the Senator referred, we must design services in their interests.  That is the direction in which we must move to ensure an inclusive Ireland, but we must also convince others that it makes economic sense for people to live independently with support in their own home.</p></speech>

We are all committed to trying to manage the matter.  There are particular pressures in the disability sector, but it is not unique in having to cope with additional demands within a finite budget.  We must be clear and establish where the money is being spent.  That process has been undertaken with Rehab to ensure it is all incurred properly and in line with what we expect.  Any effort to examine the matter will require a process, rather than a one-off approach, but the process with Rehab is continuing.  It will not simply be a meeting to decide on an outcome, rather it will have to involve a continuing commitment by both parties to work in the collective interest of clients.  It must not try to impose the problem on either party.  Instead, it must be a genuine effort to resolve issues that will involve both parties challenging each other and reaching an outcome in the best interests of clients, rather than those of either party sitting across the table from the other.</p></speech>

We went through a recession when the scalpel and filleting knife were taken to everything.  I am not against reviews, but while they are in progress, circumstances get worse for people.  How much can be learned from a review, given what I have outlined?  It could be marginal, although if it is greater, that is brilliant, but we are sliding past the fact that people are still going without services and I am concerned there is not a simple, honest acknowledgement of it.  Dr. Henry referred to self-care management, early intervention and public health.  A great deal could be done in that regard.  Many organisations work in that space, although there is no magic pill and such a change could take three, five or ten years.  Many people suffer badly every day, despite all the talk of reviews and so on.</p></speech>

There has been such an acknowledgement in the replies to the questions the Senator has asked the Department and the HSE, as there has been during this meeting..  </p> <p>  Another question concerns the cost of running the current service before unmet needs are addressed.  The HSE would be in a better position to explain, but many of the issues that have been presented to it relate to the cost of the current service before additional clients are brought in.  That is another issue that needs to be focused on.  I do not fully subscribe to the fact that just because the value for money review took place some time ago, the job has been done.  I ask the disability sector whether all of the recommendations made in the value for money review have been fully embraced and whether it has gone to the last to ensure it is as well organised as it can be in delivering current services.  There were recommendations made in the value for money review that asked questions about that such as in respect of back-office arrangements and organisational overheads.  There has been no transformation on that level.  There has been incremental change.  In fairness, some providers have made changes, but we have not moved decisively towards something that looks very different from when the recommendations were made in the value for money review.  I would not say the job has been done.  If the current cost of the service is cited, the HSE is quite entitled to ask what are the overheads that do not add value for the client and that could be met in a different and more efficient way such as by sharing services with another disability service provider or linkage with other disability service providers.  There must be a two-way conversation.  It simply cannot be the case that somebody presents a problem and somebody else solves it because that will not be possible.</p></speech>

Disability organisations, including the Disability Federation which I know quite well, have been involved under the bonnet in the implementation programme.  Ultimately, the HSE is the funder.  Since 2013, it could have driven the questions the Department is asking.  Again, I am hearing talk of insurance costs and procurement.  I sat with representatives of the HSE in 2013, as did representatives from the other umbrella organisations and groups, to discuss utility costs such as oil, heating, insurance costs and so on.  They are not new issues.  Two of us have engaged, although how well we have done so might be a more useful question to ask.  Perhaps the engagement has been episodic, but I do not accept that there has been none.</p></speech>

It does not involve a review of the Act; we would not give that to Mazars to do as it is a policy piece.  However, it does touch on more than the Act.  The terms of reference include examination of the governance arrangements, including systems, structures and processes; and the resources that support the decision-making process for pricing reimbursement applications such as the use of expert advice in the assessment process, including clinical, pharmacoeconomic, commercial, financial, procurement and legal expertise.  The review will examine the approach to securing the best value in terms to the HSE through commercial negotiations and procurement policies and procedures.  It will examine procedures for detailing agreements in written contracts.  Finally, it will examine arrangements and supports for the HSE directorate in making reimbursement decisions in line with the 2013 Act.  It is about the resources that are brought to bear on the problem, the expertise and skills that are brought to bear on it, how knowledge is brought into the dialogue between firms and the HSE, how cost effectiveness is assessed, how pricing is arrived at and, ultimately, the function of the HSE leadership to sign off on those decisions.</p></speech>

The review might also examine whether the 2013 Act directly blocks us from adopting the practices in those countries, from which we could learn.  Does that need to be changed?  Does the review include a specific mandate for improving access for patients?  Did I pick that up in what Mr. Breslin said?  I reiterate that there does need to be significant consultation with clinicians, patients and the industry for it to be effective.  It should not be an iterative process.  It should evolve and should not be a once-off review.</p></speech>

I agree with Dr. Henry about the alignment between primary care and front-line care.  Until we get proper congruence there, we are not going to have an effective system.  Indeed, it will be a waste of money because people will present at acute hospitals when they could be looked after in primary care.  A lot of it comes down to home help and decisions that are being made in that area and the criteria that are used.  Let us take, for example, an elderly woman who has broken many bones.  She has broken both her hands, her leg, her wrist, her toes and her hip.  She has suffered a shattering of her knees.  She has diabetes and is a high fall risk.  She cannot stand for any longer than ten minutes.  She is also a coeliac with an overactive thyroid, high blood pressure, anemia and severe dermatitis that gets infected regularly such that she has to be hospitalised.  She also has poor hearing and poor eyesight.  The response back from her application and its appeal is that she does not meet the criteria.  Do the witnesses not think that somebody with all of those conditions in a high-risk situation should meet the criteria for home help?</p></speech>

That is apart from those who have been approved as needing home help but cannot access it.  I am out canvassing the doors at this time and I met somebody who was born in 1929 and said, "If I could only get another 15 minutes...".  She has half an hour for four days a week.  She said 15 minutes would do the extra bits she needs.  It is not right at all.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  We are currently having to work on the basis of recycling hours and all of that.  We have an unrelenting demand for home support but certainly if the Senator wants to give me the details of the case she referenced I can certainly see.</p></speech>

It is not even about recycling hours; it is about recycling minutes.  There was a good home help system in place where people were allocated hours and home help staff were directly employed by the HSE.  They were paid properly, paid for their mileage and all of that.  Now we have home helps criss-crossing country areas to do minutes here and minutes there.  It is not a good use of anybody's time.  I would ask Mr. Reid to examine the home help system as well because it is saving thousands.  We talk about money, having to work within a budget and whatever is allocated but it is not even about that.  It is about the use of time if somebody has to spend time taking up an acute bed in a hospital.</p> <p>  I am also concerned about the out-of-hours coverage linking to primary care.  I refer to the Erris region in particular, where one doctor is responsible for the care and safety of patients.  Doctors are covering 1,000 sq. km day and night without a break from Friday to Monday.  The population and the size of the area demands a much greater number of doctors.  Doctors are going above and beyond the call of duty and they cannot access the out-of-hours service.  I believe the service there was cut from 26 to 20 weekends per year.  There has been an announcement about a new primary care centre that is to be built and expressions of interest have been invited.  Does that mean the money has been allocated for it?  What is the next step in that process?  </p></speech>

The legal process was complex and protracted, as a result of which many remained in the system and in direct provision centres for many years before their application for protection was determined.  Confined in centres designed initially to accommodate people for no more than six months and where all meaningful employment was prohibited, the residents found that the living conditions became increasingly oppressive as the waiting periods drifted from weeks to months to years.</p><p> Recent trends in the number of asylum applications and the direct provision population indicated that new fault lines are emerging in the system.  There are now approximately 6,100 people in direct provision.  Four years after the report, it is worthwhile to review the progress made in implementing the working group recommendations.  If I may, because of the limited time available, I will concentrate on big ticket items.  First, I will speak about the right to work.  Combined with the long time in direct provision centres, applicants who were denied the right to work suffered incredibly as a result.  They became deskilled, depressed and felt themselves to be useless, to say the least.  I remember one resident said, "As we wait for time, time kills us", which paints a depressing kind of a scene.  The recommendation of the working group was that those waiting for a first instance decision for more than nine months should have access to the labour market.  The Supreme Court, in May 2017, held that the blanket ban in place against working was unconstitutional and, unusually, it asked the Government to put forward its proposals to rectify the situation.  After some hesitation and toing and froing, the Government went beyond what the court required and opted into the recast reception conditions directive, something that had been advocated by some reformers for a long time.  It could be said, therefore, that the Supreme Court's intervention prompted a more generous response from the Government than that suggested in the measured proposal from the working group four years earlier.  This response was much to the advantage of the protection applicants.</p><p> Asylum applicants have the right to work after nine months.  The question remains, however, whether the right to work is fully effective, as it appears that some difficulties have arisen when residents in direct provision sought to obtain a driving licence or open a bank account.  Moreover, the opportunities to work may be restricted for residents located in remote centres.  Such obstacles should be removed if it is shown that they restrict residents' rights to access the labour market.  I visited a couple of centres in the past week.  In one centre with 57 residents, 38 of them are now working and three of that group are in further education.  Another centre, which was for women only, had 86 residents and approximately 70% were working.  In a third centre, which was for men only, approximately 70% were working.  I hasten to add that the centres were located in a tourist area where work was available.  The morale in the centres where people were working was wonderful and the right to work was very much appreciated.</p><p> The second issue was allowances.  The working group recommended that the allowances of approximately &euro;19 for adults and &euro;9 for children be doubled.  That was not done immediately but it was done in the past month.  Together with the right to work, this has made a significant difference to the morale and comfort of the residents in direct provision centres.</p><p> The third issue relates to the role of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children.  Their respective remits have been extended to cover residents in direction provision centres.  This change was sought by the residents and is having a very liberating and comforting effect because they can now make complaints without fear of retribution.</p><p> The fourth issue is cooking and independent living.  One of the big complaints we got from residents was that they could not make independent decisions about eating.  They had to go to canteens at given times and eat the food that was presented to them.  It was a big issue for families in particular who were denied the privilege of sitting down together as a family at given times and making choices and culinary preferences.  Progress has been made in this regard.  We recommended that all direct provision centres have independent living in the sense that there should be a shop where residents could purchase their food and facilities to cook it themselves.  That has been done in approximately 38% of centres.  Another approximately 1,400 residents have the right to cook but they do not have a shop and must shop elsewhere.  Some progress has been made in that respect but it is significant to note that, as yet, none of the State-owned centres has provided access to a food hall and cooking facilities under the agency's independent living model.  The State owns seven centres and none of them has provided independent cooking facilities.  I am informed by the Department that discussions with the Office of Public Works are ongoing in that regard.  There may be technical or logistical problems but it is notable that while 50% of centres have some form of cooking facilities available, the State-run centres have not provided any such facilities.</p><p> We also concentrated on accommodation standards, as it was felt that the accommodation in some of the centres was lacking.  We recommended that there be a uniform minimum standard.  I am pleased to note that in recent years national standards have been drafted and are now with the Government for final approval.  These incorporate the minimum requirements set out in the recast reception conditions directive.  That should help to promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect human rights, as defined by the public sector equality and human rights duty.  Moreover, future tendering competitions will insist that all providers demonstrate their ability to conform to these statutory obligations.</p><p> The sixth issue relates to a phenomenon that has asserted itself in this country since the report was published, namely, the shortage of accommodation generally.  The shortage of accommodation throughout the State, which was noted and considered by the working group, has become more acute since 2015.  I need not tell members that as they are dealing with it every day.  In 2018, there was a sustained increase in new applications, averaging more than 300 per month.  That has put greater pressure on the existing stock of the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, in that more protection applicants continue to live in direct provision centres while waiting for determinations.  Alternative accommodation is not readily available for those who might wish to avail of it and they cannot move out.  Those who have received positive decisions are obliged to continue to live in direct provision centres for the same reason.  At present, it is estimated there are between 700 and 800 such persons trying to transition out of direct provision but cannot do so.  Owing to the shortage of accommodation, the RIA is also obliged to provide emergency accommodation outside of the centres.  That is a costly business.  It costs in the region of &euro;99 a night per person to accommodate those who cannot be accommodated in direct provision centres.  It may be understandable that the RIA should do that to ensure protection applicants have a roof over their heads, but it is important that the lessons of the wider housing sector are learned and that this short-term fix does not become a long-term solution.</p><p>Also, in light of the high cost of emergency accommodation, one wonders in these circumstances whether it would be more economical for RIA to consider expanding its own stock by building on State-owned sites.<br/><br/>I leave until last the most important issue that was identified by the working group as a problem in the system, namely, the length of time that applicants remain in the system, and this is due to the processing.  To cut it short, the working group felt that anyone in the system for more than five years should be got rid of in that they should be dealt with expeditiously and they should be fast-tracked out of the system.  It was felt that was the humane thing to do.  Five years was fairly arbitrary and five years is a long time, but we were talking about people who were in there for six, seven, eight or nine years at that time.  We felt that five years should be set as the minimum.  We also felt that if that was not done quickly, that group of people would continue on into the new system which was introduced in 2015 in the single application process.  The single application process was agreed by the Government before we were even sitting.  This was to simplify the legal process and to reduce the three hearings to one hearing, but we warned, and the working group was strongly of the view, that unless the backlog was cleaned out, the backlog would continue to contaminate.  I do not mean to use the word &quot;contaminate&quot; in a pejorative sense but to upset the expeditious dealing with the reign that would come in.  The Government does not accept our proposal on that.  However, it did try to address the five year plus people on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and it got through 2,000 of them fairly quickly in the next two years.  However, a bulge was still left in the system which continues to go through the system today and it clogs up the administration.<br/><br/>I refer to the current administration.  In dealing with these matters, about 3,600 come in every year and we are told that it is able to process 3,900.  If only the current people coming in were being dealt with, the present system would adequately deal with them, but it is complicated by the legacy that I have spoken of coming into the system so that there is still a delay.  Nowadays there is a backlog of about 19 months before an applicant can have his or her case heard.  That is too long and the Department is working on it to try to get it down to 15 months and 12 months and it is hoping that it will do so within a year, but those are aspirations.  At present there is an 18 to 19-month delay between application and processing, so that is too long.<br/><br/>The <i>ad hoc</i>scheme for long stayers ceased with the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 in January 2017.  However, 4,000 existing cases that are still in the system were transferred into the new single procedure.  The failure to deal with this group, as the working group had recommended, hindered the success of this new single application system.  This is far too long.<br/><br/>There have been many improvements in the system since the working group has made its report.  It is not perfect but this is a changing space and this has to be monitored every year to see that the improvements are made.  It was submitted that in 2017, the working group report was the first review of the analysis of the direct provision system since it was introduced, and membership of the group included representatives from every Department involved as well as non-governmental organisations, NGOs, working in the area and a number of academics and other experienced individuals.  For the most part, the recommendations made by the working group were pragmatic and achievable, and this is not surprising given the membership of the group.  In particular, the public servants from the various Departments ensured that the political realities were well articulated when possible solutions were being debated.<br/><br/>The report provides a valuable infrastructural analysis of the direct provision system and identifies many problems and issues of concern as well as suggesting reforms in many areas.  Some of the recommendations were adopted and implemented fairly quickly while others were deferred.  Even where there has been delay, however, the report has kept the direct provision question continuously on the political agenda.  In any event, it is generally recognised that the programme of action set out in the report is still valid and is one that the Government is trying to implement.<br/><br/>Since the publication of the working group report, there have been significant improvements, including the resolution of an estimated 2,000 long stayers who are here in the system for five years, the establishment of a new international protection procedure, the introduction of communal catering in family centres for many, the extension of the role of the Ombudsman's office, the introduction of a right to work for eligible protection applicants, increased direct provision allowances, and the development of a national standard for accommodation.  While there has been considerable progress, there still remains significant work to implement the working group's recommendations fully, and it is concerned that some improvements are being unwound by the accommodation crisis.  Without doubt, the housing crisis poses the greatest practical challenge to identifying an alternative to the direct provision system where residents might be allowed to live with greater dignity.<br/><br/>It should be acknowledged, however, that four years have passed since the working group report was published and there have been significant changes at home and abroad in this area in that time.  In particular, one might mention the following in this regard: Brexit, Angela Merkel's unilateral acceptance of 800,000 migrants into Germany and the backlash that followed, the housing crisis in this country, the election of Mr. Trump in the USA, and the rise of right-wing politics in Austria, Hungary and other European countries in the east.  The last time I looked, it was estimated that there were 68 million people forcibly displaced in the world and there is no indication that a limit has been reached on this yet.  The landscape continues to change and the Irish response to asylum seekers who arrive on our shores in search of refuge and protection must also be continuously sensitive to all these geopolitical trends and developments.</p></speech>

The Immigrant Council of Ireland is an independent law centre and NGO that works to protect, support and advocate for the rights of migrants and their families in Ireland.  We provide legal information, advice and representation through information and legal services.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland legal team also specialises in holistic legal aid to victims of human trafficking, the majority of whom in our case are women recovering from sexual exploitation.  We are a leading anti-trafficking advocacy organisation in terms of our expertise in policy and advocating for legislative change in this area.  As such, the Immigrant Council of Ireland's experience of the direct provision system derives primarily from its experience in the legal representation of trafficked women who are living in that system.  Hence, this is the focus of the comments I will make to the committee today.  The overall majority of victims of human trafficking represented by the Immigrant Council of Ireland are housed in direct provision centres, and while this can be seen as a niche area within the overall direct provision landscape, there is much overlap concerning the issues involved and the solutions suggested.</p> <p>  To outline the problem briefly, the provision of safe and appropriate housing is an internationally accepted priority need for victims of human trafficking.  It is central to their recovery as independent individuals and to fulfilling their potential role as witnesses within criminal investigations.  Taking into account the gendered character of trafficking, relevant EU level directives require that the assistance to victims of trafficking should be gender sensitive and include measures which provide appropriate accommodation and aftercare support for victims of trafficking.  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, is tasked with the provision of accommodation and material assistance to all victims of human trafficking, which is in addition to its main function to house people seeking asylum in general.</p><p>Our key concern is for women, in some cases under-age girls in age determination processes, who are trafficked for sexual exploitation and referred to the national referral mechanism for the support of victims of human trafficking.  For such women, the introduction of gender-specific shelter and accommodation approaches in Ireland is of central importance.  Integrated supports such as medical, material, legal and other integration assistance are key components of such support and recovery.  It is the long-stated position of the Immigrant Council of Ireland that direct provision centres do not represent appropriate housing for victims of human trafficking.  At the same time, the national shelters and other services for domestic and sexual violence are not resourced in any way or formally involved in responding to migrant women in situations of human trafficking.</p><p> Despite the improved practices in general residential matters in the aftermath of the McMahon report from the working group, the situation of victims of trafficking in direct provision centres has not changed in any significant way.  For example, the sharing of rooms, limitations on food preparation, sexual harassment and an environment where post-traumatic stress and other mental health issues that arise from trafficking can be addressed are not catered for and responded to appropriately in direct provision centres.  The recommended single female gender hostel was set up in a location removed from any specialised complementary services for trafficked women in order for it to become a suitable alternative in these circumstances.  It is our understanding there are no victims of trafficking living in the specialised single gender centre.  There is recent evidence that Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, accommodation centres are, in cases of victims of trafficking, asking the victim of trafficking to leave the direct provision centre after 60 days, which they believe is the upper limit of their responsibility to support victims of trafficking, requiring the victims of trafficking in those cases to then present to homeless services.  We hear this from many support services with which we interact, both State and non-State, which work with victims of trafficking.  It is completely unacceptable when trying to support somebody who has been through an extremely traumatic situation.</p><p> With regard to international criticism, Ireland&rsquo;s track record in the provision of accommodation supports for victims of trafficking has been noted not just at national level but also through international bodies such as the Council of Europe committee of experts, GRETA, and the US Department of State's trafficking in persons, TIP, report, which in 2018 downgraded Ireland from tier 1 to tier 2, essentially stating Ireland was not meeting the minimum standards required to respond appropriately in this complex area.  Accommodation standards and procedures were cited by GRETA and in the TIP report.</p><p> With regard to recommendations, in the long term we advocate for alternative housing entirely removed from direct provision centres for victims of human trafficking.  However, we are aware that this transition may take time and of the current housing situation in Ireland.  For this purpose and in addition to our long-term recommendations which I will address momentarily, we have developed urgent interim recommendations to be adopted by RIA centres to meet the immediate needs of trafficking victims who are living in direct provision centres.</p><p> Urgent interim proposals include the provision of designated private, non-shared rooms for trafficked women who have been sexually abused and are recovering from significant trauma, possibly with depression, anxiety, insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Sharing a room with up to three other individuals who are passing through in many cases, while trafficking victims can stay there for a number of months, is a completely inappropriate situation for a trafficking victim to be in.  Provision of self-catering arrangements where women can cook their food, as an essential pre-condition to regaining control and independence through budgeting and exercise of choice, must be increased.  To build on what Mr. Justice McMahon said, it is fantastic that there are improvements in that area, but they are not throughout the system and need to be.  We need to see increased awareness among managers of centres of their salient role in the delivery of this most vital service to victims of serious crime who are recovering in the premises they run.  There is a need for the training of key personnel in understanding human trafficking, the obligations of the State and the specific needs of victims, with a focus on those who recover from extensive long-term trauma.  The provision of a roof over one's head and three square meals a day is not adequate care for victims of human trafficking.  There is a need for a significantly improved response in that regard.  There is a need for a commitment to gender-sensitivity in view of the serious exploitation the majority of victims of human trafficking have suffered, including sexual abuse, rape and other extremely damaging practices.</p><p> I will address long-term solutions.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland calls for gender-specific accommodation services for trafficked women who are recovering from sexual exploitation and recognition of the support needs among that group.  As an interim and immediate measure, nomination of women's refuges for women fleeing domestic violence as emergency accommodation for trafficked victims and the provision of additional resources for those refuges are essential.  This is the model of housing for trafficked women that is preferred in a number of EU member states.  It calls for significant resources for those centres to meet the immediate needs of women fleeing the situations they are in.</p><p> As middle ground, creating a shelter that specialises in dealing with trafficked women who are sexually exploited is essential.  This shelter-type facility would offer services to women who require long-term recovery services beyond emergency accommodation, including legal, trauma and health supports and counselling which are currently only sporadically available.  Ultimately, for the long-term recovery of victims of human trafficking in direct provision centres, privately rented accommodation with a geographical spread located in areas where there are options to provide wraparound legal, medical and counselling services, including major cities such as Dublin, Limerick Cork and Galway, is the gold standard to which we must work.  It would involve having a flexible number of units and a corresponding budget, in dispersed locations, to try to support the accommodation needs of victims of trafficking.  It could be done in collaboration with approved housing bodies.  We welcome the reflection of the particular needs of trafficking victims in the McMahon working group and the report and recommendations arising from it.  This is a niche area within the direct provision system.  It is internationally and nationally recognised that trafficking victims, owing to the high proportion who have been sexually abused, need an improved level of care beyond what they receive in direct provision centres.  We urge in the strongest terms that that be the priority for the State and the Government.  </p><p> I would welcome questions and thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.619" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Enda O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#F00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting me to address it on these important matters.  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is mandated by the General Assembly to lead and co-ordinate action worldwide to protect refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons.  We have had a continuous presence in Ireland since 1998 and our supervisory role regarding compliance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is recognised both in national legislation in the International Protection Act and EU legislation.<br/><br/>As the scope of the committee's work on this topic is broad, in my opening remarks I will focus primarily on the protection process and progress to date in implementing the recommendations made in the 2015 McMahon report.  It contained 173 recommendations across three broad themes: the determination process, living conditions in accommodation centres and supports for persons in the system.  The recommendations were intended to be implemented as a package, in advance of the introduction of new comprehensive legislation, to address the biggest single issue identified in the report - the length of time protection applicants had to wait for a final decision on their claim.<br/><br/>Chapter 6 of the report details the financial model which was developed in consultation with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to project the financial costs in implementing the report in full.  Paragraph 6.45 of the report states:</p><blockquote>The financial model developed by the Working Group demonstrates conclusively that investing in decision-making not only will yield returns in reducing time spent in the system but also makes financial sense.  Each year a person remains in the system gives rise to accommodation costs of &euro;10,950 on average per applicant.  The cost of decision-making is a fraction of this cost.</blockquote><p>As members of the committee will be aware, challenges still remain as regards the length of time applicants typically spend in the system.  They should have before them some recent statistics compiled by the UNHCR which point to a number of trends.  The number of new applications each month has been rising moderately and consistently for some time, with an average of 319 new applications per month in the last year or 360 per month in the last two quarters.  However, annual numbers of new applications are still far below the 2002 peak of 11,634 new applications and comparatively fewer than in many other EU countries.  There were 5,693 applications in hand at the International Protection Office, IPO, at the end of 2018.  This represents an increase on the figure of 5,183 at the end of 2017.  By contrast, when the McMahon report was being drafted at the end of 2014, there were 2,402 applications in hand.  The McMahon report, at paragraph 6.29, points to the reason for the increase: "The number of new protection applications in 2015 has outpaced the capacity of available resources to process these applications.  A failure to provide decision making bodies with the further additional resources to process these cases will result in a new backlog affecting those in the system for shorter durations".  </p><p> As a result of the failure to take steps to substantially reduce the number of cases in hand prior to the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015, transitional provisions of the Act resulted in approximately 4,000 cases being transferred to the IPO from the old tribunal, referred to as legacy applicants, on 31 Dec 2016.  Despite a considerable increase in productivity by the IPO since, the number of substantive decisions taken in 2018 remained lower than the number of new applications received, at 3,319 compared to 3,673.  The current median processing time for new applications received under the International Protection Act 2015 stands at 15 months.  Additional resources have recently been assigned to the IPO, with a view to meeting its target to reduce the average waiting time to nine months for a first instance decision by the end of 2019.  All remaining legacy applicants whose applications were considered to be live at the end of 2018 have been scheduled for interview by the IPO, with final recommendations intended to be issued in these cases by the end of quarter 2.  A separate unit within the IPO is examining non-cooperation cases such as where an applicant's whereabouts is unknown and there is an ongoing lack of contact with the office.  There are an estimated 1,200 applications in this category which are being worked on to bring them to finality as quickly as possible.</p><p> Notwithstanding these positive indications, I reiterate my concern about the length of time it takes to determine an application for international protection and recall the recommendation made in the McMahon report that the decision-making bodies be staffed on a continual basis with sufficient staff to ensure it can respond appropriately to the number of applications it is receiving at any given time.  Just as it was in 2015, the length of time protection applicants have to wait for a final decision on their claim remains the key factor affecting their experiences in the direct provision system.  Long periods spent in direct provision centres can impact on the future employability of refugees and their mental health.</p><p> I would like to make a broader point about the working group.  That process benefited enormously from unique collaboration between civil society and the Government, with members displaying commendable commitment to attend weekly meetings throughout much of the duration, despite their heavy professional responsibilities.  It was always envisaged that a new body, similar in structure, would continue this work after publication of the report.  It is regrettable, therefore, that the recommendation to this effect was not implemented, specifically that an independent advisory board be established and given the necessary flexibility to consider all matters related and relevant to the operation of the system.  An annual review of the system was also recommended, with a view to making recommendations to guard against future backlogs, for example, a failure to provide adequate resources for all decision-making bodies.</p><p> On living conditions in accommodation centres and supports for persons in the system, the committee should have been given a copy of an article written last year by one of my colleagues, Caroline Stephens, entitled, Developments in the Direct Provision System since the McMahon Report.  Members should also have before them a submission on measuring outcomes and supporting refugee integration.  Time will not allow me to specifically address the contents of these submissions in my opening address.  However, I would welcome questions members might have about them or any other matter relevant to their deliberations.</p></speech>

I hope this is the start of a valuable process that will allow us to consider where there have been failings and how we can map a better system.  I would like to think - I think many other members of the committee agree - that in the long run there will be a radically transformed system.  There have been significant failings in the direct provision system and the way we have treated people who are fleeing war and persecution.  In many instances, their human rights have been failed significantly and many have suffered great hardship, some caused, as identified in all of the statements, by the delay and inordinate amount of time they have spent in the system.  There have been other failings too.</p> <p>  The IPO is still processing more or less the same number of applications, or even slightly fewer than the number coming in.  Is the solution simply the provision of resources?  Are there not enough staff in the IPO to deal adequately not only with the backlog but also with the number of applicants?</p> <p>  Is there any sense that the private model we have chosen is flawed?  I appreciate that this is the justice committee, but in many respects these are accommodation and housing issues and asylum seekers who in the long run will become long-term residents or Irish citizens will eventually have to be housed.  Would it not be better to provide accommodation for people quickly, whether through voluntary housing agencies, the local authorities or direct build?  The Immigrant Council of Ireland touched on this issue.  The most significant element of people's criticism and concern about the direct provision system is its significant human rights failings, although it has cost over &euro;1.25 billion since 2001.  For a parent and two children, the cost is &euro;40,000 per annum, which is more expensive than many other forms of housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.623" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#G00400"><p>On the processing of applications, there is room for possible improvement, but it does seem that the authorities are coping with new applicants.</p><p>They are roughly dealing with 3,900 a year, and 3,600 are coming in this year.  The present system would be fine if we did not have what we call the inherited problem from the old system.  There are a couple of pinch points.  I think extra resources have been put in to the International Protection Office, IPO, and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT.  One area where there is a delaying factor is judicial review.  I draw attention to that in my paper.  There should probably be more judges dealing with judicial review, where delays hold up the applications in an area where the Government has no control.  If more judges were dedicated for a period of time, we might make some progress there.</p><p> With regard to systems other than direct provision, the Deputy is absolutely correct that the working group had its remit confined to improvements in direct provision.  We were not asked to look at other models.  I am not an expert in alternative models around the world.  I have investigated and have attended seminars where discussions were taking place in respect of Scotland, Portugal and other countries.  I would have to be convinced that other models would succeed better in our economy with the accommodation crisis we have now.  If we do not keep people together, we have to put them into other areas.  The accommodation issue is a serious limitation on what a Government can do in terms of alternative models.  I would have to be convinced that another model could work in our given situation with the accommodation crisis, and that it would be cheaper.  I do not know that it would.  I have not seen it.  Work would have to be done to convince me that we would be better off shifting to something else in these difficult times in accommodation in this country.  That is my personal view.  I am not an expert and there may be models out there.  Someone might do excellent research to show the Government.</p><p> Given the improvements that have been brought about in the past four years, as I have mentioned, it is in no way as bad as it was.  One of my suggestions is that the State is probably in a better position than anyone to provide more accommodation.  They could build them themselves, if they need to, on State-owned land rather than going out to the market and competing in a difficult accommodation situation.  That is only a suggestion.  I would need research.</p></speech>

It is a peculiarity in Ireland that we have non-concurrence, meaning that one cannot be an asylum applicant and be identified as a victim of trafficking at the same time.  This is unusual in the international context.  Somebody who is in the asylum process may be a victim of trafficking but cannot be identified as such.  Someone who is a victim of trafficking living within direct provision cannot apply for asylum.  They cannot be both things.  This is an important point to make.</p></speech>

It will depend on how the person has come into the system.  A person may have lodged an application for international protection, may subsequently have been referred into the national referral mechanism and been provided with advices, and may then seek to be recognised as a victim of trafficking.  At that point, they are faced with a decision as to which system may suit them better.  In either event, they will still be accommodated in direct provision.  As Mr. Killoran was saying, our focus is on the victims of trafficking who are being housed in direct provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Killoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#H00700"><p>In terms of the process of identification, in the cases that come to the Immigrant Council of Ireland, identification can often take up to two years.  As a law centre, we sometimes take judicial review cases in respect of this complicated and long processing time for being identified as a victim of trafficking, which involves civil authorities, the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, and the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  The process often breaks down in that time.  A much clearer identification process for victims of trafficking that does not involve so many different bodies is needed.  This would allow for the quick identification of a victim of trafficking.  If somebody gets to the stage of getting a temporary residence permit, once they are identified as a victim of trafficking, they get a stamp 4, which is a residency status in the State that allows access to support services.  That is taking a long time to happen but should it happen, that person could in theory then leave direct provision and live independently as they would be able to be supported.</p> <p>  In our cases, then, it is a question of a mix of resources but also a clearer identification process for victims of trafficking who are living in that system.  I speak primarily to our area of expertise but internationally there are many models for housing victims of trafficking which take a gender-based violence approach.  They rely upon women's refuges and other support services to provide accommodation, both in an emergency capacity at the initial instance of somebody being identified and in the long term through the model of approved housing bodies or voluntary housing associations, which rent private accommodation and house victims of trafficking.  That is difficult to do in the current context here regarding housing.  The housing bodies themselves are in difficult circumstances.  The refuges are oversubscribed as it is.  It would take additional resources for this to be a realised model of accommodation for supporting victims of trafficking coming from situations of sexual exploitation.  However, that needs to be the goal to which we work and the guiding light by which we aim our approaches.  As I said in my opening remarks, the housing of victims of trafficking within direct provision systems often adds to the trauma and continued difficulty of their recovering from the situation they have just come out of.

It is difficult for external parties to say more than that but when we drafted the McMahon report, we tried to be proactive rather than reactive in planning for the future.  The financial model developed for that report projected new applications for last year as slightly higher than the number that came in.  The number of new applicants was predictable and could have been planned for.  The report recommended front-loading of resources to put the priority on processing rather than reception and it projected that this would result in savings of &euro;25.7 million in 2018 and &euro;51.9 million in 2019.  However, the situation in which we find ourselves now is that &euro;3.4 million has been spent on emergency accommodation this year alone because of insufficient reception capacity.</p> <p>  Moving on to the Deputy's second question, without talking about a completely different model, it is important to acknowledge that the system as it stands today is quite different from the one 20 years ago, in many ways because of the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  I would like to flag the fact that it has been put on a statutory basis through the reception conditions directive, which includes the right to work.  Draft standards have also been agreed with officials of the Department of Justice and Equality.  It just remains for the Government to sign them off and for them to be implemented.</p><p>We have done an awful lot to ensure that minimum standards have been defined in law and set out in standards to be applied when providing accommodation.</p><p> The next logical step is to review the operations and the tendering process to see how those standards can be put into practice and how uniformity can be guaranteed throughout the system.  Officials appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last month and flagged that the original tendering process will happen this year.  I recommend that the Department take an open approach in consulting all relevant parties and that much effort be put into ensuring it is truly fit for purpose and flexible enough to allow for alternative models.  If the standards are clearly defined, there is no reason that smaller accommodation units, clustered in a region, for example, could not be part of the solution.  In the paper on measuring outcomes and supporting refugee integration that was circulated among members, I have tried to set out that much Government policy already exists and can be implemented in this space.  One of the main challenges is that while the RIA is responsible for procuring accommodation, it is not an agency and it is does not do integration.  It is limited in its role and dependent on the Departments of Health and of Education and Skills and other agencies and service providers to link with it and provide those services for accommodation centres.  Sufficient authority is needed to ensure co-ordination and to link with all the other Departments.</p></speech>

I take on board the point that the housing crisis is doubtless a significant consideration.  It affects every sphere of life, including those who have received their papers and are in a position to apply for local authority housing, secure HAP and so on.  There is nowhere else for those people to go at this time.  The work will be important if we do it right.  We need to take a view that looks to the future, beyond when the housing crisis has abated, which I hope it will do.  We need to aim for the best possible system.  Improvements may have been made to direct provision such as in respect of self-catering and the right to work, which is important.  Nevertheless, not only asylum seekers but also the public have lost confidence in the system.  The public consider direct provision a dirty term.  People feel ashamed and embarrassed about it.  While they may have different views of the reality of direct provision, that is the perception in society.  There is a feeling that people's human rights have been, and are being, frequently breached.  If we are to map out a report, therefore, we have an obligation not simply to consider incremental changes but to map out the best system that Ireland can deliver to receive people fleeing war, conflict and destitution, and to ensure that we treat them with the dignity they deserve.  Although it may be an ambitious objective, we should pursue it.</p> <p>  A point was made about the location of direct provision centres.  Asylum seekers have many appointments, generally in Dublin.  It was recently noted that it takes ten hours to travel from Moville to Dublin and involves travelling through the Six Counties, which is not permitted, strictly speaking.  It is possible to complete the journey from Lisdoonvarna in one day but one will have only a short period in Dublin.  Travelling from Kenmare is likely to require an overnight trip, while Mount Trenchard does not have access to a public bus.  Not all direct provision centres should be located in Dublin but a balance must be struck in that as much as possible, the services that people require in Dublin should be brought to where they reside.  Surely the centres should be located in places that are reasonably easy to access by public transport.  It is a fair expectation.</p> <p>  Another point was made that people leaving direct provision centres often either find their own accommodation or stay with friends and then find themselves homeless and seek readmission to direct provision centres that are not in a position to grant readmission.  That problem was identified by the immigrant council.  It has been said the matter is probably contrary to the recast directive.</p> <p>  Does Mr. O'Neill consider it possible to predict trends in the coming years?  Does he expect Brexit, with or without a deal, to have a significant impact on the number of people seeking asylum in Ireland?</p> <p>  I thank our guests for appearing before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.635" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Enda O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#J00400"><p>On the location of reception centres, I fully agree that transport is essential to allow people to go to the shops in a local town or access the services they need.  One measure that was introduced by the reception conditions is a vulnerability assessment.  While that is a new process and we will have to see how it will work out in practice, it has been incorporated into the standards.  The intention is that upon arrival, people will be assessed for their reception needs, which will include access to medical services, counselling services and so on.  On an ongoing basis, someone from a social care background in each reception centre will be tasked with ensuring that assessment is up to date and that no new needs have been identified.  One can imagine that system working well if it was developed in co-operation with other service providers and Departments, along the lines indicated by Mr. Justice McMahon, namely, access to employment and mental health services, including specialist counselling services and others of a similar nature.  That is not currently happening in any systematic way but it is provided for in the legislation and included in the standards, and we hope it will become an important part of the system in the future.</p> <p>  With dispersal, interviews with asylum applicants could be relocated throughout the country.  Not all the services must be centred in Dublin.  We have had some recent indications that asylum applicants could be interviewed in County Tipperary, and Cork is also under consideration.  There are ways, therefore, to ease the burden on people living in those locations.  In the resettlement domain, a task force at national level has representatives from each Department, while there is an interagency group at local authority level.  In 2015, there was an agreement on dispersal throughout the country and the numbers that each local authority area could expect.  The same process is not replicated in this space.  I do not see any reason, however, that those types of structures could not be put on a more permanent footing and include resettled refugees and refugees who arrive spontaneously, in order that there is appropriate planning at local authority level and cross-departmentally to ensure that people have access to adequate services, irrespective of where they are located.</p> <p>  On predicting the numbers, we in Ireland are quite fortunate from that point of view.  We are not so easy to reach compared with other European countries and we are at the end of the line of many migratory routes.</p><p>The numbers have been fairly steady in recent years.</p><p> On Brexit, we sometimes see movement from the UK.  It is something which is harder to predict.  The Dublin regulation is the law which regulates which country has responsibility for the determination of an applicant's claim.  It is EU legislation and what happens to that after Brexit may have a big impact.  We do not have a clear answer on that now.</p></speech>

The location of centres is a very important factor.  It is important for the availability of work but also for the equality agenda.  Were one to be placed in north Cork or west Mayo, that might make it much more difficult for a person to be gainfully employed in work than in some place near a centre of tourism or an urban centre.  That is a fact of life.  It did not make the same impact when the right to work was denied to everyone, but now that it is available, proximity to work is important.  It should be remembered that there is currently full employment in the State.  This morning I heard on the radio that unemployment is down to 4.6%, which economists classify as full employment.  There is no shortage of jobs in the economy.  Rather it is where they are.  I also agree that location is very difficult for people when they must visit Dublin for meetings.  We have heard stories of single mothers, for instance, who had to travel to Dublin to do an interview and so had to take the children out of school on that day and travel up on public transport on very limited resources to do so.  I agree with the Deputy and with Mr. O'Neill that more interviews should be done locally in these cases.</p> <p>  As for predictions, who knows?  I drew attention to the cases that have occurred in the world in the four years since 2015.  Having said that, the figures we predicted for this year were an overshoot.  We predicted that more people would come here than did so this year.  We should get over the idea that everyone who was dislocated, the 68 million people in the world, want to come to Ireland.  It might be a last resort for them, or it might be a first resort.</p> <p>  The view of the Irish public of direct provision is as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire stated it.  It needs to change now.  Four years since the report, people ought to review the system.  There will still be people against direct provision as a model but it is not as bad as it was and it is a good deal better than it was, and that should be said.  What is the alternative?  To quote the politicians, we are where we are.  If the Deputy can get me a better model at the same money, I will certainly approve of it. </p></speech>

Perhaps half of the victims who have been identified are in direct provision.  The location of support services for these people is a significant issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Justice McMahon referred to the annual monitoring of asylum and migration trends generally.  It may be a generalisation but largely true that Ireland has largely reacted to migration over the past 15 to 20 years, but we must get to the stage of planning and investing for it.  Questions may arise such as what is the next conflict outside European borders that may put pressure on Europe in terms of accepting asylum applications, and there are other questions such as Brexit.  We need not to be surprised by issues such as these when they arise and have mechanisms in place to allow us to plan and invest appropriately in our migration and integration systems so that we can respond to these things and be prepared instead of just reacting.  Notwithstanding the improvements that have been made, we need to get off the back foot and begin planning and investing for migration, unlike our current approach.</p></speech>

There is a third strand to Ireland's response to victims of trafficking which has been addressed at national and international level, namely, an independent rapporteur for trafficking.  We have called for that, as has GRETA, the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and other expert agencies.  This would be similar to the children's rapporteur and would have an overview of how the State was responding to victims of trafficking in general.  That is one approach.  Taking into account that there are victims of trafficking in direct provision, that kind of oversight is necessary.  It might also feed into the findings of a rapporteur who was monitoring trafficking on an ongoing basis.  That is essential.</p></speech>

That is probably true.  Many people compare direct provision centres with mother and baby homes where women were involuntarily incarcerated many years ago.  Does Mr. Justice McMahon agree that it is important that the public is given an accurate assessment and presentation of what these centres involve and that there is an accurate assessment that the numbers of people seeking asylum in Ireland are very low by European standards?</p></speech>

I do not know of anyone consciously trying to distort the situation.  The McMahon working group, under my chairmanship, was very independent and truthful in what we saw, and we reported it as we saw it.  Since then, all those who have participated in the system, and certainly the NGOs and individuals involved, have been very honest and open, as I have always tried to be.  It is like anything.  When one gives a dog a bad name, it will stick to it for a long time until the impression is reversed.  It takes much longer to reverse a bad impression than to create a bad impression to begin with.  The message needs to go out that the direct provision that was in place four or five years ago is not the same as the direct provision that is there now.  It is not as bad.</p></speech>

I was listening to Mr. Justice McMahon in my office.  I will be as brief as I can as I have a couple of questions, which I will direct to Mr. Justice McMahon in order that I do not drag out other people's time.  Mr. Justice McMahon said improvements have been made, things are better now and the numbers coming in on a yearly basis are being handled but that the backlog is a challenge.  What does he think of the idea of introducing an amnesty for anybody who has been in the system for more than five years?</p> <p>  Are vulnerability tests being carried out in any of the centres as a matter of course?  If so, do they happen within the first 30 days, as required by Article 22 of the reception conditions directive?  Is there provision for ongoing vulnerability assessment as per the regulations?</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, told us that combined, the fully implemented, in progress or partially implemented recommendations make up 98% of the total recommendations contained in the McMahon report.  A year ago Nasc disputed this claim, stating that at best 51% of the recommendations were in progress or partially implemented.  What is the status of the implementation of the recommendations at present?</p> <p>  There are rising numbers in emergency direct provision where the conditions are even less attractive than in the regular form.  Does Mr. Justice McMahon have serious concerns about this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.659" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#L00400"><p>I will try to answer as quickly as I can.  Starting with the final question, emergency accommodation is not desirable.  It is costly and unsuitable and should be addressed as quickly as possible.  No one should be in emergency accommodation.  It costs &euro;99 a night.  If we do the maths for 500 people in accommodation at present, the cost is huge.  We know the cost of keeping a person in direct provision is &euro;10,900 a year whereas emergency accommodation costs &euro;99 a night.  That should be a priority.  Emergency accommodation must be resorted to in extreme cases for short periods but it should not be part of the solution.  I suggest that in this situation, given the housing crisis we have, the only way to address it might be for the State to build its own direct provision centres to house people.  In those circumstances, emergency accommodation would not be needed.<br/><br/>The other problem on this front is that properties that were available, such as disused hotels and secondary schools, may no longer be available to the State for direct provision centres because they are probably becoming commercially viable again.  The builders, developers and hoteliers - Deputy Wallace would know more about this - might state that the economy is now such that they can make a go of these properties commercially.  There may not be that many of them available.  In these circumstances, the State should consider whether it should build.  Father McVerry, the Jesuits and others have a pilot scheme to try to get people out of direct provision.  This has been successful but the numbers involved are very small.  I am totally against emergency accommodation.  It is unsuitable and costly and is a last resort.<br/><br/>With regard to an amnesty for those who have been in the system for more than five years, we tried very much in our discussions to introduce something that was like an amnesty but we did not dare call it an amnesty.  The politicians could not live with the word &quot;amnesty&quot; because it is not a prospect that would go down well with the public.  To some extent, the word is taboo in the discussion because it will not fly.  The administrators tried to do it in another way on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  We cannot say we will give an amnesty to 4,000 people.  The administrators stated they would prioritise cases by examining them quickly and being a bit more lenient or benign if people had been in the system for five years.  It had to be done without using the word &quot;amnesty&quot;.  There is no doubt that people in the system for five years or more deserve compassion and quick treatment.<br/><br/>The Deputy also asked about assessment in the Balseskin centre.  This is another result of the accommodation crisis.  Balseskin is the location for the initial reception process.  It is the first place applicants go when they reach this country.  They are medically assessed and legally informed and come into contact with the system.  My understanding is that in recent times Balseskin has not been able to take all of the applicants so they are put into emergency accommodation before or during the assessment period.  This is unfortunate and should not be allowed.  The Department is taking some steps in this regard to expand Balseskin so it will accommodate everyone and enable people to have initial training and an initial legal and medical assessment.  This is very important.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked about a statistic that was thrown out that 98% of all recommendations were implemented.  I do not believe it.  I cannot say the figure is 90%, 85% or 50%.  I do not know.  Many of the recommendations have been implemented, including some of the important ones.  The figure of 98% has been disputed by some of the NGOs.  With regard to cooking facilities, the Department states 38% of people have cooking facilities, which means 62% do not have cooking facilities for independent living.  I will not challenge a statistic such as the one the Deputy mentioned.  It is too general and I do not have enough specific information.  I might be able to respond to a more specific statistic but I will give the Deputy this for what it is worth.  Some of the NGOs did not agree with the general statement that 98% of the recommendations had been implemented.</p></speech>

Anecdotally we know it is being done in some cases.  It is being done on request.  There have certainly been some positive developments on this of late but it is a new process.  Often, when we ask the Department of Justice and Equality, it tells us it is in ongoing discussions with the HSE.  The process is under development but I cannot say with any authority the extent to which such a test is done in every case.  Mr. Justice McMahon alluded to the fact that not everyone was able to go through Balseskin registration centre where there are certainly some good medical assessment facilities.  If people cannot go through Balseskin in the first instance, they cannot access those facilities.  A measure we have been trying to employ to counter this is Safetynet's mobile health screening.  This has been a very useful service for people who have been able to access it.  Plenty of work is happening but the situation is still evolving.</p></speech>

I am really glad to hear Mr. Justice McMahon say the situation has improved over the past five years but I still find it very depressing, very sad and heartbreaking.</p><p> The first question I will ask Mr. Justice McMahon is about the right to work.  This has been highlighted by direct provision residents and campaigners for decades and by the working group in 2015.  We saw the Supreme Court decision in 2017, which I strongly welcomed and which effectively forced the State into some action, but I do not believe it is nearly enough.  Residents raise issues of access to bank accounts, driving licences and the fact that the remote locations of many centres make it impossible to find work.  Residents are still prohibited from many unprotected industries and jobs with certain pay.  Estimates show that only some of the residents are working, as Mr. Justice McMahon mentioned.  Because of this, it seems there is now a limited legal right to work but not an effective right to work.  Does Mr. Justice McMahon agree?  Is there a positive obligation on the State to actively ensure the right to work is accessible?  I would like to know Mr. Justice McMahon's thinking on this.</p><p> I wish to ask Mr. O'Neill a little about the lack of common quality standards in the centres.  We have touched on the cooking facilities and the ability to prepare a meal for oneself and one's children.  This is so important.  It is just a matter of basic dignity and respect.  Those who cannot cook are infantilised and denied the chance to make basic decisions as to what they will eat and when.  Does Mr. O'Neill agree that there should be a consistent set of standards across every centre?  Does he think these opportunities and rights should be afforded to every applicant equally?  Could he elaborate a little more on the standards being worked on at present?</p><p> I have a few more questions, if that is okay.</p></speech>

I call Mr. Justice McMahon first, as the Senator's first question was directed at him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#M00300"><p>I agree with Senator Black that we should ask the question as to whether, just because people have the right to work, it is an effective right to work.  I adverted to this in my paper.  There are a few things I have come across in this regard.  First is opening a bank account, which one would imagine is a simple thing.  However, local bankers seem to turn their faces against anyone from a direct provision centre.  They do not seem willing to accept the addresses to open bank accounts.  I know there is anecdotal evidence that people have tried to do so and failed.  I also have anecdotal evidence to the contrary, that in some cases bank managers are a little more human and humane and that if a sponsor goes in with the resident, he or she may succeed in having a bank account opened.  I have raised this myself with the Minister as something that should be addressed centrally.  I do not see why the Minister or someone at his level cannot talk to the banks about this generally.  We are talking about 3,000 people.  It is not a huge number.  If there are some controls to be put in because of bank laundering and fears of that, I am sure they could be agreed with the direct provision people.  I agree with the Senator that this is a big issue.  A prospective employer who sees any obstacle at all will use it to turn an applicant away.  If there are 100 people on his or her payroll and they are all paid by bank draft or bank transaction on a Friday evening and if a resident, male or female, comes in and says he or she is in direct provision and does not have a bank account and asks to be paid in cash, the employer will say "No" just because it is difficult and an additional obstacle.  The employer will ask why he or she should get involved.  Similarly, driving licences should also be tackled centrally.  There is no reason in the world that this should be any different for people in direct provision.  I know that some of them are driving, so they must get away with it.  I do not know fully what the position is but I do know anecdotally that they have difficulty getting driving licences.  How is someone living in Millstreet or Portlaoise who gets a job in Tralee, Listowel or Limerick to get there?  It is an ineffective right.  These two examples should be addressed and simply resolved.  I am not telling tales out of school but I know that the Minister for Justice and Equality has spoken to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on these issues, so the matter is being kept alive.</p> <p>  I have addressed the issue of the locations of the centres already.  The locations of some of them militate against getting a job.  They can be six or eight miles out into the country and away from a town, and the transport is limited in some of these areas.  I know centres which are served by a bus only once a day.  The bus drops the kids at the school and comes home after collecting them, and there is no other transport in and out unless one has a bicycle or something.  I therefore suggest to the authorities when they are picking a new location, if they have a choice of picking one near an urban centre or an area where work is available, that they consider those areas in making their choice and put them into their procurement process.</p></speech>

Questions such as the implementation of the right to work can sometimes become politicised and the debate can be quite polarised and anecdotally based.  I referred to the Department of Justice and Equality's culture and values charter, which states that it approaches policy development in a spirit of openness and consultation with all relevant stakeholders, employing evidence-based policy methodologies.  This is also in the Department's strategy statement.  That is what we did in the McMahon report, in the working group.  We were given the information and the evidence in order to be able to make well-informed decisions, to speak with all the relevant Departments and to frame policy in that environment.  I am not sure I can say the same thing is happening on an ongoing basis.  This is one example of an area where we should always conduct reviews and see whether it is effective and whether more can be done.  I will give one positive example, which is the open doors initiative.  A number of Government Departments and the private sector are collaborating on this, and we and a number of NGOs are supporting partners.  We helped contribute recently to a support tool for employers in order that they can better understand the permissions and how they can go about employing people from various backgrounds, including migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and persons with disabilities.  We need to encourage such constructive spaces where we can all play a role in trying to find solutions rather than throwing figures around that we are not sure of or finding criticism when we can perhaps find solutions.</p> <p>  To respond to the Senator's second point about the standards, there was a meeting last week with officials from the Department of Justice and Equality at which the final text was agreed.  There was a public consultation, and I credit the Department as the initiative it took to this was very positive.  We and many of the NGOs concerned and officials from the Department went to the various centres, met residents and discussed the standards with them.  I understand that the final step is for the Minister to sign off on the text.  I expect this to happen promptly.  These standards have already influenced the contractual basis of some of the current arrangements with direct provision centres.  The best way to understand the standards is that they translate the recommendations of McMahon into easy-to-understand binding standards that will apply universally to reception centres.  There is certainly a potential issue with the divergence in standards across the system.  Even within centres there can be a complete divergence of standards between the rooms for families and those for single males, for example.  With these standards there will be uniform treatment.  Of course, in order to ensure they are applied in practice, an independent inspectorate is required.  That will form the basis of contractual obligations with any provider services.  It is crucial that an independent inspectorate is given all necessary authority to go into centres unannounced and all the powers necessary to be able to say with authority that the standards are in fact being implemented in practice.</p></speech>

In 2018, the State paid &euro;72 million to private firms operating direction provision centres.  Many of these operators are offshore companies, which means there is secrecy and a lack of information as to how much profit they are making.  It is incredible that private companies are allowed to profit off extremely vulnerable people.  It is very upsetting.  When the profit motive is introduced, the concern becomes achieving a lower bottom line rather than the welfare of the people involved.  If the State is responsible for the welfare of residents, should it be outsourcing that function to private companies?</p> <p>  What is the witnesses' view on the likelihood of legal action against the State?  The special rapporteur on child protection has described the system of direct provision as State sanctioned child poverty.  Asylum seekers have talked about the misery endured by them in the centres and how their humanity was slowly taken away and their fundamental rights ignored.  Two weeks ago, I spoke at an event marking ten years since the Ryan report into the abuse inflicted on people in industrial schools.  Is there potential for the residents of these centres to take further court cases now or in the future seeking a State apology and redress scheme?  Could a claim be made that basic constitutional rights or rights outlined in international human rights instruments are being violated?</p> <p>  Mr. Justice McMahon's comments on the victims of trafficking are extremely upsetting.  It is shocking to hear that there are no services in place for those who went through such horrendous experiences and are effectively being left in a state of post-traumatic stress.  I find it difficult even to listen to commentary about it.  What would the witnesses like to see done in this area?  Can they provide clarity as to why people are asked to leave after 60 days?</p></speech>

Once the State makes the decision not to be directly responsible for provision and engages outside commercial bodies to provide the premises and run the centres, there is then the problem that the operators have to be paid.  There should always be transparency as to financial transactions in these matters.  I do not know how accurate it is to say that very little is known in this regard.  I understand the figures are available in general but I am not privy to any information about profits.  There is a certain amount of confidentiality in these transactions.  I am not sure there is the degree of secrecy to which the Senator alluded but once the job is outsourced, it is inevitable that a commercial deal must be done.  Private operators will not take on the job unless they are getting a reasonable profit out of it, although there is a question as to what is reasonable and not reasonable.  The Senator is suggesting that these operators are exploiting the opportunity.  That is a value judgment and I do not know whether it is correct.  There are a lot of people looking into the matter and I suspect the level of profit-making is less than people might think.  However, it is relevant to ask whether we are getting the best value for money under the existing system or if we would be better off were the State to be directly involved in provision.  In the context of the accommodation crisis we are experiencing, I have suggested that it might be time for the State to provide more centres because the likelihood of getting commercial premises is shrinking.  That is the route we might have to go and it would offer the benefit, one hopes, of ensuring better control on the part of the State.  It should at least allow us to ensure the job is done transparently.</p> <p>  I have no opinion as to the likelihood of legal action.  I am a retired High Court judge and have ceased to think like a lawyer.  I certainly am not giving advice in this matter.  The courts are always open to individuals in this country, as we have seen in respect of the right to work.  Individuals may always plead their case as far as the Supreme Court and obtain a judgment.  I cannot say whether an argument could be mounted similar to that which was made in respect of residential institutions.  From that point of view, however, the improvements must be welcomed.</p></speech>

When one visits a reception centre, one will often find a range of services available on site provided by, for example, the Health Service Executive or a non-governmental organisation.  In fact, the centres rely hugely on other service providers and various Departments, and it is important that the latter are accountable for their areas of responsibility.  That is actually set down in law under the public sector duty as set out in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  The centres are obligated, in accordance with guidance issued by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, to plan for and report on how they are implementing that duty.  In practice, not enough is done to hold different Departments and providers to account for their provision of services and to ensure there is sufficient co-ordination in place such that when a new centre is proposed to be opened, all of the required services are in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Killoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#N00500"><p>Regarding victims of trafficking, it is not entirely the case that no supports are available.  Through the national referral mechanism for identifying victims and what happens to them thereafter, there is a model whereby access to health and support services can be activated.  What we see in reality, however, is that there are huge inconsistencies in how that is done.  Sometimes it does happen as it should and I do not wish to disparage any of the services in this regard, especially those connected to the HSE.  However, because the identification process is so complex, with some cases taking up to two years before a person is identified as having been trafficked, we see inconsistencies and a breakdown in the process.  One of the significant difficulties relates to the level of training provided to staff and managers in direct provision centres and RIA centres on the specific needs of these very vulnerable individuals.  Staff and managers often have no idea of the particular circumstances of the person they are dealing with and, therefore, he or she may fall through the cracks in the system rather than having his or her particular needs met.  The  model is there to be applied but our finding is that it gets undermined by the identification process and the inconsistencies arising out of it.</p> <p>  Victims of trafficking are a particularly vulnerable category of persons and there is also a gendered aspect to the issues they face.  For example, being housed in mixed-sex hostels in a room with up to four people may compound the trauma they have experienced.  It is important to acknowledge that there are many key civil servants in the Department of Justice and Equality who recognise this problem.</p><p>It is not the case that there is a blanket denial of this from the Department or, indeed, from some of the politicians involved either.  We are in this repetitive institutional context, however, where we are stuck with the approach we have.  There is a recognition that we need to provide this ameliorated level of care.  We are obligated to do so by the directives into which we have opted, by some of the pressure we are under from international instruments and, not least, from the experiences of the victims of trafficking who are in the system.  Progress is being made but it is incredibly and grindingly slow, unfortunately.</p></speech>

There are a number of stages in the response to a victim of trafficking.  The first stage is called a "recovery and reflection" period, which is essentially that when someone is identified as a suspected victim of trafficking, he or she gets 60 days in which to recover initially from the situation from which he or she has just emerged.  As one can imagine, someone who has been exploited in the sex industry is dealing with immediate trauma and often with immediate physical and psychological effects of his or her circumstances.  That can lead to a temporary residency permit, which is a six-month permission.  The 60-day period is the first part.  We hear anecdotally from different services that some of the RIA centres are interpreting their obligations as relating just to that 60-day period and taking the view that once that 60-day period is up, the centre no longer has an obligation to the person.  Such centres are writing people letters to request them to leave and those people are then going to the support services to ask what they should do.  The support services are then going to homelessness services with such a person to ask whether a bed is available that night.  While there is no research that can identify this, that is what we are hearing from the services and we have seen it ourselves.  It is completely unacceptable for someone who has just come from a very traumatic situation.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending and presenting such comprehensive documents to us.  I refer to Senator Black's point about the effective right to work and the mismatch between the apparent right and the effective right.  Do any of the witnesses have real-time information on what is happening in that regard?  Are people getting jobs?  Are there examples that can be given?  How effective is the right?</p> <p>  How specific are the service-level agreements between private contractors and the State in respect of trying to improve the threshold of intervention regarding health, proper accommodation and so on?  How effective is the oversight mechanism involved?  Mention was made of national standards for accommodation and the introduction of an inspectorate to oversee them.  Who would run that?  How effective might it be?  This committee in particular but others too have dealings with lots of siloed inspectorates and oversight mechanisms which are accountable to different bodies.  Does it come back to the original point of having one unified body or agency to deal with this in a more holistic way?</p> <p>  I refer also to the healthcare issue, including mental health for people coming from war-torn countries.  In my area in west Dublin, we have a lot of people who have gone through the process and who are now out the other side.  The problem is that it does not end there, as the witnesses know, as to the healthcare deficit and housing issues.  In terms of the afterpiece, do we need to oblige local authorities to be involved to a greater extent or even to improve the legal threshold with regard to healthcare rights for people who come out of direct provision and who are potentially accommodated?  How do we continually provide a rounded intervention for them as they progress through society?  In Canada, for example, that is done in a positive way at an early stage and they see the positive effect it has for their society.  In Ireland, however, we are forever playing a game of catch-up which means the person in difficulty is never given a chance.  That is what we must all seek to deal with.

The Deputy's point about local authorities is an interesting one.  We do a lot of work with local authorities nationally on integration strategies.  It is standard practice at European level and everywhere else that local government areas need a strategy through which to identify a framework, indicators, goals and funding for how they will co-ordinate services and engage them with health and other services, the private sector, NGOs, support organisations and community groups.  It is quite a big thing but it can be quite fluffy.  While integration strategies often focus on positive integration initiatives and community events, which are brilliant, a lot of this is about the nitty gritty of how one absorbs someone coming into the community, including someone who has spent five years in a direct provision centre which is a form of institutional living.  We work very closely with some of the local authorities and urge them to build in any direct provision centre in their area as a strand of the local integration strategy in how they respond.  While someone who comes from a direct provision situation may not decide to remain in the local community near the centre and may go to another city or town where there are relatives, local authorities need to consider that this might be part of it and that the person may need ongoing support, including specialised assistance around employment and health supports.  The difficulty with integration strategies is that while local authorities are encouraged to have them, they are not required to have them.  It is not mandated but is rather a recommendation of the national integration strategy.  It is not a legislative requirement.  One therefore gets a sporadic approach whereby local authorities like Fingal have invested huge resources into good and complex integration strategies over the past two years, while other local authorities are still at the starting point.  Some are asking how to even start with an integration strategy.  Often, the funding is an issue.  Local authorities may say they have to use their funding instead for priority areas like housing, education and all the usual things.  That comes back to the point about planning.  Locating a centre in an area is not just a once-off action.  It is something that will reverberate for years and it needs to be built into the infrastructure of that area.  An integration strategy is a sure-fire way to look at that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the right to work.  It is worth pointing out that in Europe and Ireland so far, the tendency among asylum seekers who have a right to work is to enter self-employment due to the significant barriers they face in entering regular employment.  While a large number of people have taken up the right to work in Ireland, it is unclear how many are in self-employment and how many are in actual employment.  We hear from those contacting our services and from our integration work that bank accounts are a significant issue.  However, some banks have started to figure out what one could call limited-function, high-risk bank accounts, both because they have been forced to do so by recent court decisions and because they recognise this is something they need to sort out in the long term.  Accounts like this will deal with the issues banks face of identification and address, while allowing asylum seekers to access a function that will satisfy an employer and allow salary payments to be made.  There is movement in that area and I think some of the banks will come out with initiatives to address the issue this year.  While that is positive, it remains a significant problem at the moment.</p> <p>  We have worked with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to figure out driving licences.  We are batted back and forth between the two, each of which says the matter is the responsibility of the other.  As of yet, there has been no resolution of that issue.  Location is a significant issue.  As Mr. O'Neill said, the private sector involvement and level of knowledge on the right to work of asylum seekers is incredibly low.  We are trying to work with the employer agencies and bodies to spread information and we are a supporting partner in the Open Doors initiative.  The initiative involves 22 large private employers operating special schemes around employing asylum seekers and refugees and is very important.  While positive things are happening, significant gaps remain.  Those are the two parts to which I can speak.</p></speech>

We have had 632 employment declaration forms returned.</blockquote><p>That would suggest that officially at least 25% to 30% of the applicants are being approved.  I mentioned when the member was not here that I visited three centres in the past ten days, all in the same area of the country.  In one centre, which was a men only centre, 38 of the 57 men were working.  That is a good number, and of the 38 men, three were also doing further education.  In the next centre which was for women and children only and in which there were 86 females, I was told that about 70% were working in that centre.  Some of the women would not have been in a position to work because they had young children.  Therefore 70% of that cohort is a significant number.  The third centre was for single women, and in that centre 70% of the women were working.  I hasten to add that this was in an area of the country where there is a good tourist business and where jobs in the hotel service industry are readily available.  I do not know how common that is.  I have the figures for one area which are very encouraging.  I would not expect it to be the same in Foynes, Millstreet or in some of the other remote centres.  That is why we have talked about location.<br/><br/>The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, was mentioned as a possible organisation that might be approached to do the job for direct provision centres.  I am not sure whether it was accepted or pursued as yet, but it needs to be an independent body with teeth.  The Departments will be negotiating between themselves.  I am sure there will be a reluctance to set up a new agency, but some existing body could take it on board as part of its portfolio.  Mr. O'Neill wishes to comment.</p></speech>

The driving licence situation is a good example.  What often happens is that a person goes between one Department and another and there are ongoing discussion as to who has responsibility.  There is no referee, nobody above that to decide.  It requires a good deal of co-operation and these things can often take a very long time to resolve.  That conversation is relevant to the inspectorate as well.  HIQA has been mentioned but legislative change would be required and there would be resource implications.  What we need is a new approach, an all-of-government approach to these issues.  It is bigger than just the Department of Justice and Equality, whether one has a rapporteur, as suggested by Mr. Justice McMahon, or some other model where somebody can have a bird's eye view of the entire system.  We do not have performance benchmarks or baseline indicators across each Department so that we can see what success looks like and whether progress has been made against the targets.  That is a difficult conversation but is one that needs to happen.  The standards have been agreed at departmental level so it needs to be signed off.  It is envisaged that there will be a period of two years where the centres will be expected to come up to standard over that period before they become binding.  That said, they have informed the tenders already to date, so many of the important aspects of the standards coming from the McMahon report have been incorporated as some of the requirements of the tenders already done to date.</p> <p>  While we have not had sight of the contracts with direct provision centres, because this is commercially sensitive information, they are made available after a number of years.  I believe we did have an example.  It is in the appendix in the working group report but the tender documents themselves contain quite a bit of detail in terms of the expectations of contractors and what is required.</p></speech>

This has been a real education for me.  I would not know much about this area.  I remember my mother told me years ago that if I do not know something, not to be afraid to ask questions.</p> <p>  Is it correct that there are approximately 6,000 people living in direct provision?  What information do we have on the people who live in direct provision?  Do we have statistics?  How many are living in State accommodation and how many are living in private accommodation?  What benefits are the asylum seekers entitled to?  It was stated earlier that some of the people living in these asylum centres have qualifications, such as plumbers and carpenters.  In recent months I have been contacted by painting, plumbing and electrical contractors who are experiencing a massive shortage of workers.  They have been in constant contact with the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, about the work permit scheme for taking people from countries outside the European Union.  I wish to address questions to Mr. Justice McMahon and Mr. O'Neill.  Later I will have a question for Mr. Killoran.  As a member who does not really know much about the asylum system but who is willing to learn, will the witnesses educate me on what is going on?</p></speech>

His first question is easily answered.  There are 6,106 people in direct provision at present.  People can come into the country and be an applicant for asylum and not live in the direct provision centre.  People can choose to live outside, and if they have the means to live outside, they can do so.  There is an undefined number outside the system.  When we were doing our report in 2014, it was nearly 50:50.  There was approximately 4,000 people living in direct provision and it was estimated that approximately 4,000 people were living outside.  It is very hard to keep tabs on people outside direct provision.  The figures are there and I am sure Mr. O'Neill has more accurate figures, because the person only has to make a legal application for asylum and the next time they are seen is at the next stage of the process, when they are called to come before a tribunal.  They vanish and it may be that some of them go to England clandestinely.  We do not know.  There is a question mark about how many are outside direct provision.  We were only asked to report on the people in direct provision and the State's obligation to them.  That is why our focus is confined to that.  I suspect nowadays there are fewer people living outside direct provision than there was when we did the study.  There are many more people living in direct provision because there are no alternatives available.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick touched on a subject that is fairly complex, namely, the willingness of asylum seekers to work and their qualifications to do so.  We met people in direct provision who were architects, economists, university lecturers as well as those who were tradespersons in their own country.  The question of recognising their qualifications is a major question, and that applies not just to people seeking asylum but anyone who comes to the country and wants, for example, to practise as an architect.  He or she has to show that his or her degree is equivalent.  I suspect there is a resource of people who could work in the trades in country places.  I am not sure if this would apply to electricians but there is work for everyone, as we are told by the economists.  If one comes from a local provincial town, one hears people complaining that they cannot get people to tend to their garden, do handiwork or paint the house, which one imagines that people in a direct provision centre would have the skills to do.  Somebody else on the panel might know more about their skills and how they are trying to match up the skills of those in direct provision with the needs of the local economy.</p><p>In any event, the question was not asked simply because they did not have the right to work up until recently.  Now that they have the right to work, I am surprised to hear it is not publicised in direct provision centres.  It is a crying shame that it is not posted in all direct provision centres that a person there is entitled to work after nine months.  It should be promoted.  There is a role there for voluntary, local and community groups.  Many direct provision centres have friends in these sectors.</p></speech>

I am trying to be honest.  That is why I am asking for information and statistics.  I am delighted to hear that they want to work.  There should be as much emphasis on them as on the question of work.  I understand the issue regarding location.  I come from Dundalk.  The nearest centres are in Mosney and Monaghan.  Committee members intend to visit these two centres in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  What are their entitlements if they want to work?  It is great to hear that they want to work and that the entitlement to work is granted.  It is easy enough to say that but when a person starts working initially, it could be one or two weeks before he gets any money.  Are these people entitled to free public transport?  To what are they entitled?  I am delighted that the law has changed and that they can work.  There are highly skilled people in the centres.  As stated earlier, I have individuals ringing me up on a daily basis trying to get people to work for them but they cannot get staff.  This morning, I received a telephone call from a painter in Dundalk.  He has lost 11 contracts recently.  He had ten painters working for him at one stage but now he only has two.  It is nearly impossible to get painters.</p> <p>  These people came to this country for a reason.  They came for help and we have to give it to them.  If they have the qualifications that our guests state they have, then they are entitled to work.  These people do not want to be freeloaders, they want to work.</p></speech>

If people remained in direct provision centres for five, six and seven years, they lost the will to work and became de-skilled.  Their skills atrophied and they became institutionalised.  We should not have that problem any more.  The people who are in these centres for six months, a year or two years want to work.  I asked a man in one of the centres how he was getting on.  I was inquiring about his legal papers.  He told me to forget about his legal status.  He urged me to help him to be allowed to get up in the morning, have his breakfast, go to work and then come back in the evening and sit down with his wife and children and say that that day he had worked.  He said he would work for nothing.  It means a great deal to the new people coming in.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is absolutely right; there is a missed opportunity here somewhere.  I am unsure as to how the matter can be resolved.</p></speech>

There are approximately 3,600 each year.  What lessons have we learned in recent years?  Are these 3,600 applicants new?  Are we starting with applicants from day one?  What is happening?  I will be honest.  I would not fancy being stuck in a confined space for such a long period.  What is the system at the moment?  Have we learned anything?  Have many of these people been in direct provision for five or six years?  They want the right to work and do everything else.  Have we learned anything?  Have more people been employed to process applications?  The figure of 3,900 seems large.  They have got something right.  What have we learned to get the process going at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-05-22a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Enda O'Neill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019052200002#Q00600"><p>Thinking back over the years, sometimes people would say to me that if we made the system too good for asylum seekers, it would attract more people to Ireland.  I do not think anyone who has been to a direct provision centre would make that argument but it is made elsewhere.  Really, the fact that the system goes on for so long has the potential to make it a target for people who come irregularly and who are not likely to get status.  The quicker a person's case can be resolved, the quicker we can identify his or her legal entitlement to stay and work.  Our discussions at the working group also concluded that a fast process makes it more likely that a person would voluntarily return home if, at the end of that process, he was not given status.  I go back to this point - the right to a quick decision is crucial.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked about entitlements.  It is important to state, especially in light of certain comments during the campaigning period of late, that asylum seekers are not considered to be habitually resident.  Therefore, they do not qualify for social protection payments in the same way as Irish citizens.  The payment rates to which those living in accommodation centres are entitled are &euro;29.80 per week for children and &euro;38.80 per week for adults.  The allowances have increased considerably since the report came out and we have seen the implementation of the recommendations in the McMahon report.  People are reliant to a large extent on the food and services available in the centres.  They have a small living allowance to meet their other needs.  They would also be entitled to a medical card.  It is only when they get status or are granted permission to work and take up employment that they would have greater income.</p></speech>

It relates to with human trafficking.  Mr. Killoran mentioned that it could take up to two years to find or identify the woman involved.  That seems a long time.  I have seen many documentaries lately dealing with trafficking.  It is frightening, especially for a father of three children, two of whom are girls.  The last thing we want is for our children to be kidnapped, taken to strange countries and so on.  Have the numbers been rising in recent years?  The Garda has been getting enforcement going in recent months.  People are being arrested now whereas previously nothing was happening.  There is enforcement by the Garda.  Can the Immigrant Council of Ireland provide figures for the past 12 months, 18 months or two years?  What is the success rate?  The first thing a woman taken from a foreign country would want is to get back to her parents.  Will Mr. Killoran outline what is happening?  Is the Immigrant Council of Ireland working closely with the Department?  Is the council getting much response from the Garda?  I am not being smart but to me it is the next thing to rape.  At issue is a woman being forced to have sex against her will by these pimps, or whatever we call them.  Many people seem to get away scot-free.  The more we highlight this, the more people will realise it that this is happening in our back garden.  I want to see it stopped.</p></speech>

By its nature, trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation is for the most part organised by organised crime gangs, Irish and international.  These gangs often work in collaboration.  They move women around on a regular basis and make it difficult for the women to escape.</p> <p>  Garda investigations tend to be part of international investigations involving Interpol and Europol and are large and complex in nature.  Council law centre staff have to be conscious that those who come to us are often some of the worst cases.  These are the ones that come to our attention.  We have seen cases of identification of victims of trafficking taking up to two years.  Often, we will go to the High Court for judicial review to review the whole process and try to find out why it is taking so long.  One of the primary problems is looking at trafficking through the lens of immigration or seeing it as an immigration phenomenon.</p><p>Trafficking can of course occur with EU nationals who enjoy freedom of movement as well, who do not necessarily have an immigration issue but are caught up in this system anyway.  Although trafficking often and mostly involves migrants, we have to move our perception of it from being an immigration issue to an approach similar to that around gender-based violence, in that we need to be much quicker in identifying victims of trafficking and putting supports in place around them.</p><p> As for the numbers of victims of trafficking over the past few years, the State engaged in 90 investigations of victims of trafficking in 2016 and 115 investigations in 2017.  These investigations were split roughly evenly between labour exploitation and sexual exploitation, although there were slightly more sexual exploitation investigations.  While the official 2018 statistics have not yet come out, it looks like there will be a further increase on the 2017 figure.  We are seeing an increase in prevalence and detection, but we are not seeing an increased level of conviction of traffickers, which is the biggest single issue.  We have very close contact with the Garda, including the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, and the immigration authorities and I do not think the low conviction rate is because of a lack of willingness on their parts.  The problem of identification hampers their ability to investigate effectively because they spend so long trying to work out the identity of a victim of trafficking that it takes from their overall powers of investigation.  That needs to be reformed entirely and the Garda needs to focus on investigation so it can convict traffickers.</p><p> The Garda is very conscious of the international criticism it has received because of the fact that we have not yet convicted a trafficker in Ireland.  That is a massive area.  While all these complex responses are going on at State level, people are often sitting in direct provision, essentially going through the motions, trying to get into a position of recovery and trying to get their lives back on track.  These administrative arrangements built around it often hamper those people's ability to get back from a horrific situation into one of having dignity and the ability to be on their own two feet again.  We have the component parts of a good response to victims of trafficking, and we have the will, but we are lacking a clarity of approach and resources put behind it.  Things like the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017, which decriminalises women in these circumstances but targets buyers, are very important but they need to be properly implemented as well.  We are only seeing the initial stages of implementation on that particular legislation.  It is a complex area, but I appreciate the opportunity to talk about it at length.</p></speech>

I am sure the technical aspect of it will be sorted in time.</p> <p>  I had some questions myself but I am going to conclude with one observation, and to share a situation with the witnesses.  When I was a member of the health committee, in a previous D&aacute;il up to ten years ago, we visited a number of direct provision centres.  At that time it was very much of the order Mr. Justice McMahon has referenced himself.  Changes have been made, and that is to be welcomed.  However, the reality still is that the lives of the greater number of people accommodated in these situations, particularly those who are waiting longer, are suspended.  That is the way I see them.  The 19-month wait that was referenced is totally unacceptable, albeit a significant improvement on the previous situation.  Are any of the panel in a position to advise on whether there are people currently in direct provision who have been there for significantly longer than 19 months?  Do we know the statistics on that point?  </p></speech>

I have some difficulty in interpreting the tables but there were 346 people who have been residing in Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, sites for more than four years, of whom 75 had status granted, 41 had been issued deportation orders, and 230 are still under consideration.  Moreover, 141, 66, 63, 16, 19, 26, 13, eight, one and three people have been there for more than five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13 and 14 years, respectively.  Therefore, a total of 702 people have been residing in RIA sites for more than four years.  I can give these figures to the committee.</p></speech>

In June 2015, when I finished the report with the working group, I was <i>functus officio</i>.  I am no longer relevant as my job was finished.  I am here today as the former chair of a working group that finished its job in 2015.  I still maintain an interest in the whole area but I have no official status.  I want to make that clear.  I would classify myself, if I may, as an informed advocate at this juncture with no official status.  However, I am being kept in the loop by the Department.  In taking its evidence, the committee should pay attention to the people who are at the coalface in this matter.</p><p>I have drawn attention to the differences that have arisen during the past 15 years but I am not at the coalface.  I am sure many other witnesses will come before the committee and I want members to bear that in mind.</p></speech>

We have challenged the Minister, Minister of State, who is a former Chairman of the committee, and representatives of the agencies involved on this matter.  They point out that they do not have accommodation available for the numbers presenting and that their hand was forced on this issue.  We are talking about private-for-profit interests because all the other centres bar those that were State owned in the first place, which are seven in number, are all private-for-profit entities.  However, the situation regarding emergency direct provision comes down to what can only be described as block booked hotel and other accommodation opportunities.  I am familiar with some of these in my constituency.  I have personally witnessed a situation where a significant number of people are accommodated in a very rural location that is not served by public transportation and they have a big car park to walk around.  This conjures up in my mind something akin to an exercise yard in a prison.  I find that utterly unacceptable.  What is more unacceptable is that the providers of this so-called accommodation and the Reception and Integration Agency seem happy to ignore a major inconvenience that occurred when more than 100 people - I do not have the precise number to hand - were removed from the hotel in which had been staying for some time and relocated elsewhere because the hotel had to honour a previous booking for a wedding event.  These are human beings and that incident conjures up an image of a herd being moved to another field in order to facilitate whom?  It is offensive, disgraceful and a very black mark on Ireland.</p> <p>  The joint committee will hold a series of engagements with the widest number of people we can physically accommodate.  The expressed interest is beyond what we can facilitate.  For this reason, I am laying great emphasis on the fact that we are open to receiving submissions.  We will meet representatives of the Irish Refugee Council and the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, MASI, next week.  We decided earlier in private on our meeting of 12 June and we will meet again on 19 June.  We will also have planned visits, as Deputy Fitzpatrick noted.</p> <p>  We greatly appreciate the witnesses' attendance, the submissions they forwarded to us and their opening statements.  We had more members in attendance than I expected or feared, which is great.  The joint committee has 11 members and we had seven of our number in attendance today, which is not bad given the week that is in it.  I thank Ms Mary Henderson, Mr. Brian Killoran, Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon, Mr. Enda O'Neill, Ms Maria Hennessy and Ms Caroline Stephens for their participation and assistance in this process.  We will invite them to the launch of our report and if they are in a position to attend it that would be great.  We intend to launch it publicly with recommendations that will be the result of a process of discussion among us.  Hopefully, we will reach consensus on real and practical recommendations that will make a difference in the lives of people who are looking to us in times of agony in their lives for help and assistance.  I also thank Senator Black for staying the course.</p></speech>
