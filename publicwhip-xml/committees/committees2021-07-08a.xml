Deputy Verona Murphy is speaking in the D&aacute;il but will join us later.  I welcome everybody to the meeting.  Due to the situation with Covid-19, only the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin.  I ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure we are adhering to that constitutional requirement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness and is attending remotely.</p> <p>  Today, we will engage with officials from the Tax Appeals Commission to examine the 2019 appropriation accounts for Vote 10 - Tax Appeals Commission, and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the accounts of the public services 2019, Chapter 14 - Management of Tax Appeals.  The commission has been advised that the committee has an interest in the highest value appeals before the commission.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following representatives from the Tax Appeals Commission: Ms Marie-Claire Maney, chairperson, and Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, access officer.  They are both very welcome.  When we begin to engage, I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices when not contributing so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, the witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.</p> <p>  I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to give his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070800002#A00700"><p>The main role of the Tax Appeals Commission is to adjudicate, hear and determine appeals by taxpayers against decisions and determinations of the Revenue Commissioners concerning taxes and duties.  The 2019 appropriation account of the commission records gross expenditure of &euro;1.77 million.  The estimate was &euro;3.3 million and, as a result, there was a surplus of almost &euro;1.5 million at the end of the year.  Most of the underspend relates to the planned recruitment of additional staff taking longer than expected.  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the account.</p> <p>  The commission was established on 21 March 2016 as an independent statutory body, replacing the previous Office of the Appeal Commissioners.  As a result, the commission has been in a development phase over the past several years.  It has had to develop new operating systems at the same time as it dealt with legacy cases it inherited, as well as new cases lodged since its establishment.  The report before the committee today examines the management of the tax appeals process, and provides analysis on the value of tax under appeal at the end of 2019, the outcome of appeal cases and the time under appeal.  </p> <p>  At the end of 2019, there were 3,357 open appeal cases, with a combined value of &euro;3.8 billion.  A small number of very high value cases accounted for 58% of the combined value.  The average time that cases had been under appeal at that date was around two years.  Almost a quarter of cases, accounting for &euro;508 million in value, had been in the appeal system for three years or more.  Some taxpayers pay the amount of tax in dispute before lodging an appeal.  If the taxpayer is successful in the appeal case, Revenue is required to refund the taxpayer the amount prepaid.  Revenue could not quantify for us the total amount prepaid relating to tax under appeal at the end of 2019.  However, that information would be available on Revenue&rsquo;s individual taxpayer records.  In the period 2016 to 2019, the commission closed more than 3,900 appeal cases.  Over 70% of the cases closed were either settled by the taxpayer with Revenue, or the taxpayer withdrew the case.  The commission refused or dismissed 22% of the cases that had been closed.</p> <p>  The commission was required to make a formal determination in only 5% of the cases closed between 2016 and 2019.  Once an appeal has been heard by the commission, there is no time limit within which the commission must issue its determination.  At the end of 2019, a determination by the commission was awaited in 57 cases, and 23 of those cases, with a quantum under appeal of &euro;114 million, had been heard prior to 2018.  The outcome of an appeal can result in a revised tax assessment.  Monitoring of the outcome of appeal cases would potentially provide Revenue with information about circumstances where there are significant reductions or increases in the original assessment for a particular tax type.  While Revenue considers determinations issued by the commission, the examination found that Revenue did not actively monitor the impact of the appeal process on tax assessed at a global level.</p> <p>  In 2016, the commission procured a case management system at a total cost of &euro;202,000.  It was subsequently decided in 2018 that the system did not operate as intended and was written off by the commission.  A replacement case management system developed as a temporary measure was still in place at the end of 2019.  As the report was being finalised in September 2020, work was continuing to develop a permanent case management system for the commission.  The examination identified some errors in the data recorded on the case management system, which better data entry controls could have eliminated.  Discrepancies were also identified in the recorded quantum of tax under appeal when the commission&rsquo;s data were compared to data extracted from Revenue&rsquo;s appeals module system.  This finding resulted in Revenue conducting a review and subsequently revising its data on appeal cases.</p> <p>  The chapter made five recommendations, three of which are addressed to the commission.  These relate to improving the timeframe for the disposal of cases and the development of escalation procedures when delays arise; the setting of time targets for the issuing of a determination following a hearing; and a review of the commission&rsquo;s requirements in advance of the procurement of a new case management system.  The examination made two further recommendations addressed to Revenue, concerning the recording of tax appeal data on its own case management system; and monitoring of the overall change in assessed liabilities as a result of appeals.  The commission has agreed to implement the recommendations addressed to it and the witnesses will be able to provide the committee with an update on the implementation of those recommendations.</p></speech>

I am a member of both the senior public service and the legal profession.  To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, to be a member of one unpopular group might be regarded as a misfortune; to be a member of two, I know, looks careless.  Now to the serious business.<br/><br/>The O&rsquo;Donoghue report of 2018 and the Comptroller and Auditor General report of 2019 were properly critical of the commission.  They highlighted significant issues with the functioning of the commission and made a number of important recommendations.  I am pleased to inform the committee today that all of the recommendations for the commission in both reports have now been implemented.  I am pleased to inform the committee that there has been a notable and noticed improvement in performance.<br/><br/>In 2020, the quantum of appeals determined increased by over 900% to &euro;610 million.  This year, we are set to determine appeals of the same magnitude.  In 2020, we scheduled hearings to a value of &euro;1.5 billion.  In 2021, we have, to yesterday afternoon, scheduled hearings to a value of nearly &euro;2 billion.  Critically, we have reduced the backlog of awaited determinations by 80% and the remaining 20% will issue before the end of the year.  Of that, 5% will issue before the end of July.<br/><br/>Since our reopening in 2020, all appeals heard are decided within measurable deadlines.  We now have 2,900 appeals.  Since January 2020 and the Comptroller and Auditor General report, our appeals on hand have reduced by 14%, namely, 460 appeals.  At any time a significant proportion, currently 40%, cannot be progressed because there is a lead case in the courts or parallel proceedings connected to an appeal, such as a judicial review, are ongoing.  Since 2016, we have closed 6,100 appeals to a value of &euro;2.7 billion, which has contributed to the economy, to the Exchequer, or both.<br/><br/>The top 20 appeals on hand amount to &euro;3 billion and are actively managed.The committee has asked for the top 10 appeals by quantum, which are worth &euro;2.8 billion and involve just five appellants.  At the other end, some 1,100 appeals have a value of less than &euro;10,000 each and amount to &euro;3 million.  Each appeal is important to each taxpayer, and hence, important to me as the chairperson.<br/><br/>What has brought about the improvements?  The headline operational improvements include the following: the staffing was realigned by me and administrative staff were recruited; temporary legal researchers were engaged; the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer assumed our IT systems support; investment in new IT to support digitisation was made; capability for remote and blended hearings was introduced; a simpler notice of appeal and statement of case was published; a modern website with search capability was launched; and the tender specification for a case management system was completed.  I am pleased to inform the committee that we have recently received sanction from the digital oversight unit to go to tender.<br/><br/>In terms of headline governance improvements, a number of governance deficits were highlighted in the reports and so a full suite of required formal policies was completed.  A governance framework, service level agreements and an actively managed risk register are now in place.  All signage now complies with the national language Act.  A recovery and resilience plan, an annual business plan and an accessible three-year statement of strategy were completed.  The annual report was issued to the Minister for Finance in March, with publication in April 2021.  Strict timelines for issuing determinations are overseen by me.  Judicial reviews against the commission have been resolved, and as importantly, guidelines to avoid recurrence were compiled and no further litigation has arisen.  I have had meetings with the Minister for Finance and all other relevant stakeholders.<br/><br/>In terms of future improvements and looking to the future structure, I am also an appeal commissioner.  I have personally determined the highest value appeal to date at nearly &euro;600 million.  I have also determined appeals of less than &euro;600.  That wide spectrum of appeals encapsulates the challenge.  There is no other quasi-judicial body, or even a court, dealing with such a range, from the volume of the Small Claims Court to the complexity and quantum of cases in the Commercial Court, and everything in between.  As such, I submitted a proposal to the Department of Finance for a new tiered commissioner structure to match the appeals&rsquo; case base.  I am pleased to inform the committee that sanction has been given, and hence, that tiered approach will start to align the case base.  The O&rsquo;Donoghue recommendation for the State to consider mediation and alternative dispute resolution, as is found in the UK, has considerable merit.  I support this recommendation.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to thank my small staff - the anchor, rota and remote teams - and commissioners for their adaptability, <i>esprit de corps</i>and hard work during this last unique year, and for their co-operation after a five-month closure to ensure the smooth resumption of hearings, both remote and physical, on 4 August 2020.<br/><br/>The commission has made progress, but there is some way to go before it has the required throughput and output relative to the case base, contributing to the economy and the Exchequer.  I am committed to that endeavour.<br/><br/>I am joined this morning by my colleague, Mr. Paddy O&rsquo;Keeffe, head of corporate affairs.</p></speech>

Ms Maney's presentation is very different from the one we received when representatives of the Tax Appeals Commission appeared in front of the previous Committee of Public Accounts.  It was a very memorable meeting for the chaos that was presented.  Many of the things that have happened since then represent a positive change.  I compliment Ms Maney on that.  We were told about computers catching fire and there being no desks in the commission, and all sorts of things.  It was very difficult.</p> <p>  Obviously the commission had a legacy case load.  It has been working to reduce that.  What would Ms Maney say is a manageable case load for the staff working in the commission?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie-Claire Maney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070800002#B00400"><p>Currently, we have 33 staff, which includes the commissioners and me.  There are four and a half commissioners, which, as the Deputy can appreciate, is just not feasible in terms of getting through the workload of 2,900 cases.  We have 28 administrative staff currently.  The Deputy's question is a difficult one.  I would like to have another five members of staff.  As we have moved towards holding remote hearings, we have found that we need more support staff to support more hearings, because more hearings can be held remotely.  We have had to invest in more clerical officers who run the IT side of the remote hearings.</p> <p>  However, the biggest issue we have is on the commissioner side.  That is why I have proposed to the Department of Finance the introduction of a different structure in respect of the commissioners.  I would like to see ten to 12 commissioners.  That would give us a chance to cover the case load.  There is no point in public officials coming to the Committee of Public Accounts and saying that we do not need more resources.  I do not think it would cost an awful lot more money because we are going to stratify the case base to deal with cases at different levels, and have commissioners at different levels and salary grades commensurate with the complexity of the cases.  </p> <p>  The main issue we have is trying to get through the backlog of cases.  We have made great strides and we have provided the numbers on that to the committee.  I would like to get a manageable number.  We have 1,500 cases every year.  I would like to be dealing only with cases dating back six months and the current workload.</p><p>That is what we are aiming for.  Perhaps 500 to 1,500 would be what I would envisage as a good, efficient body.  I am sorry for taking my time to get to that point.</p></speech>

She might try to keep her responses a little shorter because I have several questions to get through and time is tight.  All ten of the big cases relate to corporation tax.  What range of corporation tax dominates the rest of the cases, or does that relate predominantly to the bigger ones?</p></speech>

We had an oddity last year in that I dealt with a case of nearly &euro;600 million - &euro;587 million, to be precise - on stamp duty.   There are oddities, but, for the most part, the very large cases are corporation tax.  They are extremely complicated and they take a long time.  Members will see on page 15 of the booklet we sent to the committee that there is a case listed for the whole month of November that involves &euro;1.6 billion.  Once we get that off our books, so to speak, that will make a good inroad into the &euro;4.2 billion that is currently under appeal.</p></speech>

On the numbers, income tax constitutes the biggest number of cases we have, while on quantum, it is corporation tax.</p></speech>

It appears a great deal of effort went into providing it but it did not function as it was intended.  The commission dispensed with it and is now using a system that was built in-house.  It has now sanction to purchase another case management system.  How confident is Ms Maney that the new case management system will do the job, given the commission's experience with the previous system, which was quite expensive and did not function?  Is that system completely gone or is any part of it usable?</p></speech>

I understand it is completely unusable and has been written off in previous accounts.  I am absolutely confident the new system will be fully functional and will provide the specification we need.  That is why we set up a governance team with a representative of Revenue.  We have had great assistance from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, and I compliment Mr. Barry Lowry.  It is a fantastic organisation.  We also got a proper business analyst, at a cost of &euro;28,000, which I believed was really important to get that specification right.  That has helped us do the tender specification and we have now got sanction from the digital oversight unit.  We have had full consultation with Revenue, because we want the systems to interact between the two organisations, and we have had a system fully costed and specified.  We are getting assistance-----</p></speech>

In terms of mediation, we do not currently have the facility to ask the parties or to insist on mediation.  That would need a legislative change and I would recommend that change.  There is a review system in Revenue, and according to chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report, there have been 58 uses of it over five years.

It would be useful if those could be picked up and addressed with the individuals concerned because that would prevent an appeal.

I am going to try not to mention the company involved because I am not entirely sure if we are allowed to.  The company has advised its shareholders that its representatives will go into talks with Revenue and come to an agreement.  That agreement could result in the company paying less than 10% of what it owes.  It would be fantastic if we could all do that with our taxes.  I would love that.  Actually, I would not, as a public official, because we would have nothing to spend on our hospitals and infrastructure.  I am trying to understand who is going to go into negotiations with the company in question about paying less than it owes.  If it will be Revenue, which I presume it will be, what regard must be given to the decision the TAC will make in November?  Does Revenue take advice from the TAC?</p></speech>

We have listed the case for hearing as a tax appeal in November for a full month with commissioner Conor Kennedy.  What happens before the case is entirely a matter between that organisation and Revenue.  We have no influence or bearing on that.</p></speech>

We will give a determination, or a decision, after hearing the case in November.  The organisation concerned has already been to the High Court for a judicial review, which is a separate proceeding.  It lodged its tax appeal with us at the same time as the judicial review.  We could not hear the judicial review, which obviously causes a delay on our statistics.  The High Court decision was finalised in November or December 2020.  In January, after the timeline for appeal had expired, we wrote to the parties and asked whether they want the case listed because we were keen to list it.  The parties gave us the date in November as the soonest time when both parties could be prepared for the hearing due to the complexity of the hearing.  Anything that goes on prior to our hearing is entirely a matter for the parties.  Those are the vagaries of a quasi-judicial body.  We could be told the night before or even on the morning of a hearing that a case has settled.  In that scenario, we have, effectively, lost a month because a commissioner's time has already been allocated to that case.</p></speech>

I do not know if there is anybody else on the call who can answer this for me.  Am I correct in saying the original CMS was also given the go-ahead by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO?  The OGCIO has given the go-ahead for the tendering or procurement of a new system.  It seems the Tax Appeals Commission has given much consideration and thought to how to improve the system but has the OGCIO done similar work with its tendering and procurement processes?  Was it involved with the original CMS that had to be repudiated in 2018?  It seems it must also do a review.</p></speech>

We have heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General today that there may be work to be done on the Revenue monitoring tax appeals in a more active way.  From the other side, is the Tax Appeals Commission monitoring the progress of particular cases?  It seems to be from today's answers that it is.  If it is, how many of all the cases being dealt with are going through a parallel system involving the High Court?</p></speech>

That relates to parallel proceedings.  I will check with my colleague in a moment.  With the larger cases, I am not aware of parallel proceedings numbers but we can come back to that.  I can give an example of what happens with parallel proceedings.  The farmers' industry had a case heard by ourselves and that affected more than 100 different farmers.  We did one lead case and that went to the farmers in terms of positivity.  Revenue appealed that and it has gone to the High Court.  That means the 156 other cases are still on our books and we cannot close them because there are parallel proceedings now going through the system.  There are quite a few of those cases.  Some of these happened before judicial review and we cannot hear them.  Others go to the High Court afterwards.  We can come back with a number.  It is probably in my huge pack.</p></speech>

There are 2,900 appeals and approximately 60% is all we can work with.  There are 40% of cases in a different and parallel system that cannot be touched until there is movement.  I assure the Committee of Public Accounts that once they are moved in the courts and released, we act very quickly, as evidenced in the case referred to involving &euro;1.6 billion.  We were proactive in saying we wanted to list it.</p></speech>

In one of the reports it was listed as 43% of a total of &euro;3.75 billion caught up in tax appeals as of last September.  We are talking about the quantum involved and the numbers being dealt with.  If Revenue is going to negotiate and make a settlement, and I know the witness cannot comment on this, on anything in the region of 10% or 15% of that &euro;1.64 billion, we would not be talking about the same numbers.  The parallel process does not deal with the same quantities of tax liability.</p></speech>

Those are the numbers we use.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General report indicates, our number was found to be on the button and it is what we must take.  We cannot get involved with lower numbers or settlements.  That is the system and the number is &euro;1.6 billion according to my records.  That is what the taxpayer and Revenue have informed us of and the statistic we use.  It would be very nice if I could use lower numbers today but these are what we are using.  It is currently &euro;4.2 billion under appeal in the system.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Maney to her role, which is new enough, and commend her on the work she has undertaken in a short period.  She took over at a very difficult time and from reading her report and the other information given to us, particularly around case management conferences and hearings that were re-established during the height of the pandemic, it was very important that they were re-established as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I have a number of broad-ranging questions but am limited by time so I would appreciate if the replies could be brief.  The witness would be familiar with the alternative dispute resolution system in the UK.  The commission runs case management conferences so how similar are they?  How frequently are they used?  In what kinds of cases are they used?  They cannot be used with all appeals but Ms Maney might outline the circumstances in which they are done versus in a hearing, for example.  </p></speech>

They are used to set directions and get parties ready for hearing.  We find that once we engage with parties, settlements come from that listing or we get everybody prepared for the full hearing.  That is all time and time is money and public money at that.</p> <p>  The case management conferences are done remotely now, which we find very efficient.  They are an excellent vehicle.  They are not officially an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  We have found that by calling the parties together, it can assist settlements but we cannot be party to that.  The Deputy's point is very well made.</p></speech>

There is a good percentage of the smaller cases where one would not really need to have a case management conference and it would add to the burden, especially for individuals and with cases worth less than &euro;1,000 or where they need some assistance.  For anything over &euro;50,000 or even &euro;10,000, we find a case management conference very useful.  It is efficient for parties and ourselves.</p><p>It is approximately 60% and it might be higher.  I can get the percentage for the Deputy.</p></speech>

In terms of an appellant making a decision on whether to appeal the assessment from Revenue, 44% of cases were withdrawn by the appellants.  If more information was given by Revenue at an earlier stage, would it change the course of an appellant bringing a case?  What is the experience with appellants not of Ms Maney but of the commissioners?  Is it an issue?</p></speech>

From our perspective we are trying to understand the interaction between the TAC and Revenue and trying to make a recommendation for improvements.  In a bizarre way, although many witnesses do not believe it, the Committee of Public Accounts is here to help.  In terms of the supply of information from Revenue to the appellant and the reason for the assessment, in the UK there is a slightly different system with which I am sure Ms Maney is familiar.  Would this type of system be more appropriate here?  Perhaps it is unfair of me to ask.  I am conscious we have a report to compile after this in which we will make recommendations.  Is there a need for reform at that early stage?</p></speech>

We have asked it to consider alternative dispute resolution and to look at the UK model.  I have also engaged with the Irish Tax Institute.  We have had a good discussion about alternative dispute resolution.  According to its recent survey of members, they are in favour of such a mechanism.  It would be helpful.  It certainly would help the TAC if the facility were available to the citizens of Ireland and to organisations.  This is also the case with regard to caseload.  There is a lot of merit in it and we would welcome any assistance the Committee of Public Accounts could give us or give citizens or organisations.</p></speech>

Whatever time limit is given it is perhaps always arguable that it would not be enough.  I believe 30 days is a good timeline.  We do have a facility to accept late appeals and we are usually good where appellants engage with us and give us sufficient reasonable reasons they are late.  Of course there is a limit on it also.  During this past year in particular, with the unique circumstances, we have not been too draconian with regard to these reasons.  It is a fair question.  The difficulty with time limits is it does not matter what they are, somebody always says they should be shorter or longer.  That is all I can say on this.</p></speech>

How is the commission getting on with this?  Earlier, Ms Maney said there were four commissioners.  There was an underspend because of non-recruitment.  Is it just commissioners that the TAC is looking to take on?  What expertise is it looking to take on?</p></speech>

I cannot take on anybody because it is a constraint and it would have to be changed.  I suggest that in the new structure we have a tiered commissioner structure so the salaries would change.  This would free up some money to recruit more.  The underspend from before I joined was, for the most part, with regard to administrative staff and trying to get in those various grades.  Last year, there was an underspend some of which was accountable by my salary.  The recruitment campaign for me took six months.  I was informed in the middle of June and I started as soon as I could, which was 1 July.  These are some of the reasons for the underspend.</p></speech>

The TAC is new to me.  I was not aware of it.  Many people believe that Revenue is a law until itself and there is no appeal commission.  The structure I have been reading about is well placed.  It has existed since 2016.</p> <p>  With regard to the recommendations made in last year's accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the amount of tax under appeal in July 2018 was &euro;1.8 billion.  This seems to have doubled.  Notwithstanding that a portion of this sum will be successfully appealed, a considerable amount will fall to be collected.  The timely receipt of Exchequer amounts due is dependent on how efficiently the TAC processes and finalises appeals cases.  The recommendation from the committee at that time was that measurable targets would be set for progressing and finalising tax appeals on an annual basis.  Will the witnesses update the committee on the TAC's progress in achieving its output targets on closing tax appeals and issuing determinations since the implementation of the recommendation?</p></speech>

For cases up to &euro;1 million it is one month for issuing a determination; for cases between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million, it is two months; and for cases in excess of &euro;10 million, it is three months.  All of the cases heard since September, bar three, were determined within these timelines, which is approximately 98%.  The three undetermined cases were due to the domestic reasons of a particular commissioner, the Covid pandemic and a bereavement.  Everything since the recommendation came into place has gone through in the timelines.  With regard to aged determinations mentioned by Mr. McCarthy in his opening statement, there were 57 at the end of December 2019.  This has been reduced to 12 outstanding determinations.  I apologise on behalf of the State for those cases being outstanding.  Exceptional work has been done to reduce the number and it will reduce to zero by the end of the year.  The committee's recommendation was taken very seriously by me and it has been adhered to.</p></speech>

My first task on joining an empty office on 1 July was to get the office reopened and get information technology facilities.  That is why we joined the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer to get Polycom and all the IT equipment.  I am delighted to say we opened on 4 August 2020 and started remote hearings.  We have no backlog to do with Covid.  All the hearings that had been postponed for those five months were then heard.  We have been through all that.</p> <p>  Covid-19 had the normal effect in the sense that when there is a closure there is a backlog, but I am delighted to say that we put in place the anchor team in August and teams that come in on a rota.  We have been through level 5, level 4 and level 4 plus.  I do not even know what level we are at currently.  The rota changed with those levels.  We have had all the vagaries that a pandemic brings to any organisation but I am delighted to say it did not stop us or stop me.  We have made great progress in spite of the pandemic.  There is no backlog of post and there is no backlog of cases being heard.  We are full steam ahead.  In 2020, Covid had an impact but not currently.</p></speech>

We are classified as an essential service under the administration of justice.  We have a small anchor team.  They bring people into the building and we have people who set up the scheduling and who manage IT.  There are between six and eight people there at any one time.  Then we have teams who come in on a rota.  Currently, the rota is one week in four.  That brings in another eight to ten people.  We have had people who have had to self-isolate and stay at home and cases where it is really not essential to come into the office.  These people have worked away, and have done work including proofreading determinations and all the post.</p> <p>  All the files last year under my domain were digitised.  That really helped with remote working.  We have had a mixed bag.  There has been an unusual management structure but we have all adapted to it and it has worked well.  I have never met one third of my staff.  Obviously, we are online but we have never met.  That is the pitch I am on and I have enjoyed the pitch.  We have made the best of it.  I have never met one third of the 28 administrative staff.</p></speech>

I am sorry if I am doubling up, but there have been cases involving a delay in determinations.  What process has the commission put in place to ensure that the time taken to issue a determination after an appeal is reduced?  In light of Covid one can imagine, through no fault of the commission but rather the pandemic and Covid, that determinations have been extended.  Has the commission put something in place?</p></speech>

The determination is issued within one month.  The commissioners receive a schedule each month from me and I monitor it.  For cases between &euro;1 million and &euro;10 million the determination has to go out within two months.  Cases over &euro;10 million involve dealing with complex issues and the period for determination is three months.  That has been published.  The parties know that.  That is in our annual report and in the briefing prepared for the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since that came in, 98% of the determinations have gone under those timelines.  There are always cases that are outside the norm.  There is a &euro;1.6 billion case that the other Deputy referred to.  That may take a longer time but certainly every other case has gone out under those timelines.  They are closely monitored by me.  The schedule team draws up a report for me each month for each commissioner and I speak to the commissioners regularly.  They are also told the number of days if it is going over the timeline.  Anyway, I am pleased to say that of the cases since this came in last October, only three went over those deadlines.  Again, those were outside the control of the commission and I apologise to the parties for that.</p></speech>

The bureau representatives asked me to look at their appeals in the system.  We have heard almost all those appeals or certainly moved them on as far as the parties can move them on.  Mr. O'Keeffe can correct me on the details but at the last count, there were 46 appeals.  I am unsure of the current position.</p><p>There has been huge engagement with the Criminal Assets Bureau.  At my most recent engagement with people working in the Criminal Assets Bureau, they informed me that there has been a very good unintended consequence of us moving the cases through the system in that the parties are much more willing to engage with them and settle quicker because the cases are going through at a faster pace with their sales.  They are a particular category of cases-----</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague Mr. O'Keeffe to take a note.  I start to lose my sense of numbers when dealing with &euro;1.6 billion at one end.  Criminal Assets Bureau cases do not tend to be that; they tend to be up to &euro;1 million.  In the 50-odd cases, it is probably in the ballpark of &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million.

Each one has either been heard, is contacted or is through the system as far as it can be.  Those cases are particularly looked at because of particular issues because of flight risk or whatever and the particular engagement I have had personally with the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I can say hand on heart those cases are very much monitored.  We will get those statistics for the Deputy.</p></speech>

That would be completely outside our remit and we would have no facility to even assess that.  That really would be a matter for Revenue and the chairman of Revenue.  It would be entirely incorrect if we started to even consider such matters because it might start to influence how we schedule cases and we have to be completely independent in terms of how we do that.  I am not trying to be evasive, but the business and financial circumstances of those organisations, companies and individuals no doubt are entirely outside my remit.</p></speech>

Does Ms Maney have any figures percentage wise on what is physically recovered once the Tax Appeals Commission has made a decision?  Is that ever fed back to the Tax Appeals Commission or is that matter entirely for the Revenue?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's Chapter 14 report referred to the Revenue recovery.  Revenue gave an undertaking to look at its recovery rates.  In general, we do not get involved in that at all.  The Comptroller and Auditor General did a sample of 100 cases and the level of recovery is outlined in his report.</p> <p>  This might be of interest to the Deputy.  We have done a sample of the percentage of who wins cases.  In 2021 the appellant won in 28% of cases and the respondent in 72%, which is obviously Revenue.  In 2020 the percentage for the appellant was actually very similar at 27% and Revenue won 68%.  There was a split in terms of 5%.  So, it is about 70-30 in favour of Revenue when it comes to winning the cases.  It would be for it to explain the recovery rates in the cases it has won.  That is completely outside my remit, however.  The Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned the recovery in terms of the sample.  It is just not to hand at the moment.  Perhaps Mr McCarthy could assist if that is needed.  It did a sample of 100 cases and I think there was quite a high recovery rate.</p></speech>

It is listed at paragraph 14.28.  We looked at 100 cases determined or settled in the period from 2016 to 2019.  At the end of May 2020, more than 90% of the final agreed liability in those cases had been collected.  Less than 1% had been written down by Revenue and 9% remained outstanding.  Revenue would probably be able to give a further update as to whether that 9% has been collected.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will appreciate, those 63 that have gone to the High Court tend to be the higher-value cases.  One of the cases that I determined at &euro;587 million has gone to the High Court and a judicial review at the same time.  It would be a high percentage of the quantum.  It is 13% in terms of the total number of determinations, but I suspect it would be much higher in terms of the quantum of the determinations, but that is to be expected.  At that monetary value, we would have an expectation that they would be appealed to the High Court.  However, we have a very good success rate in the High Court of our determinations.</p></speech>

I was proactive in that case and they both went to the High Court to get their hearing expedited.  I am pleased to say the High Court listened to them.  The case is listed for October and will take place over six days.

I listened to the details she outlined.  It was on 4 August that she got into the office and started to get things moving.  Obviously, it has been a difficult year.</p><p>Spending money is easy.  Trying to gather the money that is owed is hard, but trying to reach an agreement with somebody or reach a figure for what is owed can be even more difficult, so it can be a challenging job.  With regard to some of the information Ms Maney supplied, the top ten largest appeals are in respect of corporation tax.  That is interesting.  Could she expand a little on that?  As regards the top 20, according to the figures given in the brief the value of that unsettled tax is &euro;3 billion.  What really stands out is that the top five is &euro;2.8 billion.  Perhaps she could tell us if that &euro;2.8 billion would be owed mainly by multinational companies or Irish-based, Irish-registered companies.</p></speech>

We have a low corporation tax at 12.5% compared to other countries, and I agree with that.  To put it bluntly, it drives the public up the walls, and particularly PAYE workers, that the money is gone before one gets to see it.  One does not get to see it except on the payslip at the end of the month.  There is strong consensus politically on the 12.5%, but the 12.5%, as we know from other pieces of information that emerge from time to time, is hard to collect and determine.  Is it the case that there is a culture or that some of the multinationals feel that they can play a little here?  We provide the 12.5% and that is very welcome and proper, even though it is under scrutiny now by the OECD.  Is it the case that some of the multinationals feel that they have, basically, a soft touch in Ireland?</p></speech>

Every appellant has the right to appeal.  I make no judgment on any appellant, be it large or small.  The appellants are entitled to exercise their right to appeal, whatever the quantum.  That is what these organisations are doing.  They are treated well by ourselves, as are the individuals.  I mentioned that I have heard cases up to &euro;600 million and cases over &euro;600.  Each of those appellants is treated absolutely the same.  We have the same independent mind.  The numbers to me are just the numbers.  The policy issues are for politicians.  I am an independent judge and I have to judge each of those appeals independently.  It is really important that I do not make any judgments or wording on policy issues.

I thank you for confirming that.  They are heading for almost &euro;3 billion, at &euro;2.8 billion plus, in terms of what they owe.  Out of all the cases being appealed, there are five companies out of the thousands that pay corporation tax - five multinational companies - that account for almost three quarters of the total sum.  It is an incredible figure.  Would you agree with that?  It is a stand-out figure by any account.</p></speech>

Those assessments were raised by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is an indication of the tax base that pertains in the State.

It is a substantial challenge in terms of the complexity of the cases, the length they take to hear, the parallel proceedings that the other Deputy and I have referred to and the length of time it takes even for the parties to get ready.  Yes, they are a substantial challenge.  Currently, the resourcing we have would not facilitate the speedy resolution of that large quantum of appeal.</p></speech>

That was unsuccessful.  The CEO of that company, speaking recently, said that he believed the figure "was not even real any more".  I know the witness has to be careful here.  He went on to say that it should be zero.  It would indicate that the State, the Revenue Commissioners and the Tax  Appeals Commission have a challenge with some of these large cases.  Is it correct to say that the commission finds some of these cases particularly challenging and onerous?</p></speech>

They are not the same as dealing with a very small case, obviously.  They are a challenge.  Certainly, even the O'Donoghue report that reviewed the commission in 2019 did not envisage this type of appeal and the quantum and complexity under appeal.  We are now dealing with cases as complex as those of the commercial courts and often they are running in parallel with the commercial courts.  Nobody in the State should be under any illusion about how much of a challenge this top cadre of cases causes in terms of resourcing, dealing with them and the manpower needed.  Even for the organisations, the Revenue Commissioners and that party needed 11 months to prepare for the tax appeal themselves.  The date in November that we gave was from them.  We have listed it for a full month just to hear the case, not to determine it.  That is a full one twelfth of my year on one case.  That is the soonest the parties could be prepared for hearing that case.  It is a huge resource from the Revenue Commissioners, a huge resource from the party and a huge resource from us.  Other than that, I cannot stray into making any comment on the case.</p></speech>

The commission certainly has been making progress, and I compliment Ms Maney and the staff on that.  They do a very important job.  There is a longer period of time for the determination of the larger cases.  Ms Maney outlined that there is a grading system for over &euro;1 million, over &euro;10 million and so forth.  Is it the case that some of the very large ones are put way back?  For example, what type of timescale is there for cases that would be over &euro;500 million, &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion?</p></speech>

I am very aware that there is great political interest in the top ten, so the Committee of Public Accounts has asked for the top ten.  However, there are the bottom ten.  My challenge is to ensure that the individual of less than &euro;500 gets the same treatment and gets through the system the same as some organisation at &euro;1.6 billion which is taking a lot of resources.</p><p>That is the challenge and that is why I have suggested a different structure that is tiered with a cadre to deal with smaller cases, a middle tier and one for the very large cases.  I am concerned that these large cases will just eat up resources.  That is where the political pressure is and that is what people are interested in but I am interested in the whole case base.  I have to be fair to absolutely everybody.  We are trying our best to get these cases through the system in order that we reduce the quantum under appeal but that has a cost.  It has a cost to people perhaps at the lower end who have a smaller appeal.  That is what I am trying to cover.  That is the challenge and it is very difficult.  I make no bones about it.  The Chair is absolutely right.  He has hit the nail on the head.  </p></speech>

How many companies are involved in such cases?  Many of the cases related to corporation tax or capital gains tax etc.  These have tax and PRSI implications.  Is there a figure or percentage available?</p></speech>

That went out recently.  There was a case that was confirmed in the High Court on the employed status of those who work in the industry delivering fast food.  Our determination was upheld that those people were also employees.  Off the top of my head, there is not a huge number of cases about employment status but I will get those data to the Chairman.</p></speech>

We have received 9,073 appeals that were either transferred or we have come into since 2016.  We have closed 7,375 appeals.  We are down to 2,900 appeals of worth.  The closures are worth &euro;2.7 billion.  The Deputy can do the maths.  The current figure is 2,874.  Many thousands of cases have been dealt with and closed.  We all get confused with the figures.

We have updated Chapter 14 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which contained an analysis of that.  On reviewing all appeals that have been closed since 2016, we can state the average time is 15 months.  Obviously, those cases that we have spoken about put the average out of kilter, if that does not sound mathematically incorrect.  Those cases that are consolidated and are on hold, like the case we have spoken about involving &euro;1.6 billion which was on hold for several years, will put the figures out of kilter.</p></speech>

If I had more commissioners the desire would be to complete the process within nine months to year.  That is probably realistic in terms of the process.  It takes time for people to get their case bundles together and to engage barristers.  The Deputy is now getting an understanding of the process.  A case that is worth less than &euro;1,000 should be in and out fairly quickly and should take three to six months.  In cases involving sums of &euro;1 billion to &euro;6 billion, it took those involved 11 months just to prepare for the hearing.  It is apples and pears.  There is a huge spectrum.  On average, I would like things to be in and out within an year.  That is the desire.  As I say, the reality is somewhat different.</p></speech>

In theory, they are paying for that delay or the length of time it takes.  If the appeal is found in the appellant's favour, it is unfair if he or she has to pay penalties because of a delay.</p></speech>

Interest runs if people do not pay the tax.  If they pay the tax upfront, there is no interest.  My understanding is that there are no penalties.  Again, Revenue can confirm that as it is a revenue issue.  It is a statutory issue that has been set down by the Oireachtas.  That is outside of my control.</p></speech>

The UK system is further down the road than us and has far more experience.  I am speaking for individuals and not the corporate world.  People who might not have the wherewithal to be able to pay money until a determination has been made are lumbered with further penalties and interest on the sum that Revenue makes.  That is a recommendation that the committee will look at.</p> <p>  Ms Maney will come back to me on a previous question I asked.  She might also inform us how many cases have prepaid and how many have not paid at all and, therefore, would have been subject to penalties.  That is of interest to the committee.</p></speech>

It is not part of our data collection.  Revenue would have that information.  I would not have the resources to liaise with Revenue and match up the cases.

On the IT system and the 2019 accounts, I note there is an underspend of &euro;259,000.  Ms Maney said a new IT system is coming in.

That is one of the reasons it has been included in the new specifications for the new case management system we are trying to procure.  We have a representative from Revenue on our project group to ensure those systems will be compatible.  That will be in the tender and is an important piece of the kit.

I am a new member of the committee, but I must emphasise that in my time on this committee I have never seen such comprehensive coverage by any Department.  I commend Ms Maney on that.  We have rarely, if ever, seen all of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations brought on board within such a short space of time, in this case a year.  Sometimes there is no regard for them whatsoever.  I am impressed.  It deserves and needs to be said.  We are often very critical.  If all Departments were managed in a similar fashion, our job would be very simple and would not take half as long.  I commend Ms Maney and her staff on that.  I have not heard from Mr. O'Keeffe.</p> <p>  There are some points of interest about which I would like to ask.  When a case is not accepted for appeal, has there been any analysis of the main reasons for that decision being made?  Is there a judicial review of a decision or is there a High Court process?</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. O'Keeffe could find the statistics for me in the huge pack of documentation that I have with me.  Very few cases are not accepted.  Perhaps Mr. O'Keeffe could find that statistic for me or point me to it.</p> <p>  Mostly, such appeals are on matters that are outside our statutory remit.  The Deputy mentioned judicial review.  She asked a very good question, and one that has perplexed many of us.  Those appeals tend to be on matters such as how the appellant was treated or dealt with by Revenue.  That is not for us to deal with.  We only deal with the monetary side and the tax assessment.  Cases that tend to relate to potential issues around legitimate expectation and constitutional rights are for the courts to deal with.  If the Deputy bears with me, I will find the statistics in my documentation.  We might be talking about less than 1%-----</p></speech>

Rather than seeing anybody being disenfranchised and having to go down the road of judicial review, I am trying to establish and understand whether there should be a briefing on what constitutes the commission's decision not to accept an appeal.  If the case is not accepted because it concerns how someone has been treated and is not monetary in nature, that provides me with the perfect understanding.</p></speech>

We report that 14% of the cases closed were refused and 8% were dismissed.  They are significant proportions.  That is how 22%, or nearly a quarter, of cases ended as far as the commission was concerned.  I do not have anything further in the chapter in relation to the reasons for that.  I understand that these figures were given to us by the commission.  I confirm that is the information we have received.</p></speech>

There can be many reasons for the dismissal.  There can also be settlements in some cases.  Dismissal is a wide-ranging category.  It tends to occur where people will not engage with the commission and do not turn up for hearings.  There are many reasons for the dismissal of cases.  There is a statutory framework for dismissals.  I am satisfied that they are always conducted correctly.</p></speech>

Some cases are outside the time limit - perhaps years outside it.  A smaller percentage of cases are brought to the wrong forum, which is what I think the Deputy was referring to.  However, in terms of the refusal to take cases, sometimes people appeal points that cannot be appealed.  The point may not be appealable.  Sometimes the appellant approaches the wrong forum.  Sometimes they are out of time.  Refusal is a wide category.  We put details on the website of what is appealable.  That has assisted appellants.</p> <p>  I wish to make clear that dismissals are not in the category that the Deputy referred to.  Even the refusals cover a wide range of reasons, including appellants being out of time, raising points that are not appealable at all in any forum, and raising issues that are not within our remit.</p></speech>

I have a fairly straightforward question for Ms Maney.  I am curious about the issue of commissioners.  As Ms Maney has outlined, there are four commissioners.  If I heard her correctly, she said that she could do with having 12 commissioners.  The commission is doing important work and is making good progress with it, but it is obviously being hampered by the staff shortage.  In terms of our work as the Committee for Public Accounts and our view coming out of this meeting and what can be done to assist the commission with this, what is the process in terms of the commission trying to get the extra staff?  Who does Ms Maney have to approach?  Does she have to approach the Department for Public Expenditure and Reform?  I ask her to outline the process briefly.</p></speech>

In January, I studied all the statistics and submitted a business case to the Department of Finance, detailing five years of statistical analysis and seeking more commissioners and the introduction of a different tiered status in respect of the commissioners.  That proposal was submitted to the Department.  I am pleased to inform the committee that I recently received confirmation that the Department of Finance has sanctioned the business case.  It is now with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration.  Once that is dealt with, hopefully recruitment can commence.  It has been positive.  I wish to commend the Department of Finance on its support for the commission, and in particular, Ms Deirdre Donaghy, who is the liaison officer and has worked exceptionally well with me.  I also wish to thank the Minister, whose door has always been open to me.</p> <p>  That is the process.  I hope that we will have the support of the committee after today.  We have worked hard.  I have personally worked exceptionally hard in the last year to make the progress required.  I hope that the State will support us in trying to recruit more commissioners at different grades.  I appreciate the Chair asking the question.</p></speech>

I accept that.  Earlier, Ms Maney mentioned a tiered system.  I take that to mean that commissioners with varying degrees of experience will be at different levels and on different salaries.</p></speech>

However, in respect of cases that are valued at under &euro;5,000 or &euro;1,000, perhaps even some of us could work on such cases.  How much would it cost, roughly, to recruit eight additional commissioners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie-Claire Maney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021070800002#M02100"><p>It is not a huge amount.  That is probably the one piece of paper I did not bring with me to the meeting.  As we are going to change the grading, we believe the replacement of the commissioners at the grading we have with an extra four would be cost-neutral.  To recruit an extra two commissioners at the lower end of the salary scale would cost around &euro;160,000.  All in, I believe the extra costing was estimated to be &euro;500,000, or something of that magnitude.  When we have &euro;4.2 billion worth of cases under appeal, the proposal seemed quite cost-effective in terms of restructuring and reducing the salary grades.</p></speech>

That is the figure that is in my mind.  That needs to be sorted out.</p> <p>  In relation to the recruitment of the eight additional commissioners, Ms Maney mentioned that the recruitment of two commissioners at the lower end who would deal with smaller cases would cost &euro;160,000 per annum, or &euro;80,000 per commissioner.  How much would the recruitment of the eight additional commissioners cost, roughly?  I just want a ballpark figure.  I do not expect Ms Maney to be able to give me an exact figure off the top of her head.  It is not her job to determine what commissioners are paid.  She has some idea of the grading and salary structures.  What are we talking about?  Are we talking about &euro;1 million per year?</p></speech>

I think it will be one of the better reports.</p><p>People can feel that witnesses sometimes get a hard time here, but Ms Maney has answered very detailed questions.  One of our recommendations might involve making a strong case for extra staff for the commission in order to allow it to deal with the backlog and capture some of that &euro;4.2 million.  If it is less than &euro;1 million per year and we are dealing with sums of &euro;4,000 to &euro;100 million, it is an open case.</p></speech>

Senator Mullen is substituting for Senator Boyhan.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members that, in the context of the current Covid-19 restrictions, only the Chairman and staff are present in the committee room.  All members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to please mute their microphone when not making a contribution and to please use the raise hand function to indicate.  Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots are prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  The topic for this morning's meeting is alleged issues in the horse racing industry with representatives of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB.  In the interests of full transparency, I acknowledge at the outset that this series of meetings on alleged issues in the horse racing industry was called on foot of the recent allegations made in the media.  In order to give all parties a fair hearing, the person who made those statements was invited to appear before the joint committee, but has chosen to decline the invitation.  Although such an engagement would have been beneficial to our discussion on what is a very important issue for a significant Irish industry it is their right not to participate and they are not answerable to the committee.  It must be said that we are not a committee of inquiry, so we are not here to judge the veracity of statements made or explore any allegations or wrongdoing against any person.  Our only objective is to establish what systems and processes are in place to see if they are up to top international standards and to discuss any policy issues arising.  I remind witnesses and members that we are not allowed to criticise in particular anyone who is not here to defend themselves.  I also remind them of the parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I welcome from HRI, Mr. Brian Kavanagh, CEO; from the IHRB, Mr. Denis Egan, CEO, Dr. Lynn Hillyer, chief veterinary officer and head of equine anti-doping, Mr. Niall Cronin, communications manager and Dr. Clive Pearce, LGC Laboratories, Newmarket.  The opening statements which we have received have already been circulated to members.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.  The committee has agreed that each group will be given ten minutes to present its main points before we commence questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must give an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence relating to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021070800002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today to discuss the issue of integrity and drug testing in Irish horse racing.  As the committee will be aware, the equine sector is an important contributor to the rural economy, with Ireland ranked as the leading exporter and seller of thoroughbreds in the world.  Despite its small size, Ireland plays a significant role globally in the horse racing and breeding industries.  Ireland is the third largest producer of thoroughbreds in the world and Irish trained and bred horses compete successfully in many of the major races worldwide.  Trade in Irish-bred horses is estimated at &euro;300 million per annum.  As such, the reputation and integrity of the product is of paramount importance, so the question of drug testing is an important one with significant funds invested annually in this area.</p> <p>  The horse racing industry in Ireland is governed by three major pieces of legislation: the Irish Horseracing Industry Act 1994, the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  This statutory framework sets out that the Racing Regulatory Body, the IHRB, is responsible in the first instance for anti-doping and forensics.  Section 39 of the Irish Horse Racing Industry Act 1994 provides that the IHRB shall be solely and independently responsible for making and enforcing the rules of racing, shall provide adequate integrity services to horse racing and shall make all decisions in relation to doping control, forensics and handicapping.  The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 provides that Horse Racing Ireland is responsible for the overall administration, governance, development, and promotion of the Irish horse racing industry and for guaranteeing funding to the Racing Regulatory Body to carry out its functions through an integrity services budget which is agreed annually.  In 2021 this budget amounts to &euro;10.3 million.</p> <p>  Horse Racing Ireland is committed to high standards in this area and our strategic plan for 2020 to 2024 has as one of its priorities "to enhance our domestic and international reputation through world leading standards of integrity and equine welfare".  Specifically, HRI sees its role as ensuring that the IHRB has sufficient resources, both financial, human and capital to carry out its responsibilities to the level expected of a major racing nation and we support the IHRB to constantly improve its capacity in this area.</p> <p>  In this regard, Horse Racing Ireland has progressively increased its funding for these activities.  It has established an industry wide anti-doping task force to examine and make recommendations regarding best practice in this area.  It has ensured that all Irish samples are tested at an internationally accredited laboratory.  It has promoted the concept of authorised officer status to enable testing at non-licensed premises and supported international best practice reviews of activities in this area.  Horse Racing Ireland works with the IHRB to ensure that its ambitions are supported in the area of doping control and the integrity services budget is subject to a formal quarterly review at executive level.</p> <p>  The IHRB has presented on this matter to the board of Horse Racing Ireland twice in the last two years, while Ireland is a full signatory to Article 6 of the International Agreement on Racing and Breeding.  This is a formal agreement between global horse racing authorities which commits countries to meeting best international standards in drug testing and forensics.</p> <p>  While drug testing is an area where one can be never complacent, Horse Racing Ireland takes assurance from the following aspects of the IHRB testing programme.  All winners in Ireland are tested, focusing on the most successful performers.  A selection of non-winners are tested on the track, including poor performing favourites.  Horses are tested out of competition at trainers' premises.  This year, out-of-competition testing has been extended beyond trainers' premises.  This means that the IHRB can inspect and test any thoroughbred anywhere in the country whether it is in training or not.  This is a unique power among major racing countries.  Testing can now take place at sales, breeding farms, point-to-point meetings and at various other sites such as barrier trials and pre-training yards.  All adverse findings are dealt with through the IHRB disciplinary process.</p> <p>  A detailed equine anti-doping report is now formally presented twice yearly to Horse Racing Ireland.</p><p>It was published for the first time last week and will be published every six months from now on.</p><p> Proportionally, Ireland races more horses overseas than any other country.  In 2019, 1,733 Irish-trained horses raced in countries as diverse as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, USA, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan, and were tested under various international regimes.  These international runners represented the equivalent of 6% of the total runners in Ireland and included horses of all standards and ability.  No adverse findings were returned.</p><p> HRI is committed to working with the IHRB to ensure that its systems are fit for purpose and operate to the best international standards.  Our spending on doping control has increased by 27% in the last four years and HRI has advised the IHRB that funding will never be an issue for meaningful initiatives to improve capability or increase capacity in this area.</p><p> All winners in Ireland are tested and 25% of testing is out of competition and away from the racecourse.  Out-of-competition testing now covers all horses at all times, whether in training or not.  All samples are analysed at an internationally accredited laboratory.  Samples from Irish horses are tested regularly at international laboratories when racing overseas and the samples include blood, urine or hair, as appropriate.</p><p> I am grateful for the opportunity to outline these points and I hope they are helpful.   I am happy to address any issues or questions which the committee members may have.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Egan to make his opening statement on behalf of the IHRB.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Denis Egan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021070800002#B00300"><p>On behalf of the IHRB, I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their invitation to appear before them. The IHRB was pleased to accept the committee's invitation and the opportunity it provides to address statements in the media which have been made about integrity and drug usage in Irish racing.  We appreciate the fact that the Chair and members have given time in what is a busy work programme to allow us to set the record straight.  We look forward to answering the questions that the Deputies and Senators may have.<br/><br/>For those who do not know me, I am Denis Egan, chief executive of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board.  I am joined today by my colleague, Dr. Lynn Hillyer, who is the head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer for the IHRB.  Lynn joined the IHRB in 2016, having worked as a regulatory specialist in anti-doping for the British Horseracing Authority since 2005.  She is recognised globally in her field, having published specifically on the detection of prohibited substances, and is chair of the International Group of Specialist Racing Veterinarians, a member of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, IFHA, and its advisory council on prohibited substances and practices, and a member of the , EHSLC.<br/><br/>We are also joined by Dr. Clive Pearce, laboratory director and director of sport and specialised analytical services at LGC Laboratories, who has been working with us since 2018.  As a racing chemist and laboratory director, Dr. Pearce is active in major international organisations associated with the regulation of animal sports.  He is a board member of the EHSLC, a member of thelaboratory and prohibited list groups, and theIFHA's reference laboratory technical committee and its advisory council on prohibited substances and practices.  LGC Laboratories analyse all our equine samples.  LGC is one of only five laboratories in the world certified by the IFHA to analyse racing samples to a benchmark which exceeds accreditation.  My colleague, Niall Cronin, IHRB communications manager, is also in attendance.<br/><br/>I will now provide some background information on the IHRB.  The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board CLG is a company set up by the Turf Club and Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee to carry out the functions assigned to the racing regulatory body under the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  It is responsible for the integrity of Irish racing, including doping control and forensics.  It carries out its functions through a team of highly trained professional racing officials and administrative staff, as well as dedicated and experienced voluntary race-day stewards and committee members.<br/><br/>In 2016, the Irish racing and breeding industries came together on a single issue, namely, tackling doping in the wake of the John Hughes case which had been prosecuted in the courts.  The subsequent recommendations of a task force comprising industry representatives which were reiterated in an updated policy document in 2018 are the foundation for our work today.  The appointment of Dr. Hillyer as head of  anti-doping, an established expert in her field; a public procurement process to appoint one of the best laboratories in the world; and a seismic shift in increasing out of competition testing were all early tangible outputs from those industry agreements.<br/><br/>The IHRB&rsquo;s equine anti-doping programme has developed into a sophisticated and extensive risk-based and intelligence-led strategy in which it is not just the numbers of samples which matter, but from what horse they are taken, where and when.  Regarding the where and when, in addition to the authority the IRHB has under the rules of racing in respect of licensed people and premises, 12 IRHB officials, including five qualified veterinary surgeons, were appointed as authorised officers under the Animal Remedies Act on 21 May last.  These officials can identify and sample any thoroughbred at any time and in any place, and have the authority to seize products, documentation or other evidence as necessary.  The ability to do this is ground-breaking and part of our armoury in protecting the integrity of Irish racing, which no other racing authority has.<br/><br/>I will briefly outline what we do on the anti-doping front and how we do it.  The IHRB samples horses both on and off the racecourse, taking blood, urine and-or hair.  Using these different samples allows us to detect a range of thousands of substances for varying lengths of time.  Taking the right type of sample from the right horse at the right time is an essential part of any modern anti-doping programme's test distribution.  The IHRB continually refines this, for example, now taking more out-of-competition samples than ever.  We are the first racing authority to take hair samples routinely on the racecourse.<br/><br/>All sampling is witnessed by a representative of the person responsible for the horse.  A sample is split into an A and B portion and anonymised and sealed in a tamper-proof bottle.  The process is automated using an app-based system which ensures integrity, real-time data transfer and minimises the risk of human error.  The process is similar to those used in all sport bodies, whether for human or animal athletes.  As Mr. Kavanagh stated, I would like to emphasise that all samples are analysed, with screening results usually reported to the IHRB within seven working days.  All adverse analytical findings for prohibited substances are prosecuted via a disciplinary procedure.  The trainer has the right of appeal against any penalty.<br/><br/>LGC Laboratories in Newmarket has been the contracted laboratory for IHRB samples since 2018.  Established in 1963, LGC has a long history as a world leader in the development and application of cutting-edge approaches to detect existing and emerging drugs, from anabolic steroids in the early 60s through to more complex biological threats and gene doping in 2021.  In a typical year, LGC carries out analysis on over 50,000 equine and canine samples and has an ongoing commitment to investing in new technology, with contractual requirements to share with the IHRB the outputs of new methods of testing and research as well.<br/><br/>LGC is one of five IFHA-certified laboratories, enabling the IHRB to continually benefit from data and intelligence shared between the best racing laboratories in the world.  An extensive programme of ongoing technical work to evidence performance is required to maintain this certification.  LGC's reputation in anabolic steroid and hair analysis is recognised globally.  In LGC, the IHRB has access to the most pioneering laboratory in the world in these two areas, as well as meeting the highest standards, along with the other laboratories, in the context of analysis of samples for other prohibited substances.<br/><br/>In  carrying out its equine anti-doping programme, the IHRB applies a risk analysis and intelligence-based strategy to its selection of premises and horses for testing.  In the six months since the start of the year, the IHRB has inspected 33 premises, testing at 18 of these, seven of which were unlicensed.  The unlicensed yards included studs, pre-training yards and sales consignors' premises.  We also tested at the recent barrier trials.Prior to the appointment of the 12 IHRB officials as authorised officers, it would not have been possible to access and test at the unlicensed premises.<br/><br/>The IHRB has unique anti-doping powers that are unparalleled in any other jurisdiction.</p><p>The appointment of IHRB officials as authorised officers is a game changer as it enables those officials to access any thoroughbred at any time, in any place, without notice.</p><p> We continue to work with LGC, one of the leading laboratories in the world, which is a pioneer in the analysis of hair samples.  We have a top-class anti-doping team, headed up by Dr. Lynn Hillyer, and while we continue to evidence that there is no systematic attempt to cheat through doping in Irish racing, we will continue, with the assistance of the industry and those outside, to effectively detect, disrupt and deter such behaviour.  It will not be tolerated.  We will continue to seek it out and where discovered, we will take all actions within our power to combat it without fear or favour.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and committee members.</p></speech>

I now invite questions from the members.  I call Senator Paul Daly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021070800002#C00300"><p>I welcome our witnesses, Mr. Kavanagh, Mr. Egan, Dr. Hillyer, Mr. Cronin and Dr. Pearce, this morning.  I thank both groupings for their presentations.</p><p>At the outset, while it may be well known, I am probably obliged to put on the record that I have skin in the game.  I am a member of the Association of Irish Racehorse Owners, AIRO,  and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association, ITBA.  I have a brood mare and the first of her progeny is commencing a racing career out of Mr. Pat Martin's yard.  I have, therefore, skin in the game in that regard but I also have a dedication and personal passion for the business, industry and sport by virtue of the fact that I have been the voluntary chairman of Kilbeggan Racecourse for more than a decade.  I am, therefore, putting all that on the record.  I have interest in the industry and the sport and a passion for it.</p><p>It struck a chord with me as a young man, back in the day.  When I had a newspaper, I would read the sports section and my reading ended there until later in life when my political involvement led to a keener interest in public affairs.  I would start at the front of the paper and finish before I got to the sports section.  I will say reservedly, however, that unfortunately, on three out of the past four Sundays, I found myself starting at the back of the newspaper and what I read has not been good for the industry and the sport for which, as I said already, I have a passion.</p><p>The old justice motto of being innocent until proven guilty is actually read in reverse when it is a person in the public domain or a public body spending public money or if it is a public representative or an organisation that is of public interest.  Unfortunately, in that situation it has to be read as guilty until proven innocent.  Once accusations or assertations are made, one is then duty-bound almost to prove one's innocence.</p><p>In that regard, I have some questions for the industry.  Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Egan will probably know who is best suited to answer them.  The questions are along the lines of what actions the organisations have taken since this scenario started and what further actions they intend taking, as I probably say bluntly, to prove their own innocence.  As I said, in the public eye, one is guilty once the accusation is made.  I say that with the greatest of regard; I am not making any accusations myself.</p><p>I would like to hear from the industry's side from whichever body believes the question is most appropriate to it.  We are here today, with the best interest of everybody at heart, to get to the bottom of the situation.  As has been outlined by the Chairman, we are not a court of justice.</p><p>Have or would the witnesses consider holding their own inquiry into any of the allegations that have been made?  As licensing bodies, all people out there who are in the industry either have a permit or a licence, which would be overseen or issued by one or other of the witnesses' organisations.  Would they not think it appropriate that this hearing or inquiry should have been, could be or perhaps still will be, hopefully, held by them to get to the bottom of and put to bed or solve some or many of the allegations or if they are false, maybe take some action against those who are making them?</p><p>With regard to the IHRB, and in particular, the third article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, there was some coverage on some anonymous letters and correspondence received by the IHRB.  Anonymous whistleblowing correspondence is how I would put it.  Very strong allegations were made that complaints were not acted on.  I would like to hear the IHRB's comment on them.  Does it have a file of complaints which, as has been said, have not been acted on?  I believe the board deserves the right to explain that one a little bit further.</p><p>I have some questions for Dr. Hillyer and Dr. Pearce on the testing side.  In preparation for Dr. Hillyer, when she does a bit of googling, a number of articles come up which to which she contributed.  One that struck me from not long after her appointment bore the headline, &quot;mucking out the Turf Club&rsquo;s stables&quot;.  I would like to give her the opportunity to explain that a little bit more.  What was she saying she was going to muck out there?  That headline reads badly now.  It may not have at the time.</p><p>As I said at the outset, while the numbers of tests being carried out is impressive, we are where we are now and changes need to be made to go back to prove the innocence of the associations and the industry.  I believe 2,449 tests - just shy of 2,500 - have been carried out, be they on racecourses or private properties.  Is there an available record of the results of all those tests on file in the IHRB?  Can they be accessed by somebody through a freedom of information request or are they always forwarded to the people responsible for the horse post testing?  Do they get a copy irrespective of whether it is an adverse analytical finding?  Is there a record of all those samples taken having been actually tested?</p><p>I would also like a little bit more clarification in that regard.  The IHRB in its submission stated, in particular when referencing winners on track, that samples of blood, urine or hair or both are taken.  The IHRB, therefore, takes both blood and urine and, on occasion, also hair.  In that situation where it would take both blood and urine, are both tested?  Again, when hair is also taken, are all three samples tested?  I would like a little bit more discussion or explanation from the experts, Dr. Hillyer and Dr. Pearce, on the whole hair issue.  Hair testing seems to come up a lot for discussion and debate when we are discussing this issue.  It seems to be the better of the three samples for testing and seems to give a more historical reading of what substances may have been administered farther back or previously in the horse's career.  Even in humans, one hears of somebody testing clear but if one uses a hair sample, it will show if they have a history of taking substances.  I assume it is the same with horses.  While the numbers the IHRB is testing are good and impressive, perhaps less is more.  If we were doing less and concentrating more on hair, would we perhaps be coming up with better results?  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on that. </p><p>Based on the accusations, for want of a better word, to have ten adverse analytical findings, all of which were not of substances that are fully banned, would portray the image that things are rosy in the garden but unfortunately, as I said, we must prove they are at this juncture.</p><p>In that regard, perhaps Dr. Pearse will comment a little bit more on the actual testing.  Are the same substances tested for in the Irish samples as would be in the British Horseracing Authority, BHA, samples?  I know the laboratory caters for both Irish and UK racing.  Is his brief to test or look for the same substances in both jurisdictions or do we have a different test?</p><p>In addition, perhaps he would enlighten us a little more about how the drug developers seem to be able to stay ahead of the testing.  How quickly and adequately are the powers on the other side of the fence developing new drugs for which, perhaps, we are not even testing?  Mr. Egan or Dr. Hillyer might also comment on the recent food issue that was detected in France but which did not come up in any of the Irish tests.  Could they explain that?  Are the French and English tests more severe than ours?  Could there be an issue with our tests?</p><p> I have covered a great deal so I will give the witnesses the opportunity to respond.  If there is time at the end of the meeting, I may come in again.</p></speech>

We are very frustrated and disappointed by the recent allegations.  In our responses today, we will set out the factual details in order to set the record straight.  I will make one point before I hand over to my colleague, Dr. Hillyer, namely, that any information we get is assessed and acted upon.  That is the first thing I wish to say, but I will hand over to Dr. Hillyer because there are many technical issues which she and Dr. Pearce will be better able to address than me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.288" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lynn Hillyer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021070800002#D00600"><p>I echo Mr. Kavanagh's and Mr. Egan's thanks for the invitation to this meeting and for the opportunity to set the record straight.  As a veterinary surgeon and a scientist, it grates me when the truth is not reported correctly.  I am hoping that we can set some of the facts straight this morning, and to clarify and explain matters.  That is what we are here to do.</p> <p>  Before I deal with some of the questions, which were detailed and extensive and which I look forward to working through, I echo the three points Mr. Egan made.  Every sample that we take is analysed at LGC, with the exception of the B samples which are analysed at Laboratoire des Courses Hippiques, LCH, in France.  Every finding is followed up unequivocally.  That goes some way to answering whether there is a database or record of all the results.  There is.  It is sitting on our systems.  Third, there has been much talk of our contracted laboratory being somehow substandard.  That is not the case.  We work with one of the best laboratories in the world.  I have worked with it for some time.  There is a history and a trust there, which is very important when one is working in partnership with experts.  The laboratory won the contract for our work in 2018 through a public procurement process.  It is leading in the world, but I will let Dr. Pearce speak to that.</p> <p>  On the questions, I will start with one that was directly for me to answer.  With regard to the mucking out the stables headline, I do not write the headlines.  I was asked to do the interview and, in the interests of transparency and talking about my favourite subject in the world, which is anti-doping, I accepted the invitation.  To go back a little in time, I was brought into the new position of head of anti-doping and chief veterinary officer as has been set out and according to the recommendations of an independent anti-doping task force.  I say "independent" because it comprised stakeholders who had many different views.  It was not the Turf Club as it was then.  In 2018, those recommendations were reinforced again by the industry.  The industry has signed up to wanting this to be done.</p> <p>  I was appointed in 2016 and we immediately began to make changes.  In no particular order, it was clear to me that the out-of-competition testing needed to increase in line with best international practice.  We moved from 7% in 2016 to 18% in 2019.  It is now approximately 28%.  That is best international practice.  These animals spend the majority of their time at home and it is very important that we have coverage in that area.  The access that we have now, since 21 May, means that my team can go to test any thoroughbred on the island.  That is unparalleled.  I have a team out this morning doing exactly that, what it is meant to be doing.  The mucking out headline was not something I would have chosen.  I have great respect for what has gone before, but there is no doubt that we have moved things on.  The main evidence of that was in 2018 when the IHRB was formed, as distinct from the Turf Club and the International Horse Sports Confederation, IHSC.</p> <p>  The results of all the tests we carry out are logged, catalogued and documented to within an inch of their lives.  They have to be.  That is our process.  There is a continuous chain of custody from the moment the sample is taken on the horse side, and witnessed by the representative of the trainer or the person responsible, through to when it is received anonymously at the laboratory, analysed and reported.  From the moment it is taken, it is a number.  It is not a name, a horse or a person.  It is a number, and it has to remain that way in order that any decisions that are made along the way in terms of further analysis or whatever might need to be done are made absolutely anonymously.</p> <p>  As regards reporting, yes, all results are reported.  The vast majority of them are negative.  The positives or the adverse analytical findings, to use the full term, are always reported.  We have had instances where a drug can be detected in part.  It is a so-called screening finding.  It is part of the fingerprint, but it does not confirm to a full result.  Those are also reported back.</p></speech>

The reason, and Dr. Pearce may explain it further, is that we get a very good window on what is happening with the horse.</p><p>Blood represents a much smaller window of time.  Each of these matrices has its strengths and weaknesses.  Some substances show better in blood and some will show better in urine.</p><p> Regarding hair, we started administering substances to experimental horses and researching on hair some 15 years ago.  Hair has been a research tool for 15 or 20 years where horses are concerned.  The Senator is right, in that hair testing is used in respect of people.  With horses, we have the advantage of having much more hair - mane hair and tail hair, which can go back years.  It was clearly going to be an exciting opportunity to be able to understand better how long we can detect drugs in our horses.</p><p> Operationally, we have been using hair in Ireland since 2018.  I was using it across the water before then.  It is important that Dr. Pearce speak to the committee on this because he is the expert.  From an operational and regulatory point of view, hair gives us a larger window of time, more confidence in the blood and urine results that we find and more of an understanding of how long the drug has been in the horse or for how long the horse has been exposed to it.  It also allows us to take samples in a non-invasive way.  Taking a blood sample has to be done by a veterinary surgeon.  Taking a hair or urine sample can be done by a non-vet, which makes it more applicable across a wider field in terms of our strategy.</p><p> The straight answer to the question of which of blood, hair and urine is better is that they are all good in their own way.  The best way to use them is together in a complementary fashion and to be careful about when to use which one.  We have used all three successfully to prosecute cases or to see cases through to a proper conclusion.  In every case, the hair has added value, the blood has added value and the urine has added value.  In the ideal world of limitless resources and time, we would take blood, hair and urine from every horse, but what we have to do is use the three together strategically.  On the racecourse, we typically take blood and urine for a period of time as a period of target testing.  If we want to follow up on a case, we take a mixture of the matrices.  I hope I have answered the question, but I will leave it to Dr. Pearce to go into more detail.</p><p> The only other matter I wish to comment on is the idea of less being more.  I am a great believer in less being more.  It is about quality, not quantity.  We are keen to try to do both in our anti-doping strategy, though.  Not only have we increased the numbers - the numbers for June were significant - but we have had to balance out an absence of activity earlier in the year due to the pandemic.  We had to be cognisant of the landscape within which we were working, but we have made up for that in June by taking advantage of our authorised officer status from 21 May.  It is not just about numbers, though.  It is a question of what is being tested for and how it is tested.  This means that the expertise of laboratories must be relied on.</p><p> Without further ado, and if it is okay, I will pass across to Dr. Pearce and allow him to fill the committee in on the technical laboratory side of matters.</p></speech>

We have been in this support role since 2018 and we work according to operational documents, which are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis.  We also have business meetings with the IHRB.</p> <p>  LGC is a world-leading racing chemistry lab and has extensive animal sports testing and research and development programmes that have been developed over many years.  We are well known for our pioneering research and continued investment in detecting the use of banned substances such as anabolic steroids, which have been a specialism of ours for many years, and erythropoietins, or EPOs, which have large biological molecules and now feature strongly.  As Dr. Hillyer mentioned, we have introduced many novel testing methods, including hair testing.</p> <p>  I will pick up on some of the points made regarding hair testing.  It is a useful matrix for performing an analysis because it provides a long window of detection.  Typically, blood provides a window of days or sometimes a week.  With urine, the period is generally a little longer.  Urine has an advantage, in that drugs and so on tend to concentrate in urine, meaning that there is more to be seen in urine.  Hair provides a long window of opportunity to detect.  The concentrations of drugs found in hair are generally very low because it relies on the drugs circulating in the animal's system and then being incurred in the hair.  There is a large advantage in terms of the window of detection, but the concentrations are small.  It has only been in recent years after the analytical technology advanced to the point where we could detect such very low concentrations that hair testing has become a useful addition to urine and blood testing.  As Dr. Hillyer mentioned, though, since the concentrations in urine and blood are generally higher and they are much more convenient matrices for testing, it will be some time before hair testing comes alongside urine and blood testing completely.  Urine and blood testing will always be the main matrices for the foreseeable future, supported by hair.</p> <p>  I wish to emphasise the large amount of international collaboration that goes on around research and development programmes.  LGC is part of the Association of Official Racing Chemists and the European Horserace Scientific Liaison Committee.  We also have representation on the advisory council of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, IFHA, and in the US, the scientific advisory committee of the Racing and Medication Testing Consortium, RMTC.  The laboratory is well placed in terms of its interaction and collaboration with racing interests around the world.</p> <p>  I will pick up on a couple of the questions that were raised.  The matter of zilpaterol was raised in terms of LGC's detection capability versus LCH's.  LGC and LCH are two of the five IFHA reference laboratories and we are seen as being at the vanguard of racing laboratories.  We are top of the tree, as it were.  However, it has to be remembered that what both laboratories are detecting is close to 3,000 different substances.  A large array of chemical molecules are being detected as the drugs themselves and after they have metabolised.  Many of those chemicals are medications or known and naturally occurring contaminants.  Associated with these are reporting and screening limits or international thresholds.  There is a number of the 3,000 where there are definite concentrations that all laboratories-----</p></speech>

It had not really been raised as an issue in Europe prior to 2020, which was the first time zilpaterol was detected by a laboratory as a feed contaminant in Europe.  Zilpaterol is a banned substance.</p><p>As I said, laboratories are encouraged to report concentrations as low as possible for such substances.  Modification of doping control labs is required in order to detect many hundreds of such prohibited substances, particularly if it is constant, but every lab uses a range of what we call multi-residue methods.  There is potential within those methods to focus on particular areas and drugs but there are usually trade-offs.  A lab has to work conscious of the fact it is trying to cover as many substances as possible in this multi-residue method.  It simply cannot set up methods to detect 3,000 separate compounds.  It has to bolt them together in multi-residue methods.</p><p> Prior to 2020, LGC's routine methods were capable of detecting zilpaterol in, typically, two to three weeks in urine.  That is how the method was set up.  When LGC was made aware of LCH's findings, we quickly assessed, in collaboration with LCH, our detection capabilities.  We discovered that while we were detecting at about one part per billion, which is a very low concentration, typically giving coverage for three to three and a half weeks, LCH had better methods set up, at about five times greater sensitivity.  As soon as we were made aware of that issue, we took it on board and adjusted our method in order that we could be at least as sensitive as LCH, in the space of 48 hours.  At the same time, there was a great deal of international interest.  The issue was discussed at the advisory council of the IFHA, and within EHSLC.  Internationally, within a matter of weeks, agreed reporting levels were decided for zilpaterol in both urine and blood.  LGC, LCH, the other European labs and labs throughout the world are now operating to those reporting levels.  That is a good example, in many ways, of how communication and collaboration among the regulators and testing laboratories can adjust to an incident or threat, and that is exactly what we do.  All the time, through the various racing and analytical bodies we are involved with, we pick up intelligence, act on it and adjust and refine our methodologies in order that we counter these incidents and the new threats to the integrity of racing and the safety of competitors.</p><p> That is how it all works.  It works through communication.  LGC, as one of the world's major racing laboratories, is at the heart of much of that communication and collaboration, in both our testing programmes and our extensive research programmes.</p></speech>

I put on record my esteem for the success of Irish horse racing and echo Senator Paul Daly's comments that the objective of this committee is to ensure that the international reputation for which we are renowned will be protected and enhanced at all stages.</p> <p>  Mr. Egan concluded his opening remarks by stating that there is no systemic cheating within the horse racing industry, and it is important to state clearly that the committee has no evidence that there is.  Does he believe there is any cheating at all?</p></speech>

As for whether there is cheating, people will always try to go close to the edge in any sport.  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that there have been four cases in the past three years of anabolic steroids being found, to pick a drug most people would associate with cheating.  Of those four, two were completely natural and normal for the animals concerned.  It is important to understand that the nature of the drug and why it is present is just as important as the type of drug.</p> <p>  When I took up the position of head of legal, licensing and compliance, alongside another new position, I was passionate about ensuring we put in an investigative structure for every case.  Every analytical finding is investigated because it is one thing to say a drug is there but it is another to understand why.</p> <p>  I am not really a figures person but sometimes it is important to-----</p></speech>

Our guests mentioned that blood and urine samples are routinely taken from winners.  Is it the case that both types of sample are taken?  My understanding is that it is primarily urine samples that are taken and that blood is taken only when urine has not been passed.</p></speech>

We can take both in every case, and the Deputy is correct that we more usually take urine because it gives a percentage.</p></speech>

The urine is part of the picture.  When we take out-of-competition sampling, it is typically the other way around.  It is blood, with hair in addition.  As I outlined earlier, all these matrices are important; none is better than the other.  They do the job according to what we are trying to detect on the day.  On race day, it is important that we have a deep, extensive coverage of what is present.  When we take out-of-competition samples, because they are unannounced and people do not know we are coming, the blood sampling together with the hair sample is, generally, the correct combination.</p></speech>

The current chairman of the board is Mr. Harry McCalmont and the vice-chairman is Mr. Martin O'Donnell.  The board meets approximately times per annum and is heavily involved in policy, but it is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the IHRB.  That is a matter for the executives.</p></speech>

The reason I ask is that the US anti-doping agency is to put in place a new governing body comprising nine members, five of whom will be completely independent of the industry, while four will be experts of the industry who have no current engagement.</p><p>Does Mr. Egan see the merit of that type of structure whereby there would be a clear difference between the industry and the governing body?</p></speech>

The situation in the USA, where there are 38 or so racing commissions, is completely different from here.  Our board sets policy on drug testing and our policy is based on what is happening internationally.  If a horse comes to run in Ireland, the sample is tested at one of the five IFHA-certified laboratories, which is LGC.  Similarly, if a horse runs in Hong Kong, it is tested by the Hong Kong laboratories.  There is uniformity in drug testing and policy on drug testing is similar across all the main racing jurisdictions.</p></speech>

I will briefly outline the position as we are tight on time.  As Mr. Kavanagh said, the IHRB is solely and independently responsible for making and enforcing the rules of racing.  We are responsible for employing racing officials, doping control and forensics and representing Ireland internationally in the context of our functions.  I cannot remember our fifth responsibility.  It is all set out in the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  We interact regularly with HRI.  As Mr. Kavanagh said, we meet on a quarterly basis to go through our budgets and accounts.  Horse Racing Ireland provides our funding and it is important our funding is spent in accordance with the budget we have submitted.  If we see something coming down the line which has financial implications, which is not budgeted for, we liaise with HRI.  We are in touch with HRI at least two or three times a week on budgetary or integrity related matters.  In the anti-doping area, HRI has been a great support.  As Mr. Kavanagh said, we are pushing an open door on anti-doping with respect to funding and everything else, and that is something we welcome.</p></speech>

That cascades down to an annual budget, which is approved by the board of Horse Racing Ireland.  As Mr. Egan said, there is a quarterly review meeting at executive level.  Aside from that, there is day to day contact to do with racing.  The functions are set out in legislation.  They are separate but they impact heavily on each other.  We would talk to each other on a day to day basis.  Certainly in the run up to today's meeting we would have been in touch with each other regularly.</p></speech>

HRI gave the IHRB funding towards CCTV coverage which has not been carried out.

CCTV is one part of the process that would assist.  We welcome HRI&rsquo;s commitment to provide funding for CCTV cameras in stable yards on Irish racecourses.  We are working towards having the cameras in place on all racecourses prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  This will provide an additional layer of security to our existing measures.  The Deputy is right to say that money had been allocated previously to cover a small number of racecourses but that work did not proceed as the money was allocated elsewhere.  We very much welcome a state-of-the-art CCTV system, which is the subject of public procurement and the tenders are in the process of being evaluated.</p></speech>

Mr. Egan was right in what he said.  The process is very simple.  In broad terms, information will come to any one of us, whether it be one of my team on the racecourse today, Mr. Egan, somebody in HRI, a trainer, stable staff  and so on.  The information can come in via a number of routes.  Once it lands on someone's desk in our organisation it will come in to either me or to the head of the legal licensing compliance, Dr. Cliodhna Guy.  Dr. Guy manages the confidential hotline.  The matter is dealt with unequivocally.  I need to be clear about this.  Sometimes information can be scribbled on the back of an envelope, it can a recorded taped conversation and sometimes I will receive envelopes in the post with leaflets of products.  We do not care how it comes in.  The important point is that it comes in and is assessed.  We need to be careful to differentiate between information coming in and hearsay.  I am not saying we disregard either.  We consider everything but we have to process it and assess it.  That is basically converting information into intelligence.  We work very closely with the BHA, which manages the database on which the intelligence is logged.  Every single piece of information is logged.</p> <p>  A piece of information could come in today which, on its own, would not seem to make much sense but it might make sense in two months&rsquo; time when it is put together with another piece of information.  That is how we work.  That is the way modern anti-doping is dealt with..  The Deputy mentioned Travis Tygart of the US Anti-Doping Agency, USADA.  I have had quite a number of dealings with that agency in the past.  It has stated repeatedly that information coming in, for example from whistleblowers who are prepared to step up and give that information, is really important.</p> <p> I will give an example of where information that came in from another racing authority was acted upon last year.  It links in with Senator Paul Daly's comments, to which I wanted to respond, about having to prove our innocence.  One of the things that rankled the most was reading last Sunday&rsquo;s article about the six Irish horses that were alleged to have anabolic steroids on board and the claim that we were doing nothing about it, but the opposite was the case.  The minute that information came into the BHA it acted on it.  It communicated with us.  We were across it and were prepared to act.  The BHA did the most extensive piece of the work I have ever seen, apart from investigation of an adverse finding, by going into that within an inch of its life.  It analysed tail and mane hair, and samples repeatedly at LGC Laboratories.  I will not go into again where LGC stand in the world of hair and anabolic steroid chemistry and nothing was found.  That is not a criticism of the other laboratory involved, but this is expert stuff.  LGC has been dealing with anabolic steroid profiles since 1963.  It knows the difference between the normal profile of a cult compared with an animal that has been administered an anabolic steroid.  It has done it for us numerous times in investigations.  It has dealt with live samples.</p><p>What I am trying to say is staying ahead of that, being on top of that and dealing with information in a timely fashion is critical because if that had returned a positive result, we would have been in those yards immediately on unannounced visits.  It would not have just been us; it would have been us in conjunction with the Department.  With anything like that we act with our colleagues in the investigations division of the Department.</p></speech>

I work with my colleagues in the security division to interview and to assess the information.  My part, as one would expect, it more limited to the horse side, the drugs side and the chemistry side.  In that particular case, I assessed the amount of acepromazine, ACP, present in the horse in the sample against research data to give us an idea of the window of time within which we believed it would have been exposed to or administered the drug and so on.  CCTV clearly was not in place and I am not going to go back over that ground again.  What I will say on CCTV, having been involved for 15-odd years across the water in anti-doping investigation------</p></speech>

The statistic I was going to give before we stopped is we have had 60 cases to 2018.  In 55 of those we have been very sure of the source of drug.  That is a percentage which exceeds that of most racing authorities.  I would love to identify the categoric source in every single case but that is just not possible.  We will do what we can and we will not stop until we have done everything we can.  As I said, in 55 of 60 cases we are very clear we know what has happened.  Viking Hoard was one of the ones where we have to hold our hands up as we did not get to the end of the line.  That is it.</p></speech>

I am indeed the person who sent in the correspondence after reading of a leading horse trainer in some of the national newspapers.  I got very concerned because I have a very keen interest in horse racing, which is a very important industry to Ireland and I do not want to see it going down the same way other industries have.  Beginning with Mr. Egan, I do not want him to pass the questions over to anybody else.  I ask he answer them himself.  He said the information he gets is assessed and acted upon.  I wonder whether it is anything like the amount of information I have got over the last number of weeks since I sent in this correspondence.  I have been absolutely horrified and am very concerned.  I am more concerned by the day about what is happening within the IHRB and maybe what is not happening within it.  People who have been contacting Mr. Egan's organisation are saying information is not being assessed or acted upon.  I have to believe these people who come to me and the witnesses have to prove themselves not guilty.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions about the IHRB accounts for 2018 and 2019.  I have been contacted by people in the industry who are very concerned by what they have seen in the board's accounts.  Why was the budget for the forensic equine unit cut by almost &euro;500,000 between 2018 and 2019?  Mr. Egan has repeatedly stated the IHRB increased its testing for prohibited drugs but the figures for this show this to not be true.  Why did the racecourse samples decrease between 2017 and 2019?  In 2017 there were 3,074, in 2018 3,034 and in 2019 3,004.  I ask Mr. Egan to answer those and then I have further questions for him.</p></speech>

The first question was on information coming into the IHRB and not being acted upon.  I can categorically state if information comes into the IHRB, it is assessed and followed up on.  We have no reason not to follow up information if it comes in to us.  Dr. Hillyer referred to the structure that is in place.  I am going to talk about another issue for a second, where we got information recently and it lead to a matter being investigated and dealt with by the referrals committee.  We got information from a third party.  All information is assessed and followed up so if people have information, it is, as I have said before on many occasions, incumbent on them to give us that information and we will act on it.  It will be assessed, fed into our database or whatever and acted upon.  That is the way we operate.</p> <p>  The second question related to the accounts and anti-doping.  There was a transfer from our original laboratory back in 2018 to LGC.  LGC was appointed as part of the public procurement process and we felt that as Ireland was a world leader in horse racing we needed a laboratory which was a world leader.  In order to terminate the existing contractual relationship that was in place at the time, we entered into a mediation process which resulted in a figure being paid.  That was included in the 2018 accounts, which is why there appears to have been a reduction between 2018 and 2019.  On the number of racecourse samples that are taken, as Dr. Hillyer said earlier that is related to the number of winners and we also test other horses randomly.  Again, Dr. Hillyer is the expert on that and I would like her to comment on that specific point because it is her area.</p></speech>

There has never been a positive finding where no action was taken.  I made that point in my opening statement and want to make it again.  I thank Deputy Kehoe for giving me the opportunity to make it.  I can categorically state there has never been a positive finding with no action taken.  I think there are in the region of ten hearings waiting to be held at the moment.  They are in the process of investigation and we are expecting them to be held in the next month or two, certainly in the next two or three months.  I think there are ten in the system.</p></speech>

Why does the IHRB not disclose the salaries of its staff?  The board gets, I think, &euro;10 million of taxpayers' money from the HRI.  The board has no competitor in the game.  There is no commercial sensitivity here that I can see.  Maybe Mr. Egan can outline how there is some.</p><p>Mr. Kavanagh said HRI gives the IHRB &euro;10 million annually to carry out its functions.

If we were to disclose salaries it would be easily identifiable who is earning what.  The other point is that while HRI provides funding, there is also another source of income from licensing revenue and so on which is taken into account under legislation when determining our budget.  We are not fully funded by public funds, but we are substantially funded by public funds.</p></speech>

The key point in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion is that he said the accounts gave a true and fair view of the state of the IHRB's finances.  All money that was received by the IHRB has been account for.  The audit only covers certain areas.  It covers the financial aspects.  It is not surprising that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not express any opinion on areas that he did not cover.  I want to stress that there was a clean audit opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If there were any issues with the accounts, that would not have been the case.</p></speech>

There is a training scheme in place for all race day stewards.  It takes about 12 months to qualify.  It is important that all race day stewards are appropriately trained because they carry out a very important role.  In terms of value for money, I want to stress that race day stewards receive no payment or travel expenses.  They are not paid.  Many of them sit on IHRB disciplinary committees.  We are fortunate that we have a lot of experts in the industry.  We have experts from all walks of life who voluntarily give their time to the IHRB for the benefit of the sport.  That is often overlooked.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the members who do that.  The industry recognises the contribution that they make.</p></speech>

Many people have said to me that the IHRB is not fit for purpose.  I am only repeating what has been said to me.  I would welcome Mr. Egan's opinion on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware of the huge strides we have made in regard to anti-doping.  We have unique powers and authorised officers status.  No other authority has that status.  We can walk into any stable yard and test any thoroughbred horse.  We have a fair disciplinary system.  We were challenged in the Supreme Court in 2013.  We won that case.  In fairness to the person who challenged us he said there was no issue with the fairness or impartiality of the system.  I am proud of the IHRB and the work it does.  I have represented the IHRB internationally on many committees.  The fact that it is progressive is reflected in it being represented on every international committee in racing.  That is important for the benefit of Irish racing.  I am proud of the work that the IHRB does.</p></speech>

Can the HRI confirm that all gallop fees in the past 12 months have been properly accounted for?  The second question is to Dr. Hillyer.  Prior to arrangements being made for the IHRB to visit non-licensed yards, was it aware that some trainers - this information was given to me anonymously - were moving horses to non-licensed yards where they may have been getting drug treatment?  Was the IHRB aware of this abuse and does it concentrate its efforts on trainers engaged in this practice?</p></speech>

The next speaker is Deputy Michael Collins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1461" speakername="Michael Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021070800002#J03600"><p>I welcome our witnesses.  I have two questions.  Horse racing is a great sport enjoyed by so many.  I have no issue with the Government providing funding for horse racing, as it does in respect of greyhound racing and so on, as long as the funding is divided equally among all sectors of horse racing down to ground level.  I am not big into horse racing.  Farming and fishing are the main areas of interest in my part of the country.  At the same time, I do attend local trotting races in the Durrus, Goleen and Drimoleague roads and in Bandon.  These clubs have huge difficulty meeting insurance costs and so on.  I would like to see the funding being provided by Government reaching the people on the ground as well as the people at the top.</p> <p>  As I said, I do not have massive skin in the game but I have a careful eye on what is going on.  There are a lot of issues in this area that need to be properly explained for the sake of accountability in respect of taxpayers' money.  I believe the IHRB should be dismantled and that an independent policing body needs to be established to police and regulate Irish horse racing.  This body could be answerable to the HRI, the Government and this committee.  I am sure at this stage it has become obvious that there are serious issues within the IHRB that are unacceptable and should not be allowed to continue.</p> <p>  As I said I have two questions, the first is to Mr. Kavanagh and the second to Dr. Hillyer.  If any other witnesses wish to answer them they are welcome to do so.  Is it acceptable that a self-elected gentlemen's club which receives Government funding of up to &euro;9 million last year is not answerable to anybody?</p><p> My second question is about the steroids situation.  Are there any current positive results not dealt with?</p></speech>

I do not think it is fair to say the IHRB is not answerable to anybody.  As Mr. Egan has explained, it is required to account monthly to Horse Racing Ireland for the spending of its funds, it is audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General and there is a regular, day-to-day relationship with Horse Racing Ireland.  I outlined at the start of the meeting the legislative framework that applies to horse racing.  That is a matter for legislators to set out.  We work within the framework we have.  As I said, the structure has delivered an industry which can be and is a source of pride for the country.  It is also a sector in which Ireland performs exceedingly well internationally.  It is a sector in which Ireland has natural advantages: our climate, our soil structure, our people and a history of political support, which has created a very strong structure.  It is a valuable industry.  The structure is set out in legislation and we apply it, but I do not accept the suggestion that the IHRB is not answerable to anybody.</p> <p>  The second question is, I think, one for Dr. Hillyer.</p></speech>

The answer is "No" - not a hint, nothing.</p></speech>

If I had done so just as a guest, as an ordinary Member of the Oireachtas, what Deputy Ring says would be true: I would have had to wait until all members of the committee had had their chance.  I am here, however, having substituted for a member of the same group as Senator Victor Boyhan.  He is a full member of the committee and, under Standing Orders, in that context, I sit as though I were a member of the committee.  It is a different situation from my just turning up as an ordinary Member of the Oireachtas without substituting for a member of the committee.  That is my understanding of the Standing Orders, and this was checked with the clerk yesterday.  I am not seeking to jump in ahead of anyone - I am not entitled to do so - but I am here as a member of the committee.</p></speech>

I will address my first question to Mr. Kavanagh.  From what he said a moment ago, I understand the IHRB has a level of accountability to the taxpayer, but is it the same level of accountability as HRI has?  The IHRB will get, if I understand correctly, &euro;9.6 million this year.  Certainly, &euro;9 million out of &euro;13 million is taxpayers' money going to the IHRB through HRI.  Is the IHRB as accountable to the taxpayer as HRI is?  Is the taxpayer in a better position to know, for example, the salaries in Mr. Kavanagh's organisation than the salaries in the IHRB?</p></speech>

It is set out in legislation.  I understand that the chief executive of the IHRB since 2016 - it was the Turf Club at the time - is liable to appear before an Oireachtas committee when requested and to answer to it.  I do not believe the chief executive is an Accounting Officer in the same sense that I am an Accounting Officer of a State body, but the IHRB is not a State-----</p></speech>

That is an interesting and important point.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the Turf Club and the IHRB.  The IHRB is an emanation of the Turf Club.  It is effectively a self-selecting organisation that includes in some cases the owners of horses.  How is it acceptable for an organisation that is a self-selecting club to be the regulatory organisation for that sector, particularly when it comes to something as sensitive as integrity and drug testing?  Is that not an anachronism?</p></speech>

Every member of the organisation has to declare conflicts of interest.  That comes up at every single meeting, and members opt out if there is anything which may present a conflict of interest.</p></speech>

Perception is everything, however, just as in a court justice is not just to be done but has to be seen to be done.  There are examples internationally of regulatory bodies for this industry in which nobody who is involved in owning, breeding or training can have hand, act or part.  To take an example and a perfectly legitimate case, the IHRB's own chairman, Mr. McCalmont, was reported as having sold a yearling for &euro;1.3 million to Coolmore.  There is nothing wrong with that, but is it not wrong that a person with a financial interest in the industry could have any role in the regulatory body, even if he or she is not in an executive role?  Is it not a bad look?</p></speech>

To refer to a person operating in the industry and to his private business is not appropriate, so I would like you to rephrase your question, please.</p></speech>

Would it be inappropriate for anybody who is in any way involved in selling or trading with horses to have any role in a regulatory body with responsibility for anti-doping?  I am not suggesting that they are involved in the executive or the day-to-day business, but am referring to the perception of things and the perception of this being a clean situation.  Given that the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, is a self-selecting body and its directors are not appointed by the Government, is there not something out of date and unhealthy about the whole appearance of that?</p></speech>

The majority of people involved in the IHRB have expertise that is important for horse racing.  I reiterate that we have a very strict conflict-of-interest policy.  Anyone who has a conflict of interest does not get involved in any decision that may be of benefit to them.  I believe there are some 100 stewards around the State.  I am not sure how familiar the Senator is with horse racing, but if he looked at the stewards' inquiry reports at the end of any given day, he will see that a "Mr. Whoever" had absented himself from that inquiry.  They all stand out.  The advantage we have in using such expertise is that we have very good experts available to us and it is beneficial to the sport to have that expertise.  One cannot have experts in sport who do not understand the sport.</p></speech>

I follow it somewhat vicariously but never unwillingly.  From all that I see it is clear to me that racing is a family.  In any such family situation there must be a scrupulousness about keeping certain people away from decision-making.  The concern is that the IHRB is, effectively, a closed shop.  It is a closed shop that is getting taxpayers' money.  Some of the people involved in it might well be owners and people who are involved in the buying and selling of bloodstock.  I put it to Mr. Egan that there are examples internationally of regulatory bodies in this type of situation where the directors involved cannot have hand, act or part in owning, buying or selling.</p> <p>  Mr. Bolger is, quite clearly, a thorn in the side of IHRB right now.

Claims are made by people who have a high reputation, people of long standing in the industry, people who have a completely clean record, and people who say that they have moral certainty, that drug taking is the number one problem.  The representatives from IHRB come in here and say that they are frustrated and disappointed by recent allegations.  With everything we have heard so far the IHRB has been telling us it has the powers, and that because of that there is no systemic problem of drug taking.  All that the IHRB has proven to us is that it has not found evidence itself of the systemic problems.  If I am to ask the witnesses about out-of-competition testing, only now is that happening.  If I ask if there is CCTV at racetracks, the answer is not yet.  The detailed equine anti-doping report to be presented twice yearly was published for the first time last week.  It seems to me like the IHRB is getting serious now and that the board might owe a debt to the very prominent people of high reputation who have been expressing concern about what they have said is going on in the industry.

We have fantastic resources.  I have a fantastic team.  It is almost being seen as a criticism that we are saying this, but that is the reality and the truth of it.  We can always get better.  Every anti-doping authority in the world will always want to get better.  It is absolutely true that we have gone up a gear since we received our warrant cards on 21 May.  That was always going to happen.  It was a coincidence that this current process is happening, which we welcome.  I am looking forward to the next six months, the next year and the next 18 months.  We have more to do and, as Mr. Egan has said a number of times, the more that we can rely on people in the industry to come forward without fear and knowing that their information will be treated in confidence, is the most important thing of all to me.  It is the most important thing of all.</p></speech>

It was headline stuff.  We ask or tell our lab to detect as much as it can of prohibited at all times substances, which are the drugs that should not be there.  That is exactly what happened here.  With any of these prohibited at all times drugs there will always be one lab moving ahead a little bit quicker then another, and that is exactly what happened here.  Perhaps Dr. Pearce would like to step in briefly now.</p></speech>

My issue is what happened in Ireland arising out of that case.  This case is associated with the withdrawal of certain horses from a race card.  What are the consequences?

Two laboratories were doing their job.  The Laboratoire des Courses Hippiques, LCH, was doing its job detecting what it thought it should detect, and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, LGC, was doing its job detecting what it thought it should detect.  With regard to our role in this as the regulator, the minute the news broke we were on the telephone immediately to our laboratory and then to our colleagues in France and Britain, in that order, and we convened immediate meetings.  I mean immediately, whatever time it was at night.  We then triggered an international meeting of the powerhouse of international anti-doping decision-making which is the advisory council of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, IFHA.  This was led by the chairman Mr. Terry Wong, who is the lead analyst in Hong Kong.  There were actions and outcomes from that.  It is very important to stress that nationally I also worked with colleagues within the Department and with the feed manufacturers involved.  It was a very extensive and very rapid process.</p></speech>

Dr. Hillyer heard what I said about the regulatory body and the fact that it is, in effect, a closed shop.  It has no directors appointed by the State.

It might be worth mentioning that I come from a background of having worked in an independent regulatory authority in the form of the Jockey Club before it became part of the BHA.  I support wholeheartedly the concept of an independent regulator.  It is crucial.</p> <p>  As Mr. Egan said, there are experts in the form of members and stewards who benefit the organisation.  However, I need to be crystal clear that they have absolutely nothing to do with our disciplinary or regulatory processes, or our processing or knowledge of cases.  There is no knowledge of cases.  The first a member will hear of a case is when it is presented to the referrals panel.  That will usually be the first time the board will hear about it. </p> <p>  The only time the board will be made aware of such a matter is if it has already been processed, investigated, documented and catalogued.  The board is made aware of a case if it has a particular profile or has a particular significance that it needs know about.  The Zilpaterol event was something the board clearly needed to be briefed on.</p></speech>

Dr. Hillyer said 2,449 samples were taken in the first six months of the year, 28% of which were taken as part of the out-of-competition testing programme.  Is there a list of who was tested?  How do we get that list?  Has it been published?  If it has not been published, why not?  I was advised that certain yards are constantly tested while others are not.  I would like Dr. Hillyer to respond to that point first.</p></speech>

There is a list of sample codes which can be decoded to give a list of horses.  In all honesty, that is not done unless we have an adverse finding.  I ask the Deputy to remind me of his second question.</p></speech>

I have a database, which we have developed over the past couple of years, of all our licensed trainers and handlers.  I use a traffic light system of red, amber and green to rank them.  A red yard could be one where there has perhaps been a positive test, there is a concern or intelligence information has come in.  A so-called red yard will be visited more frequently than a so-called green yard.  Any yard that has never been inspected will be a so-called red yard, by definition, because we need to go in and establish whether there is a post-licensing issue.</p></speech>

As Mr. Egan explained, anything that is received, however much it may not make sense at the time and no matter how small or large the information is, has to be logged because we do not know what it could lead to in two weeks, months or years when put together with other information.  It is really important.  It takes a lot for somebody to pick up the phone, write a note, put a stamp on an envelope and send things to me.  It is imperative that we take note of such correspondence.</p></speech>

Most of the time, the gates are open.  As regards warrant cards, we made a policy decision that all of our inspections will be under the warrant cards, rather than going in under other powers.  We are proportionate.  If we have reason to believe there is an issue - and I have been on inspections with the Department where that has been the case - measures are taken, such as proper reconnaissance, including of back gates, as well as vehicles not being allowed to leave and that type of thing.</p></speech>

The reality is that we were affected by Covid and had to be sensitive to it.  When restrictions eased in February, we were able to do a little more, but then went back to a minimum level of emergency-only, if one likes, testing in March.  We do have plans to increase the rate of testing.  As regards when, where and how that will be done, it will depend on intelligence and risk, as I stated.</p></speech>

This is why we have shifted our focus from 9% out-of-competition testing in 2016 to nearly 30% now.  That is a direction of travel that I wish to maintain.  The Deputy is absolutely right that the horses spend most of their time in the yards and that is where we have to focus our efforts.

I gave great latitude to members and witnesses during the meeting because this is an extremely important topic and I want it to be fully understood and to give all members an opportunity to contribute.  If we were in non-Covid times, we would continue the meeting for another hour or two but we are restricted to two hours because of Covid.  I propose that we reconvene on Tuesday week to finish our discussions.  Is that acceptable to everyone?</p></speech>

I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place at which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirement and, therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I will explain some of the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the House regarding references members may make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present, or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, they are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p> This is our third meeting on direct provision.  We have met the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, and the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon.  I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to our witnesses today: Mr. John Lannon, chief executive officer, CEO, of Doras and Mr. Nick Henderson, CEO of the Irish Refugee Council.  We have received an apology from Ms Aideen Roche from Doras who cannot attend.  Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose we publish their opening statements on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  The committee also welcomes the recent White Paper on Ending Direct Provision published by the Government.  Our witnesses should confine their opening statements for five to ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members.  Each member will be given approximately five minutes, which will give them a chance to come back in with a second round of questions if they wish.  Members may speak more than once.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Lannon to make his opening statement.  As we cannot hear him, I will ask Mr. Henderson to make his opening statement.  There seems to be a technical problem in the committee room.  I propose we suspend for five minutes.</p></speech>

I am glad you can hear me now.  We thank the committee for the invitation to discuss issues relating to direct provision.  For committee members who do not know us, Doras is an independent NGO that works to promote and protect the rights of protection applicants and migrants.  We do that through direct support and advocacy.  Our work covers immigration, international protection, refugee resettlement, anti-trafficking, integration, and anti-racism.  We support more than 1,200 people a year through our advice and information centre in Limerick.  The majority are either in the international protection system or from a refugee background.</p> <p>  In my opening statement, I will focus primarily on current issues but, first, I will say a few words on the White Paper on ending direct provision.  We have welcomed this.  As the committee members will know, it outlines a two-phase system with people spending up to four months in a reception centre, before moving to own-door or own-room accommodation in the community.  We welcome the limits on stays in reception centres, the emphasis on early integration supports, and the focus on the needs of children, families, and people with particular vulnerabilities.  It is important to note that the White Paper recognises the importance of fair and fast international protection procedures.  This puts the onus on the Department of Justice to ensure adequate steps are taken to reduce the time spent in the asylum process.  Mr. Nick Henderson will speak more about the unacceptably long delays at present.  </p> <p>  For the White Paper implementation to be workable there also needs to be a clear plan to deal with the large existing backlog in protection cases.  At present, there are close to 7,000 people in direct provision, including those in emergency accommodation.  We call for leave to remain to be granted to anyone who has been in the system for two years or more, as recommended in the report of the advisory group, which was chaired by Ms Catherine Day.  </p> <p>  We are aware of how widespread the violations of human rights are right now in direct provision.  The length of time spent waiting for an International Protection Office, IPO, decision is unacceptable.  So are the conditions in many centres today.  Less than two years ago we published a report highlighting the appalling conditions in Mount Trenchard direct provision centre.  While Mount Trenchard was closed in early 2020, some or all of the issues we raised on that centre still apply to centres around Ireland.  Because of this, independent human rights-based monitoring of all centres is long overdue.  In October, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth announced that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, would do this.  To date, this has not happened.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, said that agreement has been reached with them in principle.  Yet, HIQA is still not expected to undertake its monitoring role until the end of this year.  The likely need for legislative change to put this in place has not been addressed.  This is worrying.  </p> <p>  As was highlighted in the recent Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s report, direct provision is particularly unsuitable and unsafe for children and families.  The same is true for victims of trafficking and victims of other forms of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence.  Another major area of concern for us is mental health.  It has been found that protection applicants are up to 15 times more likely to be diagnosed with depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, than the majority of the population.  They have to cope with experiences of forced migration, which can include trauma, torture, the consequences of war and conflict, and human trafficking.  The impact of these are worsened by living in direct provision.  The effects have been particularly acute during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We produced a report on this towards the end of last year.  Some issues that we highlighted in that report are, first, congregated accommodation.  Single adults have to share bedrooms with others, which is a cause of conflict, fear, anxiety, and distress.  This, along with the length of time spent in the system, exacerbates pre-existing mental health conditions.  Second, substance misuse and addiction are a reality for many people in direct provision.  This is linked to social exclusion; long-term unemployment and forced idleness; stressors associated with migration; and traumatic experiences.  However, the substance misuse and addiction services that are available to people in direct provision are inadequate.  Third, not having on-site, targeted supports have been a key failure of the direct provision system.  Staff in centres generally do not have adequate training.  In principle, mainstream mental health services are available to people in direct provision.  In practice, however, there is limited knowledge of how to access these services.  Access is further diminished by cultural barriers and the lack of multilingual mental health services.</p> <p>  Another area we have looked at recently is access to employment and decent work for protection applicants.  Many, but not all, have the right to work.  Our report highlighted a number of key issues that impede their labour market integration.  This report was published in March.  Some of the issues included factors such as the locations of direct provision centres, which are often remote; language; lack of recognition of skills and qualifications; problems accessing services to address other needs like housing, healthcare and education; employer engagement; and administrative barriers, such as work permits and not being able to get a driving licence.  </p> <p>  I will finish this opening statement by noting that essentially this once again highlights how implementing the White Paper and ending direct provision is a complex body of work.  It requires a whole-of-government approach.  It has got to be done.  Direct provision is an abuse of human rights and it has to be ended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.550" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#C00100"><p>We thank the committee for its interest in this issue.  I will speak on three matters: the state of direct provision as we gradually emerge from the pandemic; delays in the system; and alternatives to direct provision.  As Dr. Lannon set out, and as I am sure the committee will have gathered from its interactions with other important actors, we believe the system is at close to breaking point.  All the indicators are flashing red.  Approximately 5,000 people are awaiting a first instance decision.  The medium length of stay in direct provision is 27 months.  There are approximately 1,800 unrelated people who are sharing bedrooms.  There have been more than 670 Covid cases in direct provision.  There are more than 80 locations across the country where people have been accommodated.  Delays in the system are chronic and almost as bad as ever.  We are at a very serious and grave moment in the long history of direct provision and our international protection process.</p> <p>  Yesterday, Doras launched a report on delays.  I thank the Deputies who came to meet us outside the convention centre.  We greatly appreciate that.  We did a small survey of people we are working with to hear directly from them, as people in the system with lived experience, about what the impact is on them of delays.  There were feelings of stress, frustration, wasting of skills and quite devastatingly there were feelings of suicidal ideation, family break up and divorces.  Delays undermine the integrity of the system.  There is a perfect storm of a pre-pandemic backlog which, combined with Covid-19-induced closures of decision-making bodies, has caused delays to shoot up to the point where if a person applied for asylum today, without a serious reduction in waiting times and additional resources, it is likely that they would wait two years for the first decision alone and might then have to appeal.  The system is in a really bad place and this matters not least because of the White Paper and the shared collective aim of ending direct provision.  It is much harder to create a new system with 7,000 people in it, as Dr. Lannon said, compared with one of 3,500 people, for example.  We do have a road map out of that.  Dr. Lannon has pointed to the recommendation by Catherine Day's advisory group on this.  It was not picked up in the White Paper, which we think is an omission in that document.</p> <p>  We know what is wrong with the system.  We have had multiple reports.  If we put the reports on direct provision one on top of the other, we would probably reach the ceiling of a standard room.  What do we do about it?  There has been a crucial moment in that the White Paper refers and gives an intent to end direct provision.  I hope and believe that all of society across the political spectrum is committed to ending the system.  There is no doubt that it will be hugely challenging.  We have done some research on alternatives to direct provision.  We began this a couple of years ago.  In January, we produced a report compiled by an organisation Campbell Tickell, a UK housing consultancy on how to implement practical alternatives to direct provision, in which we made several recommendations.  First, that different streams of accommodation should be created.  There cannot be one type of accommodation.  Some should be developed by approved housing bodies, AHBs.  We need to build accommodation and to explore community-led alternatives.  We should consider creating a new approved housing body dedicated to this kind of accommodation or consider pivoting an existing body.  We need to think in an agile and dynamic way so that we can use large and small AHBs.  Many smaller AHBs across the country could be engaged on this.  There has to be state-built accommodation.  We believe there is significant power in community regeneration schemes.  I can share a seminar we did in June with some housing experts.  Orla Hegarty, an academic and architect at UCD, spoke on the huge untapped pool of vacant urban accommodation across the country that could be used for this.  We need to think about removing barriers to independence.  People do come to this country and seek protection and asylum but they do not enter direct provision because they may be able to live independently or they have family they can live with.  If we can increase independence, that group of people can grow and there is less need for accommodation.  We recommend that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth maintain responsibility for this issue in the short term but that said responsibility should eventually move to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>  There needs to be more urgency in White Paper implementation.  We recognise there will be a period of thinking but the deadline is 2024 and we are already half way through 2021 and are yet to see much if any tangible change.  Budget 2022 will be extremely important.  We are trying to prepare a submission on this.  All stakeholders will have to watch the budget carefully to see what is dedicated to the area.  There must be a continuation of the system and a whole-of-government approach.  We feel it is notable that the Taoiseach gave a foreword to the White Paper.  Although the White Paper has omissions and deficits, it sets out the theory, desire and intent.  What we need now is implementation.  We could take various strategies about closing down existing direct provision centres, identifying the worst ones.  Dr. Lannon spoke about the centre in Limerick.  We recommended closing emergency accommodation but that has been particularly difficult.  It has to be done sensitively.  People have built up lives.  We need to think better about how we engage our communities.  There is great power in local communities in Ireland.  The welcome local communities have given to people seeking asylum has been incredibly positive in the vast majority of cases but we need to work better with communities and help them to prepare to give the welcome that they can.</p> <p>  Ending the system and implementing both a new type of accommodation and a new system presents major challenges but we believe the weight of history against direct provision, and all its problems, compels us to do so.  Of all the reports on direct provision, the one launched recently by the Ombudsman for Children is the most devastating and should compel us all to do as much as we can to end the system.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a few questions of both of them to start and then I will ask members to indicate or put up the hand signal and I will let them in.</p> <p>  I will start with Mr. Henderson of the Irish Refugee Council.  I would like to speak for a moment about the council's report on implementing alternatives.  We cannot allow ourselves to sit back and wait for that to start.  Once a new model has been identified, as it has been in the White Paper, that transition process should begin immediately.  In the council's report on implementing alternatives, it asks five critical questions.  One related to timing and how we transition to these models.  What has to occur for them to become live, and at what point do they start to deliver accommodation, in Mr. Henderson's view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.552" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#D00200"><p>The fundamental idea here is that if we were to build accommodation, which we recommend, there would be a long lead-in time.  Therefore, the groundwork for that has to be done today or very shortly for it to bear any fruit within a couple of years or even as far away as 2024.  It is for that reason that we recommend different models of accommodation, including block-leasing accommodation, which the Government has already used but where there could be improvements.  We recommend block-leasing and the use of private accommodation in the short term, not as a long-term measure.  The benefit of that is that it is accommodation that can be drawn down sooner rather than later.  As for private company and social enterprise use, there are examples of different types of accommodation being provided already.  One criticism we are aware of from providers is that there is not enough clarity on what funding is going to be provided to bodies that have accommodation in this area.  There needs to be greater clarity from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p> <p>  Regarding the regeneration and community-led schemes, and speaking in particular to Orla Hegarty's point about the considerable pool of vacant urban accommodation, her point is that turning that over will take considerably less time than new builds.  As for AHB delivery, it would be a matter of working with existing projects to try to identify whether there is a possibility for a particular project of providing a small portion - a small portion, I emphasise - to protection applicants.  The point we are trying to make is that we have a shared desire to end direct provision.  We recommend that different accommodation streams be used but that for each stream the accommodation will become "on tap" or live at a different point in time.</p></speech>

That report dealt with making changes to the current direct provision system but it can also help with the transition out of direct provision by starting to improve conditions immediately.  Given that many of the recommendations of the report have not been implemented, which is acknowledged in the White Paper, is there a danger that we are already setting back our plans and not acting immediately or decisively on this?</p></speech>

I do not deny we are all in a very challenging position in that regard, but we believed and stated in the report we published in January that 2021 would be a year for action, not necessarily a year for thinking, or at least that the two would be done in parallel.  If we are to get the interest of, say, approved housing bodies, which are a big provider of accommodation and very much a potential provider of accommodation for protection applicants, they need clarity on what funding arrangements for building, servicing and supports would be provided to them, and they do not have that.  If we do not have that now, the lead-in time to create such funding streams will take time, so every moment we wait or do not implement something, the ball is being kicked further down the road.</p></speech>

Perhaps they have mental health issues that are going largely unaddressed, and they can be stuck in the system for years.</p></speech>

You enter a system where, as I said, you may not get a decision for two years.  You will be accommodated in Balseskin, probably, but in recent years, because of capacity issues, people may go into emergency accommodation.  After being in that initial form of accommodation, you will be dispersed.  You will not necessarily know where you are going and you will not have a choice as to where you go.  Previously, up until 2017, you would not have had the right to work, but the Supreme Court case changed that.  Now you can work if you have been waiting for six months for an initial decision.  The quality of accommodation can vary hugely.  There are 80 accommodation locations across the country and they really are the good, the bad and the ugly.  There is a huge degree of lottery in that respect.</p> <p>  Doras's report, which Mr. Lannon may speak to, covers mental health issues in a lot of detail.  I think we would both agree that there has been a huge deterioration in mental health supports.  We are noticing that through our services.  That goes as far as suicidal ideation and is something we are really concerned about.</p> <p>  The committee has spoken to the Ombudsman for Children, whose report makes clear that direct provision as an institution is not capable of providing for the best interests of the child.  The ombudsman's previous report about racism and direct provision found that almost the fact of living in direct provision exposes children to stigma and racism.</p></speech>

I will start with the same question I asked Mr. Henderson on mental health.  Regarding health services' capacity with Covid, the provision of mental health services in this country is well known to be far below what is needed.  Doras has noted that people in direct provision are 15 times more likely to be diagnosed with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and the Ombudsman for Children has identified a dreadful failure to provide proper supports for people in direct provision.  That must have been made even worse throughout the pandemic.  Are genuine efforts being made to address this since the ombudsman published his report?  Could Dr. Lannon outline his view on how best we can ensure that the needs of the people in the new system are met?</p></speech>

As Mr. Henderson said, there are 80 centres around the country, and the standards in those are very varied and the access to services really varied as well.  We highlighted a number of key issues regarding mental health difficulties and direct provision.  One of them was the unsuitable accommodation.  Another was the delays in case processing which, as Mr. Henderson outlined, has exacerbated and contributed to what is in effect retraumatising for many people who have been living in direct provision centres for years.  Substance misuse and addiction is an area of particular concern to us.  This was highlighted by the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland in a 2009 position paper.</p><p>We have found testimony from people who have said they have become brain-dead while living in direct provision.  It will not be fixed or changed immediately.  There are major problems in accessing services.  We welcome that a pilot project has commenced on vulnerability assessments.  However, it is all very well to do vulnerability assessments but we would emphasise access to supports and services required in the follow-up are essential, particularly for people who have experienced trauma.  That is not happening now.  We found people who self-declared as having mental health challenges when they initially came to the reception centre in Balseskin were still transferred to centres where they did not have adequate access to services.  There are a number of issues involved.  As I said with substance misuse and addiction, there is a cause and effect factor, with mental heath problems.  Regarding access to services, mainstream mental health services are in principle available to people in direct provision but, as the Chairman said, they are stretched, strained or inadequate for people in general in Ireland.  On top of that, there are language issues and the fact people do not have any awareness of the mainstream services.  The lack of access to multilingual services is a big issue.  We have been contacted by people working in crisis intervention support services who said they do not know how to support people.  The use of interpreters is problematic and there are cultural barriers.  A great deal of work needs to be done in this area.  Because of the length of time people have spent in direct provision, some of them are in really bad places and, as Mr. Henderson said, in many cases, they are suicidal.  Organisations like ours are trying to do their best to stem the tide in many cases by providing people with access to minimal supports and services.</p></speech>

I will and come back in at the end.  Drug addiction and mental health issues among people in direct provision were mentioned.  How prevalent is that?  What has been the impact of the pandemic on people in direct provision? If treatments were more available does Dr. Lannon think that may be another element of dealing with the connected areas of mental health issues and addiction?</p></speech>

We have engaged with the HSE to attempt to get better supports and services for people in centres.  A phrase I have used is "forced idleness", which is a reality for many people in direct provision.  Access to work is available now for anyone who has been six months in the country.  A person can apply for a work permit and he or she would then be fortunate to get work.  A person living in the direct provision centre in Limerick city has a much better chance of work than a person living in a far remote area of County Clare or some other counties.  Sitting idly without access to employment or education, having been traumatised through displacement, persecution and perhaps oppression prior to coming to Ireland has meant the problematic nature is exacerbated by resort to substance misuse.  We do not have research on that.  There is limited research on the prevalence of substance misuse among protection applicants but many risk factors such as social exclusion, long-term unemployment and stresses associated with previous experiences are evident.  We need a proactive approach to ensure supports and services are available to people in centres right across the country.  There are 80 of them.  We note and welcome the promise by Government to start closing the emergency accommodation centres.  However, as Mr. Henderson said, there needs to be a plan for how to respond to the closure of those centres.  We need to ensure accommodation is available, that the backlog is cleared and, most importantly, we want to avoid returning situations where there is not only over-crowding but more overcrowding in centres where people are sharing, which, in itself, is contributing to even more distress and anxiety for people.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Henderson and Dr. Lannon for their presentations.  I apologise as I have two Zoom calls running at the same time and it is quite difficult.  I listened with interest to both presentations.  As alluded to by both speakers, the Ombudsman for Children appeared before the committee a few weeks ago and his presentation was stark.  I have a number of questions and I would appreciate a response to them.  Dr. Lannon referenced the Ombudsman for Children's report.  From the perspective of my own interaction, there are two direct provision centres in my immediate area and I would have had much interaction with them during the years having been involved with community and sporting groups and so on.  It was stark to hear all the people who were involved in those sporting and community groups had been Garda vetted and would have had clearance to deal with younger people in particular.  I was quite aghast when I read in the Ombudsman's report that this was not necessarily the case.  Is that widespread across the direction provision system as a whole?</p><p>My second point is a comment on the White Paper.  It is great it has finally been published but we cannot let it become an excuse for our work being done.  The work is only beginning.  What reforms would our guests propose we need to take in the interim?</p><p>My third point relates to deaths in direct provision centres.  There have been numerous newspaper articles and reports over the past few years on the number of people who have died in centres in recent years.  The number who have died is contested.  Do our guests have any data or reports on that or can they bring any clarity to the number of people who have died and the nature of their deaths?</p><p>My fourth point relates to unaccompanied minors and children&rsquo;s issues.  There have been newspaper reports that many children seeking direct provision would be under the age of 18 and once they turn 18 years of age they are removed from foster care and brought into the direct provision system.  What are our guests' thoughts on that?  How many people does that affect?  I read newspaper reports that it involved more than 50 children.  </p><p>My fifth point relates to reports from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform officials who have allegedly said direct provision targets are unrealistic, which was a headline in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>In particular, they flagged the concerns they had with respect to funding, decongregation of the setting and funding for housing, which was mentioned earlier.  What are our guests' views on that and the challenges we face us in that regard.</p></speech>

The Ombudsman for Children's report is quite stark.  Some of the issues highlighted in it chime with us and, more importantly, with the people we support, particularly the problematic nature of the lack of inspections and the need for an independent complaints procedure.  Those issues date back quite a few years.  The ombudsman and others have highlighted there is quite a degree of widespread fear among people of coming forward or highlighting issues related to conditions or lack of access to services in direct provision centres.</p><p>The ombudsman clearly said that, essentially, it did not have the best interests of children at its core.  I would say the situation is better in some of the centres that have been opened in appropriate locations that have fully own-door access and accommodation, where families can themselves look out for the best needs of the children.  That is better than the congregated settings and situations where children are really suffering and in particular, their development is suffering.  We see that across the board.</p><p> I will comment on something the Deputy mentioned with regard to community support.  Community support has, by and large, been wonderful around the country for people and families who are in direct provision.  I do not know of a centre in the country in which there is not someone in the community who could be called upon to give a hand or to help out if necessary.  That is in stark contrast, I must say, to much of what would have hit the media with regard to protests on the opening of direct provision centres in communities.  Communities are, by and large, very welcoming and open to having protection applicants or others living in their community.</p><p> I will address some of the other questions on unaccompanied minors and the numbers affected.  We do not have tracking.  One of the issues and problems here is that the people disappear out of the system when unaccompanied minors come in and we do not know where they end up.  They have disappeared after coming into the country.  This is a problem.  We should not and do not have situations where people are recognised as being under 18 and are unaccompanied in direct provision centres but we have had a number of cases of people whose age was disputed and there was evidence to strongly suggest they were less than 18 years old.  They were, however, accommodated in direct provision centres and that is really problematic because of the special reception needs they would have.  Again, that was highlighted by the Ombudsman for Children's report.</p><p> Perhaps Mr. Henderson would be best placed to speak about the targets and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  He might like to comment on that and then I can come back to some of the Deputy's other points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#F00200"><p>I can come back in on that.  In the <i>Business Post</i>a couple of weeks ago, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform stated that the time target, that is, 2024, and the amount of money allocated, were underestimated.  I do not disagree with either of those points necessarily but without being slightly trite, if we disagree with them, what will it cost?  As I said, we would expect all Departments to input positively into this process.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance are really crucial actors in this in terms of the budget that will be required to go to a new system of accommodation.<br/><br/>In terms of budget, to be very brief on it, we have spent almost a quite obscene amount of money on this system of accommodation, which has accommodated people.  I think something like 60,000 people have been through direct provision over 20 years.  There is nothing there for the taxpayer, however.  There is nothing there for Government in terms of any buildings or properties or use.  When we talk, therefore, about an alternative to direct provision, sure, there will be the creation of a new budget line.  With the two systems in parallel, that is, the existing one, which is being wound down and the new system, which is being created, there may be two budget lines.  If done properly, however, we believe that in the long term, this is better for the public.  That would include the public from the perspective of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well.<br/><br/>I can come in on the short-term points to that question and then I might hand back to Mr. Lannon.  The advisory group on direct provision and the protection process, chaired by Dr. Catherine Day, published its report in October.  That made various recommendations and has a list of issues that could be immediately implemented.  The White Paper picked up on some of those things but some still have not been implemented.  It is frustrating, not least for people in the process, that some things, which should take no time or a little time to implement or change, are slow.  One example is drivers' licences.  It remains the case that somebody would have difficulty or just could not apply for a driver's licence, which would allow for some sort of independence.  There is still no provision for that as far as I understand.  I can come back on another couple of points, for example, deaths in direct provision.  I will hand back to Mr. Lannon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. Henderson.  I will come in again on the question about the reforms.  One comment I would make is that we have moved now with the White Paper from discussions about reforming direct provision to a clearly-stated recognition that it is not fit for purpose.  That is really positive and welcome.  Reform has not worked nor can it work, given the fundamental nature of direct provision.  A few things need to be done now.  We need HIQA inspections to provide proper oversight of direct provision centres.  That is something on which I would be happy to come back to speak further, if the committee wishes.  We also need vulnerability assessments across the board.</p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children's recommendations are a good starting point.  It said the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, should put in place a procedure to identify children with special reception needs, which is really positive.  This should include a vulnerability assessment.  Recognising the vulnerability is crucial, as it has pointed out.  This is something that goes across the board as well.  Recognising the vulnerabilities needs to be considered in the planning and provision of accommodation needs because accommodation needs will vary.  As Mr. Henderson said already, with the right approach, many people - the vast majority of people - who come to Ireland seeking international protection can live independently and can live in the communities with proper access to social welfare, education, employment, etc.  Some will have special needs, however.</p> <p>  One of the things we have seen that is particularly problematic is the lack of on-site collaboration between agencies when it comes to preventive supports or early interventions.  We have seen situations where parents are struggling.  When these situations are allowed to fester and develop, things become more and more difficult.</p> <p>  Even with regard to how IPAS operates at the moment, sometimes we will intervene and request a transfer because we feel it is in the best interests of the individuals but that is not done or we are told that it cannot happen for a variety of reasons.  Much more, therefore, needs to be done with regard or in response to residents' plights and situations.  The first thing is that they need to be listened to and this comes back to HIQA inspections.  At the moment, inspections, such as they are in direct provision centres, do not take into consideration or even listen to the people who are most affected, that is, the residents.  If I may, I will hand back to Mr. Henderson on the deaths if he wishes to speak on that.</p></speech>

Figure 6.1 on page 83 of the advisory group report contains a list of things that could be implemented.  It is literally titled &quot;Recommendations that could be implemented quickly&quot;.<br/><br/>In terms of the number of people who have passed away or died in direct provision, there is a very topical article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>in which Mr. Lannon is quoted by Mr. Mostafa Darwish.</p><p>I think the figure in that is around 84 people who passed away or died in direct provision.  We are aware in the last year, very sadly, of at least two suicides.  The main point that organisations have been making is that there is a need for greater transparency.  There is also a need for better co-ordination between the Garda, the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, and also the body that investigates deaths here, the Coroner Service.  There needs to be more transparency and communication.  There was a case in Galway of somebody called Sylva Tukula who passed away and there was a terrible mix-up in terms of her remains.  I will finish there.</p></speech>

I know Dr. Lannon for some time and he has gotten to know me.  His commitment to support those people over a number of years must be acknowledged.  At a time when many did not stand up for such unfortunate people, he and Mr. Henderson did.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked a number of questions I intended to ask.  We have had experiences in County Roscommon and not too far from there with centres.  What often concerns me is the integration and support.  It is very good initially, but as time goes on it disappears, although not fully.  I fear there is a gulf developing between local communities and people in such centres.  Is that something either of the witnesses has come across or is concerned about?</p> <p>  Regarding individuals who complain about their accommodation or food, I am aware of one case going back some years.  We all accept that things have improved considerably.  We have the White Paper.  We need to get the recommendations of the White Paper implemented as quickly as possible.  A person was brought to me who could not adapt to Irish food and the person was tossed out on the street.  I accept a lot has changed but that was the reality.  We have moved away from that.  Do we have any similar situations at the moment?  I believe that sort of outrageous carry-on has disappeared.</p> <p>  Regarding integration and the availability of cr&egrave;ches and playschools in towns, I do not think a realistic effort is being made to integrate children from those communities into local cr&egrave;ches.  In some cases, people locally in the community were prepared to do it, but the State was not always prepared to go for that option.  The preference was to provide a cr&egrave;che within the accommodation rather than in the community.  Surely integration is the way to do it, to bring refugee children into the local creche or playschool where they can interact with the local children.  Those type of bonds are great.  If we look at people from other communities who come here because of war or whatever else, sometimes they are talented sportspeople and they get into a local girl's or boy's football team and that is fantastic integration for them.  Is that an area where we still have to do an awful lot of work?  There is no point in people saying they will help people when they arrive in a town or village and that they will do this, that or the other, but as time goes by the support wanes.</p> <p>  The Chairman has asked the other questions and they have been answered fairly well.  I did raise driving licences at a meeting previously.  There are significant issues in that regard.  In general, improvements are taking place.  I am very much of the point of view that if we give commitments to take in those unfortunate people, we should look after them to the very best of our ability and not leave them suffering in any way because they have gone through an awful lot.</p></speech>

I am happy to say that.</p> <p>  In terms of integration, the difficulties for international protection applicants begin with the fact that they are trying to survive on &euro;38 a week, living in institutionalised settings, often in remote locations that do not have adequate supports or services.  In some of the communities and locations that we both know where there was discussion about setting up a direct provision centre, there was clearly a need that had not been addressed to engage in discussion and dialogue with all stakeholders &ndash; the people who would be expected to live in the congregated settings but also the local communities - in terms of ensuring adequacy of services and supports.  The chances are that in many cases the local GP, cr&egrave;ches and everything else are already stretched so this is something that we need to recognise and understand.</p> <p>  We have some wonderful experiences in Limerick of children from the direct provision centres going to the same cr&egrave;ches as others and now going to the same summer camps.  We are happy to see that we have children whose parents may have come from Syria, Afghanistan or other parts of the world that are likely to be playing Gaelic football in another few years.  This is something that we do have to work on.  We must ensure that any elements of systemic or institutional racism that might exclude people who are international protection applicants are addressed.  We have a number of initiatives that are happening.  The consultation in the national action plan against racism is something that is of relevance here as well.</p> <p>  Food is often an issue in direct provision centres.  In many cases, people have own-door access and they can cook their own food.  In other cases, we have what is called "independent" living, which is not what we would understand as independent.  It refers to a centre that has a food hall or an accessible shop where people can buy a limited amount of food and cook that in a shared kitchen.  In other places, people are queuing up in a canteen to get food that is not appropriate, not only to their culture but to their dietary needs, which are often not addressed.  That is problematic.  We find that children are not eating, and adults are unable to eat.  This is also exacerbated by the stresses, strains and anxiety that people are suffering as a consequence of their experiences before coming to Ireland and having to live in direct provision.</p> <p>  We often find as well that communications between centre management and IPAS is not as immediate or fluid as it should be.  That can result in misunderstandings in some cases and people not being given access to centres or, as Senator Murphy stated, in effect being tossed out on the street.  There have been cases of that, which is extremely worrying.  We have quite a bit of work to do as we look forward with the White Paper, which gives us an opportunity to put proper measures in place to ensure that communities across Ireland where protection applicants or anybody else will be living have adequate supports and services that are appropriate to the needs of the people who will be using them.</p></speech>

My understanding regarding people in the protection process is that an asylum seeker who is working can access the national childcare scheme but somebody who is not working cannot do so.  Programme refugees, who are resettled refugees, can access it but people in the protection process who have arrived spontaneously cannot do so.  We have an integration strategy in Ireland but it does not include asylum seekers.  It does not include people seeking protection.  It starts upon being granted status.  This is in contrast to Scotland, which has a new Scots integration from day one strategy.  Looking at the Scottish experience, we believe it makes sense to support people in integration from day one even though people who come here may not stay and even though the Government may intend to deport or remove those who are unsuccessful in their applications.</p> <p>  Dr. Lannon hinted at this next point earlier.  We have worked with people who have come here with huge enthusiasm, skills and optimism but this has deteriorated.  The delays in the asylum process in this regard are crucial to this.  We can do all these things and, as we have recognised, communities have huge power and ability.  Ultimately, when it comes to the crunch, it is somebody simply waiting for a decision that does not come.  People may deteriorate.  Their mental health may deteriorate.  People can also close up.</p></speech>

Much has been covered.  I want to go back over a few issues.  We are having a conversation about conditions in direct provision.  I have spoken to Mr. Henderson and a few of the people who were outside yesterday.  Let us be honest.  The majority of these people come from very bad situations.  They come here hoping for sanctuary.  We have a reputation of being an open and welcoming society.  There is still a perception that these people are free loaders who should not be coming here.  We also hear all these horrific stories of overcrowding and what the witnesses have covered today.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about strategies and White Papers.  I have seen too many of them in the short few years I have been a Deputy.  I am speaking about implementation.  I am a massive fan of NGOs.  Believe it or not, they are one of my favourite groups.  We need to get the information out to the general public on how these people came to be here and what were their options in their own countries.  When we educate people and give them the key to opening up to people, they might understand why they are here.  They might be more not so much sympathetic but empathetic to the fact we should not be criticising these people but supporting them.</p> <p>  When we sit down and have a conversation with somebody, we learn from them and they learn from us.  I am a massive fan of integration.  We have a food festival every year - bar the Covid years - in Midleton.  We bring all the nationalities that have come through the asylum process and they show off their national foods.  The way Irish people interact with them on these two days is absolutely amazing.  People make friendships and understand each other's culture.  To get the information out, how do we educate people who are uneducated when it comes to knowing what is happening?  They then make a judgment without having proper information.</p> <p>  A point that was touched on was deaths and suicides and how suicides are reported.  I am very curious about this.  We have a similar issue in the prison service.  Bodies are removed from the prison and taken to the coroner's office.  In the same way, the bodies are no longer in the centre but in the coroner's office.  This is where the suicide is determined.  How do we get positive figures?</p> <p>  Several weeks ago, the Ombudsman for Children came before the committee.  He was very critical but very honest about what is happening.  The Doras report does not spare much either.  It shows the position and that is the way it should be.  We keep speaking about things that are broken but nobody wants to fix them.  Is it an issue with money?  Is there European money we can access?</p> <p>  While I say all of this I have to be conscious that some people, because they are not educated enough, do not want these people in their communities.  However, as the witnesses have mentioned, many of them are qualified doctors, dentists and engineers.  Others are very badly traumatised and need help.  Mental health services were mentioned.  Mainstream mental health services are diabolical so I do not know how we will get anything into these centres.</p> <p>  The witnesses referred to places not being fit for purpose.  It is amazing that other systems, such as the HSE, can deal with such an issue in months.  In my town, we have the Owenacurra health centre.  It is not fit for purpose so it is going to be shut down in October, which is pretty fast.  All of the people will be moved out and the services will be relocated.  This can be done.  We do not want this to happen in our town but I am giving it as an example of how quickly things can be done.</p> <p>  I have one simple question for Dr. Lannon and Mr. Henderson.  On a scale of one to ten, if they had to be totally honest, with one being very good and ten being absolutely diabolical, when it comes to providing the services for the most vulnerable, how bad is it?</p></speech>

In our experience contact matters.  Two people having a conversation can change perceptions and stereotypes.  Over the past year, the Black Lives Matter movement has come to the fore.  We should recognise that racism exists in Ireland.  This has to be acknowledged and dealt with.</p> <p>  In terms of trying to give a score it is very hard to do but I suppose I would give a four.  Some people are given some support.  What we sometimes hear from Government representatives is that we are not like Italy or Greece.  Our response to this is that they are dealing with different scenarios and different numbers of people.  We also say we should judge ourselves on our own history, experience and standards, for example cherishing all children of the State.  We are demonstrably not doing that at present and this is a problem.</p></speech>

For me, the starting point is always that we have responsibilities under international legal instruments with regard to providing the opportunity for people to seek asylum.  We look at instruments such as the reception conditions directive at EU level under which we have obligations regarding what we do.</p><p>In terms of what Mr. Henderson was saying, I guess we could do more, but we are doing what we can with very limited funding for the NGO sector.  We are absolutely stretched when it comes to trying to do what we are doing.  In my opening statement, I mentioned a whole list of areas that we are working in or trying to work in at Doras.  We are trying to do that on a shoestring.</p><p> The State has a responsibility here, whether it is in terms of ensuring that there is funding at local and community level for initiatives that are appropriate or in terms of ensuring that there is proper and appropriate information for people so that we do not, for example, have far right elements coming in and spreading misinformation and lies in relation to immigration.  We need to ensure that we are out in front of that in terms of getting the right information to people.  </p><p> Mr. Henderson mentioned the national integration strategy.  There are deficiencies in that.  Taking the example of Limerick, where there is a local integration strategy, we have an integration working group.  Under that, there are a number of elements, including a child and family support network.  There is a lot of work that is being done at a local level to be proactive.  In fact, we, as an organisation, were set up at the same time as direct provision was introduced around 21 years ago.  We have maintained the work that we are doing to try to ensure that what the Deputy is speaking about in terms of getting the information out and educating people is happening in Limerick.  However, I do accept that we have a lot more do to.</p></speech>

At the outset, I wish to thank both Mr. Henderson and Dr. Lannon for their presentations.  Apologies for not joining the meeting earlier; I was in the Chamber.  I ask the witnesses to forgive me if I go over questions that have been covered.  I heard some of the questions being asked, but I have a few of my own.  As others have said, the Ombudsman for Children appeared before the committee previously and we had a good discussion around the White Paper.  The witnesses have referenced that in many of their replies.  It is important to have that tangible document to work towards it in a speedy fashion.</p> <p>  Protection accommodation, and specifically, AHBs, were mentioned in the opening remarks.  I ask the witnesses to go into more detail on their thinking on those as specific bodies for accommodation.  Equally, I heard the witnesses speak of the issue of individuals sitting idly.  I am very aware of that.  Dr. Lannon mentioned Doras being in operation for 21 years.  I recall that perhaps 18 years ago, accommodation was provided for minors who were coming into Sandycove in my constituency of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Local people set up a football club for those minors.  It created a great sense of integration between local teen, early teens and many of the unaccompanied minors.  When we speak about activities, entertainment and genuine integration, there is nothing like sport, music and other similar activities.  That brings me onto my next question.  What type of activities and entertainment are available for those who are in many of these centres?  I am aware that the witnesses have said that there is a hierarchy of needs and there are needs that are greater than that.  </p> <p>  The witnesses have mentioned mental health and suicide, which is extremely worrying.  I believe I heard them say that some applicants are 15 times more likely to be diagnosed with mental health problems.  That is a staggering figure.  Do the witnesses have statistics on the age range of individuals that we are talking about, and equally, what services are available for them?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned HIQA and the need for HIQA inspections.  Obviously, if the White Paper takes off, many of these issues could fall away.  However, there will need to be a system of inspections in place.  I was a member of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Covid-19 Response last year.  We heard about the lack of inspections in some accommodation centres.  That, in itself, is worrying.  We have seen other issues in relation to nursing homes.  From the witnesses' perspective, what needs to change in that arena?  </p> <p>  Senator Eugene Murphy mentioned integration and Deputy Buckley mentioned food and culture.  I recall being at a school fair a few years ago.  What struck me was that the food and elements of the culture of all nationalities represented in the school were on display.  Again, that sent a signal of true integration.  These children were celebrating their cultures and being proud of where they are from, yet they were loving living in Ireland.  That is what we need to embrace.  In referencing my own constituency, we used to have a festival of world cultures, which was extremely well publicised and known right across the world.  Unfortunately, it grew too big for one local authority area to take on.  It pointed to the need to celebrate culture, diversity and integration.</p> <p>  My final question concerns education.  The issue is one that comes up now and again and I am sure both organisations are well aware of it.  It concerns individuals who are in education and are told one day that they are being relocated to perhaps another part of the country.  That obviously has a huge and devastating impact on those individuals.  We spoke of mental health problems earlier on.  I can only assume that such instances of relocation would compound such problems.  The Department has acted compassionately in some cases, but I am sure the witnesses are aware of others where that did not happen.  Perhaps they might touch on that in their responses.</p> <p>  I thank them both for their presentations; they were most interesting.</p></speech>

The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, is supposed to carry out inspections using its own staff and the staff of a private company, QTS Limited.  The inspections are supposed to monitor compliance with the rules and things like food hygiene, water supply, general safety and that sort of thing.  In terms of inspections, very little has changed over the last decade and a half in respect of the types of problems being reported.</p> <p>  To explain why we feel the HIQA inspections are particularly important, currently, three inspections are supposed to be carried out per year.  That was not even happening in all centres pre-Covid, but it certainly has not been happening since the onset of the Covid pandemic.  The current inspections essentially monitor the contractual obligations of the contractors, building maintenance and that sort of thing.  As I said, there are supposed to be three inspections per year.</p> <p>  HIQA inspections would be different.  They would aim to improve generally the quality and safety of health and social care services.  They would do a lot more than just focus on the buildings.  They would focus on the quality, safety, person-centred care and that sort of thing.  Essentially, they would or should consult and assist people using the services to understand what they should expect and they should develop guidance for staff in order to make improvements.  Reading the current inspection reports and looking back over the years, we see that residents are not consulted.  They are not even being considered.  Current inspections are, at best, about buildings and kitchens and things like that.  HIQA inspections would be more about people.  From a human rights perspective, that is really important.  We have talked about children.  It is also vitally important from a safeguarding perspective.  Indeed, the Ombudsman for Children has highlighted that the current inspection regime does not take into consideration the supports needed to meet children's physical, mental and social development.</p> <p>  It has been delayed.  The Minister has said that progress has been made.</p><p>There has been engagement with HIQA on getting inspections up and running.  There is a question mark over whether legislative change is needed.  I believe that it is, but the Minister said in May that that had not yet been determined.  This uncertainty is worrying given the very dire need for inspections.  The Emergency Homeless Accommodation and Direct Provision Independent Inspections Bill 2018 sought to amend the Health Act 2007, but it was never enacted.  It would have granted HIQA the power to inspect direct provision centres.  It is a vital area in terms of ensuring that the services are appropriate, not just for children but everybody.  </p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Henderson now to deal with the questions on the approved housing bodies, AHBs, following which I will come back in again on some of the other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.585" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Henderson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#K00200"><p>On the inspection issue, it is worth looking at the difference between the current inspection reports for direct provision and a HIQA inspection report for a nursing home or another type of institution.  They are two different things entirely.  Dr. Lannon said it all in that respect.</p> <p>  On the approved housing bodies, our report looked at this in detail and it found that there are many advantages in using approved housing bodies, including that they are non-profit and they can provide wraparound supports.  There are currently over 500 AHBs in Ireland, ranging from the very large to the very small.  The advisory group report published in October and the White Paper both recommended that more vulnerable groups may need different types of accommodation.  Our report also looks at how we could use smaller proportions of accommodation from existing or forthcoming developments.  It suggests a pivoting of existing approved housing bodies, taking them back to some of their origins where there were huge challenges around accommodation and housing, such that they are purely devoted to this issue.  </p> <p>  On the other hand, there are barriers and disadvantages that we would have to surmount.  In the seminar we held in June, there was input around the lack of clarity thus far on how an AHB could get involved in this type of accommodation.  We have not yet spoken about the current challenge of the housing crisis and the fact that AHBs are embroiled in trying to deal with that challenge.  There is also the issue of scale and bringing accommodation on stream.  The report does not recommend AHBs as the exclusive accommodation stream, but it is one of several.  The report projects that by 2024 this stream will be providing 25% of the accommodation.  I will hand back to Dr. Lannon to address the other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#K00300"><p>On the types of activity and entertainment available to people, by and large, communities are wonderful in terms of their engagement and openness to new cultures, experiences, food and so on.  For people living in direct provision accessibility is the problem.  If you cannot get a driving licence and you live miles outside of the nearest town it is really difficult to even join the local GAA or soccer club and to attend training.  We are currently trying to find ways to facilitate access to training with one of the local soccer clubs for some people who have just arrived into the direct provision centre.  As a number of members have said, it is a wonderful way of engaging and integrating.</p> <p>  On individuals' mental health and the age range of individuals, we are supporting people aged 17 to 70 in direct provision who are struggling with mental health issues.  These centres, in many cases, are managed by private contractors with staff that have insufficient experience or training to provide supports or to refer people to the appropriate support services.  This is a huge issue.  Some members asked about our recommendations.  We made a number of recommendations in our report on mental health as a short-term and urgent priority.  We recommended single occupancy rooms be made available to people who self-identify or are identified by the health services as particularly vulnerable or at risk.  That is critical but that does not happen in many cases.  We need to listen to and follow up on recommendations with GPs and psychiatric services and other qualified health professionals.  In almost all cases of which I am aware, a health professional has identified the vulnerability and signposted to what needs to be done but the follow-up has not happened.  In many cases, the default is the prescription of drugs.  Yesterday, I spoke with a man who lives in a direct provision centre and he told me that he is on, I think, 11 different forms of medication.  He does not need to be taking that medication, but that is the consequence of the lack of other supports or services for him.  We need to ensure that mainstream support services, including targeted outreach services, are available and accessible to people.  The vulnerability assessments and effective independent monitoring and oversight by HIQA are important.  Allowing people to be able to move out of the system is also important.  The issues in regard to the backlog were referenced earlier by me and by Mr. Henderson.  These issues have been highlighted by professionals, such as the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, as far back as 2009.  We need to take action.  </p> <p>  The lack of multilingual mental health support services is a real issue.  When it comes to interpretation services, this is problematic as well.  We need to do more in Ireland to ensure that there is an effective accreditation system for interpreters to ensure that the services are professionalised to a high standard, appropriate and compliant with all the necessary legislation.</p></speech>

I would like to take up a couple of points.  The number of people who tested positive within the direct provision services was referenced.  For information purposes it might be helpful for the committee to have the stats on the percentage of the overall number of residents versus the percentage in terms of the general population.  At the start of the pandemic, a very serious situation arose in the Cahersiveen centre, which was mishandled.  There are lessons to be learned from that if we are to avoid a repeat of that situation.</p> <p>  I want to raise an issue that has come to my attention in the past 24 hours.  I am sure it has been brought to the attention of many other Deputies.  I know it has been raised with my colleague, Deputy Michael Creed.  I refer to the situation in regard to the direct provision centre in Macroom, County Cork, where a number of residents have been informed that they are to move to County Donegal.  This is very concerning.</p><p>There are people who have come to Macroom, settled well into the community and are happy where they are.  They enrolled their children in local schools and those children have settled in and made many friends in their classes.  I have been informed of families who bought uniforms for the new semester, starting in September, and who are being moved to Donegal.  My understanding is that they will be moved to own-door accommodation.  That is an improvement, on first look, but some of those families have put down roots in the town and are being asked to move to the northernmost part of the island of Ireland.  Children and adults are being separated from their friends.  What are our guests' views on that?  Should there be an opt-out for people?  I am also concerned about the amount of notice that is being given to people.  In this case, the notice period seems to have been particularly short.  It is surely no way to treat people.  I am keen to hear our guests' views on that matter.  I again thank Mr. Henderson and Dr. Lannon.</p><p> Today's meeting needs to be about the direct provision service and everything we have discussed.  However, it would be remiss of me, as a member of the committee, not to question the Chairman's recent remarks where, as a Member of the Oireachtas and as the Chairman of an Oireachtas committee, he failed to condemn the killers of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on active service.  The Chairman needs to explain his position to this committee or to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Does he or does he not condemn people who kill members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in cold blood, people who left a wife widowed and children without their father?  Is this something with which he agrees or not?  He should explain his position to this committee or to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The D&aacute;il is sitting again next week and the Chairman will have the opportunity to explain his position.  He should do that.  We have not been able to sit in person since the first meeting of this committee and the Chairman has got off the hook on a number of occasions.  He needs to make his position clear to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is the very least he should do as the Chairman of an Oireachtas committee.</p><p> I thank our guests for their contributions.  They are doing an important job and I am sorry that the other matter I have raised has overshadowed the important matter we are here to discuss.  I have raised a number of points and would be interested to hear our guests' views on those specific cases relating to direct provision.</p></speech>

I am just getting the data.  I understand that 670 cases were involved.  Direct provision was the second most likely location of infection, second only to accommodation within the Traveller community.  The final statement was that people living in direct provision were at greater risk of infection because of their location but not because of their personal profiles.  I will get that information and come back to the point.</p> <p>  The Deputy also raised the issue of people being moved at short notice.  That has always occurred.  It is important, on one hand, to close emergency centres because they can be plainly unsuitable and are likely not to have support networks for their residents.  At the same time, however, the closure of emergency centres must be done in a sensitive way so that people who may have built connections within the community are not simply removed at short notice, which was the point to which the Deputy referred.  I will pass across to Dr. Lannon.  I am getting the data on the Covid infection point and will come back to it shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#L00300"><p>I will come in on the point the Deputy made about Macroom.  The scenario outlined is exactly why we need own-door accommodation for families who are seeking international protection in communities in Ireland, including integration from day one after the initial period in the reception centre.  I would have to say that the answer to this issue often lies in consulting with the residents and rights holders themselves.  If the only options that are available at the moment are own-door accommodation in Letterkenny or continuing with something less than that in Macroom, and taking a human rights-based approach, we should ensure participation in the decision-making process by the rights holders.  We put a lot of emphasis, through our human rights based approach, on issues such as accountability, non-discrimination, equality, empowerment and legality.  Those are all crucial matters.  It has been welcome that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, and the Government have emphasised the need for an alternative to direct provision that is human rights compliant in the future.  We need to do that now because we cannot allow ongoing failures in the provision of human rights to continue within the system when there are ways in which we can address them, albeit in a limited capacity with the constraints imposed by the institutionalised congregated living.</p></speech>

I am concerned, however, about circumstances where the residents would be happier to remain with the status quo, as distinct from an own-door scenario so far away.  I have called for this decision to be reviewed to allow for time to see if alternative accommodation is available in the immediate vicinity.  Should there be some sort of a formal opt-out arrangement?  Has the Department communicated with our guests about anything along those lines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.594" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John Lannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2021070800002#L00500"><p>I do not want to underestimate or dismiss the challenge of providing accommodation for all the people who are in the system that IPAS is facing.  There are too many in the system and IPAS has a backlog that has not been addressed by the Department of Justice.  Flexibility is needed, however, and we have always called for that.  There are many moving parts involved.  There are people who need to move and people who want to move but who, very often, do not get the opportunity to do so.  On the other hand, there are people who are being asked to move and might ultimately prefer not to do so.  There is an opportunity to look at and understand the needs of the individuals and families.  That is critical.  I am often concerned that transfers or the rejection of transfer requests are made without understanding and without looking at the particular needs of the families or individuals concerned.  Those decisions are just made and those families and individuals are moved.  There is a risk that people are being moved solely on the basis of numbers and bed allocations rather than being assessed as human beings who have particular needs and vulnerabilities, and also have human rights.</p></speech>

I have checked that out.  There was a report from HIQA in March which provided thorough data.  I got the information slightly wrong.  The Travelling community, followed by the Roma community and direct provision centres were the sites with the highest rates of infection.  The 670 cases in direct provision centres represented an 8.1% infection rate and a 2.8% hospitalisation rate.  The report stated: "Residents and staff of accommodation centres for international protection applicants and programme refugees presented with an increased risk of infection, but comparable rates of severe disease relative to the general population."  We published the Powerless report on Covid and direct provision in August.  The main feedback from that report was that people could not socially distance themselves and felt powerless to control their circumstances.  Where I or the committee members can work from home and shut the door, people in all congregated settings cannot do that.</p></speech>

I thank both witnesses for their presentations and ongoing work.  All of us are deeply conscious of the real need for reform and, ultimately, action to be taken in ending direct provision.  In the context of the legislative foundation for proposed reform and the fact that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth may be stating that we do not need that legislative framework, does the whole reform process stop if that framework is not there?</p> <p>  My second question is in the context of the proposal from the Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to close 24 emergency accommodation centres throughout the country and feeds into what Deputy Griffin said about the need for real consultation.  Dr. Lannon stated that one of the things we must do in a multicultural Ireland if we are serious about it at any level, whether it concerns the GAA, civil society or schools, is to have integration and consultation.  Consultation means real dialogue.  In my native city of Cork, we have seen a lot of great work being done by many different organisations and we had a very strong city council integration policy.  As Dr. Lannon stated, there are multiple moving parts but the fundamental thing is that we are dealing with human beings.  As politicians, none of us looks at the person who walks into our office as a voter.  We look at them as a person who has come to our country looking for help and international protection.</p> <p>  My third question concerns the international context.  How stands international protection for people who cannot necessarily leave their countries now because of the Covid-19 pandemic?  What should the committee do to prioritise and promote equality and human rights now that Ireland has a powerful seat at the UN?  Deputy Griffin posed a question we need to answer in the context of the remarks the Chairman allegedly made.  If we are talking about the upholding of human rights, and this is not for our two witnesses today, then the Chairman needs to address matters relating to the killing of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p>  I thank Mr. Lannon and Mr. Henderson for being here today and for their ongoing work.  Many of us who have an open door policy, as all of us on this committee do, recognise the importance of giving the witnesses a platform beyond a wider remit to educate and bring people on a journey.  It is through education, schools and sport that we can bring profound and real change.  I am conscious that the McMahon and Catherine Day reports have given us a roadmap.  The Law Society made a very interesting submission recently to the Government on that.  We might look to bring representatives of the Law Society before the committee in future. </p></speech>

I am conscious of the time.  We are coming to the two-hour mark and the committee still has some work to do.</p></speech>

I agree with that.  I am not quite sure how we translate what is quite a wide-ranging list of changes and reforms, including housing issues, into statutory form but it could work, for example, in terms of the asylum procedure.  I just checked and I think either the Netherlands or Switzerland - I can update the committee - requires decisions to be made within a certain time.  That may compel decision makers to act within that time.</p> <p>  On the international point, Ireland has quite an incredible record in respect of the Naval Service saving lives in the Mediterranean.  Some 18,000 people were rescued in previous missions but since 2018 there has been a change of mission within the European Union, which has shifted more to identifying arms smuggling from Libya as opposed to saving lives.  We have an incredibly proud experience and history in the Mediterranean, which was very rewarding for the Naval Service.  We continue to recommend it as a tangible thing it could go back to.  It is not without its challenges and other member states need to be brought on board but the record there is a very positive one.  </p></speech>

In addition to the great record Ireland has in saving lives in the Mediterranean, we also need to ensure that we in the European Union are not blocking routes and opportunities for people to seek sanctuary and safety in Europe if that is something they need to do.</p></speech>

It is building a good track record of witnesses, expertise and knowledge.  The really hard work is ahead of us.  At present, the one exceptional thing we have is there seems to be very broad agreement on the need for change, when previously it was about whether we should change or not.  As we are now agreed on the need for change, let us move towards it.</p></speech>

Ireland, collectively, needs to move speedily towards the implementation of the White Paper, notwithstanding the fact that some aspects of it are still open to discussion and need to be addressed.  Broadly speaking, we need to ensure we get to a point where our treatment of international protection applicants is human-rights compliant.  We also need to ensure that we do not leave the 6,500 people who are currently in direct provision in limbo while we are waiting two and a half or three years for an alternative to be implemented.  I again thank members for their time and consideration of these matters.</p></speech>

On behalf the committee, I thank both Dr. Lannon and Mr. Henderson for coming before it today even if it was only virtually.  I hope at some stage in the future they will be able to appear before the Oireachtas committee again in person.  I wish them both a good summer.</p></speech>

The petition states &quot;As a result of the events of 2020, the year 2021 remains uncertain on a global scale.&quot;  The petition seeks:</p> <blockquote> 	to extend the visa of all graduate students for one more year.  This would give us a more realistic chance of successfully securing [or] seeking ... a sponsorship.  This extension will not only be beneficial for students, but also for the Irish market for retaining a qualified workforce in the Country. </blockquote> <p>The reply from the Department of Justice in the advice note has been circulated to committee members.

The petitioner's name is Mr. Michael Barrett.  This petition concerns unauthorised development and the role of certain State and official bodies.  Petition No. 23/21 concerns the unauthorised development on the River Shannon.  The petitioner's name is Mr. Jamie Forde Kelly.  These two petitions are similar.  I propose that, in accordance with the powers given to the committee by Standing Orders, the committee consider both petitions at the same time.  Do members wish to comment?</p></speech>

I note a number of recommendations there as well.  The first petition, that the secretariat advises is similar to a petition that was submitted, is the one the Chairman covered to make the two the same petition.  However, it was what has been alleged here, on, I suppose, the Shannon Estuary.  It says here that there are currently legal proceedings, and the club mentioned is under investigation by both Waterways Ireland and Westmeath County Council.  We never got an update on that on the previous petitions committee because the Government fell.  On that basis, I appeal to the rest of the members to have a look at the two recommendations.  If we are joining the two of these together, my personal view is that recommendation 1 is the more proportionate and proper one to get responses to see what is happening with it.</p></speech>

This is what I am afraid of.  I would go with the recommendation on the first one of Mr. Jamie Forde Kelly.  On the recommendation, as one can see, there has been a considerable amount of work undertaken on this petition and the secretariat advises in respect of the report received on unathorised developments by Mr. Forde Kelly that Portaneena Marina is currently the subject of legal proceedings.  It goes on to say that the petition case manager also suggests that follow-up responses be sent to the Department and Westmeath County Council for an update on legal proceedings.  They are more or less the same recommendations.  I have no problem.  It is the same issue.  They are two separate petitions but it is the same recommendation.  If the rest of the committee is in agreement, recommendation 1 would be the one that I would be in agreement with.  This is normally how it works.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I also propose that both petitions be published.</p> <p>  Petition No. 10/21 is entitled "Abolish the restricted dogs list in favour of Deed Not Breed".  The petitioner's name is Mr. David Ward.  A reply was received from the Department of Community and Rural Development.  I propose that the petition be published; that the reply from the Department be published; and that we send the correspondence from the Department to Mr. Ward and ask him if he is satisfied with the reply.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. 12/21 is in the name of Mr. Niall Campbell.  I suggest that this petition is inadmissible as it contains the name or names of individuals, contrary to Standing Order 127(d).  I propose that the name of the individual be redacted from the petition when published.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next on the agenda was the election of the Vice Chairman which we agreed at the earlier meeting would be put off until after the recess.</p> <p>  We are well over the time.

Indeed, when you became Chair of this committee, I was one of the people who urged members to give you a chance to proceed.  I have to say - I do not go into rhetoric against any members - I was very disappointed to read about yourself and the comments that were attributed to you in relation to the death of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  I am just doing this because I am thinking of Mrs. Ann McCabe, her five children and her family.  I would ask you, without any further delay, to clarify your position on this so that we can move on because many of the members of the committee are quite upset about it.  I will not say any more about it.  Thank you for letting me in.</p></speech>

I have to say I was shocked by your alleged remarks.  As I said, I did not hear them.  I would like you to clarify them, be that here today if we have time or, certainly, in a public forum.  The article I read is unsettling and the matter needs to be addressed, obviously, by yourself, because the article related to you.  I am sure you know the one I am talking about.</p> <p>  Other members have spoken on it as well.  I await to hear from you on that, Chair.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Like Senator Murphy, I suppose, when you initially took up the job as Chair, my viewpoint was to get on with the work and crack on, but in light of these alleged comments - like Deputy Devlin, I have not heard the interview - and that article, I would appreciate it if you could clarify the situation, whether at this meeting or at a future one.  Thank you.</p></speech>

To clarify, I appreciate that people did not hear the interview.  Let me start.</p> <p>  The killing of Detective Jerry McCabe was unjustified and I condemn it unreservedly.  It was a reprehensible act.  I condemn everything about it, as my party leader made clear - the act and what they did.  I made it clear in a subsequent statement to Tipp FM last Friday in the interview.  We have consistently apologised to Mrs. McCabe and the McCabe family and Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan and his family as well.</p> <p>  I do not know why this arises.  It was made clear last Friday, with my answer on Tipp FM.  That is my position.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome Mr. Fionn Crombie Angus and his father, Mr. Jonathan Angus; Mr. James Cawley, policy officer, Independent Living Movement Ireland; and Mr. Paul McBride, chief executive officer, Mr. Owen Collumb, Mr. Gordon Ryan and Ms Fiona Weldon, &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta.  I would also like to thank our witnesses for facilitating the change in the meeting time from 12.30 p.m. to 9.30 a.m. this morning.  We are very appreciative of that.  It is important that we acknowledge that the witnesses had committed to attending and changed their schedules to suit us.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex or in the convention centre when the D&aacute;il or Seanad is sitting there.  In this regard, if members are joining the meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex or the convention centre prior to making a contribution.  For anyone watching the meeting online, witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, I ask everyone to bear with us should technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence the formal proceedings, I must begin with some formalities regarding matters of privilege.  I advise witnesses that they are directed to give only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings.  Witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts to note the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should also be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence regarding a particular matter, they must do so, and respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or entity outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Fionn Crombie Angus to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

It shows that the committee is keeping in mind the diversity of disability.  The kind of support I need is time and help to think things through.

I thank the committee for the series of inputs that were dedicated to Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  I commend the Deputies and Senators who have engaged to date on these matters.</p> <p>  To tell a little about myself, I am a son, brother, husband, friend, co&ndash;worker and very proud disabled person who uses a personal assistance service to live a life of my choosing.  Growing up in rural Ireland and being the youngest of nine siblings, my independence and activism skills were fostered from a very young age.  I went through education and progressed to university and now work in full-time employment and live with my wife, Ally.  I have received appropriate supports to live and experience the same life as my non-disabled peers.  These supports include assistive technology, a powered wheelchair, peer support, a special needs assistant, exam accommodations, accessible transport, accessible accommodation and personal assistance.  These supports have allowed me to make fundamental decisions and choices throughout my life.</p> <p>  With that said, I am very proud to be here representing a movement of disabled people across Ireland in my role as policy officer with Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI.  In this opening statement I will bring the committee through an introduction to ILMI and the philosophy of independent living.  I also want to speak about what a personal assistance service is and our PASNOW campaign.</p> <p>  ILMI is a campaigning, national representative, cross-impairment disabled persons organisation.  We promote the philosophy of independent living and seek to build an inclusive society.  Central to the way we work is to ensure that policy decisions that impact on the lives of disabled people must be informed by disabled people through our representative disabled persons organisations.  Our philosophy can be summed up as nothing about us without us and rights not charity.  Our vision is an Ireland where disabled persons have freedom, choice and control over all aspects of their lives and can fully participate in an inclusive society as equals.</p> <p>  ILMI was established as the first Irish centre for independent living in 1992 by and for disabled people in order that we as disabled people have choice and control over our lives, and fully participate in society as equal citizens.  The personal assistance services that are now available in Ireland came into existence in 1992 initially as a pilot project.  This was started by disabled people who designed a system in which they were in control of the direction, operation and management of their personal assistance service.  However, 30 years on, the personal assistance service is still a pilot project.  Disabled people in Ireland have no legal right to a personal assistance service despite national policies that support the deinstitutionalisation of disabled people.  In addition, Ireland has signed and ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As we all know, Article 19 states that disabled people have the right to live where and with whom they want and have choice, control and a range of supports in the community.  Ireland is rich in policy development but we need to work together to implement our policies to ensure the rights of disabled people are upheld.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly about the philosophy of independent living and what exactly a personal assistance service is for many disabled people throughout the country.  Independent living is about having the freedom to have the same choices that everyone else has in housing, transportation, education and employment.  Independent living is also about choosing what aspects of social, economic and political life we want to participate in.  Independent living is about having control over our lives to have a family, to get a job and to participate socially.  My supports allow me to be a son, brother, husband, friend and co&ndash;worker.</p> <p>  For many disabled people, independent living can best be achieved by the employment of personal assistants to provide supports where needed.  The personal assistance service is a tool that allows us to live independently.  The personal assistance service enables us to do all the tasks that we cannot do for ourselves.  It provides us with the freedom and flexibility to live our lives as we choose.  A personal assistant is hired to assist us with a range of day-to-day tasks that we cannot physically do for ourselves.  Many of us who use personal assistants say they are an extension of our limbs.  Often, they are our eyes or our ears.  With a personal assistance service we are in complete control.  We direct the personal assistant to carry out tasks inside and outside of the home, including personal care, domestic duties and assisting in day-to-day tasks such as shopping, support in the workplace or socialising.  A personal assistant does not look after or care for us.  We delegate these tasks to our personal assistants and in doing so we take back control of our lives.  A distinct benefit of a personal assistance service is that it reduces our dependence on our family and friends.  The confidential relationship that develops between us and our personal assistants allows us to maintain a private life and our dignity.  The personal assistance service is often the difference between existing and living for many of us.</p> <p>  To put this into context I will share an example.  According to information submitted by the HSE to the Committee on Public Petitions in 2017, 1.51 million service hours were delivered to 2,470 people.  However, these figures show that more than 84% of us who received a personal assistance service received less than three hours per day on average, with more than 44% of us in receipt of an average of 42 minutes per day.  It is clear that anyone who receives an average of 42 minutes per day is not going to be able to live independently, access education or employment or become involved in meaningful social engagement.  Disabled people with reduced services of this nature are unable to live the lives of their choosing.  They are often trapped in their own homes without the chance to interact and do the things they want to do in life.  They are prone to isolation, exclusion and institutionalisation in the home where they simply exist and not live.</p> <p>  I know the committee has dedicated sessions to deinstitutionalisation but I want to make reference to Wasted Lives.  Too many disabled people under the age of 65 are inappropriately placed in nursing homes or do not have the adequate and appropriate supports to live a life of their choosing.  If we think about this, can committee members imagine all their choices being taken away?  Can they imagine being told when to eat, drink and go to bed and all of their decision making taken away?</p> <p>  We as a national disabled persons' organisation support the philosophy of independent living.  Independent living is not just about living in a house or building a house.  It is about all the pieces of the jigsaw fitting together.  It is about our choices, our control and our dignity and having appropriate and adequate supports to have the choice, dignity and respect to live a life of our choosing.</p> <p>  We, as a disabled persons' organisation, have developed PASNOW, which is a national campaign.  In consultation with our members, we have identified five asks.  These are to define, legislate, invest, standardise and promote the personal assistance service.  We want a universal accepted definition of the personal assistance service that places disabled people at the centre of any service provided and is directed by us to meet our needs to live independent lives.  The personal assistance service is about providing us with the necessary supports, inside and outside the homes, to enable us to live a life of choice, dignity and respect.  The personal assistance service needs to be separated from home help and home care with its own ring-fenced funding.</p><p>Our second ask is to introduce legislation to guarantee us the right to a personal assistance service, as per Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  With legislation, however, we need investment to increase the budget for personal assistance services by &euro;12.5 million annually to provide an additional 500,000 hours each year to enable us to lead independent lives.</p><p> We want to standardise, promote and introduce a single standard assessment of need across all HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas.  This must include the provision and support for independent assessment of need, as per the Disability Act 2005, and the creation of a national standardised system that will allow for portability of services across CHO areas, meeting our social, personal and employment needs with no bureaucratic barriers.  Finally, we want to ensure that we are all made aware of the availability of the personal assistance service in order that those who wish to lead their lives independently can access the necessary supports to do so.</p><p> In summary, I remind members that independent living is about choice and control.  The personal assistance service is about giving disabled people that control.  The committee should remember that we ratified the UNCRPD in 2018.  We, as a disabled persons' organisation want a system that meets the needs of disabled people, which includes investment and standardisation to legalise the right to protect our rights to live independently.  We believe this would be a way to realise and implement Article 19 of the UNCRPD.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all members of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters for listening.  I look forward to questions or comments.</p></speech>

I, along with my colleagues present, wish to thank the committee for this opportunity to make our representation.  I will now make a number of points to give some background to our previous submission.<br/><br/>&Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta&rsquo;s, &Aacute;T, mission statement is to provide leadership and support in Ireland to empower disabled people to direct their own lives and enjoy the same freedoms, choices, control and opportunities their non-disabled counterparts take for granted.  As disabled people, we need daily personal support to carry out all our daily activities and routines necessary to live an ordinary life in our own homes.  To do this, we need the support and assistance of other people.  We call these people our personal assistants and we call ourselves &quot;leaders&quot;.<br/><br/>We employ our own personal assistants and direct their work through our independent companies we have set up for this purpose.  &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta acts as an intermediary or broker between each of the leader's companies and the funders, that is, the HSE, to set up a direct payment to our companies.  This brokership model enables us to move from a service delivery model, such as residential care, to choosing and managing our own service, which is a personal assistant service.<br/><br/>Everything we do is underpinned by the philosophy of independent living and the social model of disability.  True independent living allows individuals to custom-design their own supports based on their own individual needs, capabilities and aspirations and in doing so, it contributes to the development of a more equal and just society for everyone.  We believe leaders are the best experts on their own lives and it is important that their expertise is listened to and valued.<br/><br/>The availability of direct payment options in this country is a hugely important step to have rights and independence and be equally recognised as disabled people.  &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta commissioned National University of Ireland, Galway, to conduct research into our model.  The overwhelming conclusion was that it was quite literally life changing for those who<i></i>had the ability to take up this opportunity.<br/><br/>One of our strategic objectives as a peer-led organisation is to lobby appropriate stakeholders to make our model more readily available nationally and to ensure that leaders who undertake the &Aacute;T process will be facilitated by Government to move to full independence.<br/><br/>As a committee, we are well aware of Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which deals with living independently and being included in the community<b>.  </b>It states that parties to the convention recognise the equal right of all disabled people to live in the community and have choices equal to others, and shall take effective and appropriate measures to facilitate the full enjoyment by people with disabilities of this right.<br/><br/>As we work towards universal availability of the direct payments, &Aacute;T has demonstrated to the HSE the benefits of our model, which has been accepted nationally within the HSE.  On this basis, we requested additional funding to create more places to support new leaders all over the country in getting a direct payment.  This request has been denied in the context of the ongoing personalised budgets demonstration projects.  These projects are now significantly behind schedule by more than three years, however, having initially been intended to report in June 2020.<br/><br/>To achieve full independence, &Aacute;T provides training and support to leaders to establish and manage their own service.  Once leaders are experienced and proficient in this, it is our view that they should be facilitated to move to complete independence and sign their own service level agreement with the HSE rather than the brokership agreement.  This facility is currently denied to them if they wish to have it.<br/><br/>We now make a number of recommendations going forward.  First, we call for the immediate removal of restrictions on leaders to move to full independence, entitling them to leave a broker and be in receipt of their funding directly from HSE.  This could be accommodated via the current demonstration project structures.  This would, however, require the immediate implementation of the demonstration projects in a much more comprehensive manner than is currently the case.<br/><br/>We call for immediate action to make direct payments available to all leaders who desire to choose direct payments for themselves.  We have been waiting too long for the HSE demonstration projects to complete their evaluation.  Leaders are in situations today where their freedom to choose is being denied, which is an infringement of their basic human rights under Article 19 of the UNCRPD.  An interim solution is to make more funding available to organisations such as &Aacute;T, which can, in the short- to medium-term, begin to increase capacity to support more leaders.  This can be done against the backdrop of the continuing demonstration projects, with some agreement in place that leaders could migrate to one of the appropriate models that emerge from the demonstration projects.</p><p> We wish to incorporate capacity-building, in the form of a peer support group, and independent living training and its principles in the demonstration projects in order to enable less able leaders or potential leaders to become more self confident and to succeed in using the direct payment.  Finally, we would like to change terminology in the committee's communications from "people with disabilities" to "disabled people".</p></speech>

I thank them for attending and for their opening statements.  What they have outlined fits in very well with what the committee has been discussing over recent weeks.  We have talked about people in residential care and young people being placed inappropriately in nursing homes.  The main reason that happens is because supports are not there to facilitate them living in the community.  We are not only talking about that physical support of a house, which is often available, but the supports such as the personal assistant service.</p> <p>  Some of the figures we have been given this morning are quite alarming.  Mr. Cawley said that 1.5 million service hours are divided among 2,470 people has lead to an average of 42 minutes daily for 44% of users, which he rightly pointed out is not a personal assistant service.  Can he explain the process for approval of a personal assistant service?  Is it the case that not everyone who applies is granted the service?  Is it based on funding?  Is it because it is not a legal right?</p> <p>  Mr. Fionn Crombie Angus indicated that he is the first person with an intellectual disability to avail of a personal assistant service.  Do many people with intellectual disabilities have a personal assistant service or is it largely confined to people with physical disabilities?  Standardisation was mentioned by the witnesses.  What exactly does this mean?  Why is it important?</p> <p>  Transforming Lives says that 5% of the disability budget is used for the personal assistant service and 85% is used for residential and day services.  Is that indicative of a model of care that is outdated and in total contravention of the UNCRPD?  How can those figures be reversed comprehensively?  Those questions are to whomever wishes to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cawley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070800002#D00400"><p>The Deputy has hit the nail on the head.  When the figures are broken down to 42 minutes a day on average, we have to ask whether that is independent living or a move to institutionalise people at home.  Realistically, personal assistance is about the freedom to make choices about when to get up in the morning, when to go to bed in the evening and so on.  If you break it down, with 42 minutes per day, you would be lucky to get a slice of toast and butter it and have a shower routine, for example.</p> <p>  The standardisation point is vital.  It is a postcode lottery at the moment.  Ireland is broken into nine CHO areas.  I might get different hours in Longford than someone else in a different CHO area.  If I get a job in a different CHO area, I cannot move my service.  There is no portability of services and that is across the board, not only personal assistant services.  I mentioned when I was at university and my wheelchair broke down in County Kildare.  Because it broke down in there, I was told I had to get my broken powered wheelchair, which is one of my independent living supports, to the CHO area where it was funded.  That is something we need to move away from.  That is why we need to look at standardising this process across the island and looking at a centralised system.</p></speech>

The fundamental point behind setting up the demonstration project was to bridge the gap between the person with the disability or disabled person and the funder.  We have been asking for funding to come directly from the HSE into our own companies which we have set up, or which Fionn set up.  It cuts out a lot of the work between service providers and administration.  We are prepared to run our own companies after some training and employ our own staff, do payrolls and be accountable for that money and have our accounts audited each year.  &Aacute;T is a broker system.  We believe we would leave the broker system eventually having added more capacity and been aware of what direct payment was and have payment from the HSE into our own accounts which would be audited once a year.  We would be accountable for that and go through all due process.  Some people have budgets already which are really restrictive and offer them packages where someone comes into their home from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. whether they need them or not.  They spend that amount of time in their home and then they leave the disabled person who may not even have needed to spend money on that occasion.  We are asking for a more flexible service where funding makes a direct pathway to the individual.  We manage it and we will probably find better value which is what we found from our study with NUI Galway.</p></speech>

AT has added 18 members over the past four years and we now stand at 42.  We are capped, to some extent, at that level because of the lack of funding and we referenced that in the opening statement Mr. Collumb delivered.</p> <p>  On the point made by Deputy Tully on intellectual disability and a personalised budget or direct payment being available, 23% of our current membership have intellectual disabilities, and the payment is available to persons across the spectrum of disability.  Typically, people who come to AT will already have a HSE-funded budget.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their contributions.  I am jealous of Fionn having visited 30 countries and being a lecturer, teacher and everything else.  It just shows that when people get an opportunity, they should grab hold of it, as we all should.  We all deserve opportunities and to be able to grab hold of our dreams and create those opportunities for ourselves.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Cawley.  We all agree in order for the PAS system to provide independent living, it needs to have flexibility and choice and be a rights-based model.   Are there good international examples?  What form would such a model take in Ireland?  How best can we implement those principles in Ireland, in light of the best models?  As we know, we rarely have to reinvent the wheel but rather adapt it to an Irish model.  How best can we do that in Ireland in line with the UNCRPD?</p> <p>  Mr. Cawley mentioned the lip service paid to personal assistants, who get so few hours.  Is there a model for the best length of time that personal assistants should give?</p></speech>

Independent Living Movement Ireland has carried out research and produced a paper with the centre for disability law and policy at the National University of Ireland, Galway, which we launched in the audiovisual room at Leinster House.  In examining other jurisdictions, we considered four options, one of which was identified as the standard or approach we should take, that is, stand-alone legislation.</p> <p>  As for where this has been done well, Sweden is seen as a gold standard for personal assistance services and it remains the only European country that legally confers a right to a personal assistance service.  Other jurisdictions, such as the UK, Denmark, France and Germany, have legislation, but our research focused on stand-alone legislation because that is the point at which PAS could be given that ring-fenced funding.  Moreover, legislation would protect the investment.</p> <p>  As far back as 1996, we identified that ten hours a week would suffice for a person's care needs but would not allow us to participate in all pieces of the jigsaw, such as engaging in employment, social life and so on.  In Sweden, for example, at a local level anything up to 20 hours is funded to the person but anything over that goes from a centralised approach.</p> <p>  There is research and we have the report, which I would be happy to circulate to any member or the committee as a whole.</p></speech>

Life is not one-dimensional; it changes from day to day, as the PAS does.  When a person has a personalised budget, he or she can change that budget accordingly.  He or she can pay for five hours in the morning one day and may not need all the additional time.  The budget can be maximised accordingly.</p> <p>  I visited Sweden around 2000 to see its model in operation.  It seems to have something similar to the way the AT network is set up.  People can bundle hours and store them up for special occasions.  They can spend the budget on that occasion if they are going out to socialise, for example.  A large number of hours are given to people who just hold on to them because they are afraid they will lose them in certain circumstances, which does not make for an efficient service.  It all comes down to money and hours at the end of the day, and we need to maximise those hours to live independently.</p> <p>  Furthermore, people need additional hours to live a full life in the community.  Many people get hours just to get them out of bed in the morning and be put back into bed at night.  That is not independent living; it is just surviving.  It has been sold as independent living because there is a budget or hourly allocation for that.  Direct payments are something we have to take on board.  We have to get the demonstration projects up and running and test this model as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Cawley on legislating to guarantee the right to a personal assistance service.  It needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  A large amount of work has been done by the task force, which is represented on this call.  Mr. Crombie Angus, Mr. Collumb and Mr. Ryan were participants in that task force.  Its report recommended the demonstration projects.  We are all agreed that the demonstration projects are the vehicle for assessing the variations of personalised budgets.  If there is one message that I could get across to the committee, it is that we ideally need to see some positive and meaningful progress on the projects.  This is not meant to criticise, given Covid and other reasons, but there was meant to be a report in June of last year and we have still not seen any great momentum.  If the committee put its political weight behind the projects, it would be wonderful.  We need to see those projects brought to a conclusion in order that we can move forward with whatever they recommend as the correct model or models for a personalised budget.</p></speech>

We consulted our members around the demonstration projects.  There have been significant delays and some people have been given different messages, though, so it would be good to progress the projects.  We must remember that the personal assistance service was originally set up to give people choice and control.  We need to move away from the medical approach taken in Ireland.  This would be one way of moving towards a rights-based approach and social model of disability.  I support the points that have been made.</p></speech>

We are indebted to them for their contributions to the meeting, which will inform our work.  Our committee has been tasked with accelerating the transition to a social model, person-centred and rights-based approach to supporting disabled people in living independent and full lives.</p> <p>  I will make several observations and ask several questions.  A member of the HSE is not present today, which might have been an oversight.  This discussion would have benefited from the opinions of a representative of the HSE.</p> <p>  I have several concerns about the assessment of need in order to qualify for participation in the pilot.  This is a right that was enshrined in the Disability Act 2005, and disabled people have reached out to me to say that after years spent battling to obtain their current services, they do not want to be reassessed, which is understandable.  Why do we believe it is okay to reassess disabled people when they already fought an uphill battle, with a great deal of bureaucracy and jumping through hoops, to prove something?  The discrimination that pervades these assessments of need is patronising and ableist.  Disabled people are expected to rank their daily activities between essential and non-essential and to differentiate between personal care, community participation and domestic and social needs in a way that a non-disabled person would never be.  For example, if a disabled person's social needs are more urgent than personal care, the same hours will not be provided if he or she mentions at assessment stage that he or she has a partner who can provide support for those needs.  This could have a devastating impact on the individual's primary relationships.  Suspicion and scarcity are at the root of these assessments.  The subtext seems to be one of "Give them an inch and they will take a mile".  We must strive for self-assessment with full alignment to will and preference policies must be striven for.  Mr. Cawley made reference to this.</p> <p>  It is striking that the personalised budget demonstration is being piloted again despite the fact that it was first piloted in 1992 with EU funding through a programme called INCARE.  It is unproductive and wasteful to allow progress on personal assistance services and personalised budgets to stagnate by not relying on direct lived experience.</p> <p>  Members of &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta - I struggle with the pronunciation, for which I apologise - have told the committee that they have sought funding to extend their life-changing broker model of personal assistance but have been refused.  Between 2008 and 2018, there was no increase in funding for the provision of personal assistance.  Since then, there has been a marginal increase, but one that is barely worth mentioning, as 84% of PAS users receive less than three hours per day.  Even more disheartening, 44% receive less than 42 minutes per day.  It is difficult to imagine trying to reduce the day's activities into 42 minutes.  Would someone choose to have a shower, go for a walk, clean the house or do the shopping?  It does not leave people with any time for hobbies, work, education or parenting.  It tells us a great deal about our expectations of disabled people's lives.</p> <p>  A disabled friend of mine recently called trying to access service provision as akin to being on parole for life for the crime of having a disability.  My friend must not violate the conditions of parole, in that she must be available for reviews and risk assessments and prove her impairment repeatedly.  If her quality of life improves too much, she is threatened with losing her vital services and going back to square one.  It is a life sentence without parole, as she would say.  This is a stark but effective description of the disempowerment of disabled people.</p> <p>  My first question is directed to each of the witnesses.  How can we as a committee offer our support to them in ensuring that the Government takes their experience seriously and does not delay the inevitable by issuing pilot after pilot?</p> <p>  What are &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta's main concerns about the personalised budget demonstration pilot's roll-out and how it meets the standards of the social model, the will and preference policy, the UNCRPD and empowerment?  Given its representatives' direct lived experience and their knowledge of what is involved in the assessment, do they believe it is invasive and infringes on privacy rights by leaving disabled people open to a higher level of questioning and inspection than non-disabled people would ever be expected to put up with?  Have they spoken to anyone who has been selected for the pilot and what has that person's experience been to date?</p></speech>

At the moment, &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta is just a brokership which facilitates money from the HSE, signs the service-level agreement with the HSE and facilitates the money being put into individuals' bank accounts.  It offers administration advice and how to manage that money.  There is also a charge then to individuals for that administration fee, which is considerable.  &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta is not the answer to direct payments.  I was a member of the task force.  I am currently waiting for the service to be rolled out because I have applied for a direct payment through the task force.  There are three models of direct payments - one which is less bureaucratic, one which is similar to &Aacute;T and is similar to a brokership model and then there is signing a service-level agreement with the HSE and having money directly paid to the individual to run their own service.  I emphasise &Aacute;T is one model of direct payments.  We need more models in the system.  We need choice and control.</p><p> It would be incorrect for me to leave this discussion without saying the HSE model of delivering PA services has seemed to go down a different pathway where private organisations buy hours from the HSE to deliver services to people with disabilities.  These are private companies which are profiting on the back of our disabilities.  It seems to be the norm at the moment that the private company will be given a number of hours to look after us in our homes, workplaces or colleges.  We do not need looking after.  We decide on what we want to do with our lives and we can direct our lives in the way we wish.</p><p> That is just an overview of our organisation.  It is not perfect in any way, shape or form.  We are not a prison.  We let people come to our organisation and leave it when they wish.  We will even facilitate them with those choices as well.  Members may call us the &Aacute;T network if they find &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochta too difficult.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

First, we need a standard assessment of need across all CHO areas.  Currently, for example, your application can be assessed by a public health nurse or an occupational therapist.  They could be rooted in the medical model of disability and only believe in a care approach to people coming through their doors.  By contrast, people who apply for a personal assistance service knowingly do so for assistance and not care.  We need to make that difference between care and assistance distinct and change from the medical model of disability to the social model.  These applications go to the CHO area and within that to what are know as community discussion forums or clearing house committees.  Bear in mind that if I send in my application, I am not there.  I repeat "nothing about us without us".  I should be there and I should be consulted.  Let us assume it is all non-disabled people sitting around a table talking about disabled people's needs and rights.</p> <p>  Deputy Wynne talked about the social requirements and needs we have.  Currently, disabled people talk about their personal care needs and priority one.  However, what about our social needs?  What about what when I am working all week and want to go out for a pint on a Friday evening?  We are human beings.  We should be able to decide when and where we go.  That came across very strongly in a consultation ILMI did over February and March when we were, as we all know, reporting back as a country on the UNCRPD.  Particularly with reference to Article 7, when we engaged with young people they said their spontaneity is always impacted.  When they are 16, 17 and 18 years of age they want to do what their non-disabled peers do.  That is a really strong point we need to talk about.  To return briefly to the example of the clearing house committee, we would not go to a men's shed and ask to consult on women's issues and that is something lots of people have said, colleagues included.  We need therefore to start, under Article 4.3 of the UNCRPD, to engage with disabled people.  We must engage with the representative organisations for disabled persons led by and for disabled people.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked did we know anybody in relation to the personalised budgets.  We did a consultation with people in May.  There was a huge amount of participation.  People were frustrated about the lack of contact, of clarity and of a clear sense of a plan for how the demonstrator projects would be delivered.  For example, many people had signed up in September 2019 and have been sent emails and calls had been made and not returned.  Some people just want to know what the story is with this going forward.  The lack of communication impacts then on their choice, their supports and their pathway to work towards the personalised budgets.  We recommend full details and clear timelines for these models must be delivered.  We need a clear commitment from the HSE, the Department of Health and of course the Department for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is a mouthful, on the demonstration models as a pathway to personalised budgets for disabled people.</p><p>In 2019, a motion brought before the D&aacute;il by Deputy Pringle was unanimously agreed.  It was a historic debate.  Following on from that, to try to link the local level to the national level and <i>vice versa</i>, we asked disabled people who use personal assistance services at a local level to engage with their elected representatives and local authorities to have a motion on a right to a personal assistance service passed.  That work is ongoing.  In light of Covid-19, four or five local authorities have not yet passed that motion.  We are working to get that done.  When done, we would like to progress the motion through both Houses of the Oireachtas to keep the issue live.  I hope I have answered the questions put to me.  </p></speech>

She asked how the committee might assist us.  As I said earlier, we would welcome some political focus on the demonstration project.  We accept there are some flaws within it in terms of, for example, reassessment of need where a budget is already provided.  There are restrictions around entitlement to participate in the pilot in terms of age and existing budgets.  As mentioned by Fionn and Jonathan Angus, the question is around whether the project is adequately resourced.  A budget of &euro;1.3 million of public finding is ring-fenced for the project, which I understand will go towards funding 4.5 full-time equivalent staff plus a project manager.  One wonders if that is adequate resourcing for a project that essentially will engage with 180 individuals through three different variants of a personalised budget.  That said, as mentioned by Deputy Wynne, there have been attempts here before.  We are where we are and there has been a lot of effort put into getting us to where we are in terms of the task force.  I do not think we should allow a loss of momentum in terms of bringing this to a conclusion.  If we do, we will be right back to the start.  That would be a terrible waste of time and effort and it would be very disappointing for many people.</p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned that &Aacute;iseanna Taca&iacute;ochata has applied for and been refused funding in relation to growing its numbers and to provide more spaces to individuals.  The Deputy is correct that we have applied for funding through two different channels.  We applied to the national office, HSE, for an increase in our core funding and we also applied to the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, Deputy Rabbitte, for funding under the strengthening disability fund for the same purpose.  In both cases, we were declined the funding in the context of the demonstration project.  That is the only show in town in terms of where personalised budgets will go.  That was fine two or three years ago, but three years down the road there are people whose opportunity to avail of a direct payment is being denied to them while the project is delayed.  There is need for an interim plan to provide small but not insignificant amounts of funding to organisations like AT so that we can, at least, provide some additional spaces to those individuals who are waiting while await the demonstration project.  </p></speech>

I compliment Fionn Angus, James Cawley, Owen Collumb, Paul McBride and all of the other witnesses who contributed.   On Mr. McBride's point with regard to the budget that is required now to move on with the personal assistance scheme, which he says is not a huge budget, does he have a quantum for it?</p> <p>  In regard to the personal assistance pilot scheme, do the witnesses believe it is just tokenism and a box ticking exercise?  Is there a lack of enthusiasm or intent within the HSE and Department of Health to deliver on it in a timely fashion such that we get to the point where we can provide a national personal assistance fund?  I am struck by the huge amount of expertise available to us through the witnesses here this morning, in particular Fionn's expertise in regard to best practice in the UK and internationally.  The witnesses are a huge asset to us as a committee in trying to ensure that in whatever we do, we do some good.  </p> <p>  I heard it mentioned that there is inflexibility in the system.  I believe each CHO area is working in silos and there is no cross-purpose.  Mr. Cawley mentioned the problem he had with his wheelchair and the distance he had to travel to get the problem sorted.  It is silly things that are holding up people getting parity of esteem.  What has impressed me most today is that all the witnesses are looking for, and all we should be talking about, is that they can take control of their own lives and make their own daily decisions.  That is fine.  The committee will take on board what has been said today.  Any other information that the witnesses might have that they feel would be helpful, they should forward to us.  </p> <p>  I might be talking out of turn but I understand we will be re-engaging with today's witnesses again because we will need them to help us to inform the Department and the Minister as best we can in our work.  I thank the witnesses for the content of their presentations, in respect of which I have been taking notes.  I have learned a great deal.  I ask Mr. McBride to brief the committee on the level of funding required.  </p></speech>

I am a PA user.  I work for ILMI and I am on the board of the &Aacute;T network.  I have been supporting people to get an individualised budget.  One of the key issues is that we are finding it really hard to debundle money already within a service such that people can take it out and use it as a personalised budget to live the life that they want.  That is something the committee could look at.  There is no system at the moment to help disability services or the HSE look at how they would allocate funding to a person that wants to leave a service and have a personal assistant as opposed to a day or residential service.</p></speech>

We see the &Aacute;T network as an opportunity for people to develop capacity to manage their own support service.  Then, they can move away from &Aacute;T and sign their own service agreement directly with the HSE.  There is no requirement to do that but ultimately, we see that as our final goal.  At this point in time, as I said before, this is not available to the leaders.  Therefore, for as long as they stay with &Aacute;T, their arrangement via &Aacute;T must be with the HSE.</p> <p>  To come back to Deputy Canney's question on funding, our board operates in a conservative and careful manner, working within our own capacity.  Our numbers have grown by 18 over the last four years.  Our recent proposal to the HSE, which was declined, was to grow our numbers by a further 18 over the next two years.  To do that, we would have required an investment of &euro;93,000, essentially to develop resources at our head office, to support those leaders who would have joined us.  There would have been an offset, as Mr. Collumb referred to earlier, to the subscription fee the leader would pay to us for our service.  Therefore, a net funding position of &euro;53,000 was what we first put through to the HSE's national office, and then to the strengthening disability services fund.  We were capped on the strengthening disability services fund at 1% of our public funding.  That was &euro;26,000.  As I say, that was declined.  That information gives a feel for the quantum.  The demonstration projects look at 180 individuals and that was a &euro;1.3 million budget.  We felt that probably was not sufficiently resourced either. </p> <p> On the point of tokenism Deputy Canney raised, the HSE's policy and strategy says the right things and uses the right language.  The head of strategy and planning for disability services at the HSE addressed the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, recently.  He talked about objective 5 of the HSE's corporate plan for 2021-24 on disability services, which was "to be the most responsive, person-centred model achievable with greater flexibility and choice for the service user".  Certainly, at a national strategic level, the HSE uses the language we want to hear.  Within the HSE's national service plan for 2021, personalised budgets are a committed area of strategic reform.  It is there in the strategies and policies.  However, it is unfortunate that the reality on the ground seems somewhat different.  We are now three years down the road and we have made no progress on the demonstration projects.  We feel, therefore, that the demonstration projects are under-resourced.  There is a disparity between implementation and written strategy. </p></speech>

To come back to Deputy Canney&rsquo;s question, the unbundling of funding is key.  I come from the area where I had an accident.  I was physically able-bodied and moved into residential care.  I moved out of residential care into a house in the community, where I was looked after by a different agency.  Thereafter, I moved from that agency into the &Aacute;T network, where I am at the moment.  Now, I am looking at moving towards the demonstration projects.  Unbundling the funding is a nightmare.  To have funding follow the individual is something on which we need to work much more.  There are restrictions.  Organisations do not like you taking money out of one organisation and transferring it into a different organisation.  There are no processes or guidelines on how to do that easily.  Typically, for my disability, I would have a budget in the region of &euro;120,000 to pay my personal assistants.  However, agencies do not typically like you to move money from agency to agency within short periods.  They have administration staff and back office staff to pay.  As Ms Weldon said, the unbundling process is key.  Movement of money restricts people from having their choices and going to different agencies.  That is about it.  The key point, as I see it, is the ability of people to move from one agency to another or to be the service they wish to be in.</p></speech>

This has been interesting.  I was struck by Mr. Collumb&rsquo;s last comment.  It comes back to that question of choice.  It is important to centre choice, both in terms of how time is used and of the priorities in life for the person with the disability.  It strikes me that this is something we have encountered in the committee, in that Ireland drags its heels in delivering things and then the area moves on.  We are, therefore, still talking about statutory home care.  Now, we are moving towards an era where we need to look at statutory entitlements to personal assistance.  Having not delivered the one, the other has now become crucial.  It strikes me that this is the problem with some of the piloting.  While there is a pilot under way, evidence of the important features already has been gathered.  We do not need the pilot to see the importance of personal needs assistants.</p> <p>  Instead of relying even just on pilots, we could also look at models being successfully used in other countries.  Sweden is one example.  There is a statutory right to personal assistants in Sweden.  This is accompanied by personalised budget.  Is that model interesting?  Is there much to learn in Ireland from that model in Sweden where it is a statutory right and is accompanied by a personalised budget?</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Crombie Angus and others, on which any witness can comment.  In Sweden, it is possible to hire family members as personal assistants..  How do we balance that?  It may well be good to be able to hire family members, but how do we make sure that it is not seen as a family carer role but is different and reflects the real, free choice of the budget holder?  How do we ensure that control and leadership sit with the person with a disability?  What safeguards can be put in place to ensure that dynamic?  I was struck by the comments on the problem of privatised private company services.  Does an assistant answer to the person with the disability as his or her employer?  It is important that such assistants do, rather than them simply reporting to a private company about the services they have delivered.</p><p>How important is it to build into the standardised and good practice models clarity as to where direction comes from?</p><p> I was concerned to hear that there are limitations on the budgeting.  No project will demonstrate everything that might be possible in personal assistance services because they are limited and constrained in their budgets, as Fionn noted.  How can we ensure the learning the State takes from those projects will be supplemented by other, perhaps better practice, examples in other countries, as well as from those who may not be in the demonstration project but who are using personal assistance?  Has the Independent Living Movement Ireland or &Aacute;T been consulted on the research that is accompanying or will emerge from the demonstration projects?  Are they getting to input such that the pilots are placed in a wider context of the collective lived experience of people who have used personal assistance?</p><p> James mentioned assistive technologies and their importance.  Will he comment on those that can be used to supplement and support personal assistance services and how that can be done effectively?</p><p> I was struck by the point about social and cultural participation and the relationship aspect.  It is another dynamic that applies to the family aspect.  How can personal assistance services support people in their relationships with others?  For example, could they support someone to support his or her family members?  How do they support people to be a supportive husband, brother or co-worker, for example?  Our guests might comment on how we can maximise the positive impact those using the service can have on others.</p><p> To clarify, Article 19 is the core issue.  I would welcome comments on how personal assistance services, as opposed to merely care, fulfil the obligations of that article.</p></speech>

There are risks also if the person being hired is a stranger.  The system has to protect the person with a disability in all cases, but the protection needs to be balanced with the freedom of the person to do what he or she wants to do.</p> <p>  Fionn does not know much about the Swedish system but he wanted to give an example about his visit to Australia.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jonathan Angus" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070800002#K00500"><p>We often end with the deficit discussion of how a person is disabled and how much money he or she should get as a result of his or her disability.  Australia has some problems with this system, but one good aspect is that there can be a further conversation about what would be good in the person's life and how he or she could be enabled to have the life he or she envisages.  As a result of that conversation, additional funding is often available to encourage creativity and to fund not just people getting to the starting line, in order that it is fair and everybody is at zero instead of being negative, but also to help people to have a good life, and creativity is encouraged in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.734" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cawley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021070800002#K00600"><p>This goes back to the general question of the need for the disabled person to lead and be in control.  It is interesting that during this meeting, all the witnesses have mentioned choice, aspirations and control.  The one thing we all want in our lives - disabled or non-disabled - is that choice and to have aspirations and control.  It is important that the wishes of disabled people be respected all the time.</p> <p>  That brings me to the definition of personal assistance services.  We in ILMI, as a national disabled persons' organisation know the definition of personal assistance services, but among CHO areas and service providers, that varies.  That, inevitably, leads to flaws within some service providers, in that it might become more of a care or home help role.  A definition needs to place the disabled person at the centre and take account of our needs.  In consultation with our members, we came up with a definition, and it is important that the definition is consistent among the CHO areas to standardise that approach.  That is one way of helping to realise standardisation.</p> <p>  As I said, I can send to the committee a copy of the paper on the Swedish model.  It refers to eligibility assessment, with the person in control.  At local level, a person can get up to 20 hours, and if he or she requires more, that is done at a national level.  Moreover, funding is in place and there is flexibility for a person to fully direct his or her service.  In summary, the key aspects are eligibility in respect of cross-impairment, the funding being there and the fact that the local and national levels are linked, which is really good.</p> <p>  The point the Senator made about assistive technology is really important.  We need to consider a suite of options and to pull out the tools from the toolbox of independent living that enable me and many disabled people to live independently.  For me, those tools are a powered wheelchair, a personal assistant and assistive technology, such as an accessible house.  Nevertheless, while we might live in a house, the assistive technology has to be implemented, whether motors on the door or whatever it is, to enable us to live independently.</p> <p>  That brings me to the final point, which relates to Article 19.  A home or a house has four walls, but we need to be able to engage and live in that home with the range of supports such as personal assistance or assistive technology.  Moreover, a house can be situated somewhere that is not close to transport and is not connected to the community or to the post office, the pub, restaurants or whatever the case may be.  It is about being connected to one's community, and that reminds me of our public sector duty and obligations.</p><p>Under public sector duty obligations all public bodies need to connect the housing with the supports and the supports with housing and so on.  I hope this has answered some of the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

The learning that I have taken from it is how capable disabled people become when they are given the resources and the personal assistance service to live a life.  Some of the most capable people I know have been people with disabilities.  The people who have gone before me have inspired me.  Otherwise, I would not have made the huge step from institutional care to living in the community.  It was people with disabilities who inspired me to take that step.  That is the real learning.  The results should say that those people have made society better for us all and especially in Ireland.  It is people being out and about, going to work, and normalising it in society.  It is normal to meet an individual with a disability in the workplace now where it was not so normal years ago when it did not come so easily to us.  We could not get on buses to travel.  We could not get to the work places that were accessible.  Such change has come from us lobbying politicians and the HSE.  It came from good people with good intentions to make society more equal for everyone.  If we stand side by side to progress we realise that society is not easy for people with disability to engage in.  There is a huge range of issues still to iron out including direct payments, getting assistance services, assistive technology to include people with disabilities in the workplace, in education and in normal activities in their lives, so that a child who is born with a disability in Ireland today grows up with aspirations of leaving home, going to college, having a family and having a so-called "normal" life.  That can be achieved by having a personal assistance package.  Something that small can be life changing.  The alternative is that people stay at home, depend on elderly parents, and become institutionalised when their parents can no longer look after them.  There is a choice there between A or B in some situations.  As long as we are in a position to lobby and have other people on our side to progress independent living, personalised budgets, accessible home environments and accessible work environments, we will make huge changes and advances for everyone.  I have a disability.  Ms Weldon has a disability.  It could be a reality for Mr. Cawley, for example, or any one of his family members going forward.  I will leave it on that note.  It is profound that we are all on the same page in trying to achieve something valuable here.</p></speech>

I noted the comments made by Ms Weldon on the assistive technologies not having budgets at the moment.  In that bigger transformative picture on independent living I am very struck by the idea that there seems to be three or four pieces to it.  We have focused a lot on the personal assistance service, which is core.  In his previous contribution Mr. Cawley referred to the national disability inclusion strategy not recognising personal assistance, creating that equivalence between care and personal assistance and not pulling that out.  In the personalised budget piece how important is it that we do not allow personalised budgets, which need to be increased, to let public services off the hook or that people have to personally pay for assistive technologies.  There is an almost the capital infrastructure  of the investment in assistive technologies.  Should that and could that be a separate budget that is made available?  I imagine that on occasion these may be very expensive purchases.  Should it be separate to the idea of the personalised budget, which is how a person is living his or her life?  As a committee we need to keep the pressure on so that the public services are serving everybody and that individuals do not have to try to find private solutions for public services that are falling short.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Cawley have a comment on the issue of personal assistance for those who do not have a physical disability?</p></speech>

We often think about accessibility in the context of doors and steps but sometimes we do not think about accessibility in terms of websites, information, consultations and so on.  That is vitally important.  We must ensure as a society that all of these are made accessible under Article 9 and the public sector duty.</p> <p>  We would recognise, as do many people who are disabled, that assistive technology is as important as personal assistance.  There absolutely should be provision to fund assistive technology to enable people who are disabled.  Again, it goes back to the key method about the person deciding.  For example, it is more important for me to be able to live independently than it is to have assistive technology, if that makes sense.  The personal assistance service, the assistive technology and so on allow for the pieces of the jigsaw to be tied together.</p></speech>

We all come to this committee because we have empathy and a belief in the UN convention.  Empathy is all well and good, but we also need an investment in and understanding of people.  These engagements help us with that understanding and make sure to give is a kick to keep going.  How does this all make Mr. Crombie Angus feel that he is constantly pushing for this equity in his own country, in his own world and his own society?  We all know that society is the barrier. We all put up those barriers.  How does this make him feel?  How does it make the witness feel when those barriers are actually pulled down?  Mr. Cawley spoke about the assistive technology.  Ms Weldon spoke about the ability to travel, and Owen spoke about his ability to live independently.  How does this make them personally feel when the barriers are taken down and you are liberated?  Please feel free to answer or not answer but I believe that this is the crux of what the convention is about.  It is about creating equity and in the world for us all not just for some of us.</p><p>With the right kind of supports, disability disappears.</p></speech>

It is good to point out the difference between care and professional support.  We talked about dementia and many other conditions where someone who knows and loves a person can offer the kind of support that people cannot be trained in.  It is unique and that is why we feel many people with disabilities who speak very well say that they do not want their family to be involved with their professional support.  That needs to be heard.  We also need to hear from the people who do not speak as well and what professional family support can do for them.</p></speech>

As I said, I am from a family of nine.  I was always taught to fight for the spuds and get out there.  I was told to go and do things and that I could not be treated differently.  That has stood to me in terms of my resilience.  My friends and family always slag me and say that if anything is wrong, James will write an email.  It is good that we do that because we, as individuals, need to ask questions and challenge things when something is wrong so that we can change that wrong into a right.</p> <p>  The real magic for me was when coming through university I saw the power of collective action.  That is where my activism moved from James Cawley being an activist into a collective.  I joined lots of campaigns in university.  I went on to be a teacher and empower young people, and saw how that can be done in a collective when we can educate people.  I was fortunate to join ILMI as a staff member and connect with a movement of disabled people right across Ireland to see how we can move action from the individual to a collective.  That is important.</p> <p>  There was a question about how the committee can help or progress this.  A D&aacute;il motion was passed in November 2019.  We would love to progress and explore a Private Members' Bill that we have worked on with Deputy Thomas Pringle and bring a debate to the committee.  I again thank the committee.</p> <p>  The personal question is great.  It is amazing how things have transitioned for me from the personal to the collective.  It is also amazing how collective action can start to break down barriers and change the medical model into a social and human rights model where we can all participate as equals.  I again thank the committee.</p></speech>

The big difference with having a disability is constantly asking for our rights, campaigning and so on.  It is tiring to have to go back and take steps forward.  Moving from institutionalisation to living in my own house and having to manage a personal assistant service is not something I want to do.  I do not want more hours than I need.  I like time to myself as well.<br/><br/>It is the pure exhaustion of asking for simple human rights that tires out people with disabilities.  It is not the disabilities themselves <i>per se</i>.  When we get on with trying to live an ordinary life, it is hugely tiring.  We can lose our service if we do not meet the right requirements.  Everything we do, including the basic things in life, are quite tiring for people with disabilities.  We have to deal with simple things like accessing transport, planning our day out before we get out of bed, planning our trip or event and where to go for education in terms of whether it will be accessible.  That is the main overview of the situation.  We have to do it.  We do not give in, but is hugely tiring for an individual on top of trying to live an ordinary life.</p></speech>

On behalf of the ETBI and the 16 education and training boards that the ETBI represents I am very pleased to make this statement to the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the topic of reopening further and higher institutions in a safe, sustainable manner.</p> <p>  The ETB sector is the leading provider of educational training services nationally, and with a budget of &euro;2.2 billion and 32,000 staff, is a key actor responding strategically to emerging trends and needs, both nationally and on the international stage.  As a responsive sector, ETBs deliver further education and training to more than 220,000 unique further education and training, FET, learners annually in more than 200 FET colleges, training centres, youth education and training centres.</p> <p>  The pandemic has challenged us all and from the very outset ETBI contributed to the tertiary education system steering committee and the various working groups that have been navigating the challenges of the pandemic over the last 15 months.  In August 2020 the FET stakeholder group was established with a view to ongoing collaboration and consistency in relation to navigating the various challenges posed by the pandemic.</p> <p>  Further education and training is multi-faceted in terms of provision.  When ring-fencing provision, attention was focused on adult and community education, Youthreach and apprenticeships.  Remote learning was targeted for PLC, VTOS, evening training courses, and contracted training.</p> <p>  Over the course of the last 15 months we have been navigating various challenges.  In August 2020 we planned for full on-site return but unfortunately the pandemic intervened.  There have been challenges along the way, particularly in lockdown in October 2020, and full lockdown again in January 2021.  Online remote provision continued for the months of January and February of this year.</p> <p>  The full benefit of the stakeholder engagement across all union parties, SOLAS and the Department of Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science really came to the forefront in March when we looked at commencement of phased return for apprenticeships, vulnerable learners at levels 1 and 2, and leaving certificate applied students in our Youthreach centres.  With safe returning being progressed, extended provision was arranged for more further education and training learners to return with the reopening of community education and literacy programmes in April.  Attention was also given to the school of music learners, and in May additional accommodation was provided for work placements and workplace learning programmes.</p> <p>  We are contributing at various levels to the work of the tertiary education system in the safe return plan for the coming September and will be guided by the need to maximise on-site provision for teaching and learning, supporting ongoing public health requirements, and supporting the ongoing needs of learners through the various stages of the pandemic.</p> <p>  ETBI core principles are centred foremost on positioning the FET sector for future innovation, as a key contributor to developing appropriate teaching and learning policies.  The function of ETBI is rooted in the Government's vision to make Ireland one of the leading providers of lifelong learning and long-term strategic national plans to maintain a sustainable economy.  ETBI places learners at the heart of educational development.  We realise the necessity for a full-site on return provision for the coming September.</p> <p>  On behalf of ETBI I welcome the opportunity to present to the joint committee on the reopening of our centres in a safe and sustainable manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#A00600"><p>On behalf of the Irish Universities Association I thank the committee for the opportunity to participate in this important discussion on the safe and sustainable reopening of further and higher education this autumn.  We particularly appreciate the reference in the session title to both the safe and sustainable return to our campuses, which are both critical considerations in this regard.  Our preference is to refer to a return to campus rather than to a reopening.</p><p>Our universities remained open throughout the pandemic, with significant contributions to research, public health and the continuity of engagement with our students, albeit that much, though not all, activity has to be carried out remotely.  Despite these challenges, our eight universities will have successfully graduated more than 100,000 students between this year and last, including the latest cohort of our doctors, nurses, teachers and other front-line staff.  </p><p> We welcome the recent publication by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, of the plan for the safe return to a normal working operation for staff and students this autumn.  I will focus my comments in particular on the main issues and challenges for our universities on behalf of the Irish Universities Association.</p><p> Our priority focus is on the health and well-being of our students and staff.  All of our plans are predicated on the public health environment and on adhering to public health guidelines and to providing the best possible student experience.</p><p> Further and higher education are an essential sector for students and learners and for the country.  It has been designated as essential by public policy and by public health.  Research is also an essential activity intrinsic to higher education and, as we have seen through the pandemic more than ever, for society itself.</p><p> The plan set out by the Minister sets out the expectation that the majority of the adult population, including third level students, will have been vaccinated by September.  This is critical and its achievement lays the foundation for our return to campus plans.  We share the desire of our students, staff and Government to safely reinstate face to face teaching and research activities on our campuses.  Noting in particular that the provision of larger scale lectures is achievable only in a very different public health environment, it is hoped that, contingent on the benefit of mass vaccination, this environment will be achievable in autumn 2021.</p><p> Each of our universities is finalising its detailed plans for the autumn for the resumption of on-campus teaching and learning.  This preparatory work includes substantial modification of campus layout and facilities management, entry and egress protocols to buildings, sanitisation and cleaning regimes and adjustments to ventilation systems.  Readjusting timetables in our universities with campus populations of between 15,000 to 30,000 covering hundreds of courses and thousands of modules is a complex process.  In doing so, universities will have a reserve plan in place in the event that greater levels of restrictions are required by public health guidelines than those currently anticipated.</p><p> We are working together and with other stakeholders, notably our students and our staff, to review and learn from our digital experience over the last 16 months, and to ensure that the positive aspects of this can be embedded into the ways we teach, learn, conduct research and organise our institutions.  Universities have been willing partners in the Government response to Covid-19.  We have made our facilities available for contact tracing and for vaccinations; we have seconded key personnel to support the health service; and we have partnered in Covid-19 research and test facilities, and some of these are located in some of our on-campus labs.  We have given more details of these to the committee.  </p><p> Four of our universities, Trinity College, Dublin, UCD, UCC and, my own, NUI Galway are involved in pilot research projects to assess various approaches to on-campus rapid antigen testing.  While it will be some weeks yet before results from these pilot programmes emerge, it is hoped that they will provide useful evidence as to the role that rapid antigen testing could play in the safe return to campus.  </p><p> The IUA has worked with the HEA and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to seek to secure an additional Covid-19 funding package for the sector similar to that provided very generously, and we are very grateful for that, in July 2020.  This includes additional supports for students, especially vulnerable students who may require supports for digital access or welfare and mental well-being supports.  The capacity of universities to deal with the additional demands arising from Covid-19 needs the investment supported through a further such funding package.</p><p> The pandemic has led to significant backlogs in research projects across our universities.  The HEA Covid-19 cost extension fund of 2020 is being used extensively to support researchers as many need more time to complete their research.  Again, we are very grateful for this generous support.  Further funding will be required to address the growing backlog in this regard.  Plans are also under way for the gradual return to increased research capacity over the summer months.  We look forward to welcoming our students back to campus and to Government investment to support us in this regard.  </p><p> The safe arrival of our international students is a priority for the sector and for society more generally.  Our universities are working with other sector partners and with the Department to agree an updated protocol and put in place the necessary arrangements for the safe welcome of international students.  Government decisions on international travel and the roll-out of the EU digital pass are crucial enabling measures for this.  In addition, we are liaising with Government to support us, as last year, in funding the costs arising in this regard and to resolve a number of visa processing issues from and to certain countries.</p><p> We have seen a dramatic increase in applications from Irish students to participate in the Erasmus programme.  This includes a backlog of students who were unable to travel abroad to study last year.  Our sense is that there are insufficient funds in the HEA Erasmus budget to cover this expanded demand.</p><p> Seven of the eight member universities of the IUA have university-owned campus accommodation with a total of approximately 15,000 beds available.  In the last year, our universities saw a sharp reduction in the income from these facilities and all universities provided refunds to students who had booked on-campus accommodation last autumn, but were then forced to study from home due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p> Our students, staff and the universities themselves have shown great flexibility and adaptability to the challenges of Covid-19 over the last 16 months.  In particular, I commend our colleagues and our students on the adaptability and resilience now being stretched by and into another academic year.  We are now looking forward to a safe and sustainable return - those words we used at the beginning, in the title of this session - to campus that will enable a more fulsome student learning experience, a resumption of the full range of our research work and the first phase of the restoration of the academic, social and cultural aspects of campus life.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.764" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#B00200"><p>Covid is democratic in its reach.  The experience for learners and their families and for our staff has been taxing over the past 16 months.  Most learners have had little true student experience over two academic years.  It says much for fortitude and the willingness to work collaboratively and with admirable flexibility that we have successfully completed another year.</p> <p>  I record appreciation to the Department of Education which in March 2020 established a Covid-19 structure to manage and progress work that has begun to take place across tertiary education.  This structure has been modified under the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and continues to oversee challenges and solutions at national level to complement the work taking place in the institutions.  The key to the success has been inclusivity as it comprehends the Department, its relevant agencies, representative associations, social partners, and the student voice.  Arising from this, the technological sector moved earlier this year to establish the partnership of stakeholders in the technological sector, POSITS, forum and that has proved efficacious in supporting the successful conclusion to the current academic year through inclusive social dialogue and it is now focused on the implementation of the plan for safe return.</p> <p>  I pay tribute to the cohesive approach that has served well at a most challenging time.  In essence, we negotiated the period through the dedication and innovation of the staff concerned.  We have witnessed an admirable volume of quiet, caring, and innovative work that has been essential to ensuring that so many students remained connected to their institutions and programmes.</p> <p>  If Covid-19 is indeed democratic in its reach, we know that it can impact unevenly.  Considerable attention has focused on vulnerable students, and it has resulted in significant additional supports but these cannot ameliorate the complete brunt of the pandemic.</p> <p>  I am struck by how our practitioners are requesting THEA to bring to wider awareness their sense that while many students have resilience in the moment to weather immediate pressure, the professional anticipation is that the fuller financial and mental health impacts of this pandemic will not become evident until the coming years.  For that reason, the unanimous ask from front-line colleagues tasked with the care of students is that the current welcome supports be extended over the coming two years.</p> <p>  The prime commitment is to keep our communities safe.  To that end we adhere unfailingly to prevailing public health advice.  The development of the plan has seen a detailed and inclusive process.  We fully support and take joint ownership of the plan and will seek to implement it with input from all partners.  The plan itself rests on key principles, including the Government&rsquo;s stated ambition of 29 April, to realise a significant increase in on-site activity.  That education is deemed essential has been mentioned.  Finally, the plan secured the endorsement of the Chief Medical Officer, and this is adjudged key to building confidence.</p> <p>  The challenge was always in formulating a plan for implementation three months ahead during a dynamic pandemic.  This required cross-Government support for preparing in a manner where institutions are necessarily required, for the very purpose of planning, to anticipate a world beyond current public health advice.  Effectively, this involved agreeing an assumption-base founded on the predicted course of the virus, including variations, and with especial cognisance of the vaccine roll-out and the suite of mitigations that will be available.</p> <p>  Under the discretionary framework, institutions are engaging in their own risk assessment exercises which will inform the balance between on-site and remote approaches but with the over-riding commitment to achieve maximum in-person activity.</p><p>We will retain the learnings from the experience to date, including the power of technology, and some element of a blended approach is predictable as we carefully phase the return to campus.  </p><p> On enablers, the Minister has acknowledged these plans will require resourcing support and has committed to same.  In return, we acknowledge the considerable support that was provided last year and which effectively ensured the maintenance of the system.</p><p> Antigen testing remains a contested space.  Focused rapid testing in higher education was a recommendation from the Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group.  The Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, strongly welcomes advance on this as it is perceived within the confines of the academy as an additional weapon for the protection of our communities.  The success of the vaccine roll-out and recent changes offering single-dose option for the younger cohort are significant advances.</p><p> Attention to ventilation is one aspect within the suite of mitigation measures.  Variations of concern may be a continuing factor and, thus, ventilation must command increasing attention.</p><p> The international student market, which was referenced, has been severely impacted by the pandemic.  Some good collective work is under way currently but there is the danger Ireland may find itself outpaced by competitor countries which have moved more nimbly to agree protocols for safe inward travel.</p><p> I thank the Chair and members for this opportunity.  We have been offered an opportunity to shape this plan and unambiguously support the determination to realise a comprehensive return to campus for the coming academic year.  The plan is under constant review and prioritises public health and safety, and we are ever mindful of the proven power and adaptability of this virus.  Our purpose is to work cohesively and in full partnership with all stakeholders, and especially students and staff, to build the confidence that together we can deliver a safe and holistic experience for our communities of learners and researchers.

Each of our guests and all their organisations and colleges across the country will play an important part in bringing our students back safely to campus in September.  I know they will do that in collaboration with the Minister and other Departments.</p> <p>  I call Senator Dolan, who will have six minutes, and she will be followed by Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin.   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#C00300"><p>I welcome all our contributors.  We are here today to discuss, as Dr. Ryan mentioned, a return to campus.  Very many of our colleges and universities kept going all through the pandemic.  We know that a return to campus is about having students&rsquo; best interests at heart.  It is about students having the most wonderful student experience, especially for those who have been extremely disheartened during the past year or two years.  Our students are resilient.  That strength has come through our primary and secondary school educational structure and that will continue as they enter college.</p> <p>  I have a few questions.  Many interesting topics have been raised.  Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh, go raibh m&iacute;le agaibh.  It is great to see you here today.  The UniCov project on antigen testing has kicked off and it has been running since 14 June.  It is being led by Professor Breda Smyth.  It is a link between the colleges and public health.  Can Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh give us a taster of how it is going?  Will he give us an update on it?  It is a comparative study in its initial stages.  He might advise on the different groups that are working together and the researchers involved.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I want to thank, as the Chairman has done, the thousands of staff and students who will be involved in this testing across four of the universities  They are doing this to ensure we can build and have an evidence base that will stand alongside PCR testing, but we can only make decisions based on evidence.  Research has been crucial in developing the vaccines.  They are all based on research.  Researchers are crucial to dealing with this pandemic.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Kearney for his contribution on the education and training boards.  I am a pure advocate of them.  The statistics he mentioned, that there are 200 centres, are amazing.  Those centres are to be found in every town and village across Ireland.  No matter where one is based in whatever county, there is a college of further education with which one can engage and continue to do further education and training, FET, courses.  It is great that 32,000 staff and more than 220,000 FET learners have been back on track for the past few months.  </p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. Kearney about the apprenticeships, in particular.  We are promoting that programme in terms of earning and learning.  There will be a high number of school leavers and career changers at any point in their lives who may want to engage in this programme, particularly now when there is a changing of roles.  Can he give an update on that programme?  There are 60 courses available and it is anticipated another 18 will be provided.  How has the apprenticeship programme been running across the education and training boards?</p> <p>  Dr. Ryan also contributed when he appeared before this committee earlier this week on Tuesday.  We are getting to meet twice this week.  I was delighted to see an opening date for Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, and a brand new TUS, Technological University of Shannon: Midlands Midwest.  It is wonderful news that it will be opening in October.  Dr. Ryan mentioned our facilities and infrastructure have provided us with the vaccination centres.  I went to the AIT international arena to get my vaccine and it was very well co-ordinated.  The universities and staff in the colleges are working with the HSE's public health staff, community healthcare, the Army, Civil Defence and stewards.  It was incredible to see all these groups working together.  </p> <p>  Dr. Ryan mentioned the welcome supports for students.  Will he expand on that?  We have spoken briefly on funding.  I am mindful of international students on an Erasmus programme.  As a former Erasmus student, I would be very supportive of that programme.  Will he comment briefly on that?  Budgets are tight and this year and funding will be difficult, but we are here to support the colleges in whatever way we can, particularly the international students sector.  I appreciate that will be dependent on the roll-out of the  Covid passport. </p></speech>

Go raibh maith agat, Seanad&oacute;ir Dolan. On the question on antigen testing, as the Senator said, it is being led by Professor Breda Symth.  Her role in HSE West was particularly helpful in the context of our work in this regard.  We were very grateful to her.  She is leading this project with others across four institutions, including ours, on antigen testing.  I understand a further announcement will be made this week in that regard, which I do not want to pre-empt.</p> <p>  A Government structure has been put in place and Professor Symth is chairing it.  Technology, including app and website technology, has been developed.  Clinical end to end pathways have been developed in each of the institutions, namely Trinity, University College Cork, UCC, University College Dublin, UCD, and ourselves at National University of Ireland,  NUI, Galway.  The recruitment to testing is commencing this week.  It is anticipated there will be an announcement as to how that might progress.  Four institutions are involved with different pathways in each involving testing across different platforms and technology.  As was mentioned, the antigen testing is a contested space.  At all times we would be both informed by this research - as universities, it is our role to be evidence-based - and by public health advice about how effective it is and how we should implement it in the context of a return to campus in the autumn.  A further announcement will be made this week.  Those four institutions are involved with Professor Symth and Professor Charlie Spillane from Galway.  I look forward to working with them further in that context.</p></speech>

The greatest challenge with the pandemic, and there are many in terms of the delivery of FET services, were the delivery of apprenticeships because of their focus on the practical dimension, but the benefit of the stakeholder group came through with our close working relationships with SOLAS, the union representatives and Department officials.  That paved the pathway of a facilitative return for apprenticeship delivery as quickly as possible, with 251 apprentices returning on 1 March, 320 apprentices returning in the next phase and that was escalated to 589 in the second week of April. Currently, there is another plan of increased activity incorporating a return of 720 apprentices.  SOLAS has been forward thinking in countering a significant backlog of apprenticeship placements with respect to providing for the three highest categories of apprenticeship delivery, namely, electrical, plumbing and carpentry in January, and it has put in place technical groups.</p><p>They will look at an emergency approach.  The normal extended phase 2 delivery is for 22 weeks.  We are looking for a condensed, blended approach that will cut back the number of weeks required out of work in terms of the delivery of the phase 2 model.  As we speak, technical groups are established with six to seven members throughout the FET sector itself, including FET directors, training centre managers and authorised officers and they are concluding a highly ambitious plan to be put in place, hopefully for September, with a view to countering over 4,500 significant components of the backlog with a view to targeted apprenticeship delivery.</p></speech>

The committee should note there is a parallel HSE antigen testing pilot taking place in the technological sector.  I fully agree with the Senator that an evidence base is critical.</p> <p>  On apprenticeships, I note Mr. Kearney's point that there is a crisis in apprenticeships at the moment and there is a national mobilisation around this.  We are convening a meeting tomorrow.  We will be working right across higher education as apprenticeships go right up the framework to level 10.  Equally, we will be working with Mr. Kearney on a cross-sectoral piece as well.</p> <p>  On vaccination, my wife and I had the same experience as Senator Dolan.  We went to AIT.  I know it has a sports arena, which also functions as a location for graduations, but having seen it, the logistics and the wonderful organisation are a credit to everyone involved.</p> <p>  In terms of supporting the student voice, all of our professionals have engaged with students.  The student voice has been very strong on the national steering group that I referenced in the presentation, but there has been so much that we have had to look at such as Wi-Fi, access to devices, counselling and how all of that is done.  We are working in a very holistic way.  When students come back it is not just about the learning element of it, it is the broader experience.  We are working, for instance, with Sport Ireland, to see the activities that students can get involved in.</p> <p>  Finally, on the international question, we are looking at flexibility around the use of moneys - Erasmus moneys, cross-Border moneys etc. &ndash; because there are a number of dynamics going on to try to support international student mobility, meet and greet etc., which was very carefully looked after last year.  I will not delay you on this, Chair, but there is a lot going on in that space.</p></speech>

Senator Dolan has covered a lot of the questions.  Mr. Kearney and Dr. Ryan might look at the issue of apprenticeships, in particular in certain areas critical to housing.  We rely very much on the throughput.  There are concerns that apprentice electricians have not been able to get practical experience.  When do the witnesses expect things to fully return to normal?  It would have been difficult for those who had been pursuing apprenticeships last year.  Could we get an idea of when we might see a normal throughput on the apprenticeship side?  I accept that all depends on how we predict the pattern and journey of the virus.  I realise last year was a difficult year.</p> <p>  I wish to follow up on Dr. Ryan's point about the support services for students on campus including the clubs, the societies, the students union and the support services.  It is about getting those back up and running.  While some of them have been innovative in what they have been able to do over the past year, it is not the same when one does not have on-campus activity.  What structures are in place to ensure that will be in place?</p> <p>  The third issue is something the witnesses might examine.  I know there has been a lot of innovation but to be honest, I would have hated to have been a first year for the past year.  Those students have had a really tough year, after the difficulties they had coming up to the leaving certificate and then not being able to be on campus for their first year.  That is going to present additional challenges when they come on to the campus.  They will nearly be getting freshers' day at the start of second year.  Some of those issues and problems that Dr. Ryan mentioned will only start to manifest themselves on campus.</p> <p>  I also wonder whether any measurement has been done on the learning outcomes or progression rates from last year's first-year cohort.  They would have gone through some form of assessment at the end of first year.  They have had a very unlucky and disruptive period and they will need support.  Have there been any measurements in terms of what impact the last year has had on them?</p></speech>

On the question of apprenticeship, the Covid impact is exacerbating a backlog that was already there.  As Senator Byrne knows, in apprenticeships we move through the phases and there is that mixture of theory and practice.  It is the practice bit that has been very difficult.  We have had to re-order theory and practice.  The reason I mentioned the meeting tomorrow is that we are trying to take a holistic approach to see what we can do in a very focused way to address that backlog.</p> <p>  On the question of clubs and societies mentioned by Senator Byrne, the critical bit is around the student experience, so a lot of attention is being given to try to fuel that and to build it back up.  I did mention the uneven impact of the pandemic.  Some students have been in college while others, just by the nature of the domain that they are in, that is, in large-scale pieces like business or social care, are the ones that have been most disadvantaged.  If a student is on a three-year programme, he or she will have seen very little of the institution in the past while.  People are very conscious of addressing that.  It also brings us into areas like re-orientation and additional orientation, not just for those coming in into first year but for those going into second year.  They are being addressed at the moment.</p> <p>  Finally, on learning outcomes and progression rates, a lot of work is being done on this by the chief academic officers.  We are delighted to note that progression rates are very good.  There are learnings from Covid, and I will not delay the meeting on that, but it is something that we are tracking.</p></speech>

First, in the context of the student experience, clubs and societies are crucial for that.  Supporting students in their autonomy in doing that is particularly important.  We found this year even in the second semester there was a sense that there was more activity among students clubs and societies, albeit online, than we anticipated.  We would like to support that.  There are new societies which emerged in that context.  We did a student question-and-answer exercise in February and one of the excellent suggestions was exactly the same as Senator Byrne's, which is that for second year students next year, we need an orientation.  On the back of that suggestion we are thinking that we would have a re-orientation or induction for second years as well as first years.  Looking at the particular needs of students, focusing always on the student need and learning from what the student has told us they need is particularly important.</p> <p>  It is a very different context in both learning and assessment, but we have noticed better progression rates this year than last year and better retention.  They are not comparable like with like; they are much more complex but, thankfully, we have noticed better retention this year than in previous years.</p></speech>

Where does Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh think the State may be able to step in to support that?</p></speech>

It was a particularly challenging context in supporting students where there was laboratory work and field work.  That is where additional supports would be helpful, but also in the context of student support more generally, supporting vulnerable students in technology and well-being.  In particular, I am keen on targeted supports for the students most in need, rather than across the board, whether that is because of technology or different approaches to learning and supporting different needs in that context.</p><p>We have found that it is not universal.  We in NUI Galway developed a universal design for learning programme that is aimed at expanding learning with technology, but also with other platforms or supports, to make it more accessible to a broader set of students.  That project is worthy of support, not only in NUI Galway but across the sector.  A universal design for learning is particularly useful as a concept in supporting student learning more generally.</p></speech>

I wish to briefly acknowledge the work we have done, in very close co-operation with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, on bringing together various approaches with the professional bodies to try to address that.</p></speech>

As such, the focus is very much on delivery of the three focal apprenticeships, that is, electrical, plumbing and carpentry, with a view to decompressing the backlog and responding adequately to the emergency needs.  I am very confident that in the next academic year we will get back on track in the context of the backlog, which will also involve our third level colleagues in terms of the delivery of apprenticeships.</p></speech>

We are backing up into September.  I am concerned that everything will happen in September.  A total of &euro;1.2 million was granted and a target of 8,000 students was earmarked.  Will that target of 8,000 students be met by September?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that we are up against time in that context.  I understand an announcement is to be made in the coming weeks regarding the recruitment process.  All the elements are in place to allow the research across the four institutions but I do not have an up-to-date figure in terms of the numbers.  The Deputy is correct that it is challenging in terms of time to get those numbers and the results through before September.</p></speech>

The figure of 8,000 was not plucked from the air; there is a reason it was selected in terms of the integrity of what is being proposed.</p></speech>

That has been taken into consideration.  I appreciate entirely the challenge of the time constraints in that context.  I have asked for an update from Dr. Breda Smyth, who will be joining our management team next week in order to give us an update in that context, although I understand there will be an announcement in the next week or so on progress in that regard.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, stated today that a funding package to support sustainable reopening will be made available.  It will be announced on 19 July, which is a key date for many people across the State.

What I am trying to get at is that if the money has not been spent this year, will it be rolled over?  Can we be guaranteed that the money that will be announced on 19 July will be new money rather than money that has been sent back or not spent?</p></speech>

I do not have the detail of how it works in the budget or whether it is new money or old money, but we believe new money is needed to the scale we anticipated.</p></speech>

I do not have a number in that regard for the whole sector.  We could revert to the Deputy with the detail in that regard.  There has been significant expenditure of capital funding in NUI Galway around simulation spaces, which relate to clinical spaces or HSE spaces.  We added new spaces in medicine in NUI Galway last year, which is particularly welcome in the context of the pressure in that regard.</p></speech>

I am really concerned on this issue.  I am concerned because the waiting list was 6,928 at the beginning of the year but in May it was 9,071.  The Minister told me today that the current waiting list is in excess of 10,000.  Our guests have indicated that 4,500 will be addressed in the famous month of September or in the autumn.  That would still leave a deficit of 6,500 if things stand still.  The numbers are not adding up for me.  I know the challenges that exist in this context.  I ask the witnesses to speak to the numbers.  If the target for September is 4,500, where does that leave the 6,500 who will still be waiting for on-the-job training?</p></speech>

That is why I referred to a figure of 6,000.  That possibly relates to the situation a week ago.

I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for the question.  On the numbers coming in, as of today we are working on the basis of the current public health advice.  We are anticipating a considerable increase in September.  It will depend on the domains and so on but we are talking about a commitment to a significant increase.  As I have said, that will depend on domains.  While I have the floor, I will mention the question of apprenticeships.  If we go on as we are going today, we will be in very serious trouble.  That is why I talk about a national mobilisation.  Something has to change.  Some &euro;10 million has been granted for further education and another &euro;10 million for higher education.  It will involve the recruitment of new staff.  We are working with social partners on that.  We are looking at things like summer blocks and increased blocks.  We are also looking at different approaches to assessment and different pedagogical approaches.  Architectural change is required to address this.</p></speech>

It is good to see some of them for the second time this week.  It is also good to see Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh.  As I said earlier in the week, I was on the &uacute;dar&aacute;s myself, albeit briefly.  I will ask a couple of quite specific questions but first I will thank all of the staff in all of the institutions.  The last couple of years have been incredibly difficult.  As has quite rightly been said, this is not a reopening but a return to a safe environment.  The terminology used may in some way indicate that people have forgotten the great deal of work that has been going on in the background.  The realities of third level education have been quite invisible to a number of people who are not in touch with them.  We are concerned about the students, their experiences and their mental health.  I agree with an awful lot of what Senator Malcolm Byrne said earlier.  I am anxious to hear whether we have any indication as to the impact on those students not only in terms of their educational attainment but also in terms of drop-out rates because it was flagged early on, perhaps by Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh, that we may see fairly high drop-out rates.  Has that been the reality?</p> <p>  The other specific questions I wish to ask relate to ventilation.  This issue has been brought up by a couple of people.  It seems that the witnesses are saying that ventilation systems will have to be adjusted.  What does that mean?  What adjustments are being considered?  Staff are concerned because they need to feel safe in their working environment.  Are CO2 monitors being considered to ensure transparency for university staff and students?  I will ask the witnesses to answer those questions briefly before I come back in to ask another one or two.</p></speech>

Is maith an rud &eacute; &iacute; a fheice&aacute;il ar&iacute;s.  I thank her for her service on &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na hOllscoile, which was very valuable to us.  I completely endorse her comments on staff and colleagues.  When I stood in our drawing room in the quad and informed people, at short notice, that we were moving university activities online, I did not imagine that we would maintain academic activity online for a year and a half.  We were able to do so because colleagues quietly went about their business, supported students and put them to the forefront and supported research.  They were keen to come back to do research and to come back to teaching.  In either December or January, I had a sense that we could have done more in the second semester, if public health advice had allowed, because our colleagues wanted to do so.  That is a great endorsement of our colleagues.  I again put on record our thanks for that.<br/><br/>It is the same case for student support.  The Senator is right.  It may be because the context is different but we are finding that retention rates are slightly higher than they were last year, although that is based on raw data, as Senator Malcolm Byrne has mentioned.  That may not translate once we come back to campus.  How that will work out remains to be seen.  In that context, student support will be critical.  Much of the funding the Irish Universities Association has asked for through the Department relates to student support.  I have certainly been advocating for that and supporting our students' union in that regard.  I am talking about directed student support.  It is not for the university <i>per se</i>but for students.  I would certainly advocate for that.<br/><br/>Ventilation has emerged as a particularly important issue throughout the pandemic.  There are a couple of aspects to it.  One relates to the systems themselves, keeping them up-to-date and looking at international norms in that regard.  A second aspect relates to the capacity of rooms.  Not all large rooms will return to 100% capacity.  We will have slightly smaller capacities depending on the ability of the systems to extract air quickly enough.  We are also considering shorter lecture times.  Rather than the normal 50 minutes to an hour, we are likely to ask for 45-minute lectures to allow for exit and egress but also to allow some time to ventilate the room between lectures.  CO<sub>2</sub>monitors are an excellent idea.  We will look at that if we are not already doing so.  We are certainly very keen to have transparency as to how the system may work.  We have found that ventilation is a key aspect and it is something at which we are looking very carefully, particularly in the context of larger rooms.  We will have to make sure that rooms are properly ventilated and to be transparent about that but this may result in lower than normal capacity.  That is what we are looking at in the context of ventilation.</p></speech>

Is it the case that people will be able to choose or will they have to have medical certificates?  People differ in when they feel vulnerable.  This can also be associated with their mental health at a particular time.  Will people be able to choose a hybrid model?  Will a model such as the hybrid-flexible, HyFlex, model be available throughout next year?  I also wish to come in briefly on apprenticeships.</p></speech>

I advocate for kindness and flexibility.  I am of the view that the learner should be allowed to find his or her own way through.  We have found that many students want to be back on campus.  Some will desire that and some will not.  We need to accommodate those.  We will find ways to provide material for those groups, as we did last year.  The issue of access is slightly more challenging where labs or fieldwork are involved.  However, more generally, we will support students to find their best way through their own learning.  In that context, flexibility and kindness will be important.</p></speech>

It is important and I appreciate it.  With regard to apprenticeships, quite apart from the backlog, a new model is clearly needed.  How many more places are required, apart from what is required to deal with the backlog?  We are hearing from Green Party Ministers that there is an increasing need for ecologists and those with expertise in biodiversity.  That is simply not coming out at the moment.  That is not anyone's fault, but it is a fact.  We hear about the building profession all the time but green training is also required for the revolution that is needed with regard to the green economy.  Now that people are out of jobs in one sector, the focus of the economy will have to shift.  Do the witnesses have any brief comments not only on the backlog, but about how we are managing the area of apprenticeships in general and what the pandemic has taught us?</p></speech>

Everyone at the meeting agrees that it should be a top priority to get students back on campus from next September.  We have heard terribly disappointing stories about the college experience that students have had since the pandemic arrived in February 2020.  Many parents are concerned about the fact that their children's experience of student life has been limited to being on laptops in their bedrooms, not getting out to experience college life and missing out on massive parts of the social and intellectual development that comes with college on-campus life.  That is a comment, not a question.  I know it has been mentioned previously, but how confident are our guests that we are going to see students back on campus in September?  To what extent do they believe it is important that we avail of antigen testing for the purpose of ensuring that this occurs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.819" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#G00600"><p>I fully agree with the Deputy's first comments.  The disappointment of students with the experience was very keen.  The Deputy might recall that last December there was a determination to make sure that the second semester was better, but then we experienced Christmas.  This time, we go in with that lesson.  A great deal of cohesive work has gone into this preparation and the commitment is to increase the experience substantially for September.  Obviously, we are keeping a weather eye on what is a very intelligent virus.  We are watching for the variations of concern that I mentioned.  The antigen testing is seen to be a critical part of the armoury for this.  As I said, I note it was contested space, but within the academy one is talking about a confined area where one can build up intelligence on this, see how it works and record it within that closed community.  We see it as being very important.  The fact that the vaccine roll-out now being offered has been changed to offer a focused attention on the single-shot Janssen vaccine for the younger-age cohort is also seen as a critical part of this, because it is quite predictable that there will be a large movement of people roughly eight to ten weeks hence.</p></speech>

The plan is contingent on a different public health environment next year from what we had this year.  In that context, the vaccination roll-out is particularly critical for the college-attending age groups.  On antigen testing, we will be evidence based and take the public health advice to see whether that is also appropriate and to what extent, but I emphasise that the vaccination roll-out is increasingly important.  The news cycles make us more or less optimistic, depending on how things are going, and for me the vaccination roll-out is what makes me more or less optimistic about September.</p></speech>

Each of those facets, and the Government policy on ring-fencing those, was greatly appreciated in that in October there was a similar delivery last year.  Then they were successfully re-engineered again for on-site delivery from March onwards.  Based on that, the sector is very confident that it will be returning to that state of delivery in September as well.  The big unknown is whatever challenges the pandemic will throw at us over the next couple of weeks, but the sector was ready for reopening for post-leaving certificate, PLC, provision.  In line with what my two colleagues said, the antigen testing and the vaccine roll-out would instil confidence in us that we will be ready for very significant on-site delivery of PLC programmes in September.</p></speech>

I am very encouraged by them.  All of us are aware of the desire of students to get back on campus.  This may be unfair, but sometimes there is a perception that some of the academic staff might not share that desire to get back.  Our guests will correct me if I am wrong about that.  If there is a situation in September whereby vaccination appears to be effective and we are in a much better place, who will make the decision as to whether lectures proceed remotely or in person?  Is that a jurisdiction that rests with the individual lecturer or do the institutions have a say on whether that occurs?</p></speech>

It is a difficult question, but the sheer determination is to be back on-site.  There is a national steering committee which includes the social partners.  They are part of the construct around this.  All institutions have been very sensitive to vulnerable staff and vulnerable students.  As the president of NUIG said, they will take those cases on an individual basis.  However, the determination is to get back onto campus, and to do that through discussion with partners at local level.</p></speech>

Once there was leeway for on-site delivery, there was an openness, willingness and engagement by staff to be back on-site.  As was alluded to, whenever critical situations arose for vulnerable staff there was a degree of accommodation, but it was very much a full return being welcomed by staff as much as by the learners.</p></speech>

I have two Zooms and two committee meetings on at the same time, so I am finding it difficult.  I have been trying to listen to both.  However, I heard the opening presentations and I thank the three speakers.  I will ask my questions one at a time.  I followed what was said about the vaccination roll-out and the positive impact that, hopefully, antigen testing will have in the coming months.  In that regard, much of the contingency planning that all institutions will have made will be formulated on the basis of predicting where the virus is going.  Now, of course, we are getting information that cases are increasing.  The one thing we know is that there is nothing predictable about the virus and what is to come.  In that context, I have a quick question for all three speakers.  Bearing in mind that things are so unpredictable, are we best placed to prepare for the challenges that lie ahead in September?  The follow-up on that relates to online learning.  Is the role of online learning, and is the case for it, strengthened post pandemic?  Is it something that will become a wider feature of third level and further education?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#G01500"><p>I will take that first.  Ours are learning institutions so we need to learn from what happened last summer.  I will make two or three comments in that context.  One is that it is a very uncertain context, so it is extremely difficult to plan ahead and predict.  The second point is that if we do it together, the sectoral piece is particularly critical.  The Department's plan, which is cross-sectoral, is very valuable.  Where we step together, that working together in order to work through the process is particularly important.  The third point relates to planning as early as we can.</p><p>Last year, it was particularly problematic that we marched up a hill and marched down again very quickly.  That was necessary because of the changes to the virus but it would be better if we planned earlier.  That is why the mid-July timeline is important because it will allow us to see further ahead.  As we know, the pandemic has made life uncertain for all of us.  It is particularly difficult to plan in that context.  Planning together and ahead of time as much as possible is important.  The roll-out of the vaccination programme is important in that regard.</p><p> My view has always been that online learning is a supplement to, not a replacement for, the on-campus experience.  This year has brought that point to the fore.  Even when online learning is available, students and staff want to be on campus.  We have learned a lot in short order and with agility about access to technology and its use from our experiences of this year.  We have also learned that online learning will not replace the on-campus experience which students and staff wanted this year.  We have learned a lot and will bring many good things forward with us but, at the same time, we know that online learning is not a replacement for university life as students and staff want it to be.</p></speech>

One of the things those students asked for was the retention of that online piece as a supplemental or support piece.  That was particularly interesting.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we have learned through the past year.  We have learned an awful lot and I fully agree with what has been said by Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh.  Much of that has been down to working cohesively with the Department, its agencies, the unions and with the students' voices at the heart of things.  Much credit must be given to staff for their innovation.  We were bounced into online learning.  We have made considerable advances through the year by happenstance or necessity.  Online learning will be a part of our world in the future.</p></speech>

All of our preference is that we would have a significant on-site presence but whatever challenges will come our way, we can look back with confidence at what we have dealt with successfully over the past 16 months.  In that regard, I would, in line with previous speakers, point to our ongoing collaboration with the Departments responsible for education, SOLAS and the union stakeholders.  Challenges came at us quickly, including the lockdown in October last year and the revised lockdown in January.  FET services have continued to reopen since the middle of March.  Changes were necessary as the situation evolved and we were successful and competent in our stakeholder engagement.  That gave us the confidence to take on whatever challenges came thereafter.  Notwithstanding the fact that we would prefer to be on site, we are confident we will be able to deal with whatever comes at us over the next couple of weeks and months, however difficult and challenging.</p></speech>

What is the outlook for apprenticeships in terms of targets set by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins?</p> <p>  I will ask the following question of the representatives of third level education.  What has been the impact of the pandemic on the numbers of international students in their institutions?  What impact has the pandemic had on the financial side of things on their institutions?  Perhaps the witnesses could offer a brief comment on those matters.</p></speech>

There is a housing crisis.  The first priority is to address the considerable backlog in existence.  Ambitious plans are being put in place.  The sector is committed to addressing those backlogs and once they have been dealt with successfully, we can get back on track and national targets will be set by the Minister and the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Much good work is going on to try to hold onto that market but the truth is that the pandemic has had a huge impact.  We will not know the measure of that impact until we see how these particular pieces work.  We know that competitor Anglophone countries are working ahead of us.  The message from Ireland is that we have managed this pandemic very carefully and cautiously.  We are open within the country but there is sometimes an inconsistency between that openness within the country and the barriers to getting students into the country.  To give a practical example, vaccinations that are given in other countries but that are not recognised by the European Medicines Agency are not recognised here either.  That is difficult for intending students to understand.  We are still tying to work through some of those final pieces.</p></speech>

The positivity in their opening statements was palpable.  Many of the questions I had for them have already been asked.  I am glad that the discussion has touched on antigen testing, international travel, the roll-out of the vaccine and other matters.  Those issues are incredibly important in terms of a sustainable and safe return to third level education.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly about ventilation, CO2 monitors, allocation of space etc.  What guidance and support have the witnesses been given by the Department of Higher and Further Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other Departments in that regard?  It is of critical importance that students feel safe in the environment to which they are being brought this September.  I glanced across a student survey recently and noted the desire to retain the online piece was strong.  That was particularly true for vulnerable students, lecturers and staff.  The ability of those staff and students to participate in remote lessons while others are present in a lecture theatre is incredibly important.  Dr. Ryan might give me a brief comment on that matter.</p></speech>

I have referenced the national steering group that is sitting.  Mr. Kearney also sits on that steering group.  It has gone through phases of concentration.  There was a phase when there was a real concentration on physical distancing.  We have been arguing for some time that the concentration now needs to move towards ventilation.  We have seen what has happened in respect of the monitors at second level.  The Deputy is right that this is a critical issue.  Many of the questions at the moment refer to large lectures.  The arrangements for large lectures are context-specific and depend on how big the halls are and the numbers of people involved.  The truth is that air throughput is going to become critical as we move into autumn and changes to physical infrastructure are going to be needed in certain cases.  What advice has been given?  The simple truth is we are waiting for more advice in that regard.  We would welcome such advice.</p></speech>

Our colleagues are looking at international norms in the context of ventilation.  The announcement of new guidelines on 19 July will be critical in the context of giving us good guidance.  There is a sectoral approach to those concerns that look at international norms.  We hope more public health clarity will be provided on 19 July.</p></speech>

It is also about the things that happen after 5 p.m.  We had instances last year of campus parties and issues like that.  We have seen the early vaccine roll-out for the over-18s in recent days and I am sure that will be ramped up.  There must be recognition that by the time we get to September, the vast majority of people will be vaccinated but at the same time, there most likely still will be concerns about congregations.  Specifically on campus, what contingency plans or procedures have our guests put in place to try to limit large gatherings and mitigate their effects, or do they have such plans?</p></speech>

We will need to be very conscious that in bringing students together again there are obviously opportunities and a tendency to congregate.  It is something we will have to monitor carefully, certainly in our residences.  We work very closely with HSE West on that and on rapid testing where it is needed, and student responsibility in that regard.  The Deputy is right that it is a cause for concern for us all, I think, and in the context of the role our students play in society more generally.  We will consider the public health advice very carefully and very cautiously.  I am very concerned about this, as I have been all year, and I share that concern with the Deputy.</p></speech>

We would love to have that problem.  The truth is that the Minister and all others involved in this have been very careful not to get into a blame game.  These are young people and they have been deprived of so much.  They are going to congregate.  We will give advice.  We work very closely with the students' unions to try to do that in a managed way.  The phasing Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh mentioned is a key piece of the planning but, obviously, there is only so much we can control, in truth.</p></speech>

The issues relating to international students have been touched on.  I appreciate entirely that that is dependent on Government announcements.  Dr. Ryan, I think, has said Anglophone countries are ahead of us.  Can he help the committee understand how we can improve that position?  Is it entirely down to Covid restrictions on international travel or are there other measures he would suggest we take to try to support a return of our international students?  They are of critical importance, of course, not just to the sector but also to research and in moving on to highly skilled jobs that are in demand in this State.</p></speech>

Ireland was very good on this initially.  Ireland cared for its international students very well.  Where we did not do quite as well was in not doing the early planning for this last year as quickly as we could.  There was very cohesive work but it happened quite late, and that left us behind in the market.  To some extent the same sort of thing is happening this year.  There will be lessons to be learnt from this if we go through something similar in future years, and it is to be hoped we will not.  It is not that there is any element missing; it is just that getting that cohesion as early as possible is the critical element.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.850" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#J01000"><p>There are two things.  First, there is a meet-and-greet element, which is important.  Second, we really need to be conscious of international travel.  We cannot bypass those public health requirements because, first, for society at large, that is a very important issue and, second, this is a very important support for our students.  We do not by any means wish to bypass any of the requirements and we support all public health requirements in that regard, but in that context I think we could do more to support international students, first, as Dr. Ryan said, to plan ahead and, second, when they arrive, in how we might accommodate them in their isolation, quarantine and so on.  We hope that in the Department's support package there will be support for those measures because, as Dr. Ryan said, they are important.  It is about the learning experience and the talent.  We should be open to all talent internationally and provide that opportunity.  There are those two aspects: planning ahead and then working with students when they arrive while remaining conscious all the time of the public health advice and the fact that we need to work within those constraints.  We are very supportive of those.</p></speech>

Clearly, in the context of this matter, the sector will lean on the experience it has had over recent months, particularly, I would have thought, last October and in the new year.  Are there any particular aspects of that where the witnesses feel the sector has not been supported sufficiently?  Is there insufficient funding for the sector to put in place the supports for students to access material online or are the witnesses happy enough with the hearings they have received from the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.852" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#J01200"><p>The plan has a forward line, which is what you might call the optimistic line.  That is what we are aiming for.  It also has a fallback line.  I am no epidemiologist, but what I am hearing is that we are on the foothills of a fourth wave.  That fourth wave is coming, as people here have said, at the same time as a very successful vaccination programme and antigen testing.  We anticipate, even in the worst-case scenario, that we will be significantly in advance of where we were.</p> <p>  As for the supports, the collegiate work that has been done on this and the support from the Minister, the Department and the whole political establishment have been very impressive.  Obviously, we hope that that will continue and that when we come with informed advice as to where those supports need to be targeted, we will get the same hearing as we have been getting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.853" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#J01300"><p>That has been the experience to date during the 15 or 16 months of the pandemic.  Whatever challenges came at us and whatever targeted needs were identified, a very responsive plan was being put in place by the Department and SOLAS.  We have not been found wanting in terms of needs that have been identified, and I am confident that that will be the same moving forward, irrespective of what the pandemic throws at us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.854" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#J01400"><p>We have a Department that is listening and focused, and we welcome that.  We made a submission both as the IUA and collectively with the other organisations.  We would welcome that investment in student supports in particular.  It is a matter of financial assistance, well-being and access to technology, but there are many issues around financial assistance.  Clearly, the broader support mechanisms that are there are good in that context, but there are some particularly challenging measures.  I also urge that supports be extended to international students.  The tendency is to think of supports for EU students, whereas international students have particular needs as well, and if we are to maintain our reputation with that group as a sustainable location we need to look after that group.  However, we have a very supportive Department, and we welcome that and look forward to that investment continuing in the future.</p></speech>

I will finish as I started with the remark about the palpable positivity that is there, which is really welcome.  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

Dr. Ryan spoke about third level institutions being used as vaccine centres.  I would like to say "well done".  I got my two vaccines in Carlow and was delighted to do so.  In that context, I would be happy for Dr. Ryan to pass on my thanks to President Mulcahy because it was run very smoothly.  I know all the third level facilities that were used as vaccine centres.  It was greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh about antigen testing, the process and how he foresees it happening.  A student will have an antigen test.  There will be thousands of students coming into the campuses.  It will be very slow on, say, the first day.  How will that be managed over the following days?  Will a certain number of students come in each day?  How often will they have to take an antigen test?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.857" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#J01700"><p>Gosh.  That is anticipating what antigen testing might look like and stepping into a live debate on the matter.</p><p>The research is ongoing and we will follow the public health advice in that context.  Our experience with students is that when we ask them to engage in a testing process and to be tested with HSE West - returning to the original question of Deputy Alan Farrell around off-campus challenges -  they were very forthcoming.  My expectation is that students will engage with this process if asked and will welcome it as part of a broader mechanism.  The protocols around it, how it might work, and whether it will be implemented at all is really a question for the evidence base and for the public health advice.  The logistics of this are probably a bit further down the road than we are right now but my expectation is that it will work quite smoothly in the context of how students have worked with us so far in, for example, the testing regime.  We are stepping into a debate that is quite live and we will await the outcome of the research in the first instance and will then work through the logistics of it.</p><p> I also return to the point that I made in that context.  Of much greater importance to me is moving at a faster pace for September with the vaccination roll-out.  Whether we get there by early September or when in September we get there is, to me, the more critical question at this stage.  We will wait for the public health advice and the evidence base on antigen testing to give us more detail in that context.</p></speech>

If a person feels for any medical reason that he or she would prefer to continue with lecturing online, will these be live lectures as they are happening or will they be recorded and given to the students?  What way does Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh see this happening?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.860" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#K00300"><p>That is dependent on, presumably, the technology and the lecturer.  Students had different views on this.  Some preferred live and others appreciated the asynchronous nature of them, in that they could look back over these lectures.  It will be a mixture of both of these, with a particular emphasis on making material available online to allow students to progress where they cannot come on to the campus.</p> <p>  Our experience is that most students will want to be back.  We will support all of our students, particularly vulnerable students, and international students likewise.  Some of them may not be able to arrive, within the public health advice, by September.  We will be supporting both of those vulnerable and international student groups through the technology that we had this year in a mixture of both recorded and live material.  Different views and preferences have been expressed by students for both of those but our expectation is that we will make those available and that is what we are asking colleagues to do in the context of the learning experience.</p></speech>

It was very interesting to talk to the teaching union on this.  Staff themselves were very anxious to have forward planning on this as it is very difficult to do both.  It is one thing to record a lecture and have it there asynchronously but trying to work in two modes is very challenging.  For that reason, as Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh has said, the commitment is to try to get back on campus with certainty.</p> <p>  Obviously, we will be very caring about individual cases who cannot, for whatever reasons, be on site.  This will apply to both staff and students.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.862" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#K00600"><p>I have number of questions for Mr. Kearney but I will come back to those in a while.</p> <p>  I was canvassing during the by-election on Monday or Tuesday of this week.  I knocked on the door of a 19-year-old who is his first year in a third level institution.  He recognised my face and knew that our witnesses were attending today.  He was very well tuned in and had a great interest in politics.  He has been learning online since September of last year.  I asked him whether he had met many of his colleagues and he replied that he was there for the induction day and had met a small number of people from his class.  He said that he was looking forward and could not wait to get to the third level college.  He said that he only knows two people with whom he would be quite friendly in the third level institution who were in his class or lecture at present and that he was very apprehensive about going back to college.  This was a very confident guy and I was amazed at how honest he was with me.  He asked me to put the following points to our three witnesses.  He said that if he was going into first year, he would get the tender loving care, TLC, of the college and all that involves but now this TLC will have to be given to both the first and second years.  That will be a very great challenge.  I am not certain if the colleges have chaplaincy services or what the position is in that regard.  Our witnesses have been involved in this sector for many years and would be able to pick out the shy students or those who might be struggling or whatever the case may be.  </p> <p>  The other issue raised was that those going to college usually want to stay on campus for the first year to find their feet.  They probably are far more confident in their second year to go and live off-campus.  There will be first year students looking for accommodation on campus.  Will many second year students be looking for on-campus accommodation or how will that be managed?  Are second year students allowed on campus or is there a lower percentage of these students on campus?  </p> <p>  What are the witnesses' views on this student&rsquo;s point of view as outlined by me and how will they face this challenge that lies ahead?  He asked me to put those questions to our witnesses and I expect that there are thousands of students out there, some may be shyer than others, who feel apprehensive about going to college in September, even though they are in second year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.863" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joseph Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#K00700"><p>The Chairman&rsquo;s question encapsulates that whole challenge of the student experience for so many students and that view would not be untypical.  I give full credit to the student in that if he knows the Chair of the joint committee and knows what is coming up on the schedule of that committee, something is working in the education system regardless of whatever course this young man is on.</p> <p>  As to the TLC, a very interesting piece on this is that the State Examinations Commission, SEC, process going into the CAO, is in itself going to necessitate a phased reintroduction of students.  That question of orientation and reorientation is in its own way going to be assisted through that architecture.  We have spent much time trying to build the design of that with colleges over the past while.</p> <p>  I will leave the question of accommodation to Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh as we do not have accommodation other than to say that one of the things about early planning for this was driven greatly by the need to give incoming students certainty.  There is no point in telling people in August that we are doing X or Y because they have to get in to book that accommodation.  In our sector, it is all private accommodation.  I will pass over now to the professor, if I may, through the Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.864" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#K00800"><p>I thank the Chairman and Dr. Ryan and as Dr. Ryan has said this is not an untypical student response.  I also encourage students to come forward.  Sometimes they find it difficult to put their hands up and ask for help.  For those either tuning in or if members come across students who need assistance, please let us know.  We are there, first and foremost, for our students.</p> <p>  Second, we are looking at an induction or reorientation for second years.  As Dr. Ryan has mentioned, the delayed start of the first year group will allow us to spend more time on the second and third year students, that is, those who are returning to college, earlier in September all going well.  The reorientation piece will be helpful to us in that regard.</p> <p>  On accommodation, it is worth noting that only 10% of the housing stock for students is on-campus university or third level institution accommodation.  There is a significant portion therefore that is off campus and a need for us to grow on-campus accommodation as a consequence.  We prioritise first years and international students for the most part on campus.  Again, we may be able to do this on a phased basis and accommodate other students for an early part of September, particularly international students.  We are looking at that in the context of accommodating incoming international students.  The phased timing and approach would be helpful, because the later years will start earlier in September and the first years will start on the last Monday in September.</p><p>That will allow for the TLC to which the Chairman referred.</p><p> Returning to my first point, if anyone sees students who need help, please let us know because we want to help them when we can.  There is an infrastructure on campus.  There are really good colleagues who work with us and with our students in order to help them through the university experience.  Part of that is informed and shaped by Covid.  We are very anxious to help students where we can.</p><p> The date of 19 July is critical because there will be further guidelines available to us.  That will allow us to plan ahead but also it allows students to plan for their own accommodations and plans for September.  We are really pleased that the Department has identified 19 July and is encouraging that date because it is really critical for our planning and for our students.</p></speech>

So, too, must the Minister for regularly attending the group's meetings.  The benefit of that tertiary education system is that allows the types of issues the Chairman encountered on the canvass to be represented, which the Union of Students in Ireland has done very successfully over the past 16 months.  As the pandemic has gone on, there have been different challenges.  Those mentioned by the Chairman have been raised at the steering group.  I concur with others that the 19 July date is critical so that the institutions are afforded sufficient time to plan for those issues.</p></speech>

If the guests had one or two requests, what would they be?  What would they like us to ask them relating to the return of thousands of students to campus from all over the island to different colleges, institutions, cities and towns across the country.  It will be a major issue.  Hopefully, there will not be a fourth wave in view of the fact that our older people are vaccinated and that young people from their late teens up will be vaccinated soon.</p></speech>

First, this is a whole-of-society approach.  It needs all of us to work together and the Department, the Minister and the HEA have been particularly good at this and we welcome that.  We want to see them encourage that along and have 19 July as the date.  The funding mechanisms we asked for are particularly student-focused.  The support and the timing around that will be critical.</p> <p>  Second is welcoming students and encouraging the continued focus on them.  The Minister, the Department and the HEA and all our institutions have been particularly focused on student needs.  We are not advocating here for our institutions, universities or the third level and higher education sectors; we are advocating for students.  We would welcome that continued focus on student needs from the Minister.  So we particularly encourage first, the whole-of-society approach, including the vaccination programme, and the sense that we are essential to society and second, the focus on student needs.</p></speech>

First, there has been that cohesive approach through all this.  I know the Minister and his officials very much want the return on campus but they also want it to be sustainable.  I have emphasised ventilation and I would ask questions around that.  The second observation echoes what Dr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh said, that the inclusive approach and the structure that has been set up be maintained.  I know what the Minister will say but I would certainly ask the question in that regard.  The fact that I am echoing what a colleague has already stated says something about cohesiveness.</p></speech>

The Minister has attended many of the meetings.  He was obliged to come in at difficult and challenging points and tell us that we were going into another lockdown.  A full, extended reopening was not possible or feasible.  We must continue with the sense of connectedness and cohesion and communication with all stakeholders in order that we can continue to deal with whatever challenges arise.</p> <p>  Others have spoken of the need to continue with the focus on learners.  I also acknowledge the work of the Minister in establishing the working group on learner well-being.  That group highlighted several key objectives and how to deliver support.  That should be continued in the coming weeks and months, whatever challenges the pandemic may throw at us.</p></speech>

I want to assure the Chair that the confident, intelligent, politically engaged young voter with a strong interest in education is a Fianna F&aacute;il supporter.  I am glad that he met him.</p> <p>  I am glad this discussion became very much on student focus and how we can do that.  I have three questions or points on that and another around Covid.  Many of those going through second level have shown amazing resilience.  There are far more places in higher and further education than ever before.  However, significant numbers of students who have had their education disrupted will not make it through the system and will not complete to leaving certificate.  The ETBI has played a particularly strong role, especially in the context of programmes such as Youthreach.  We have to look at how the system will respond to those students who have really lost out during this period, who have not been able to avail of senior cycle education and who may have become disengaged.  How do we provide opportunities for them?</p> <p>  My second point relates to the fact that there is an issue with regard to international students who may wish to come here but who have received vaccines which have not been approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  What approach should we take to address this?  There would not be a significant number of students outside the EU in that category.</p> <p>  My third point relates to assessment and performance.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, has indicated we will review the leaving certificate quite soon.  The students this year will have a combination of calculated grades along with the traditional leaving certificate examinations.  I am sure it will be done but is there a way of monitoring their performance depending on the option or combination of options they do.  I am sure the institutions are working with the HEA to do that.  It would be interesting to feed that data into what kind of model of assessment we should have in future.</p> <p>  Finally, on academic freedom, the third level sector has been superb in its contribution to tackling Covid, including by making facilities available.</p><p>Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh's former colleague, Professor Brian MacCraith, has taken on a lead role, as has Professor Philip Nolan.  Many academics are contributing and helping us to learn through this process.  I am strong believer in academic freedom and diversity of opinion, both of which have to be respected.  However, some academics are deliberately engaging in disinformation or misinformation, particularly around Covid-19, vaccines, and so on.  I do not want to mention a particular case that might be springing to my mind of someone in a position of authority.  How should we try to address that as a society?  I am talking particularly about tenured academics.  With academic freedom comes responsibility.  There is a challenge to the higher education system, as to how we address the issues of responsibility that come with academic freedom, particularly where disinformation is being spread about Covid-19 and vaccines.  </p></speech>

I am stupid enough to walk into that minefield.</p> <p>  First, I will go back to where the Senator started, on second level and learning.  With the construction of the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, we now have to deliver on the linkage between those two.  Thinking our way through that on a whole-of-system piece is an important next step.  There have been learnings from the different assessment approaches to the leaving certificate.  I am part of a current discussion that is looking afresh at all of that.  Again, it is think tank discussion, but it is interesting.  </p> <p>  Non-EMA vaccines are a challenge.  I mentioned this earlier in the discussion.  People who have taken those vaccines, whether they are in China or India, understand themselves to be fully vaccinated.  That is what the data shows.  Again, conversations are happening between the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Health on that this week.  We will wait for the advice that might come from that.  </p> <p>  On the Senator&rsquo;s final question of informing public policy, academic freedom as a concept is a double-edged sword.  If we declare and defend it, then we have to allow what comes out of it.  On the other hand, what is stated must be evidence-based.  If it is not clear and cogent, it needs to be challenged.  That needs to be done openly and honestly. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-07-08a.879" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021070800002#M00500"><p>To follow on from Senator Malcolm Byrne&rsquo;s observations, I concur with the previous point by Deputy Alan Farrell.  There is tremendous affirmation due to the young students of Ireland.  If we go back to our own school days, if we were told that we were going to spend a full, complete year in our various schooling communities, separated from our peers by a distance of a metre, and wearing masks up and down the school corridors, I am not sure we would have been eager or enthusiastic about taking that on.  That is what every young student in this country did.  Not only that, they also faced tremendous disruption of their learning for three or four months.  This is the second year in which their teaching and learning was interrupted.  This happened across all school disciplines and regulations.  A tremendous note of appreciation is due to students and teachers in accommodating that.  The various options ahead are challenging for students.  The extra guidance support which the Department facilitated was greatly appreciated within schooling communities.  It offered much needed pastoral, emotional, guidance, and assistance to our young students.</p> <p>  The benefits of the new SOLAS further education and training, FET, strategy are multi-faceted.  It looks at further education into schools and into higher education.  There are more and more options.  Again, it is about offering every support to the learner so that the best option for them is selected, at all times.  Education and Training Boards Ireland very much welcomes the approach-----</p></speech>

Colleges of education are likely looking at that already.  For international students, we follow public health advice.  That is the context in which we work.  On academic freedom, diversity of voices is particularly important.  That also means, as Dr. Ryan mentioned, there should be evidence-based challenge.  It is part of a healthy society to have those debates, with a diversity of voice, where people are challenged if something is clearly contestable.  That is a particularly important aspect of academic freedom.  We should encourage a broad diversity of voice with an evidence base behind it to challenge, where challenges are to be made.</p></speech>

The building belies the extent of their work, particularly around animation, as well as on other things.  I could feel the student-focused ethos of the College.  I want to commend that.  As I have often said, the colleges of further education have not had the capital investment they need.  Yet, fantastic work is being done there.  I encourage people all around the country to look at what is available through further education.  I commend everybody involved there.</p> <p>  The proposal Dr. Ryan has made to advocate for the retention of the vaccination infrastructure in, or near, the institutes in August and September is significant.  Has Dr. Ryan formally requested that from the public health department?  It is a good idea.  Even for September and October, where we do not yet have facilities, if each of the colleges could have a vaccination centre, that would be a worthwhile preventative measure.</p> <p>  Finally, can we now meet the demands of 100% of those who want to come to college on campus?  Will there be a percentage of students who may be turned away?  What is the capacity of the colleges?  There was an increase in the numbers last year and there is an increase again this year.  If everybody decided right now, here today, that they wanted to be on campus, can that demand be met? </p></speech>

With a vaccination centre, we would work with the HSE if that would be helpful.  Accessibility would be particularly important.  Our staff was involved in that.  We would welcome that.</p> <p>  On the other question, I am not sure if the Deputy asking specifically about the students on a university campus?  Is she asking if they will be coming back to campus or not or is it a more general question around capacity? </p></speech>

Will that mean that we can accommodate, say, 70% students who want to come back?  Would it be 60%, or whatever?  I want to get a picture of expectations.</p></speech>

There may well still, particularly given ventilation, be limits on the capacity of rooms.  In that context, we will either make the material available online or have an experience online, and-or have smaller supplementary classes.  It would be "double teaching", if you like.  However, it depends on the broader context.  As of right now, we are not clear on that context.</p><p>Our expectation is that we will go as far as possible in making the on-campus experience meaningful.  All of the other constraints around that will continue.  The 19 July plans and guidelines are particularly critical to us in making those plans and being able to communicate to students accordingly.  We are taking a sectoral approach to those communications.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

I know Mr. Kearney mentioned Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  I thank him for doing so.  As someone coming from the creative arts side, I must say that the college has a huge impact.  I thank Mr. Kearney for mentioning it.</p> <p>  I also thank him for mentioning the retention of the vaccination centres.  That was a proposal that we put through the national steering group.  I have been banging that drum for some time, to which people such as Mr. Kearney will attest.  I am conscious that the single-shot Janssen vaccine is being offered to that age cohort.  It will change the game.  Vaccination was always going to be a social contract.  The idea behind the retention of the vaccination centres was to make it as easy as possible for everyone to have the chance of being offered an invitation to get vaccinated and to take it.  I am conscious of younger staff and the students in that.</p> <p>  On the question of restricting numbers, as Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh stated, the ambition is to get as many students on-site as possible.  The truth is that it is too hard to tell at this stage what we can expect.  We will just have to wait and see how it works out.  It may be the case that we will not be able to have some large classes in full on campus, but we will monitor the situation through the summer.  </p></speech>

On behalf of all the committee members, I would like to wish the witnesses the best of luck in the reopening and getting back to some form of normality.  I have no doubt there will be many challenges between now and the end of the year.  With the work of all involved, including the Department, the HEA and the witnesses' institutions, the challenges that we have faced in the past can be surmounted.  The most important things are the lives and education of the students.  I am glad that aspect was very much part and parcel of today's discussion.</p> <p>  I would specifically like to thank Dr. Ryan.  It is his second appearance before the committee in a number of days.  I also thank Professor &Oacute; h&Oacute;gartaigh and Mr. Kearney.  The meeting has been most informative.  I thank the witnesses for sharing their own insights and expert knowledge on the issue.  On behalf of the committee, I ask them to wish all their staff the best of luck and to thank them for their commitment over the past 12 months.  It has been a learning experience for everyone and also a challenging period.  We will look into this area further when the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, appear before the committee next week.</p></speech>
