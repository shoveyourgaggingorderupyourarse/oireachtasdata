I remind everyone that apart from myself and members of the committee's secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and all members are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  Apologies have been received from Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey.</p> <p>  Today we will continue our pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the employment permits (consolidation and amendment) Bill 2019.  The proposal has been submitted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Members will recall that we had a briefing from the Department on the proposal and we have met representatives of IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, on the issue.   To assist the committee in its further consideration of this matter today, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Philip Carroll, chairperson, Mr. Cormac Healy and Mr. Joe Ryan from Meat Industry Ireland, MII.  I also welcome Ms Edel McGinley, director, Ms Karina Korotkevica and Mr. Neil Bruton from the Migrants Rights Centre of Ireland, MRCI.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and to the practice of the Houses as regards reference that may be made to others when witnesses are giving evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements of the witnesses have been directed to all members and to commence consideration of the matter today, I invite Mr. Carroll to make his opening statement on behalf of MII.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#A00300"><p>Good morning, Chair and members.  As the Chairman said, I am accompanied this morning by Mr. Cormac Healy and Mr. Joe Ryan.  MII welcomes this opportunity to contribute to the discussion at the committee on the general scheme of the employment permits Bill.  MII is a trade association within IBEC, representing the primary meat processing sector.  Our membership includes a significant proportion of the total primary processors, though not all, and we do not represent secondary meat processing.</p><p>Our members' processing facilities are located throughout rural Ireland, and the sector employs 16,000 people directly and many thousands more in linked employment.  A typical primary processing plant will generate approximately &euro;100 million in local economic activity and employ 300 people directly.</p><p> Employment in the meat sector is based on full-time direct employment and comprises a mixture of Irish and EU employees who represent some 80% of the total workforce.  Irish staff continue to represent the single largest nationality.  The majority, mainly European nationals, have worked in Ireland in the years since 2005, after EU enlargement, when a significant number of workers came from central and eastern Europe.  The economic downturn here halted the pace of EU migration in the meantime and although the economy recovered, a much smaller number of people came to Ireland and so the meat sector reached the point in 2015 where it lacked sufficient resources to service important export markets.</p><p> Through the employment permit scheme, the industry recruited skilled knifemen internationally to fill the resulting vacancies.  Although every effort has been made to recruit at home, the reality we faced was that in a recovering economy where the domestic labour market was tight, there was little or no supply capacity available to meet the growing needs of the sector.  In 2018, domestic labour sources had dried up to the extent that vacancies for general operatives were unfillable within the EU-EEA economies and the wider agrifood sector, including meat, dairy, and horticulture, secured a permit scheme for general operatives to fill the vacancies.  Between 2015 and December 2019, specific quotas of permits - approximately 3,160 in all - were made available for meat processing.</p><p> While employment levels have grown rapidly in recent years pre-Covid, labour force participation has not kept pace with current labour demand and Ireland&rsquo;s prime age participation rate had never been higher, reaching 83.5% in 2018.  This suggests that longer term, additional sources of labour are needed above what labour market activation can provide.  In this context, the meat sector forecast is that international sources of labour will continue to be in demand under the two existing permit schemes available to the sector.  The shortages we face are unlikely to abate as we increasingly find that the sector is competing to attract the attention of a reduced pool of resident workers.</p><p> Without a permit option to meet the labour needs required in the meat sector, we would put in jeopardy hard-won export business that is now more than ever facing global competitive challenges as we work through the pandemic, the more challenging trading environment arising from Brexit and the need for market diversification to support the wider agricultural and rural economy, which is so reliant on the agrifood business chain.</p><p> We welcome the intention behind the proposed changes to permits legislation, which the Department has stated are concerned with increasing its agility and effectiveness while retaining the key policy focus of supporting the economy and the labour market through evidence-based decision-making.  Indeed, it was because of evidence-based decision-making that the Department agreed to permits schemes for skilled knifemen and general operatives, both of which have a strong future importance in filling labour and skill gaps in the sector.</p><p> The scheme highlights areas where reforms can lead to wider efficiencies, benefiting both the business sector and the permit holder.  The proposal to move the operational practices from primary to secondary legislation will better support the responsiveness to changing economic conditions.  We welcome the changes proposed to the labour market needs test introducing modern communications and advertising platforms, which will bring a sharper focus on Irish and European jobseekers as their first priority in addition to the tried and tested traditional models.  We welcome the intention to deepen the involvement with the Department of Social Protection in the labour market needs test process to maximise opportunities for resident and EEA workers to seek jobs.  We have worked extensively with the Department in the past.</p><p> Ongoing significant efforts are being made by processors to recruit for these positions, including continuous engagement with local social welfare offices and advertisements in Irish and European Employment Services, EURES, websites and local and national publications.  We are committed to upskilling and retention, a feature of businesses that has hugely contributed to advancement and retention policies.</p><p>Our members continue to engage in Skillnet programmes as part and parcel of further developing the in-company needs of the sector.<br/><br/>The new processes being introduced to the Trusted Partner and renewal applications will help to alleviate the overall administrative burden of those interacting with the permit system.  There are additional IT developments that would improve the permit regime.  A further potential improvement would be to address inflexibilities in the permit system that limit and delay the promotion of permit holders.<br/><br/>One of the challenges relating to low-skilled workers that arose during the review of economic migration policy suggested that greater access to such workers through permit arrangements may stifle innovation and automation of certain roles.  This is not the case.  Where available, the use of modern technology has been adopted; however, primary processing is and will remain a labour-intensive operation.  The industry globally and here in Ireland is exploring automation options, and while a future transition to automation cannot be ruled out it is not on the immediate horizon and would be slow in emerging and expensive to deliver, particularly for the smaller-scale plants in Ireland.<br/><br/><b></b>Overall, the draft Bill is designed to ensure that Ireland has the capability and agility necessary to adapt to rapid changes in the needs of the labour market as it evolves in the future.  As an industry that has an established demand for human resources beyond those we can reach in our domestic economy, we need to have the ability to employ permit holders sourced internationally, maintain our productive capacity, service international markets and support the wider agrifood and rural economy from which our industry's raw materials are sourced.<br/><br/>While our overall preference is still to recruit within the Irish and EEA labour pools, this labour source is not currently available in sufficient numbers, and our sector will have a continuing need to fill vacancies from abroad.  Otherwise, we face the risk to businesses and limit their ability to develop new market opportunities for Irish meat products.  The draft Bill is, therefore, welcome.  The changes being made are good additions to the needs of a modern economy where agility and responsiveness are critical to maintaining our international competitiveness.  A supportive legal framework that continues to safeguard the labour market and supports the employment rights of permit holders will be good for the economy and those who work in it.  I thank the Chair and members for the opportunity to present MII's views on the draft Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Edel McGinley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair.  I am a director at MRCI.  I am joined by Ms Korotkevica and Mr. Bruton, who will be helping me with some questions later.  MRCI has been working with migrant workers in low-wage and precarious sectors for almost two decades, including across the agrifood, fisheries, childcare, home care, hotel and catering and security sectors.  We make this interjection in a context broader than just that of the agrifood sector.</p> <p>  Ireland continues to be very positive for people who migrate here for work although we have seen poor conditions for workers exposed in many sectors of the labour market.  In this context, there are three important points we want to communicate to the committee.  First, we would like to see this Bill give equal rights and parity to all employment permit holders, similar to those given through critical skill permits.  Second, we disagree with the concept of seasonal work permits and temporary work permits that move.  If the Government pursues this approach, it needs to provide measures that allow people to easily transition to longer-term status and other work.  We would also like to see a provision in the Bill that allows access to the workplace relations bodies, not just the civil courts, for all workers, including undocumented workers.</p> <p>  Are the committee members comfortable treating migrant workers differently from other workers and differently from each other.  The way our system is set up pits people against each other.  It believes an IT developer is better than a meat factory worker.  The intention of this Bill is to make the employment permit system more responsible and flexible to the needs of the labour market.</p><p>That is not a bad thing <i>per se</i>.  However, flexibility with limited rights is dangerous.  Our 20 years&rsquo; experience shows us that limiting rights puts workers in more vulnerable situations, contributes to exploitation, pushes people into irregularity and limits progression, family formation and family reunion.<br/><br/>Throughout the pandemic, essential workers have been picking and packing food and putting it on our tables.  Many have cared for loved ones.  This Bill was developed in 2019 when times were very different.  There is now much more appreciation for essential workers and for the work that people do.  We need to ask and answer a number of questions in this regard.  Why does this Bill not recognise essential workers?  Why are they been treated as less deserving of rights because the consideration is not being given?<br/><br/>Ireland already operates an onerous and complex immigration and labour migration system to manage migration.  We have measures to safeguard the prioritisation of Irish and EU workers through tests for labour market needs, some of which will change.  Measures are also in place to ensure that the ratio of non-EU workers does not surpass 50% of workforce.  Several occupations are deemed ineligible for the purpose of employment permits applications.  These are reviewed biannually.<br/><br/>Why do we penalise workers' rights by limiting their mobility?  Why are we introducing more temporary arrangements and permits?  Arguments against labour mobility - the right to change employer - often centre on protecting employers&rsquo; interests, particularly in the context of workers leaving soon after arrival and fear of posts remaining vacant, with employers unable to recoup the costs associated with employment permit applications.  Our experience shows, however, that when people are treated fairly, workers will stay in work.  This means being paid well, having good conditions, including sick pay, feeling respected and being able to progress in their workplaces.  All evidence indicates that people who arrive on work permits are not here temporarily, as the system supposes.  People come, settle, put down roots and stay.<br/><br/>We have an opportunity now to stop and reflect on our current employment permit system.  Is it fit for purpose?  Does it do what we need it to do?  Is there a better way to safeguard and enhance workers&rsquo; rights?  We believe the Bill is not in favour of workers' rights and runs contrary to them.  MRCI&rsquo;s work over the years has shown that migrant workers find it hard to access their family rights, progress in the labour market and access legal redress if they are irregular.  None of this will change under the Bill.<br/><br/>We are concerned that the Bill gives the Minister enhanced discretion and powers through the use of regulation.  This discretion is not balanced by enhanced and strengthened protections and rights for workers, especially in light of proposals to increase the use of temporary permits.  We are deeply concerned that the needs of industry and employers are favoured without a similar level of consideration given to the rights of workers and the protections relating to them.<br/><br/>The Bill needs to give parity to all workers on employment permits by giving gradual mobility to all general employment permit holders, similar to that already in place for critical skills permit holders.  In effect this means full access to the labour market after two years, immediate rights to family reunion and the right to work for spouses and partners.  This will help to simplify and streamline the employment permits system and negate the need for a range of schemes, regulations and administrative processes.<br/><br/>We are very concerned about the introduction of new short-term temporary permits.  It is well documented that when temporary migration systems do not offer safeguards, some employers may take advantage of this power imbalance, creating a vulnerable workforce that are potentially forced into irregularity.  If the Bill continues with this approach, then measures need to be put in place to allow people who are recruited temporarily, such as seasonal workers, to transition into longer-term status in other work.<br/><br/>MRCI believes that all work is work.  We believe that undocumented migrant workers perform work just like other workers and should be protected by the same rights and regulations as other workers.  Consequently, they should have access to the workplace relations bodies, which are the appropriate bodies to deal with this, and not the civil courts.  This needs to be amended.<br/><br/>The Bill also references a remuneration review.  We caution against an approach that does not meaningfully engage with workers or worker rights representatives.</p><p>It needs to be strengthened across the legislation.  There is also a significant challenge in making a submission with a lack of clarity and detail in the Bill in its entirety.  Finally, we see the Bill as creating more layers and not fewer, and it will serve to segregate people.  We are not sure what special needs permits would be, for example, or perceived lower-end seasonal work permits.  I thank the committee and welcome questions from the members.</p></speech>

The first speaker will be Deputy Louise O'Reilly and she has 14 minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#E00300"><p>As I have used the raise hand feature and have now lowered the hand, I will get a gold star.  Good morning to the witnesses.  I thank them very much for the evidence they have given.  This is a matter in which I have an interest for many reasons, mostly from a workers' rights perspective, as I am sure they appreciate.  Some of the witnesses will have seen me speaking before the Covid-19 committee and they know their industry, almost uniquely outside the healthcare sector, was subject to the discussion by that committee.  I am sure that was not comfortable for the witnesses and it was not a great place for any industry.  Nevertheless, there were submissions to that committee because of outbreaks in factory settings and particularly those disproportionately affecting the workers.  We know several plants were closed.  The process was helpful as it shone a light on an industry that we might not often think or speak about.  It is very welcome that we are having the engagement this morning and we will continue in that.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll said that Meat Industry Ireland, which he represents, uses this permit system.  I say to Ms McGinley that I am not comfortable with migrant workers being treated differently from or less well than any other group, category or type of worker.  Of course I am not because that is not right but the law appears to facilitate that.  In discussing the law we should be minded to have a discussion on how to improve the law so we can ensure there are more protections for workers.  It is a great pity we never seem to have those types of conversation and it is always where worker rights need to be diminished or set aside or where we need to pit one group of workers against another, which is not the right way to go.</p> <p>  Ms McGinley described the inequalities that exist in the system, as well as low pay and precarious work.  Is that her view on the manner in which migrants are treated within this industry?</p></speech>

We are concerned with granting more rights to workers so they can move employment if a better job comes up or they are offered something different that they want to do.  We advocate for the elimination of the general employment permit and all work in the State to be looked at in terms of critical and essential skills.</p> <p>  There is a huge number of safeguards in the State already with regard to immigration and labour market needs tests in terms of the 50-50 rule.  There are many safeguards already in place but these are not for workers.  We want to give workers better rights in the sphere that parliamentarians control, including work permits.  We do not have control over the rate of pay that workers get under the employment permit system.  It was diminished in the last quota process for this industry.  We can give people better family rights and rights in the labour market.</p><p>We can do that easily at the stroke of a pen in this legislation and we should do that for workers.</p></speech>

In times gone by the meat industry was heavily unionised.  I am not certain what the picture is at the moment but there are active trade unions in some of the plants.  What is the level of unionisation among workers on the work permit scheme and migrant workers who are employed in the industry?</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, there is no statutory obligation for union recognition in workplaces but, nonetheless, right across our sector, there is a mix.  Some companies have formal union recognition and others do not.  I do not have a particular figure but I do not think, in any plant where there is formal union recognition, there is any difference between the recognition of the workers who are covered by permits as compared with workers who are not.</p></speech>

For those of us, particularly those from a workers' rights background but not exclusively, when one considers the industry, as pointed out by Ms McGinley, is characterised by low pay and precarious work one would tend towards the view that it is not a highly unionised sector, particularly for those people at the business end.</p> <p>  With regard to recruiting people domestically and trying to find people to work in these factories under the terms and conditions offered, and I say the following a bit tongue in cheek, has the industry ever tried raising wages?  I mean if one tried to live in this State on the type of money that meat plants offer to migrant workers one would find it extremely difficult to build a life, feed a family, put down roots or have any sort of comfort.  Mr. Carroll represents a very profitable sector so would it not occur to him that if the wages were better it would stimulate demand among domestic workers to apply for the jobs?  </p></speech>

In terms of the effort that has been undertaken by our members over the years, we have worked closely for many years with them on labour availability.  Significant effort is put into prioritising recruitment in Ireland and the EEA, as we have said in our opening statement.  Over the years we have worked with the Department of Social Protection, in particular, to mine the live register.  All of that work continues to be done.  Each and every employer is engaged with the local employment and social welfare offices as well.</p></speech>

Has the sector considered raising wages to see if it would stimulate demand domestically or did it peg the wages at low hourly rates but did not find people so went outside the country?</p></speech>

There is a wide range of occupations in the sector and it is unfair to characterise it.</p></speech>

That is for sure.  While people may come in at close to the minimum wage as a starting position in a general operative post, there is opportunity to progress as skills and experience progress and that is done.</p> <p>  We are also part of, and operate in, a competitive environment.  If we look even at our closest neighbours-competitors, be that Northern Ireland or Great Britain, GB, we are on par or ahead of those in terms of pay rates in this sector.</p> <p>  We have to compete.  We export 90% of what we produce.  It is important that we maintain our position in those markets for the overall agri-sector and there is a strong level of competition.  Pay has increased as part of the overall increase in pay over the years but, equally, there is also a competitive issue.</p> <p>  Our sector will remain a labour intensive sector as well.

I received a parliamentary question response from the T&aacute;naiste's office regarding the WRC inspections.  They revised the figure of 46% non-compliance with WRC inspectors upwards to 48%.  In terms of the number of meat processing inspections by the WRC inspectors, 48% of those were found to be non-compliant with employment law and substantial amounts, possibly not when balanced with the profits within the industry but when compared to the earnings of those on low wages, were recovered on behalf of workers that they should have been paid.  Does that worry Mr. Healy at all?  It would worry me if I was representing that industry.  I have to be frank.</p></speech>

First, I want to be clear to all members.  We stated that our members in MII are open to all and any inspections by the authorities.  The Deputy mentioned in particular the WRC.  Be it the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, or the permanent presence of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we are open to those.</p> <p>  I have seen coverage on the figures the Deputy quoted.  Many breaches in that regard are of a technical nature.  It is not a suggestion, it is important to point out, that there is any deliberate attempt to flout or undermine the legal rules of the land.  Our members are responsible companies.  They are a technical breach.</p> <p>  Equally, when this was raised, we looked at inspections that the WRC conducts right across the economy and the level of inspections where breaches or non-compliance were found was at 40% across all inspections.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily out of par.  It is important to point out it is not, as far as I am aware across our membership, that anything has gone to prosecution.  If matters have been raised, they are addressed and dealt with.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned a figure of &euro;180,000 in recovered wages.  I accept fully it is important that should be corrected and dealt with but I would point out that is &euro;180,000 over a six-year period where the total wage bill of the sector was more than &euro;2.8 billion.</p></speech>

We are looking at small numbers of inspections taking place.  For example, in 2015, there were four inspections and four breaches and, in 2016, nine inspections and six breaches.  It might be in line with some other industries.  From what I have viewed, I do not accept that it is.</p></speech>

I refer to the recovery of that money for some of the lowest paid workers in this State.  When we consider the WRC is operating with approximately half the inspectors it should be, the commission is certainly not by a long shot getting into every factory or place that Mr. Healy represents but every time its staff get in and conduct an inspection we see that there are high levels of non-compliance within the sector.</p><p>It is not a case of the WRC being in every factory because of course it cannot be, but I am referring to situations where it is there.  I find it quite disturbing that Mr. Healy has come in here to defend that because those figures are quite shocking.  The fact that 48% were found to be non-compliant is not a great advert for Mr. Healy's industry.  We completely understand that it is a labour-intensive industry but it does not have to be a byword for precarious work, low pay and for figures like-----</p></speech>

What level of turnover does the industry experience with employees who come in on work permits?  This is in the context of the suggestion by MRCI that we should move away from restricting the right of a person on a work permit to move jobs.  It is a reasonable request in that if a person is tied to his or her employer, his or her ability to exercise his or her employment rights will be restricted.  I would be interested in hearing MII's response to that.</p> <p>  I am interested in whether we should move toward more of a compact when work permits become a significant feature of a sector, such as looking at what percentage of payroll is devoted to upskilling and what number of apprenticeships are taken on in a year.  Would MII be up for that?</p> <p>  Turning to Ms McGinley, does she not see a genuine seasonality to some work like fruit picking?  Maybe it is not that extensive but there would be some people whom it suits to come in and do seasonal work and perhaps do so on repeated occasions.  Is expecting a full work permit to be granted for someone coming in seasonally not an undue burden on an employer who really wants to get his or her fruit picked or their harvest brought in?  Would it be better to talk about repeat seasonality perhaps or some sort of continuity?</p> <p>  On access to the WRC for the undocumented, what is the legal prevention in this regard?  Is it that the WRC will not recognise them or a fear that going to the commission will blow a person's cover?</p> <p>  Finally, on an issue Ms McGinley raised, I see things like the right to move employment as an employment right and the right of a spouse to work as an employment right but family reunification gets into a much wider range of issues than are provided for in this Bill or, indeed, by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p>Has the Department of Justice been approached to explore some of these elements of inequity of treatment?  I presume it would be the primary Department looking at family reunification.</p></speech>

The turnover of those permit holders in the workforce would be very low.  There is some turnover and obviously permit holders can switch employers after a 12-month period.  On the Deputy's follow-up question on reducing the 12-month period, the employers go to a great deal of effort in the recruitment process and identifying candidates outside of the EU and EEA market, organising flights and induction programmes.  We feel the existing 12-month stipulation is a balanced approach.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about apprenticeships and, in a wider context, training and development.  There are apprenticeships on all members sites in respect of fitters, electricians and refrigeration.  In more recent times, there have been apprenticeships for laboratory technicians and logistics.  This is something that is certainly being done.  In addition to apprenticeships, there is a wide range of other training and development programmes, such as Skillnet programmes on knifing and boning skills or programmes on food safety, hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, Lean Six Sigma and IT training, depending on the various roles.</p> <p>  There is a point we might come back to later, which we mentioned it in our opening statement, with regard to progression opportunities for employment permit holders.  There are some restrictions and inflexibility in the legislation and system that limit for a period the progression opportunities on the employment permit side.  I can come back on this later if the Deputy wants further detail.  There are wider training and development opportunities in many roles, be they through in-house training and external providers such as Skillnet.</p></speech>

I will speak about seasonal work and Ms Korotkevica might come in on the WRC and access to legal redress.  We do not have a definition of what seasonal work is, how long it is, where it is and where it happens.  It is not just in fruit picking but also in tourism, education and many other sectors.  We could say there is seasonality in many things.  There is a danger that everything can be defined as seasonal so we have to be very careful about this type of approach.  We also need to think about the rights of workers, their access to PRSI and pensions, whether there is portability of their social welfare rights and how this is managed.  None of this has been communicated to us or thought through as far as I can see.</p> <p>  Many years ago we had a situation where people came on group seasonal work permits.  The majority of people became undocumented after those work permits ceased.  Everybody we worked with at the time fell out of the system.  There is a danger that if we do not provide transitional measures and work is available for people to access the labour market people will become undocumented, and I can guarantee that Migrant Rights Centre Ireland will be mopping it up.  We are trying to look at this from a prevention perspective.  We would like to see how we define seasonality.  It suits some workers to come and work but that is on a very specific regional basis.</p><p>Workers who come from Romania and Bulgaria, for example, have the right to work and to mobility, and there is a different set of rights and circumstances.  On the other hand, if someone is asked to come from, say, India, Pakistan, Morocco or somewhere else outside the EU, there is a different set of expectations when he or she moves to Europe.  We have to understand migration more broadly.  We are not in favour of limiting the rights of people but rather of giving them more rights and allowing them to transition into other work.  The seasonal work issue needs more discussion and thought and clearer definitions of what it would be and what the transitional measures would look like.</p><p> There is a justice issue with family reunification.  General employment permits and critical skills employment permits involve different sets of rights.  Under the latter, the holder is allowed to bring along his or her family immediately - no questions asked.  It is assumed that people are coming here to settle, whereas in the context of the general employment permit, there is an assumption that people are not and it is a temporary system.  A general employment permit holder has to wait a year before he or she can apply for family reunification.  We know moving with one's family is good and helps the person to settle in, but the person has to be earning a certain amount.  There is also the family income supplement threshold whereby the applicant has to be able to demonstrate that he or she can support his or her family.  Ms Korotkevica might comment further on that and the WRC.</p></speech>

I will provide a few comments on access to the WRC for undocumented workers.  In 2014, the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act was introduced, certain sections of which allow undocumented workers to bring a claim to the civil courts instead of the WRC.  It created problems for migrants, such as navigating the courts process and the cost of legal representation.  In a 2019 case, the Labour Court delivered a judgment involving TA Hotels Limited that held that undocumented workers could not seek redress against employers before employment tribunals such as the WRC and the Labour Court, and that the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014 referred undocumented workers to civil proceedings to recover moneys owed from the employer.  The court found that these civil proceedings did not include tribunals, only the ordinary courts.<br/><br/>MRCI believes that all workers work and that undocumented migrant workers perform work just like any other worker, and as such should be protected by the same rights and regulations as other workers.  Consequently, they should have access to the workplace relations bodies, which are the appropriate bodies to deal with labour disputes, rather than to civil courts.  Referring undocumented workers to civil courts instead of to the workplace relations bodies creates a number of access-to-justice concerns.  Workers whose legal status has lapsed for short or long periods are effectively barred from accessing justice in employment cases, and workers who cannot afford to go to court or cannot find <i>pro bono </i>or other supports cannot seek redress against their employers before the employment tribunals.  Furthermore, no free legal aid is available for employment disputes.</p></speech>

It is good to see Ms McGinley again and I thank her for attending.  I also thank Mr. Carroll and his colleagues.  I am very interested in the training issue he mentioned and MII members' engagement with Skillnet.  He referred to "skilled knifemen", a strange term to use.  Was he talking about qualifications of some sort or a recognised training certification?  Is there an equivalence with apprenticeships, which were mentioned earlier, or whatever?</p><p>Mr. Carroll might elaborate on that.  What kind of skills and experience are required for the various jobs that are undertaken?  With respect I ask him to have a look at the Irish Association for Social Inclusion Opportunities, which works with people in Ireland who want to gain employment.  I also ask him to look at Open Doors initiative, which I am sure a lot of people here are also aware of.  This also works with migrants and people from certain backgrounds who find it difficult to get work.  Those are two options that might assist MII in recruiting people who are in the country and looking for jobs.  Will Mr. Carroll comment on the changes that are envisaged in advertising?  The current advertising is quite awkward, difficult and challenging for everybody.</p><p> Ms McGinley mentioned critical skills employment permits and it seems that she would like everyone to be on such a permit and to be treated in the same way.  On her issue with family reunification, could she elaborate and tell us exactly what she means?  Is she talking about immediate family members and does that include grandparents and grandchildren?  If a worker comes to Ireland and his son or daughter comes and he or she is married with children, how far does it go?  This is something I came across elsewhere.</p></speech>

A knifeman is one of the most highly skilled individuals within a meat plant.  He or she has an in-depth knowledge of the butchery trade and is able to debone the carcase into hindquarters, forequarters and the various cuts.  It is a highly skilled role that is ultimately able to dictate the efficiency of all the other operations that follow it.  One of the courses we organised with Skillnet was a knifing and boning course.  That was aimed at upskilling the existing resident workforce that we have.  There are various levels to that course, from award to certificate and diploma.  There is a mix of practical and educational aspects to that course.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding the labour market needs test, significant advertising is done via JobsIreland, EURES, our company website, social media and recruitment agencies both in Ireland and across Europe to try to secure labour.</p></speech>

Essentially he is correct that the pandemic has shown the value of all work, especially essential work.  The rights of a general employment permit worker are not the same as someone on a critical skills employment permit.  We are essentially asking that people on a general employment permit get full labour market access after two years, which is what someone on a critical skills work permit gets.  That will allow people on a general employment permit to access their rights much more easily.</p> <p>  One can technically change employer after 12 months but in reality that is extremely difficult.  Someone who is here on a general employment permit may be working on a mushroom farm in a rural isolated setting and English might not be his or her first language.  To expect him or her to build a strong enough relationship with a new employer so that the employer will apply for a work permit for him or her in a new job is unrealistic.  A simple way we see that people can get better rights is to give them similar rights to those on the critical skills employment permit.  That means they will have full access to the labour market after two years.</p></speech>

MRCI sent in a detailed note with eight recommendations so that is welcome and I thank our guests for that.</p><p> In the limited time available to me, I will ask a number of specific questions of MII.  I want to understand the lack of labour supply in that sector better.  From 2015 to 2018, there was an unemployment rate of in or around 4%.  We know that it will be approximately 10% by the end of this year and there will be elevated unemployment levels next year and the year afterwards.  I want to understand the difficulties faced in attracting people into MII's sector.  Do they include pay and the working conditions?  The witnesses mentioned skills.  What is the number of apprenticeships for skilled knifemen, other trained personnel and general operative grades within the sector?</p></speech>

What precise initiatives did MII's sector take to recruit?  I want to hear the numbers in terms of apprenticeships and Skillnet programmes.</p></speech>

There is an ongoing recruitment effort by plant management in every company.  We have undertaken initiatives with the Department of Social Protection.  In one initiative, we ran regional job fairs throughout the country and the Department brought people from the live register whom it believed might have the requisite skills, etc.  We are constantly engaged with local employment offices and social welfare offices as regards recruitment.  We have also engaged with EURES and attended work fairs throughout Europe.</p> <p>  I accept the Senator's point that, as we hopefully come out of the pandemic, unemployment has increased.  As we pointed out in our opening statement, though, we must see what the true level of unemployment is in the long term to determine what the availability is.  We will continue to prioritise recruitment in Ireland and the EEA, but there are strong competitiveness issues.  For example, it is a difficult and challenging working environment and may not be attractive to everyone.  We also compete with the construction industry.  When that takes off, there may be a draw from our sector.  That is the reality that we must contend with, just as our industry does in most EU member states.</p> <p>  I might ask one of my colleagues for specific figures on those who have gone through a Skillnet programme and so on.</p></speech>

I will give her the context.  We received 300 or 360 knifemen work permits in 2015.  The Skillnet course on knifing and boning started at about that time.  I would need to check, but I estimate that approximately 600 people have gone through that course in the past two years.  The Senator should bear in mind that every site has a limited number of knifemen.  They are not the largest number of personnel in each plant; there are only six or seven knifemen in any one plant.</p> <p>  Regarding wider Skillnet programmes on hazardous analysis and critical control point, HACCP, food regulations, quality control, Lean Six Sigma, sales and so on, hundreds of people go through those courses annually.  They are done using a blended model across the food industry whereby companies send three or four people or the courses are run in-house and on-site.</p></speech>

It is important to say that, in light of the efforts that have been mentioned, there should be no need to go beyond the EU to seek skills.</p><p>If those efforts are being undertaken as Mr. Healy says they are, there should be no reason the industry cannot recruit in this country, given the scale of unemployment we have had and will have into the future.</p><p> A number of weeks ago, an IBEC representative claimed the reason for the low wages and high level of permits in the meat industry was that it was a low-margin sector.

I am aware of that data, which does not break down to the level of the meat industry which he represents.  It relates to food processing.  There is an issue with regard to disentangling or disaggregating the figures.</p><p>I move on to my next question.  We have had repeated news reports on the sector engaging in exploitative work practices, including bogus self-employment.  Last year, the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>referred to workers being employed in this country through an employment agency located in another EU member state.  Last Sunday, <i>The Irish Mail on Sunday</i>referred to workers having to take on fake identities.  Why are there employers in the sector that continue to rely on exploitative work practices to recruit and retain workers?</p></speech>

When this came up in the course of last year we worked with members and we estimated that less than 2% of the overall workforce represented by our members are agency and I think the figure is decreasing.  It was higher and it is decreasing.  As far as our members are concerned, it is not a route of sourcing employment.  We are for full-time direct employment.</p> <p>  To add to what the Chairman said, there are published accounts of meat processors.  The narrative that this is a highly profitable sector is too easy.  Recently published accounts from various primary beef processors show profit margins of 0.3%, 0.6% or 1%.  They were referenced in a recent ICTU report, which is available.  In the report, which I understand was published in the past month, profit margins were itemised and shown to be-----</p></speech>

Covid is a good illustration.</p><p>It has, unfortunately, shone a light on some of the conditions that exist in our meat plants and that is worth looking at further.</p><p> I have an overarching question for MII.  The rates of Covid in our meat plants are striking.  There are 25 open outbreaks at the moment out of 56 meat plants in the State.  At times in the past couple of months, the incidences have been higher and more than 50% of meat plants have had open outbreaks.  SIPTU has said that 25% of meat plant workers have got Covid-19 at some point in the past year or so, which is also striking.  There are, obviously, environmental factors because of the nature of meat plants as workplaces and issues around ventilation and so on but there is strong evidence to suggest that is compounded by poor working conditions which include issues around no sick pay, agency staff, tied accommodation and poor accommodation that is shared by workers.  Does MII accept that poor working conditions are a compounding factor in the levels of Covid that we have seen in our meat plants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#O00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  He is entitled to his position on the matter but I do not accept the position as he has characterised it.  It should be known that an outbreak is categorised as two or more cases which can then somehow be portrayed as a big and major outbreak.  The Deputy mentioned a figure of 25%.  As I understand it, from the latest figures, there are open outbreaks of Covid but they can be very small.  An outbreak is considered open until such time as 28 days have passed.</p> <p>  To show something else in terms of level of exposure to Covid, I will point to the ongoing serial testing programme that is running in our sector.  It is important to give members the latest figures on that.  More than 165,000 tests have now been carried out in that serial testing across the meat industry, primary and secondary, across 90 sites.  The positivity rate in that programme overall, across those 165,000 tests, is coming out at 0.79%.  In the current cycle, the positivity rate is running at 0.36%, which is extremely low.  It is fair that I point out that this is one of the only areas beyond the healthcare sector in which serial testing has been carried out on an ongoing basis.  We are picking up community cases because we are doing serial testing.  If one looks at some of the recent community testing that was carried out in pop-up centres, as we have heard on the news in recent times, they were getting positivity rates of 3% to 4%.  In the current cycle of testing in meat plants, the positivity rate is 0.36%.  There are significant mitigation, control and prevention measures in place and a considerable amount of effort has gone into them.  There has been a major focus on the meat industry but the work and effort that has been put in to bring the positivity rate to where it is shows that we are in a credible position.  It must also be pointed out that we have ongoing serial testing and are, therefore, picking up community cases that are not necessarily meat plant cases.</p></speech>

Those are the most recently published figures and they state that there are 25 open outbreaks in meat plants.  If Mr. Healy has alternative or more up-to-date figures, I would be grateful if he would share them with the committee.</p> <p>  On the substance of the issue, does Mr. Healy accept that the fact that an estimated 90% of workers in meat plants do not have access to sick pay is a factor in the meat plants being a continual issue in terms of Covid?</p></speech>

Speaking for Meat Industry Ireland, it is the case that approximately 20% of the workforce represented by our members have sick pay arrangements in place.</p><p>As we know, in the context of this pandemic, to which there has been a global and national response, sick pay arrangements have been put in place.  It is not the case that people do not have sick pay.  There is a pandemic illness sick payment in place where companies do not have one.</p><p> The HSE can be asked about this and I am sure the committee will take the opportunity to do so.  Asymptomatic and positive cases have been a huge feature of this.  The data will show that well in excess of 50% of cases have been asymptomatic.  The issue is not meat plants.  As I said, the HSE pop-up centres tested in the community and found positivity rates of 4%.  I heard the HSE commenting on asymptomatic cases.  Meat plants are being characterised as being centres of Covid-19.  That is not the case.  We have put ourselves in a credible position.  I believe the HSE would back up that view based on inspections and our ongoing weekly engagement with it on behalf of our members.  The positivity rates that are now being found among the workforce in meat plants are extremely low, despite very high levels of cases in the community, as was evidenced in January last.</p></speech>

I welcome certain aspects of the legislation.  We should definitely try to get something done about the seasonal employment permit of between six and nine months.  I also welcome the provision of training and innovation, supports and streamlining.  I echo one or two of the comments made by other Deputies about increased inspections by the Workplace Relations Commission.  I do not believe large industries have anything to fear.  The industries I know of certainly do not have anything to fear arising from increased inspections.  On a personal level, I favour access to the general labour market after two years.  That sets out my stall.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Meat Industry Ireland.  Have any of its members considered using rapid antigen testing in the meat factories?  I proposed this approach to the Government as a means of opening construction.  It should be done proactively in meat factories rather than chasing outbreaks after they happen.  Do the witnesses have any comments on that?</p> <p>  On pathways to upskilling for general operatives, piece rates apply to much of the work done in meat factories, which obviously increases take-home pay.  Are specific initiatives in place to allow general operatives to progress into higher paid sectors?</p> <p>  On the issue of competitive pressures and margins, I highlight to other members that an advertisement by a German multiple at the weekend featured two steaks for sale at &euro;3.  That might tell people where the competitive pressures are in the meat game.  I know the sector very well, having worked in it for a number of years.  Is Meat Industry Ireland doing anything to challenge the low-cost sale of meat in the retail sector?</p> <p>  Does Migrant Rights Centre Ireland have any comments on trying to pursue a points-based system for work permits?  People should qualify for longer term stays here on the basis of specific skill sets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.94" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#Q00100"><p>In addition to PCR testing which has been used in plants since August, there have been initiatives around antigen testing since October-November.  We were involved, through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE, in a validation trial of several different antigen test kits.  A formal trial kicked off in January and February of one particular antigen test kit which was approved for use in self-swabbing and in asymptomatic settings.  That validation programme involved running the antigen test kit alongside the PCR test in plants over those months.  Approximately 18,000 people were tested using PCR tests and antigen tests with the results compared to facilitate the HSE and Department of Health approval of that particular antigen test kit for roll-out.  The roll-out of that kit has commenced and is being used in plants in addition to the ongoing PCR testing.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's second question regarding training and upskilling, as general operatives come in there are ample opportunities to progress their career into roles such as quality, technical and other food production roles, sales and logistics, it is worth reiterating the point in our opening statement on the inflexibilities in the current permit legislation, which limit and delay the promotion of permit holders.  It is worth teasing out in some detail.  For EU-EEA staff, there are clear career paths where a worker with skills and initiative can progress in the sector but for permit holders it is limited by the structure of the permit scheme.  The promotion of a permit holder, say a meat processor operative, may constitute a material change in their job description <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the description of their job on the employment permit, which could put the company in breach of the legislation.  For example, if a meat processor operative with excellent skills and initiative wants to progress and there is a role available as a team lead or supervisor, the permit holder cannot be promoted into the role as it would be a material change in their job description and there is no available permit for the role of supervisor.  That is an immense source of frustration for the employee and also the employer.  We ask that the system be examined so that rather than restricting progression, there would be an agreed framework whereby companies may still be compliant with the legislation while allowing permit holders to progress their careers.  It is an important point that I am taking the opportunity to raise.  Generally, there are a wide range of training and progression opportunities across the industry.  I can go into more detail on those or send on details after if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

There is a constant pressure on the price that is achievable and the margin, which often leads us to conflict with our primary producers and also raw material suppliers.  Legislation on below-cost selling was done away with some years ago.  That is something we think was a retrograde step.  There is new legislation on unfair trading practices to be brought into play, which we welcome.  In the meantime, we can continue to produce the best product that secures the best customer, and equally and importantly, to continue to drive market access for Irish products so that alternatives and options are available from a customer base perspective.</p></speech>

It might eliminate some of the issues that MII is also raising.</p> <p>  With regard to a points-based system, the position is more complicated than outlined.  Our system is a guest or temporary system so it assumes that people are not going to migrate here permanently.  A points-based system is about permanent migration.  Therefore, we need a discussion on what we actually believe migration to be in Ireland.  Is it temporary or permanent?  Under the points-based system in Canada, for example, there is permanent residency and points are applied to different sets of skills.  That is not the system we have.  It is one we could explore but it means a massive, almost ideological, shift in the way we consider migration in Ireland, from a temporary route to a permanent one.  We would be in favour of that but it is not something the Department has ever considered.  We had a comprehensive review of labour migration two years ago.  A new system was never part of that discussion so we are still in a mode that is forever temporary.  We want to see a shift towards more permanent migration mechanisms.  The critical skills permit assumes people are coming permanently.  The general skills permit is temporary.</p></speech>

It is called Working to the Bone.  It has a lot of crucial information on working conditions in the meat industry.  It states: "This research reveals the systemic culture of poor and dangerous working conditions, with employers who put profit before the health and safety of their workers."  It also states: "This sector relies on low wages to make a profit and needs to change to invest in the long-term health and safety of its workforce."  It is a truly shocking report.  We are talking about work permits.  I would be very sceptical about this Government issuing further work permits to a sector that operates in the way described.  To be fair to MII, perhaps I should ask its representatives to comment on the report.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the report.  I do not accept many of the characterisations in it.  I wish to make a point that I believe was provided to the committee in evidence in some of its previous hearings.  The meat industry, or the agriculture sector, received in 2020 less than 10% of the permits that were issued overall in the country by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  That was while there was a quota in existence.  Any permits that have been made available in the agriculture, meat and horticulture sectors have been quota based; it is not open-ended.  Even in a scenario where there were quotas, we got 10% of the permits issued overall.  It is not as if we are taking every permit that exists.  I do not accept the point made.</p> <p>  As far as we are concerned, the report produced by MRCI does not characterise the working environment or the approach of the companies that we represent, which comprise a large majority of the companies in the primary processing sector.  I do not know what way I can say this other than to say we are fully open to every inspection by a competent authority, be it the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, or the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We have nothing to hide in that regard.  Inspections take place.  I believe the figure quoted in the D&aacute;il recently was 300 inspections by the HSA in meat processing plants since last March.  We are open to those and we do not have anything to hide in that regard.  Our members do not have anything to hide.</p><p>That is not to say that everything is perfect and that we should not continue to work at issues.  All I can say to the Senator is that we do not have anything to hide.  We are open to all of those inspections and the more of them that take place the better.</p></speech>

I will move on because there is a shortage of time.  I want to take up the question put by Deputy Paul Murphy.  Does MII think it is acceptable that only 20% of workers are covered by a sick pay scheme within the industry?  After all, this was a recommendation of an all-party Oireachtas committee a year ago.  I cannot understand the lack of progress on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#S00300"><p>As the Senator knows, he have already made the point that it varies across the sectors and we recognise that.  It also varies across the economy.  It is not unique to the meat sector that there is no sick pay scheme in each individual operation.  It is a matter for individual employers.  We recognise and will engage with the process.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has announced proposals in this regard and there is an expectation that heads of a Bill will be produced shortly.  From an MII perspective, we do not have any objection to that.  We welcome the notion that such legislation might come into place.  It cannot simply be a stand-alone Bill but it needs to be worked through.  We need to see the detail around it and how it is structured and organised.  It is also important that once that legislation comes to the Oireachtas, it needs to be considered in the context of the overall costs to the industry.  We equally believe that it needs to be part of a discussion around the commission on taxation and social welfare.  All of those elements need to be brought into that process to elucidate how that particular proposal will come forward.  As a matter of principle, however, this is not a sector that has any objection to that type of legislation being introduced, once we have full sight of the detail.</p></speech>

The rate of pay for general operatives on work permits is &euro;22,423 per annum.  Is that not an appallingly low rate of pay for the hard and back-breaking work that meat factory workers engage in?</p></speech>

There is also a rate of &euro;27,500 set for the skilled knifeman permits.  I said earlier that this pay is comparable with starting points for general operatives coming in.  There are opportunities within the sector to progress in pay rates, both in experience and skill.  The Senator holds that view but I have to go back to the point that we are competing.  We are comparable with our nearest neighbours and competitors in Northern Ireland and Great Britain, as I described them.  That is the environment in which we must also compete in supplying product to the same customers.</p></speech>

I come from the town of Cahir in Tipperary, with which Mr. Healy will be familiar.  It is a town with a high percentage of non-nationals who are predominantly working in the meat factory just outside Cahir.  It has challenges, like every workplace, including a number of those that have been brought up today.  However, it is important to highlight some of the good work that is done.  There is huge engagement between the meat factory and the community in Cahir in terms of integration and bringing people together.  It is important to acknowledge that does happen and that it is not all bad things.  There is a lot of employment there for non-nationals but also for Irish people.</p> <p>  A number of speakers brought up Covid outbreaks.  It is important, when we talk about outbreaks, that we do not blame people.  It is quite easy to blame some workplaces for outbreaks but we do not do it for schools or hospitals where outbreaks happen.  The important thing is whether the industry acts properly when outbreaks happen and the witnesses might give an answer on that.  Are there protocols in place?  Have they always been in place in order that when outbreaks occur in factories, the right measures are taken on the back of that?</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke briefly on serial testing and PCR.  This is something that those who are critical of the industry have been calling for every workplace to do.  Mr. Healy gave figures of a positivity rate of 0.36%, whereas it is about 3% nationally at present.  How long has that been in place for workers and how has it been going since then?  It is something we are hoping a lot of other workplaces will bring in.</p> <p>  I have a question for Ms McGinley with regard to critical skills, an issue also raised by Deputy Stanton.  It makes total sense for critical skills to be redefined after the last year.  We have seen front-line workers who might not have been perceived as front-line workers, as Mr. Bruton said in his contribution, and people who work in the meat industry are a typical example, in that they kept people fed over the last year.  With regard to family reunification, how will that process start?  How is it done in the critical skills sector and is that exactly how the witnesses would like it to be done in this sector?</p></speech>

First, I thank the Senator for recognising the positives around meat plants in local areas.  They are major economic drivers.  Our members&rsquo; plants are located throughout rural Ireland.  They are not within the M50, they are in small towns and rural areas throughout almost every county in the country, and in many towns they are probably the main employer and the main driver of economic activity.  It is good to hear that being recognised.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the position on Covid protocols.  From the get-go of this pandemic in March and April of last year, the industry had to put and was putting protocols in place.  This was when we were all learning about Covid, as a country and as a world, and the industry put many controls and mitigation measures in place at that time.</p><p> As we progressed through last summer, the HSE developed specific guidelines for the processing sector.  These continue to be updated, implemented and checked by virtue of Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspections.  We also have a permanent Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine presence in our plants while they are in operation.  Those guidelines continue to be implemented.</p><p> On testing and timing, the HSE-led serial testing programme, which is using the PCR test, has been running nationally since the end of August last year.  Monthly cycles of testing are carried out.  The programme covers between 90 and 95 primary and secondary processing plants across Ireland.  As I said, almost 165,000 tests have been completed, with a positivity rate over the full period of 0.79%.  In the most recent cycle, the rate stands at 0.36%.</p><p> Senator Ahearn is right.  I try to point out on behalf of the sector, because it is an issue on which we are focused, that community testing in pop-up centres is showing positivity rates of close to 4%.  This testing is comparable because it involves a mix of the population, not just those who may believe they have symptoms.  The meat industry has put itself in a credible position in respect of this and that view would be backed up by the HSE.  The ongoing testing in our plants means we are also picking up community based positive results.  Our testing is picking those up.</p><p> As the Senator said, there is considerable discussion of rapid testing.  Deputy Shanahan mentioned it also in the context of the construction industry.  We engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE in pilot evaluation of rapid antigen tests throughout January.  A significant volume of work was carried out on those and the authorities, the HSE in particular, were satisfied that these tests could be used.  As has been described, rapid antigen testing is a further control against Covid-19.  It has been rolled out in recent weeks across plants, which are still doing the PCR testing with the HSE but at intermittent stages along the way.  If there are any concerns, rapid antigen testing can be deployed to get a quick result.  If there is a concern about an individual, he or she can be taken out of the site or the situation as quickly as possible.  That is the purpose of rapid antigen testing.  It is just a further tool to mitigate against Covid.</p></speech>

When general employment permit holders want to bring their family members such as spouses and children here they first need to wait at least 12 months while they are on the current work permit.  It usually takes two years to prove that they have the same level of income, their salary is stable and nothing is going on in their current place of employment.  A strict income threshold is applied.  The permit holder needs to earn a minimum of &euro;30,000 a year to bring a spouse here and if he or she wants to bring dependent children here, an additional threshold is applied in line with the past family income supplement rates.  Even if someone is successful in bringing his or her spouse here, the spouse will be granted a stamp 3 visa, which is a dependency stamp, and is not allowed to work.  In other words, the work permit holder is the only one working in the family and the only one sponsoring the family.  That is extremely difficult for the workers, especially those working in meat factories, when they need to pay rent, buy food, pay school and other bills.  To compare them with the critical skills of work permit holders, their spouses are entitled-----</p></speech>

I utterly reject the current situation whereby workers on permits here are treated like a second class of worker when compared with other employees in terms of their access to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Under head 6 in the more detailed document, a concern was expressed that companies based outside the State may use intercountry transfer permits to circumnavigate the requirements in this country.  I would be grateful if Ms McGinley would go into more detail as to the intercountry transfer permit system and specific concerns.</p></speech>

Again, the heads of the Bill are not clear.  It must be the minimum wage and the heads of the Bill lack detail.  We are concerned that, again, there is a race to the bottom and that the minimum wage would be seen as the threshold for employment, not a higher rate of pay.  It is hard for me to comment, as the Bill lacks a lot of detail in general.</p> <p>  A bigger thing for us is the discretionary nature of the Bill, that is, moving things from primary to secondary legislation and the lack of political oversight this entails.  If this legislation goes that way, then we must protect workers because there will be very little political oversight after this Bill is enacted.  Consequently we need, right now, to give workers as many rights as possible.  In order to have flexibility, one needs rights so that, essentially, is the Bill.</p></speech>

The Labour Party produced a Bill on sick pay last September.  Obviously we strongly believe that every worker should have access to paid sick leave in this country.  While I welcome that Meat Industry Ireland is not opposed to the introduction of paid sick leave, with all of the attention on the sector in recent months it is astonishing that the sector has made no proactive move to extend the coverage of paid sick leave to more workers in advance of legislation.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll made reference to concerns about tax issues, welfare issues and costs in terms of the legislation.  Can he elaborate on those concerns please? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2021041300002#V00400"><p>I do not think I necessarily raised concerns about them.  The reality is that we do not have an indication at present as to what that Bill might look like or its structure.  I wish to emphasise that while we have sick pay schemes in individual companies, it is a matter for those individual commercial companies to decide whether they may make any adjustments to the current arrangements now, in advance of a Bill.  My principal point is that we need to understand the parameters of the Bill.  We have talked here about margins in our sector and affordability.  We need to understand how that Bill is designed, what its scope will be, what the potential costs associated with that will be and how those costs are to be shared.</p><p>I mentioned that in the context of looking at the commission of taxation on social welfare, which is something that is planned.  Rather, I mean that a commission on taxation is planned.  We need to do it in the context of that.  This is not to suggest that the legislation should be delayed in any way because these things can happen in parallel, but we need to have that understanding of what the cost-sharing would be and what the burden of such a sick pay scheme would be in terms of the capability of sectors to pay for that scheme.</p></speech>

If a worker falls ill at the moment, is there replacement cover put in place for him or her?  I am really interested when I hear employers talk about the costs associated with sick pay.  Is it the case that other workers must cover the person who is ill or is the replacement cover put in place?</p></speech>

It is no different to when people go on annual leave.  It is not always the case that people are replaced for the period when they are on annual leave. Therefore, I do not think that is a particular concern that arises in the case of meat plants or not that I am aware of, at least.</p></speech>

That is a very welcome clarification because, from my perspective, it is important to understand that when temporary cover is not put in place, a company just continues to pay the worker as if he or she were there even when he or she is out sick.</p></speech>

I may not use all of it.  When MII advertises for workers outside the EU or EEA, what sort of reaction has it typically got in the last while?  Has it been oversubscribed or undersubscribed?  My second question is how many people with permits are working in the industry?  Mr. Carroll referred to 16,000 direct employees.  Between 2015 and 2019, the industry had 3,160 work permits.  How many are there at the moment?  That seems to be a rolling figure so can MII give us an idea of the position.  Also, from which countries do these workers typically come?  Mr. Ryan or somebody else mentioned orientation so can the MII representatives give us an overview of what kind of supports they provide to workers when they come here?  Given what the MRCI representatives said earlier, when people come here they may not have the language or know the culture and so forth, so does MII give them some kind of supports in that regard?</p> <p>  Ms McGinley mentioned family reunion.  Does MRCI envision something similar to what is involved with particular skills and will the representatives elaborate on that and what is meant by it?  On seasonality, would MRCI agree that there are some workers who want to come here on a seasonal basis but who do not want to be here all year round and maybe want to go back to their families for several months a year and be here for work at other times?  The representatives might comment on that.</p></speech>

There would be significant advertising done with the EURES database first and then via recruitment agencies based across Europe.  In the context of various submissions we have done in seeking permits, we have put in detailed, evidence-based submissions and company case studies which outline and give detail on the types of recruitment activities across Europe.  It would be the EURES databases, social media, recruitment agencies and prior to now it would have been attendance at job fairs.  Obviously, in the past 18 months Covid has greatly reduced the number of workers who are prepared to travel but even pre Covid we would have seen a significant shortage in the number of people coming in.</p><p>As European economies started to prosper themselves as well, fewer and fewer people were willing to travel and, therefore, that is what led us eventually to seek employment permits.<br/><br/>Regarding the number of people currently here on permits, the last quota we got was in December 2019 of 1,000.  All releases so far have been via a quota system.  Adding to the previous allocations and quotas, I would say the total allocation, quota-wise, is about 3,100 since 2015.  Of those, I would say 2,700 or 2,800 are <i>in situ</i>.  Covid has delayed a number of people coming in over the past 12 months.<br/><br/>There was another question on location.  I presume the question relates to the permit holder rather than the EU staff.  In terms of permit holders, it varies, but the principal nationalities are probably Brazilian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Ukrainian and Kosovan.  Those countries are the principal locations and while the staff are not unique to those countries the largest volumes probably come from them.  I think they were all the questions Deputy Stanton had for me.</p></speech>

Is it oversubscribed or undersubscribed?  Are there a lot of applicants?</p></speech>

As companies do not have bases outside of Europe, we avail of locally based recruitment agencies to assist in the process.  Pre-Covid, the companies would have travelled to the countries themselves to take part in the selection process.</p> <p>  The other question Deputy Stanton asked me related to the integration of permit holders when they come into the country.  There is a wide range of different activities in that regard.  One is assistance where required to source accommodation, arrange flights and travel, get people set up and provide assistance with PPS numbers and bank accounts, introduce them to their co-workers and provide a buddy system, especially if they are of the same nationality, arrange transport, and brief them on the locality.  Within the plant environment all the material and standard operating procedures, SOPs, are translated into the relevant languages that are applicable on-site so that staff are fully up to speed as soon as possible on all health and safety requirements, production requirements and customer specifications, etc.  There are regular ongoing engagements with the HR representatives, of which there are some on every site, to make sure that people are settling in.  There are numerous other company-specific initiatives whereby national holidays are recognised, among other initiatives.  There is a wide range of integration activities because ultimately it is in the company's interests that people are happy in their role and in the locality.</p></speech>

It is quite simple: basically at the moment if one has critical skills, one's spouse can come immediately and he or she gets a stamp 1g, which allows him or her full access to the labour market.  That is what we want for general employment permit holders too, but at the moment they have to wait a full year and then they have to apply and meet certain criteria and testing to bring a spouse.  When the spouse eventually comes, he or she has no access to the labour market.  That is the change we want to see for all employment permit holders.</p> <p>  I will quickly bring in my colleague, Ms Korotkevica, who wants to speak about illness benefit, which was raised by the previous speaker.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses from MII share to the information gleaned from the rapid antigen test pilot programme with me and the committee.</p> <p>  In respect of the overall beef market, in the context the abolition of milk quotas there has been quite a ramp up in milk production and consequently in beef capacity.  Does MII intend to revisit the issue of below-cost selling of meat?  Has it looked at any initiatives to try to arrive at an open-book price for meat and to get Retail Ireland members to agree not to sell below cost?  Perhaps something could be done in this area in conjunction with Government.  I recently asked the Government to consider reintroducing the beef exceptional aid measure, BEAM, scheme which is needed for farmers.  Would MII support that?</p></speech>

The Deputy referenced an open-book approach.  Our aim and that of our members is to work with the best customers possible and to develop a 52-week per year relationship so that we can have an open-book price but it is not possible in all circumstances.  Obviously, we are exporting 90% of what we produce so even with initiatives in that regard in the home market, domestic retail only accounts for 6% or 7% of our overall beef output.  We are dependent on export markets and trying to develop those best customers.  In the context of EU work on farm-to-fork, an issue that needs to be highlighted more is the true value of food.</p></speech>

I also welcome Ms Mary McGrath, head of operations, National Council for Special Education, NCSE; and Ms Anne Tansey, director, NEPS.  The officials are here to brief the committee on the provision of special educational needs, specifically funding and the allocation of resources, the roll-out of the school inclusion model and the role of special needs assistants, SNAs, the provision of autism services, State recognition of a broader range of intellectual disabilities and the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Ms Mannion to make an opening statement, which will be followed by questions from the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot, which gives him or her an opportunity to question the witness and for the witness to respond.  I will keep an eye on the clock and when the six minutes has concluded, I will interrupt to ensure the meeting runs smoothly.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such in way to make him or her identifiable.  As officials are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  They have already been advised of that and whether it is appropriate to take legal advice on the matter.  As we have started the meeting, it is a bit late now if they have not.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks by the Chair.  It is imperative that they comply with all such directions.</p><p>I now ask Ms Mannion to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

At the outset I wish to thank the committee for its invitation to officials from the Department of Education, including the National Educational Psychological Service, and from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to meet with its members today.  With their agreement, I will share my time for the opening statement with Ms Mary McGrath, head of operations at the NCSE.</p> <p>  We are also joined today by a number of other officials, including Mr. Eddie Ward, principal officer of the special education section, Mr. Brendan Doody, assistant chief inspector of the Department's inspectorate division, Ms Anne Tansey, director of the National Educational Psychological Service, and Mr. Eamonn Murtagh, director of the Department's planning and building unit.</p> <p>  The committee in its invitation has set out a number of topics to discuss today, including the funding and resourcing of special education supports.  The Department of Education continues to prioritise investment in supports for pupils with special educational needs.  Last October, a range of new investments in the area of special education was provided for as part of the budget 2021 measures.  The State, this year, will spend over &euro;2 billion, or over 20% of its total educational budget, on providing additional supports for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of over 50%, in total expenditure, since 2011.</p> <p>  Budget 2021 provides for vital additional teachers and school staff in the area of special educational needs, including more than 400 extra special education teaching posts and almost 1,000 additional special needs assistants.  It also provides funding for important reforms in the area of special education, such as the further roll-out of the school inclusion model.</p> <p>  In terms of staff resources for special educational needs, the provision for 2021 delivers for mainstream classes, special classes and special schools.  Four hundred additional teachers have been provided in this area for 2021, including 145 additional special education teachers being provided for mainstream schools.  Special education teachers provide additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs who are enrolled in mainstream classes.</p> <p>  To limit the extent of allocation disruption for schools this year, in a year where there has already been a great deal of disruption due to Covid-19, the existing special education teacher allocations will be maintained for mainstream schools for the forthcoming 2021-22 school year.</p> <p>  No school will see a reduction to its current level of special education teaching supports next year.  However, additional allocations of special education teachers will continue to be made for new schools which open for the first time; developing schools which are achieving significant demographic growth; and exceptional circumstances arising in schools, pending the next re-profiling process for schools.</p> <p>  Two hundred and thirty-five additional special class teaching posts have also been provided, which will facilitate the establishment of an additional 1,200 special class and special school placements this year.  These classes will support pupils who have been assessed as requiring a special class placement for them to be able to access an education appropriate to their needs.</p> <p>  Special classes are part of a continuum of education provision that enables students with more complex special educational needs to be educated, in smaller class groups, within their local mainstream schools.  The extra teachers being provided will ensure that the new special classes, including new classes to support pupils with autism, can be opened in areas where there may be currently a shortage of provision or in areas which have been achieving significant levels of demographic growth and where additional special class placements are needed.</p> <p>  Up to 200 new special classes are planned to be opened for September 2021 meaning that we will have over 2,000 special classes, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>Twenty-three additional teaching posts are also being provided for special schools to meet expected increases in pupil numbers in special schools due to increasing enrolments and demographic trends in 2021.  Providing an appropriate school placement for every child is a top priority for the Department and the NCSE.<br/><br/>Almost 1,000 extra SNA posts are also being provided for in 2021.  The extra posts will ensure that we can continue to provide additional SNA supports for new special classes that open in 2021; new enrolments to special schools; and additional SNA allocations for mainstream schools.  They are part of our planning process to develop a general allocation for allocating SNA support to mainstream schools.  The provision of almost 1,000 extra SNA posts to the school system in 2021 will mean that the number of SNA posts will have increased by almost 70%, from 10,575 in 2011 to over 18,000.<br/><br/>In addition to this planned additional investment, the Department has provided for a range of measures to support pupils during a second period of school closures, in 2021, and also to support children with special educational needs to return to school.  The Department has recognised that school closures can have a particular impact on children with special educational needs and, accordingly, it has prioritised children with special educational needs for the earliest possible return to in-school teaching and provided specific guidance and supports to schools, including additional IT funding, to support continuity of learning for the affected children during the school closure period.  A supplementary education programme is being provided for children with special educational needs who have missed in-person education.  A significantly expanded summer education programme for children with complex special educational needs was provided last year.  It aimed to prevent regression among children with special needs, and planning is under way to provide for a similar summer education programme this year.<br/><br/>Yesterday, Monday, saw the return to in-school learning for all school students for the first time since we closed for the Christmas break.  Overall, a package of more than &euro;630 million has been provided to support the reopening of schools, including funding for personal protective equipment, additional teaching posts, sanitiser, enhanced cleaning and much more.  As part of the package of supports, additional teachers have been provided to support the reopening of primary schools to provide enhanced substitution and eliminate the need to mix classes when a teacher is absent. <br/><br/>It is acknowledged that this has been a very challenging and demanding year for the education sector, particularly for children with special educational needs and their parents.  Recognising this, the Department has sought to support the well-being of school communities during this Covid-19 period.  In addition to its normal work in supporting schools and students, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has developed a range of resources to support the well-being of children and young people in line with the Department's<i></i>Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice.  These include well-being guidance, webinars and toolkits, including a targeted toolkit for school staff, Supporting the Wellbeing of Students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) Returning to School: Strategies and Resources.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for our invitation.  I will hand over to Ms Mary McGrath from the NCSE.</p></speech>

I have responsibility for operational matters within the NCSE.  The NCSE is a statutory body responsible for providing advice and supports to parents and schools, establishing specialist education places, undertaking research, developing policy advice and providing professional learning opportunities for teachers.</p> <p>  In 2018, the NCSE completed a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme.  We recommended a school inclusion model to ensure that students get the right supports at the right time.  This model includes a national SNA training programme, a national nursing scheme, more psychologists and the availability of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and behaviour practitioners on our regional teams.  A pilot project has commenced building on the positive results from the in-school and early years therapy project in 2018.  The NCSE is working to recommence this project, which has been impacted by Covid-19.</p> <p>  In 2020, we established 197 new autism special classes.  There are now 1,570 special classes in place, of which 135 are early intervention, 1,000 primary and 435 post-primary autism special classes.  This represents an increase of 9% at primary level and 74% at post-primary level compared with the figures for 2017.</p><p>We expect to establish an additional 224 classes for 2021, an increase of more than 15% on 2020, along with a number of additional school places for students with autism.  While we experience difficulties in some parts of the country in establishing special education places to meet the needs of children in the local community, schools and their patrons are generally very co-operative and respond positively to our request to establish special classes, and we thank them for this.  We also provide a wide range of continuing professional development, CPD, for teachers in the area of autism.  More than 35 separate seminars are delivered each year and we have responded to 519 requests for in-school support directly related to autism this year, delivering bespoke teacher professional learning in line with schools' identified needs.</p></speech>

Regrettably, I want to ask questions once again about an issue that is very prominent in my constituency.  It relates to the shortage of autism special classes at primary level in Dublin 4, 6 and 6W.  I preface these questions by giving the committee some statistics.  It is known that the average proportion of autism special class places at a national level stands at about one place for every 100 students.  Unfortunately, in Dublin 4, 6 and 6W, it is seven times lower than that, with the average standing at about 0.154%.  What are the proposed timelines to resolve a lack of provision in Dublin 4, 6 and 6W?  The area stands out as markedly different from the rest of the country in terms of the number of ASD classes provided.</p></speech>

As part of our work in this area, we examined all the primary schools in south Dublin and looked at which schools would be in a position, with the available in space within their accommodation, to provide autism special classes in the short term to respond to that immediate need.  We identified 39 schools spread across the various areas in south Dublin.  To date, a number of these schools have opened classes, some are working to do so, while others are continuing in the process.</p> <p>  Generally, schools respond to our requests to open special classes and are very positive in their engagement with local SENOs.  It is important to recognise that some schools, particularly in built-up areas of cities, may simply have insufficient space within the school environment.  It may be that the school is oversubscribed and is using all the available classrooms for classroom purposes, with no space in which to expand the school in terms of its external provision.</p></speech>

The problem is that when south Dublin is taken as an entity, the problem is not as pronounced because the percentage of ASD places per student population in south Dublin is about 0.7%.  If south Dublin is narrowed down to Dublin 4, 6 and 6W, however, the figure is reduced to 0.154%.  We need a more focused audit that will look at specific areas, as opposed to an audit of south Dublin in general.  The objective is to allow kids to attend local schools.</p> <p>  In respect of the section 37A process, is it a robust process that provides consistent results?  Is there not an ability for a large number of primary schools to avoid engaging in the process because there will not have been site visits to the schools before a decision is made?</p></speech>

In regard to the particular postal districts the Deputy referenced, a number of schools were identified as part of that process and some of those schools are establishing special classes for the coming school year.  We continue to engage with all schools in areas where there is a continued identified shortage and to work to establish special classes in those areas.</p></speech>

Star of the Sea and Scoil Mhuire will establish special classes from next September.  Those schools are both in Dublin 4.  I and a number of other local Deputies visited other schools in the area, for instance, the national boys' and girls' schools in Ringsend.  They would be prepared to go along with this but need to be given the funding to construct ASD classrooms.  What is the process for that?  The two schools in question want to provide ASD classrooms and are wondering what the process is.  Can it be expedited for them?</p></speech>

There are many issues that I would like to raise around the school inclusion model, about which I have particular concerns.  I also have concerns about the allocation of special educational teachers.  I know remarks have been made in that regard.  Many people representing teachers involved in new and developing schools have a different view of what was announced a week or two ago in terms of the allocation model.</p> <p>  I will focus on two issues.  I will pick up from what was said by Deputy O'Callaghan and address similar issues.  When I speak to parents who have children with special educational needs, there is enormous frustration and a sense that the system is, if not a bit broken, certainly a bit dysfunctional.  One would imagine that there is information on every child, particularly those who are in special schools and those progressing to post-primary level about how many children there are and how many places should be made available, yet those places never seem to be available.  That applies to units and special schools.  I want to understand how the National Council for Special Education and the Department anticipate demand.  How are we failing to meet demand?  There is a crisis in Cork city relating to special units and special schools.  Why are we not anticipating future demand?  What are we doing to fix that?  It is too common, in particular at this time of year, for families to contact me because they have no school places for their children in September or even the following September.  One family that was in contact with me had received rejections from 12 different schools in Cork and had nowhere to go in September.  The situation is similar as regards special schools.  Our guests might be aware that at least six children will be leaving Cara Junior School and have no special school places.  The Department should surely have anticipated that this need would arise.  </p> <p>  There is a specific crisis about places and units that I am going to localise to Cork, to some extent.  There may be some schools that should be opening units and have not but, overall and at both levels, we are not getting ahead of demand and putting in place the provision in advance.  I would like a comment on that.  I am sure our guests heard Mr. Gary Murphy talking about his son on "Drive Time" last week and the frustration that he has faced, as have so many other families.</p> <p>  It is widely agreed that children with special educational needs were among those who lost out the most during the lockdown.</p><p>I welcomed the fact that last year's programme was expanded.  There were parents who were disappointed with the hours that were available and the difficulty in getting through the past year so it is crucial that this year's programme is the largest and most comprehensive ever to ensure those who lost out the most are supported and given the greatest assistance possible to catch up and maintain education over the summer months.  Can the witnesses outline whether there are plans to expand on last year?  One of the biggest obstacles for those who want to receive it at home is finding tutors.  Has work been done on any kind of centralised database of teachers and SNAs who are willing to provide this tuition to make it easier for parents to navigate?  It is a simple thing the Department could do.  Could Mr. Murtagh comment on any progress regarding the new building for St. Gabriel's Special School?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Mannion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021041300002#F00200"><p>I might address the issue of students who, as the Deputy indicated, have suffered most as a result of lockdown such as children with special needs and the plans for a programme for the summer.  The important thing to reiterate is that right from the time when the schools closed in March 2020, the Department was highly conscious of the impact of such closures on children with special educational needs.  All of the steps we have taken since March 2020 have been to mitigate learning loss at every point.  It involves the additional supports by way of funding, guidance and how we have managed to support those children to return safely to school.  That has been our priority.  The actions we took in the context of the schools being closed involved the introduction of the supplementary programme.  This programme allowed for in-school provision for children who were unable to access school during the school closures.  It was offered by way of additional hours teaching that could be made available to children in their home where we had guidance from public health as to how this could be managed safely in homes or, at the request of a number of schools and following representation, on school premises.  As we provided guidance to schools that they could use school premises to offer the supplementary programme, that is an additional support that is available.</p> <p>  In respect of the summer programme, we have engaged extensively with the stakeholders regarding what worked in summer 2020.  Parents requiring to offer the summer programme by way of home tuition is something that has come across as being clearly difficult for parents.  The kind of measures we are looking at in terms of summer 2021 involves seeing additional supports that can be put into schools to allow the schools to run the programmes.  The greater the uptake of the programmes in schools, the more this will reduce the burden on parents but, importantly, it involves listening to education stakeholders regarding what they need to do to run the programme successfully in schools.  I am conscious of time so that was just a brief update of the summer programme.  </p></speech>

Could Ms McGrath offer a brief response to that because it is a vitally important issue?  There is a particular crisis in Cork.  It would be great if the Minister could meet Deputies from Cork.  There is a crisis everywhere but particularly so in Cork.  How are we not anticipating demand better?</p></speech>

The number of primary autism special classes has increased by 240% to 166 since 2015.  Similarly, at post-primary level, the number of special classes has increased by 205% to 70 since 2015.  We engage in a continuous cycle of planning for special classes with parents, professionals, schools and their patrons.  As I said earlier, generally the schools respond very positively to local requests from SENOs to establish special classes and respond to the needs of the children and young people in their community.</p> <p>  We are aware of a growing demand for special school placements over the past number of years and have engaged very co-operatively with the existing special schools and their patrons over this period.  We are aware of a small number of children who are without a special school place for September 2021 and are working very closely with the existing schools, their patron and our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>All the stakeholders together are exploring a number of options with a view to providing a short-term solution and more medium-term solutions and we hope we will make significant progress in this space over the coming period.</p></speech>

I welcome, first of all, the significant increase in staffing in this area, namely, 1,000 SNAs and 400 SEN teaching posts.  That is a significant improvement on the situation which we had beforehand.  Notwithstanding some of the concerns I share with Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire around the school inclusion model, it is welcome as well that the resources are being put into the schools in order that the schools make the decision about the provision of resources so that resources, particularly the SNA resources, get to the children with needs more quickly.  I will go into a few specifics and then I have a few wider questions.</p> <p>  My first question is very specific.  How is the hiring going?  We are looking for 400 SEN teachers and for 1,000 SNAs.  Are we managing to fill those posts?</p></speech>

I do not believe that there will be any challenges in dealing with this.  These are teachers who will be interested in working in the area of special education.  Particularly at primary level, there should not be any particular challenges in those areas.  Obviously, at post-primary there are separate challenges, particularly in relation to, for example, subject specialists but it should not impact in terms of special education teaching posts.</p> <p>  In relation to the SNA allocation, the additional allocations have not gone out to schools yet as we are working through that allocation process.  We commit each year to have those SNA allocations to schools in May and we intend to be able to provide those to schools as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I suppose the follow-on question is the flip side to that.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire was driving at it as well.  If we are recruiting 400 new SEN teachers, do we have the physical accommodation?  How confident are we regarding the physical classrooms that we will be able to provide for these teachers and for the students who need that?  Maybe somebody from the buildings unit would like to come in on that.</p></speech>

We ensure we work closely with them to allow that to happen through the additional school accommodation, ASA, application process in terms of projects to deliver that.  It is a fairly fluid situation, as colleagues in the NCSE have outlined in terms of identification of these classes, but where a school has identified a need for September 2021 and a commitment to put that in place, we work hard to enable that to happen before the coming school year.</p></speech>

I want to ask Ms McGrath about this education and professional development, EPD, that is being provided by the NCSE and by others in the education space.  I am aware of the summer courses and the seminars that are available.  Are we satisfied that that level of upskilling is what we want and what is required in the area?  Are we satisfied that those resources are going into the right areas?  How are we in terms of getting teachers trained to a high level, that is, to level 9 or level 10, in this specialty area?  I have often found within schools that one gets pockets of excellence but they become quite siloed.  If we are training to this high level, do we have a good mechanism whereby experience and best practice can be shared between schools in order that we are not all separately trying to reinvent the wheel when we are providing these services?</p></speech>

One of our remits is to provide teacher professional learning.</p><p>To give a sense of the scale of this, we provided professional learning to over 16,000 teachers in 2019.  In 2020, this was somewhat impacted by Covid-19 and we provided training to 5,000 teachers.  We have looked at and redesigned some of the elements of our programme of training to provide it online during the current school year to ensure we continue to reach teachers, as required.</p><p> We also provide our in-school support service, where schools can identify specific needs that they may have within their own community and we will provide bespoke tailored learning to that school, be it for whole-school staff, small groups of teachers or individual teachers.  That, in particular, can help to embed the teacher professional learning across the school community, as referred to by the Deputy.  In 2019, we responded to over 2,200 requests from schools to provide that type of in-school support and we continue to provide that service online currently.</p></speech>

One of the big difficulties is with recruiting the tutors who will make this July provision available.  In the context of this year, are there any incentives or plans in place to ensure tutors are available to provide the summer programme?</p></speech>

The Irish Primary Principals Network provides assistance to parents who are looking for teachers and SNAs in both the supplementary and summer programmes.  Our focus this year is to try to repurpose the provision to provide as much as possible in schools, at which point it will alleviate the issue of parents potentially having to do so much of that recruitment.  We are focusing more on schools in respect of this provision.  I hope this will alleviate one of the concerns raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

I swapped slots with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh to give me an opportunity to reread the opening statements and I thank the Deputy for that.</p> <p>  I will not be introducing anything new to the conversation but there is scope for further information to be provided to us.  I acknowledge what is largely a great deal of good news in the opening statements, notwithstanding the day-to-day difficulties that can arise.  We must acknowledge the significant increase in budgetary support in the Department of Education, in particular for the provision of SNAs.  There were 10,500 SNAs a decade ago and there are 18,000 today.  </p> <p>  Other figures provided on autism services show there has been an increase of 9% at primary level and 74% in post-primary provision since 2017 alone.  We must acknowledge these two points in the context of this discussion.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire made a worthwhile contribution on the anticipation of demand.  I am sure every Deputy in every constituency can identify areas in which there have been deficiencies in the provision of services or at least in the timely provision of these services in terms of enrolment and what transpires thereafter for children with additional educational needs and autism.  In looking into this, I acknowledge the extraordinary work done by SENOs, SNAs and resource teachers in the past 12 months.  Many parents have contacted me to tell me about SNAs and resource teachers going above and beyond what was expected of them in their support of children with additional educational needs and autism.</p><p>I acknowledge that.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire outlined difficulties with anticipation of demand in Cork.  I can look at north County Dublin and say that there are difficulties in communities such as Skerries and across the board in rural areas where secondary schools outside of Ashbourne and Balbriggan are not really providing services.  As a result, there is a significant gap in the centre.  How we identify those difficulties and deficiencies could be improved.  I would appreciate a comment on that.</p><p> The other issue, which has already been touched on, is infrastructure.  With all of these additional support teachers and resource hours that are made available to students, is existing school infrastructure capable of catering for the increased level of demand?  In my community in Fingal in north County Dublin, which is one of the fastest-growing in Europe, will we be able to meet the level of demand, especially in view of the stated aim of reducing pupil-teacher ratios in both primary and post-primary schools?</p><p> My final point is relates to the statement Ms McGrath made about additional supports being provided, especially in the run-up to the summer, the issue of student well-being and the difficulties that have arisen with increased levels of anxiety.  Could she identify a specific programme within the current offering that the Department has in place at present and during the summer that will identify students who have had mental health difficulties as a result of not being in class and the associated difficulties now that they are back in the classroom?</p></speech>

NEPS has developed a range of resources that have been made available to schools to guide them in supporting well-being at this time.  The approach that has been taken is in line with the HSE's advice around a psychosocial, tiered approach to supporting well-being.  We know that strong universal approaches that promote calm, a sense of efficacy and a sense of psychological and physical safety within school communities are really important for most students.  We recognise that there are children and young people who may need more support and we are advising and supporting schools on that.</p> <p>  On specific programmes that are available to support children and young people in managing anxiety or managing their mental health at this time, the approach of NEPS is to build school capability to support these children and young people.  We provide programmes such as the friends programme, which is a resilience-building and anxiety-reducing and prevention programme.  We train teachers to provide this programme of support to children within their schools.  It is provided to all children.  It builds the core skills and competencies of children to manage worry, stress and anxiety.  It takes a cognitive behavioural approach and children build their skills through it.</p> <p>  NEPS is developing a range of workshops on the promotion of well-being resilience which will include a trauma-informed approach.  These workshops are currently being piloted in our schools and they are due to be rolled out to support teachers, special education teachers, SNAs and school leaders from next September in the Department.</p></speech>

One of the specific teaching methodologies that has been advised in special education teaching is team teaching.  It involves the special education teachers working with class or subject teachers in mainstream settings.  We are encouraging schools to build the capacity of all teachers in mainstream provision through the use of the special education teacher in that way.</p></speech>

My main question is on access to school places.  I was horrified to learn what families are expected to do in order to access a place for their child if their child has an autism diagnosis.  The process seems to be that a special education needs organiser will hand the parent a list of schools and wish them the best of luck.  The parent will go to as many schools as he or she can in order to access the school place, whether primary or secondary.  I know of parents who have gone to 15, 16 or 17 schools.  I represent a constituency on the north side of Dublin and the lists of schools given to parents include schools in Drogheda.  Parents may also access home tuition.  I do not know any of us who is qualified to employ a tutor, whether during a pandemic or otherwise, who could adequately fulfil the needs of home tuition but this is what we are expecting people to do.  Not only are parents dealing with a challenging situation of a diagnosis but they must almost go to war with the system to access a school place.  There seems to be no absolute right to a school place.</p> <p>  I spoke to a woman in my constituency yesterday who was in tears over the situation.  She sent me a message to say her son has autism and there is no secondary school place for him until next year.  He needs a special school placement as he has moderate autism, non-verbal skills, to be taught life skills, etc.  She has been applying to special schools for the past four years with no success.  He meets the enrolment criteria for the school's catchment area but because his needs require more help, a class space with compatible peers cannot be found.</p> <p>  I know the Education (Admissions to Schools) Act changed the position and the Minister now has more powers to intervene in certain schools to meet the type of need that has been described at this meeting.  How can the Department stand over a system in which a SENO hands a list of schools to a parent and abrogates responsibility? </p></speech>

The SENOs are engaging with schools on a continuous cycle of planning additional special classes and special school placements.  Those special classes, etc., are confirmed at different points in the school year so the SENO is updating parents who are seeking special school and special class places as they become available.</p> <p>  We experience pinch points at certain times in parts of the country.  We have triggered the legislation, which was commenced in 2018, twice in Dublin where schools which did have space were not responding to requests from SENOs to open special classes.  We had recommended to the Department that such legislation be introduced as we knew we were reaching a saturation point in some areas.</p><p>This was only in a very small area where some schools were not responding positively to the SENO's requests.  The SENO supports parents in identifying where placements are available.  He or she updates parents as new placements become available and more information becomes available to us. </p></speech>

Many parents just give up.  The person I spoke to yesterday, whose case I have outlined today, has been seeking a secondary school placement for her child for four years.  Ms McGrath mentioned pinch points.  My constituency may be a pinch point, but there does not seem to be a policy determination from the Department that there is an absolute right to a school place and the SENO has to find that school place.  It is up to the parent.</p></speech>

Where the parent enrols the child is a matter for that parent.  The SENO supports the parent in finding that special school or special class placement.  I am happy to respond to the Deputy separately in relation to the specific case he mentions.</p></speech>

The experience of parents I deal with is that they talk to the SENO, who gives them a list of schools. Parents then interact with the schools which have all the expertise, language and education vocabulary.  Parents are absolutely at a disadvantage.  Schools can find many reasons why they cannot facilitate the child and the parent goes from school to school.  The SENO can be a cheerleader for all that the SENO wants to be but fundamentally, there is no absolute right to a school place for the child that the SENO has to facilitate.  It is up to the parents and the parents are, effectively, on their own.</p></speech>

We must have a fundamental overview and review of how the system interacts with parents who are completely exhausted by going to war, not just on this issue of school placements but on other issues of intervention and long waiting lists for assessment and intervention.  When they finally try to get their child through the school gate, it can be hugely difficult for them.</p> <p>How the SENO interacts with this whole process is a massive failing.  I do not know whether it is a constitutional overhang which makes the Department so reluctant to intervene in schools; it says the management of schools because it just does not want to intervene.  A huge number of families are falling through the cracks because of an inability of the Department to properly defend the child.  Defending the parents' right to choose whatever school they want to which to send their child lets the schools off the hook.  While the SENO may be a support, it is not working.  I wish the Department would accept that.  A re-analysis of the way the system is supposed to operate is genuinely a necessity in this case because the person I am speaking of, who has been waiting four years for a secondary school place, is the tip of the iceberg.  These are only the people who contact their local representatives.  Many of them just give up. </p></speech>

On the challenges he has described for that particular parent, obviously nobody in the Department or the NCSE wants to hear of a parent having those kinds of experiences.  The Department and the NCSE have put huge resources and supports into ensuring that children can access appropriate placements by making available those resources and supports.  Where we have had those particular challenges, we have had to resort to legislation to ensure we could enforce those rights for those children.</p> <p>  Separate to the legislation we have pointed to in relation to the section 37 process, parents who are refused enrolment of a child in school can have access to the section 29 appeal process under the Education Act.  They can bring that process through to conclusion, which will ensure that if a school is making unreasonable objections to taking in a child with special educational needs, it would not be acceptable to a section 29 appeal committee when the Department's resources and supports are given to a school at the scale we have outlined in order to support children in those school placements.</p><p>The practice across the Department and the NCSE has been wholly in the supportive space of ensuring that schools do not put barriers in place.  They are being provided with a level of teaching resources, SNA support and guidance that allows them to take in these children.  There is then a process whereby the Department supports parents in choosing a school placement for their child.  The Department is there to help them through the processes to ensure they can access the placement.  Clearly, we do not want to hear of cases where this is not working and we will work through, as Ms McGrath has said, individual cases.  Across the system, that is not the experience because children are accessing school placements and the level and volume of increase in special class, special school and mainstream supports to children is evidence that the process, generally,  is working.  We do not want specific cases where it is not working for people, and we will work with members on those.</p></speech>

I acknowledge all the increases in the number of teachers, SNAs, ASD units and special education units nationally.  I acknowledge the good work that is being done and in the debate today we need to be aware of the progress being made.  However, an earlier speaker referred to pinch points and there are undoubtedly a number of these across the country.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned, Cork is one of them.</p> <p>  As a broad point, should we be talking about sections 29 and 37 and the various mechanisms?  The reality is we should not be talking about them.  People should have access to a school place without having to resort to those mechanisms.  What witnesses are hearing from Deputies is the frustration from parents who are blocked in the system.</p> <p>  With particular reference to Cork, I spoke previously in the education committee regarding a new school.  Perhaps Mr. Murtagh of the building unit could clarify what progress has been made on the new school in Cork in terms of identifying a site and a building for conversion in the short term.  In Cork, we have 23 families who, as of next September, will have no place for their child who has an ASD need or a profound intellectual disability.  We also have approximately 100 students on the spectrum in Cork who do not have full access to an ASD unit.  Schools are managing as best they can.  That is the situation on the ground in Cork and services need to catch up.  It is fine to say services have increased by X or Y per cent but we need to recognise and cite the extra demand on services and the extra number of diagnoses that are made every year.  That would help inform the debate.  What is the position regarding the new school in Cork?  As I understand it, a couple of buildings have been assessed but still nothing has been recommended as far as I can see or hear.  </p></speech>

On the Deputy's first point, I reiterate that the Department does not wish to see parents having to trigger legislative provisions in section 29 nor does the Department wish to trigger section 37 processes to ensure provision is available.  All the steps and processes the Department and the NCSE have in place are specifically to ensure we have sufficient provision.  I accept the issue that the Deputy and other Deputies have raised in relation to the challenge identified, particularly in Cork.  We are conscious there are students who have requirements for special school and special class placements.  We are working through a number of engagements with the management bodies and stakeholders in the Cork area in relation to how this might be delivered, including expansion of existing special schools and looking, together with patrons, at the possibility of providing special school placements.  It is an ongoing process.</p><p>We are working through it with the patrons and with the local groups in Cork with a view to trying to find a solution.  We are conscious that the parents need us to come back on that as quickly as possible.  Our absolute focus at the moment is to be able to provide that clarity to those parents and to people in Cork as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I understand some of them did not meet the criteria, which is fair enough and is part of any appraisal or assessment.  I want to stress the urgency because we need to kick on with this.  During the pandemic, politicians of all codes reiterated that home tuition is not suitable for children but, come next September, unless a solution is found in Cork, a number of families will be facing that real prospect, which is not acceptable.</p> <p>  To move on, there is also an issue with certain schools requiring that their students leave primary school at 12 years of age.  Can Ms Mannion clarify the situation in regard to a person with a diagnosis or a special educational need and the requirement for them to leave the school at 12 years of age?</p> <p>  There is a specific issue concerning children with dual diagnosis in Cork.  Again, both of the school locations that would be suitable to take children with dual diagnosis are full.  I have written to Ms McGrath in the past and, to be fair, she gave me a very comprehensive response about the number of ASD units across the county and city.  However, as we go down through the list, the vast majority of those units are full.  If a person is travelling from outside the greater Cork city environs, given the units available, it would probably require travel to Charleville or Mitchelstown, which are right on the fringes.  There is a particular problem in those areas of the city and county where there is fast population growth, in particular suburban areas.  It is fine to say, as was mentioned earlier, that a SENO&rsquo;s role is to help people navigate their way through the system and identify school places but, from the list that was furnished to me, the vast majority of ASD units are full.  Consequently, there is a very limited role that a SENO could play, and the SENOs themselves probably feel powerless in the whole situation.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Mannion to clarify the situation with regard to dual diagnosis and to 12-year-old children being compelled to finish primary school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Mannion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021041300002#N00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On the first point, special schools can cater for children once they start primary school right up to 18 years of age.  If a special class is attached to a mainstream primary school, at the end of sixth class, because it is part of the mainstream primary school, the child would move on to a post-primary placement at that point or, if parents prefer, move into a special school placement if they felt that best met their child's needs.  In those circumstances, it is probably fair to say it is not in the best interests of the child who is 12 or over to remain in a mainstream primary school, even if they are in a special class, because that is probably not the best place to meet their educational needs.  Special schools can cater for children up to 18 years of age.  In those circumstances, the normal process would be that the children would move to a special class in a post-primary school or move to a special school.  That is a global explanation of how the special classes attaching to the system work.</p> <p>  With regard to the question of children with dual diagnosis in Cork in particular, the Deputy has identified the issue in regard to children with autism.  As well as dual diagnosis, the issue for us as a Department, in working with the NCSE and stakeholders, is to ensure there is enough provision available for all children, regardless of diagnosis, in the Cork area.  I want to reassure the Deputy and other Deputies that we are acutely aware of that issue in Cork.  We are working tirelessly to ensure we have appropriate provision available in the Cork area to meet the needs, regardless of the diagnosis for those children.</p> <p>  It is important to again reassure committee members that, in order to trigger special education resources, people do not need a diagnosis.  How our provision of resources has been set up in more recent years has moved away from the need to have a diagnosis and to focus more on the needs of the individual child.</p><p>We can discuss the issue further with the Deputy at any point if he so wishes.</p></speech>

I would like to congratulate principals and teaching staff for getting all of our students back to school yesterday.  It is great to see the increase in Government investment, which builds on our previous policies.  With more than 20% of the budget going towards special needs, as the witnesses have noted, it allows for nearly 1,000 extra SNA posts and another 400 special education teaching posts.  It is good that some of those posts are also going into mainstream schools.  The school inclusion model is focusing on SNA training and healthcare and educational supports, including nursing, psychology, speech and language and occupational therapy.  It is amazing to see how multidisciplinary it is when the supports are in place for our special needs schools.</p> <p>  The most significant issue for me is the lack of special education and special needs capacity for the area around Ballinasloe, where I come from.  It covers counties Galway, Roscommon, Westmeath, Offaly and north Tipperary.  That is where the students and children who attend these schools come from.  How are we going to use all of these extra posts when we do not have a building or space in our area in which to teach the children?  I would like to acknowledge and thank the devolved project section of the office of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, for their support last week for the provision of two classrooms for St. Teresa's Special School in Ballinasloe.  However, the school management is waiting to find out about a site acquisition and where a new school will be located.  The school has increased in size from 11 students in 2010 to 27 or 28 last year.  I ask the witnesses for a brief response, of perhaps one minute, for each of the following questions.  I would appreciate a follow-up written response, if required.</p> <p>  I will direct my first question on infrastructure to Mr. Murtagh, director of the planning and building unit.  The question concerns the status of site acquisition for St. Teresa's school.  What is the position there?  Second, Scoil na Cro&iacute; Naofa is a DEIS band 1 school with a special needs class, but it has been waiting 25 years for a new school building.  It cannot take a second special needs class.  What is the plan for this area when we are trying to move forward?  I appreciate that the provision of the additional two classrooms will accommodate ten students from September 2021.  That has been an important step forward, but there are two major planning projects under way.</p> <p>  On summer provision, I will direct my question to Ms Mannion.  The plans for summer provision this year were mentioned earlier.  We know that the programme must happen this year, particularly given the need for it after lockdown.  How much of the programme is done in schools and at home?  If it is a voluntary programme how, and in what way, are we supporting schools to take part?  Will the 18,000 SNAs that we have help support the delivery of that programme this summer?</p> <p>  On SENO visits, I will direct my question to Ms McGrath.  As per the opening statement, it is noted that allocations for SNA numbers will not be reduced for schools for September 2021.  It is really positive that SNA allocations will remain in place this year.  If this is the case, do SENO visits still have to take place in schools this year, for example, for the end of April, May and June, particularly given that we are trying to reduce contacts in light of public health guidelines?</p></speech>

I understand that it is progressing well.  I will have to follow up on the specifics of it to provide the Senator with the latest position on it.  More generally, in terms of planning for SEN provision within school planning areas across the country, as I outlined earlier, we work very closely with the NCSE on the identification of schools in a position to take on special classes, and support the delivery of that additional accommodation through the additional school accommodation, ASA, scheme.  In the longer term, we are planning a number of years in advance to identify those schools that have the potential to make such provision into the future.  That is an ongoing process.  I will come back directly to the Senator on the issue of the site acquisition for St. Teresa's.</p></speech>

It is a voluntary programme because it is outside the school calendar year.  We are engaging with the stakeholders on the types of supports that would make running the school programmes attractive to them.  These include, for example, reducing the administrative burden, streamlining the payments and application processes and providing support in the run-up to, and delivery of, the programme.  </p> <p>  Obviously, our focus in the special education area of the Department has been getting the children back to school as quickly as possible.  We are pleased children with special educational needs were prioritised for returning.  Special schools are back since 11 February, special classes are back and all of the children are back since yesterday.  </p> <p>  We are now working through how the summer programme might work and ensuring it is focused more towards school than home.  However, the home-based component is also important because it will remain an important part of the programme and worked successfully for more than 9,000 children last year.</p></speech>

We issued a press statement at the time.  I reiterate that the focus of the Department, in its management of litigation over the past 20 years and more, has been on ensuring children with special educational needs had access to the appropriate provision.  The best defence of litigation proceedings was ensuring the children had access to appropriate educational placements and provision to meet their needs.

The child has not been assessed by NEPS and is continuously suspended.  Does Ms Mannion think that is right?  I ask that in light of the fact that she is telling us that &euro;2 billion has been provided for additional supports for children.  I cannot reconcile how children as young as seven can be suspended from school because of behavioural issues.  One would imagine that all of the supports and services are there to be able to address those needs.</p></speech>

From what I heard, Deputy Conway-Walsh asked if all schools have access to NEPS and if there is an onus on a principal to refer a child to the service?  All primary and post-primary schools have access to NEPS.  What happens with regard to the individual supports is that NEPS supports teachers and school personnel through the provision of a consultation and advisory service to support children within their schools.  If a continuum of support has been put in place and a student support plan is in place and the child is still presenting with needs, often times the school principal will prioritise that child for an individual case work service from NEPS.  It is possible for a school principal to receive the support of NEPS in that instance.</p></speech>

I know a number of parents who are paying large amounts of money for private psychological assessments because they have been left with no choice.  My concern is that only those who have the ability to pay will have their children assessed and get a diagnosis.  I accept what Ms Tansey said earlier, namely, that one does not have to wait for the diagnosis in order for the services to be provided.  That is not the experience, however.  Does she know how many parents pay for private services?</p></speech>

As a colleague mentioned earlier, we have a system in place now whereby supports for schools and to support children within schools are front-loaded and pre-allocated based on the school's profile.  The allocation of that support is not dependent on a NEPS diagnosis but the service is available to support schools in providing that continuum of support.</p></speech>

I reiterate that there has been significant investment in special needs education.  It is important for all of us here to recognise that but the challenge is that children grow up very fast and we see the realities on the ground.  It may take some time for things to fall into place but we have an obligation regardless to ensure that every child's needs are met.  We have a constitutional obligation as well as everything else and therefore we need to ask the witnesses these questions about individual cases.</p> <p>  One of the requests we made was for the witnesses to talk about the EPSEN Act, which has not been covered at this stage.  A number of provisions in that Act have not been commenced, despite the fact that it is on the Statute Book since 2004.  From speaking to As I Am, one of the concerns is that in other jurisdictions such as the US and the UK individual education plans, IEPs, are on a statutory footing but that is not the case here.  I tabled a Commencement matter on this to the Minister.  I understand that from the Department's perspective that is because of a move from diagnosis to this inclusion model.  However, IEPs are still being used because they are in the guidelines.  The fact that is not on a statutory footing means that people do not have the same kind of recourse if their school is not putting in place proper education plans.  Could the witnesses outline whether they believe that is the case because what I am hearing on the ground, certainly from As I Am, are many stories about people getting very little communication about individual education plans, which are supposed to be consultative.  Are they confident that all schools are rolling these out in the same manner because leaving something in guidelines does not give people enough confidence?</p></speech>

I might ask Mr. Doody from the inspectorate, who has particular knowledge of IEPs in school and how they support children with special needs, to respond as he might be able to assist her with her query.  I can specifically answer then in respect of the EPSEN Act.</p></speech>

We conducted a fairly comprehensive review of provision for children with autism in special classes in 2019 and published a report last year and, for the most part, the quality of planning for individual children was found to be fairly good.  There were some instances where it was not to the required standard and that would have been addressed at the level of the individual school.  Overwhelmingly, however, the supports that were in place included a good level of planning for the students.</p> <p>  As members may know, there is a union directive, at post-primary level in particular, that IEPs would not be put in place for students but we are finding that is not the case in practice.</p><p>The support file that is supposed to be made available for students, as indicated in the guidelines, is actually in place.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses believe the EPSEN Act will be commenced in full?  What is the position on some of the aspects concerning individual plans, particularly on mediation and section 38?  Could I have a response to that?  I would like to come back in so could we speed up the answers, if the witnesses do not mind?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Mannion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021041300002#S00300"><p>Certainly.  The Senator has identified that certain sections of the Act have been commenced and that others have not.  The Minister of State responsible for special education and inclusion, Deputy Madigan, has indicated that one of her priorities is to review the laws on special educational needs, including the EPSEN Act.  That is something the Department has indicated it will do.  The Senator pointed out that since the EPSEN legislation was implemented, the policy on supporting children with special educational needs has moved on and evolved on foot of evidence and policy advice from the NCSE, which takes into account international perspectives and other matters.  The fact is that the model for the provision of special educational needs has moved on from a diagnosis-led model to one that is driven by the needs of the child.  Having regard to any view that is substantially different from the one that underlined and underpinned the EPSEN Act, any review of the Act will need to take into account the changing policy since the inclusion of EPSEN provisions in 2004.  The review is something that the Minister of State is committed to and that the Department will undertake to do.</p></speech>

This needs to happen as soon as possible.  I am looking for full commencement because both aspects are obviously working in conjunction with each other anyway.  We do not have the same rights if we do not have them in legislation.</p> <p>  My other question is on July provision or summer provision.  Ms Mannion spoke about an inducement for schools to provide the service in school but schools are struggling to get tutors or teachers to do so.  It is partly because there is a delay in payments, of up to four months in some cases.  I want to be confident.  Is Ms Mannion confident that this will be resolved?  Are we certain it will be resolved for this summer?</p> <p>  My point on school buildings is that many of the buildings on the schools list are for multidenominational schools.  We are waiting for these to be rolled out.  It impacts some sections of society more than others in respect of the provision of the new special education classes.</p></speech>

We are considering reducing the administrative burden through a centralised applications process, providing funding towards preparation and overseeing and facilitating earlier payments of school staff, if possible.  We are working through those processes internally so it is our hope that we will be able to streamline and make that process smoother for 2021.  We have not concluded that internally or with the stakeholders yet.  We will obviously have to come back to the Senator on that, but trying to make the process as streamlined as possible, for the benefit of parents and schools, is very much our focus.</p></speech>

I acknowledge all the work that has been done and the significant investment that has been made in special needs, and rightly so.  I share Senator O'Reilly's concern about the EPSEN Act.  That 17 years have elapsed since its passage and that some issues may have changed certainly do not lessen its whole principle.  What was considered very important 17 years ago is all the more important at this point in time.</p><p>Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the issue of children not being in school due to reduced timetables.  There has been a complete abuse of reduced timetables and I think we are all aware of specific examples.  Only this morning, I spoke to a parent about her child who has special needs and has been getting sent home every morning.  The child attends an ASD unit within a mainstream school.  There was a large focus on the issue a number of years ago and agreement was reached that guidelines would be issued and a proper monitoring system would be put in place.  Is there an update on that?  It fits in to what we are talking about.</p><p> Turning to the national training programme for SNAs and teachers, I acknowledge that the Department is considering rolling out another such a programme for nursing within schools.  Is there an update on that proposal?  Having listened to what our guests outlined, I believe that teachers and SNAs need more than the types of supports being suggested.</p><p> We all agree that early intervention is very important.  There are significant delays between assessment and provision of support services for children diagnosed with autism.  Does the Department have up-to-date information on how long the delays are at this time?  Anecdotally, I have heard they are very long.  What do our guests consider an acceptable delay?</p><p> I know of a number of parents whose children have been diagnosed with verbal dyspraxia but they had to go to England to get the diagnosis.  There seems to have been a significant shortfall in support services for speech therapy.  I know of a seven-year-old boy who has had only six public speech therapy sessions.  Again, his parents, thankfully, could afford to make sacrifices to be able to go down the private road but that is not an option for everybody.</p><p> The introduction of the new school inclusion model at the school for the deaf in Cabra meant that a speech therapist post was to be taken away.  While that has been rectified, and I know the Minister of State committed to that, it is a very important issue and we want to ensure that designated special schools will not lose out under the new model.</p><p> On the supports for schools through NEPS, while it is very important that schools have a wellness policy and a positive mental health policy, there are circumstances in which direct interventions are needed.  Are professional counsellors provided by the Department?  Is there access to funding through the school to be able to supply that?  It is very important, notwithstanding the issue of peer learning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Mannion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021041300002#T00200"><p>The Senator raised a large number of issues, so we may not be able to get through all of them in the time available.  On delays in diagnosis, I reiterate that a diagnosis is not required for children with special educational needs to access educational supports in schools.  We have moved away in recent years from a diagnosis being required to access supports towards focusing on the needs of the child.  As for the issues the Senator raised regarding delayed diagnosis, I understand they may relate to a delay in respect of access of supports once children are diagnosed or health-related supports, potentially in respect of therapies and other issues.  As those matters are not under the remit of the Department of Education, we probably cannot comment in any great detail on them.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned reduced timetables, an issue on which my colleagues in the special education and social inclusion areas of the Department have appeared before the committee in recent times.</p><p>To reiterate, we have committed to ensuring robust data collection on the use of reduced timetables.  We want to ensure that where reduced timetables are in place, they are only used in a manner that is limited, proportionate and absolutely necessary, in line with our guidance.  We had guidelines drawn up for the use of the reduced timetables and we have spoken to the committee about that on previous occasions.  Those guidelines have been out for consultation with education stakeholders but the process has, unfortunately, coincided with the pandemic.  We reissued the guidelines for engagement with stakeholders in late 2020, with a view to having them introduced in the schools in early 2021 but as a result of school closures, that has been further delayed.  Now that schools are open, we are in a position to progress this issue further.  The key message is that reduced timetables are to be used only in very limited circumstances to reintroduce a child to school but never as a way of managing a child's behaviour or otherwise as a replication for the appropriate supports that the Department is funding to ensure a child has access to appropriate provision.</p><p> I know there were a number of other areas about which the Senator asked.  She asked about progressing disability services in the school for the deaf.  It is an issue that has been raised and managed under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  It provides a pathway for people to access therapy in the wider health space.  The Minister of State has recently announced that she will be holding further discussions with the HSE about the management of the programme and has paused any changes in therapy services to schools pending those discussions.  That is an update on those issues.  I am not sure if the Senator asked about anything else.</p></speech>

My first question relates to NEPS.  I welcome that there has been a recent increase in NEPS psychologists.  However, I am aware from a reply I received to a parliamentary question some months ago that the number of whole-time equivalent NEPS psychologists currently stands at 221, including an extra 17 who have been allocated to well-being in our schools.  We know that only 205 of those posts have been filled.  Could I get an update on the outstanding 16 posts and what is happening there?  Are there barriers to the recruitment of NEPS psychologists and, if there are, will our guests identify them?  Are pay and conditions barriers?  Is there a lack of available candidates?  What are the barriers?  There appears to be a shortage of NEPS psychologists.  I have raised this issue time and again since my first election in 2016.  I was acutely aware of the shortage of NEPS psychologists in schools where I worked.  I would like an update on that and on what can be done around recruitment to attract more people into psychology because we have a need for that.</p> <p>  I welcome the extra &euro;2 billion for additional supports for children with special needs.  I also acknowledge that the budget last October identified that additional teachers and school staff would be provided, particularly in the area of special educational needs.  That budget was presented on 3 October and we are now in an entirely different situation.  Many schools and principals are identifying the lack of engagement among students as being an issue of concern, in addition to educational disadvantage.  Will any other provisions be made?  Do our guests feel that the measures and resources identified and allowed for in the most recent budget are already inadequate when compared with the increased demand for pupil assistance?</p><p>I would like an answer to this given the situation in which we find ourselves.  </p><p> The issue of reduced timetables, which was referred by a previous speaker, is a very serious one that was highlighted by this committee, which produced a report on it.  The fact that 12% of children only received one hour per day is very concerning.  The witnesses mentioned that data collection has been put in place but have any other resources been put in place by the Department to assist schools on this matter?  I would like a specific answer to the question of resources.  The witnesses spoke about data collection but is there anything else available?  </p><p> My third point encompasses an issue raised by many people this morning, namely, the delays relating to school buildings.  I have raised the case of Gaelscoil na Laochra, a school that needs to transfer to a permanent premises in Birr, County Offaly, with the Department.  There are children with special needs in that school who are in an entirely inadequate premises in Sandymount Haven, Birr.  The school is to move to a premises that is partially occupied by HSE mental health services but there has been delay after delay.  It has been going on for at least four years.  I am very concerned for all the children but particularly those with special educational needs along with the fact that the school's potential is being hampered.  The lack of adequate space during a pandemic is unacceptable.  The school is in a building in Sandymount Haven that is inadequate and there is a lack of space, including in the school yard.  I would like a direct update because I have raised this issue a number of times but I cannot get direct answers.  There does not seem to be enough engagement between the Department of Education and the HSE on this matter.  I would call for that.  If another section of the Department deals specifically with this, I would welcome a written answer on it and something positive that shows that steps are being taken to remedy this situation.  </p></speech>

I will deal with the second one first.  The Deputy will appreciate that when an individual issue is raised concerning a specific school and building project, we will come back to her directly.  Regarding the budget and funding for special education, we outlined in our opening statement that in September 2021, we will see an additional 1,000 SNAs and an additional 400 extra special education teachers on top of what was a significant increase over previous years.  We are talking about a 50% increase in special education allocation since 2011.  This is a really significant increase and shows the Minister and Department's commitment to special education where more than 20% of our budget is now being spent on children with special educational needs.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the impact of the return to school and Covid.  The Department is working on this and all the measures we have put in place since March 2020 have been to put in place resources and supports to support children who are out of school as a result of school closures in particular acknowledgement that children with special educational needs would find it hardest to engage with remote learning.  It is for this reason that they were prioritised for the return to school and that all the supports and resources we have put in place, including additional guidance, were there to ensure that when they were being taught remotely, they were able to access this to the best possible degree, acknowledging that nothing replaces the child returning to the school itself.  </p> <p>  The first issue raised by the Deputy related to the recruitment of psychologists.  I will hand over to Ms Tansey but I reiterate that all public service appointments are recruited in line with public service requirements.  In an organisation like NEPS, which has over 200 staff, there will be ongoing recruitment of psychologists and filling of posts on an ongoing basis, so this is not a static figure.  As people retire and move on, there is continuous movement in and out of the service.  The key message given by Ms Tansey is that a NEPS psychological service is available to every primary and post-primary school in the country.  Ms Tansey might be able to provide more information on that.  </p></speech>

In relation to NEPS numbers, it is important to note that we have grown from a base of 173 whole-time equivalent psychologists in 2016 up to what the Deputy rightly stated is now a sanctioned figure of 221 whole-time equivalent psychologists.  We currently have 206 psychologists in post and we have recently recruited three more psychologists during the month of March.  We have engaged with the Public Appointments Service and we are planning a recruitment competition for NEPS in this quarter to fill the remaining vacancies in NEPS.  We have managed to fill the vacancies that have occurred in NEPS over the past four years and are hopeful that the next recruitment competition will enable us to fill the current vacancies that we have.</p> <p>  To date this year, with the staff that we have, we provided an individual casework service for 5,743 children and young people with additional needs in our schools despite the restrictions that have been in place as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  NEPS has provided a blended model of service delivery during this period.  We have provided an in-school service where it is essential and possible to do so within the guidelines.  We have also adopted a remote service delivery where we work through teachers and through parents to support individual children with additional needs in their schools.  This approach, we feel, has been largely successful.  Moreover, for the information of members, our figures with regard to casework will reach those comparable to pre-pandemic years.</p></speech>

Our numbers have increased and it is not just the numbers that we have been sanctioned.  We have had an increase of ten per year and then 17 last year.  It is not just those increases.  We have retirements and we have people who resign from our organisation.  We have a rolling need to fill vacancies within NEPS.  There are largely two colleges which provide the professional training programme for educational psychologists.  These are Mary Immaculate College in Limerick and UCD in Dublin.  We have generally been able to fill our vacancies through recruitment from both of those courses, and sometimes through recruitment from the UK.</p></speech>

There are reports of considerable delays right across the country.  They heard Deputies in Cork speaking about their own constituency.  I have experienced it in my own constituency in Wexford.  Right across the country one hears these terrible stories, and on the media as well, of the considerable delays.</p> <p>  It is terrible when one hears of children being diagnosed with autism by NEPS.  Could NEPS give me a reply on the waiting times between when the child gets a diagnosis of autism and the provision thereafter of the therapeutic services outside of those provided in the school?  Is there a specified target date for providing those services after diagnosis?  I accept there is an issue with the HSE in delays but is there a better way for us to streamline our services between the Department of Education and the HSE?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Tansey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021041300002#W01100"><p>I suppose it might be important to say that NEPS does not diagnose autism.  That is just one thing to say.  The diagnoses are generally made by multidisciplinary teams that are operated within the HSE services.</p> <p>  In terms of what NEPS does and the services NEPS provides in schools and the in-school service, as we said earlier on, the lack of a diagnosis does not preclude a child from accessing the services that are available within the school setting.</p><p>As to the linkages between education and health, my colleague, Ms McGrath, in the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and I engage frequently with our colleagues in the HSE with a view to streamlining services to try to ensure that the services provided for children are streamlined across health and education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021041300002#X00200"><p>Does Ms Tansey believe the streamlining is satisfactory at the moment because many people would disagree with that and say it is not a satisfactory at the moment?  I engage with parents and, as a politician, I do not believe any parent should have to approach their local Deputy, councillor or Senator to look for these services or approach me, as a public representative, to speed up the provision of these services.  It is terrible when a parent has to go to a politician to spill their heart out because of the delay in services.  I do not believe it is down to funding; it is often down to the streamlining of the services between the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the Department of Education and the HSE.  We could spend the next two to three hours arguing on that point but I wish to allow other members to come back into this discussion.</p> <p>  A key recommendation in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response report on the impact of Covid-19 on primary and secondary education was that emotional counselling and therapeutic support should be provided in all primary and secondary schools as an urgent priority.  I have no doubt that our witnesses, as officials, have read the report that was commissioned by the committee.  For their information, these were recommendations Nos. 9 and 25.  </p> <p>  Could the officials brief the committee on any progress that has been made with regard to the implementation of these recommendations with specific reference to students with special education needs?</p></speech>

The Department's approach to supporting the well-being of our children and young people in our school settings is set out in the Department's well-being policy and framework for practice which was published in 2018 and refreshed in 2019.  This approach is founded on very strong research and best international practice in how schools can best support the well-being and mental health of children and young people.  The approach proposed is that a whole-school preventative approach is put in place that has multiple components which include providing children with opportunities to build core social and emotional skills and competencies within school settings, providing children and young people with opportunities to experience supportive relationships within the school setting and to learn through those relationships and providing children and young people with opportunities to be part of a school environment and culture that feels both physically and psychologically safe.  This is an environment in which children feel a sense of belonging and connectedness, in which their voice is heard and in which they feel supported.  We are implementing that through encouraging schools to use a reflective school's self-evaluation process in order to identify the needs of their school community in the promotion of well-being and mental health and to identify what needs to be put in place in that respect.</p> <p>  There are a number of supports in place for schools in order to implement that approach to promoting well-being.  These include supports that come from NEPS itself but also the support of our guidance counsellors within the school setting, from the National Council for Special Education, from the professional development service for teachers and from other support services.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier the very specific interventions that NEPS puts in place in order to support schools to build key core emotional and social competencies of children and young people such as the Friends programmes and the trauma-informed programmes that we are currently piloting.  Within the Department we have also developed guidelines on best practice for schools supporting children with autism.  These guidelines are currently being finalised and will be made available to schools in the coming year.  </p> <p>  We also promote student support teams at post-primary school level to co-ordinate support for children but also to facilitate links to the community and other non-school support services and our guidance counsellors also do this.  Counselling is a key part of the role of the guidance counsellor and it is offered on an individual and group basis at particular times, particularly at transition points.  The guidance counsellor also identifies and supports the referral of students to external counselling agencies and professionals, as required.</p> <p>  As the committee members may be aware, it is the Department of Health which has responsibility for the provision of counselling services in Ireland.  It provides this for our children and young people through the primary care psychology services and the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.</p><p>Recently, the HSE and its funded providers have provided e-mental health services that offer online, text and telephone support to young people seeking mental health advice and information.  That includes services provided through Jigsaw, SpunOut, Bodywhys, BeLonG To, Childline, and a range of other services.  In our Department, we support the signposting within schools and for students to these HSE and HSE-funded services.  We have built strong links with the Department of Health.  We are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including increased awareness and signposting to the range of available supports that are being provided by our colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE.  We will continue to collectively explore that.</p></speech>

It will be a significant challenge for the witnesses to deal with kids' emotions and so on.  It is anecdotal evidence, since one teacher told me that no specific research was done on this.  He said that the female students were finding it much more difficult than the male students to fit back into school because male students get back into hurling, football, sports and so on.  I am not saying that the female students do not but many do not have that same activity.  The teachers who I was speaking to said that this will be a significant problem, and not just for the next months.  They feel that both male and female children have lost out on much education over the last number of months, and they reckon that, beyond Covid-19, this could stick with them for the next 12, 18, or 24 months, and that they might feel that they are trying to play catch-up the whole time.  It will be a significant challenge.</p></speech>

Determining which student requires the greatest level of support in the school lies with the school.  That removes the need for a diagnosis.</p><p>If, for example, there are students in the school with exceptionally high ability who require additional supports to ensure they meet their cognitive abilities and so on, they should be supported to avail of whatever support can be provided by the special education teacher.  It could also involve project work or a range of other types of work that could be provided for the student.  That the student has an exceptionally high ability should not preclude him or her from accessing support at the level of the individual school.</p></speech>

We have not received any apologies from members to date.  We are joined by Senators Boylan and Higgins and Deputy Whitmore who are not members of the committee.  They are welcome.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p>For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting.</p><p> I now call on Ms Drisdelle to make her opening statement.  I ask the three individuals who are making presentations to keep them short, which will allow for more interaction with the committee and more time for discussion.</p></speech>

I am the charg&eacute; d&rsquo;affaires of the Embassy of Canada to Ireland.  In my 20-year career with Global Affairs Canada, I have worked extensively with small companies, helping them to navigate international business.  I am joined today by my colleague at the Mission of Canada to the European Union in Brussels, Reuben East.  Mr. East has been a senior counsel and negotiator in several trade agreements, including CETA.  We are very happy to be here today.</p> <p>  Although I am a &ldquo;come from away&rdquo;, as they say in Newfoundland, in my year and a half here in Ireland I have been very impressed with the warmth of the Irish people and with the resilience of my own community.  Before the pandemic, not a day went by on which I did not meet someone who had a relative in Canada.  Members may know that 4.5 million Canadians have Irish heritage, which represents approximately 14% of our population.  Just last month, Canada&rsquo;s House of Commons officially declared March as Irish Heritage Month, recognising the important contributions that Irish-Canadians have made to Canada.</p> <p>  We have a very strong relationship, which greatly benefits both of our countries, especially in the increasingly uncertain world in which we live.  It is more important than ever that like-minded countries such as Ireland and Canada work together to address global issues.  Canada greatly values its partnership with Ireland, the common approaches we take on many global issues such as climate change and environmental protection, as well as our shared commitment to multilateralism.</p> <p>  We both face challenges in our economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are both trading nations and our economic recovery depends on strengthening our global trade and investment partnerships.  Our recovery also depends on the resilience of our small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  SMEs are the backbone of our economies.  They make up the vast majority of Canadian and Irish exporters and face the greatest barriers to international trade.  From my experience working with small companies and start-ups, I know that going global is very intimidating.  Small companies often do not have the resources to do market research or to figure out things like customs regulations and business planning.  I am sure many Irish companies can relate to this.  SMEs stand to benefit the most from CETA&rsquo;s tariff elimination, clear rules for goods and services exports and simplified customs procedures.</p> <p>  The economic benefits of CETA to Ireland are clear, starting with Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;1.6 billion trade surplus with Canada.  Members will have seen the figures in the information we provided earlier.  Since the agreement's provisional application, Irish exports to Canada have increased by 58%.  There are many other statistics relating to other sectors including dairy, baked goods, textiles, whiskey and beef.  There has been a 700% in beef exports since CETA came into effect and cheese exports have increased by 400%.  In addition to the elimination of these tariffs, the other important thing about CETA relates to trade in services.  There are many non-tariff elements to the agreement in areas such as procurement and labour mobility.  These are of benefit to the services industry.  Our two-way investment has also grown. Some 75 Canadian companies have opened an office or invested in Ireland, which has created 15,000 jobs so far.</p><p>CETA presents a major opportunity for Ireland and Canada to build on these benefits and create jobs in both countries.  This will be especially relevant as both countries try to recover from the current pandemic.  </p><p> Our nations understand the role international trade can play in projecting our core values in the international system, for example, climate action and gender equality.  CETA is not just a trade agreement.  It is a comprehensive and inclusive agreement with high standards for consumers and workers and upholds the high levels of labour and environmental protection that our citizens expect.  CETA preserves the ability of Ireland and Canada to adopt and apply their own laws and regulations in the public interest such as the protection of public health, the environment and labour rights.  It supports ongoing dialogue and collaboration on these topics through various advisory groups and an annual civil society forum.  The question is not whether we need to hasten economic recovery but how we strengthen rules-based trade and increase predictability, stability and economic opportunity for our companies and countries.  CETA upholds and promotes the values that Canada and Ireland share.  Under the deeper economic and trade relationship enabled by CETA, Ireland and Canada can look forward to the next phase in the development of our partnership.</p><p> I thank members for their time and their initiation to join this important discussion.  We can provide additional information if required and would be happy to answer members' questions.</p></speech>

I am honoured to do so along with two esteemed Canadian diplomats.  However, my experience is a little different from that of theirs.  While I am indeed Canadian, I have also lived in Ireland since 2007.  I witnessed the tail end of the boom and lived through the bust.  I saw at first hand the challenges faced by many young families when jobs were lost and their homes went into negative equity and I would prefer never to see that again for this country.  My wife is Irish, my two children are Irish, we own a home here and we have an Irish-managed pension.  If that does not provide me with enough Irish street credibility, I should note that one of my paternal great-grandmothers was a Mellett from Mayo and one of my maternal great-grandmothers was a Daley from Sligo.</p> <p>  I am here in a voluntary capacity representing the Ireland Canada Business Association, ICBA, which is an Irish non-profit corporation founded in 1978.  We represent 100 companies doing business between the two countries - the core of which are Canadian companies with operations here.  It is an organisation that has doubled in size over the past six years in part because of CETA and in part because of Brexit. </p> <p>  It is the position of the ICBA that the immediate ratification of CETA is of great importance to Ireland's economy and that not to do so would be detrimental to its post-Covid recovery.  Ireland and Canada enjoy an incredibly strong business and cultural relationship.  A failure to ratify CETA could weaken this relationship in the first instance and make Ireland less attractive to Canadian investment in the second instance, not to mention investment from other countries.  Fifteen other European Union member states have already ratified CETA, leaving Ireland in the position of now playing catch-up with its EU counterparts.  We believe that based on the strong links between the two countries, as the member state that is closest geographically to Canada and the last English-speaking member of the EU, Ireland owes a duty of friendship to show leadership among EU member states and ratify this deal without haste.  </p> <p>  The Ireland-Canada relationship benefits the country in two major ways - inward investment and exports.  If members take away anything from my remarks today, it should be that the numbers do not lie.  Canadian direct investment in Ireland stood at over &euro;6.3 billion at the end of 2019.  There are roughly 75 Canadian operational companies in Ireland, which employ approximately 15,000 people.  It is estimated that of those 15,000 employees, 7,000 come from IDA Ireland companies in that IDA Ireland worked diligently to bring them here.  As many as eight jobs are created in the wider economy for every ten created by IDA Ireland client companies, so based on that, those 7,000 jobs potentially support another 5,600 jobs, bringing the tally of inward investment jobs to around 20,000.  Canadian investment does not only benefit Dublin.  Regional investment is significant.  It includes SOTI and Celestica in Galway, Greenfield Global in Laois, the Optel Group in Limerick and Vermilion in Mayo, as well as eSentire, Open Text and Irving Oil in Cork and many more.  It is unlikely that there is any area of Ireland that does not benefit from the Ireland-Canadian relationship, including those areas represented by the members of this committee.</p><p>For over 30 years, IDA Ireland has worked consistently to create the Ireland Inc. brand, with enormous success.  Not ratifying an important trade deal like CETA damages that hard-earned reputation and signals to other potential investors that perhaps Ireland is not as open to business as it once was.</p><p> That is only half the story.  With regard to exports, over 600 Irish companies exporting to Canada support more than 25,000 jobs here.  Apparently, wood for hockey sticks made in Sligo is exported to Canada.  That should be welcome news to Deputy Harkin.</p><p> Since the provisional ratification of CETA, exports to Canada have grown by almost &euro;1 billion and resulted in a 27% increase in goods exported.  Last year alone, Ireland enjoyed a trade surplus of &euro;1.7 billion with Canada, with &euro;2.1 billion of Irish goods being exported to the country.  There is no Irish or Canadian business person who, if making &euro;1.7 billion more than his or her partner as the result of a provisional agreement, would not formalise that agreement.  A point I would like to drive home is that this is a very good deal for Ireland, as it stands, as the agreement has been provisionally applied in the past five to six years.</p><p> The Canadian Chamber of Commerce and IBEC represent a combined 200,000 businesses employing more than 10 million people and they also support CETA.  At a time when we do not know the effect Brexit will have on the export relationship with our largest historical trading partner, Ireland needs to secure new export partners.  CETA does that.  At a time when the economy will be recovering from a global pandemic, winning international investment that will result in high-quality jobs has never been a greater priority.  Indicating to the world that Ireland is still open for business, by ratifying a lucrative trade deal like CETA, will do just that.  On behalf of the ICBA, I ask members to recommend the ratification of CETA to their colleagues in the Oireachtas without haste.  I thank members.  I am more than pleased to take any questions they may have.</p></speech>

We will see how we get on.  Members will have seven minutes, which does not mean they have to use all their time.  They have flexibility and I hope it will allow them to follow up with additional questions.  I will start with committee members and then move to non-members.  If the approach works and members do not filibuster, we might get in a second round of questions.  We will see how it goes.</p></speech>

With your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh, what I hope to do with your enlightened approach is to split my questions into two groups.  The first group is for Ms Drisdelle and Mr. East and the second is for Mr. Collenette.  I ask Ms Drisdelle and Mr. East to bear in mind when responding that I still have a few questions for Mr. Collenette.  I would really appreciate that.</p> <p>  I was very happy to hear the witnesses mention the moves last month in the Canadian Parliament to declare March Irish heritage month.  I know James Maloney, MP, well.  He has visited this House many times when that was possible and I look forward to seeing him back in Dublin.  He has played a very important role in the Irish-Canadian relationship at a parliamentary level.  Could Ms Drisdelle and Mr. East possibly flesh out the Canadian aspirations for CETA because we will hear a great deal about Irish and EU aspirations?  Could they provide more detail on where the Canadian Government sees it fitting into the overall Canada-Ireland friendship?  Being a little more political, what is the public response in Canada to CETA?  We know what the public response has been in Ireland and we hear regular reference to the public response across the EU, but very little emphasis is put on concerns or aspirations in Canada.  An issue that many people will avoid, from a Canadian point of view, is what would happen if EU member states failed to ratify CETA.  Where would the Canadian Government take the deal?  What are its aspirations or concerns?</p> <p>  I have a related question for Mr. East.  We have not spoken yet but I know from his curriculum vitae that he was very closely involved in the negotiations.</p><p>Many people are saying that if the deal has to be reopened, now is the time that can be done and that we should push for that.  From a Canadian point of view, can CETA realistically be reopened?  From a Canadian point of view, and bearing in mind that Canada is representative of many of our global markets and aspirations, what do the witnesses think it would say about Ireland if this country, rather than the EU, were not to ratify the agreement?</p></speech>

He asked about the aspirations of Canada for CETA.  It is true that we have been focusing here on the benefits to Ireland, of which there are many.  Many of those benefits are mirrored for Canadian companies.  Similarly, Canada is next to a very large market.  Traditionally, many of our exports have gone to the United States.  In recent years and with the Covid pandemic, one thing that has shone a light for us all is global value chains, as well as supply chains.  Canada's trade diversity strategy has definitely encouraged companies to look beyond traditional markets.  I think Irish companies can relate to that in terms of Brexit and their former dependence on the UK market.  In that regard, CETA is a great opportunity for Canadian companies to have new market access in the European Union.  That only benefits the bilateral Ireland-Canada relationship.  Part of my job is to inform Canadian companies about Ireland.  Even though it is a small market, it is a stepping stone into the EU.  It is a common law and English-speaking jurisdiction.  We try to promote the investment and business friendly arguments to Canadian companies.  The same benefits, such as reduced tariffs on goods, labour mobility in terms of the ability for business people to move more freely and access to procurement, definitely apply for both sides.</p> <p>  With regard to the public response to CETA in Canada, the agreement was negotiated over seven years, so it has been a very comprehensive discussion.  Civil society was involved throughout that process.  There were stakeholder engagements across Canada and many mechanisms within the negotiations that brought in stakeholders from industry, civil society groups and environmental groups to ensure those interests were heard in the negotiations.  As the Deputy may know, in 2016, based on further discussion with civil society in Europe and Canada, some aspects of the CETA investor dispute resolution mechanism were revived, regenerated and modernised to address specifically some of the issues raised by Canadian civil society.  This is a normal process in any democratic country when there is a new trade policy or trade agreement and that is something to which Canada is committed.  I would say it continues; it is not something that ends here.  CETA has in-built mechanisms for ongoing discussion and dialogue both within Canada and with the European Union.  That is an issue we can discuss a little more at a later stage.  </p> <p>  To deal with the Deputy's question on ratification, Canada welcomes Ireland's efforts to ratify CETA and move forward with the ratification process.  I understand the Government has asked the committee to fully scrutinise and assess CETA.  My colleagues and I definitely support that and all of the discussions that need to happen to fully understand and clarify that this is a good deal for Ireland and Canada.  Canada is confident that this is a good deal.  We will do anything we can do at this session to clarify members' questions on it.  It is vital in our economic recovery to have rules-based systems such as CETA to enable predictability and easy access to participation in the benefits of trade by all parts of society.</p> <p>  I ask my colleague, Mr. East, to deliberate further on some of the technical questions asked by the Deputy regarding the agreement and its possibly being reopened, as well as ratification.</p></speech>

I will not add much to the remarks of Ms Drisdelle except to say that I absolutely agree in respect of ratification.  We respect Ireland's deliberations on this issue and the democratic process.  We support that and appreciate that it will take the time it needs.</p> <p>  On the question regarding reopening CETA, there were at least seven years and possibly even nine years of negotiations.</p><p>We have an agreement now that has been provisionally applied since 2017.  That is a very long time in which to not only negotiate but to then have this agreement provisionally applied.  Reopening it would probably not be a light matter.  I will stop in case Deputy Richmond has any follow-up questions.</p></speech>

I confirm that I am in the Leinster House precincts.  I have to get in a mention of Wexford.  Ms Drisdelle said she is a Newfie.  There are very strong relations between my home county and Newfoundland.  There are people in Newfoundland who still speak with a Wexford accent so we have strong and enduring connections.  I have been privileged to represent the Irish Government at St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Canada and remember the history of Grosse &Icirc;le and the implications of the interconnections over a very long time.</p> <p>  I will focus on one aspect of our discussions.  I believe there is very broad support among most parliamentarians for deep and wide-ranging trade agreements, and even more than trade agreements, between Canada and Ireland.  There is no argument or bone of contention about that.  There are very few who are opposed to international trade or who do not recognise the importance of international trade for the benefit of Ireland and our historical development, certainly in the past 20 years.  The one bone of contention that has caused concern not only for politicians but for civil society is the investor court system or ICS.  I ask this question of whomever feels best able to respond, and perhaps it is Mr. East.  It relates to the issue of the investor court system, which is the unimplemented part of a trade deal that has been largely implemented.  The argument being put to us by experts is that this is a system that hugely advantages private companies - major corporations - to take actions against domestic governments.  The question being posed to us that I would pose to the witnesses is why Canada would not trust the Irish courts system to adjudicate fully, in an impartial and fair way, on any dispute that might arise.  Similarly, why would Ireland not completely depend on and be confident in the decisions of the Canadian courts system?  In that instance, and I believe the answer must be that in normal circumstances we would have absolute confidence in each other's legal systems, why is the investor court system essential?  The linked question is whether it is essential or if it is possible to regularise and ratify what is more than an important trade agreement between the European Union and Canada without this contentious element that has caused problems.</p></speech>

Who will take those questions?</p></speech>

I certainly am aware of the issues discussed in the media in Ireland around the investor court system.  I would like to clarify that the investor court system replaces the investor state dispute settlement, ISDS.  One thing I have noticed in the public discourse in Ireland is some confusion about the difference between the two.  All trade agreements that include investment protection - not all of them do - require a platform for the resolution of disputes.</p><p>In democratic countries such as Canada and Ireland, the platform provides an open, transparent facility for companies to pursue arbitration or even mediation and consultation in the case of a dispute.  Unfortunately, disputes are a reality in international business.  The ICS provides an innovative approach to investment dispute resolution and procedures to resolve disputes in a fair and transparent manner.  The process includes elements such as enhanced consultation and mediation, which were not available in the previous version, the ISDS, and that is why Canada agreed with the European Union to revise the older version in CETA.</p><p> CETA will not put in jeopardy or question the validity of our respective democratic and judicial systems.  It may not be clear that investors can, if they want, go through domestic courts for these kinds of issues.  CETA does not prevent companies from doing this.</p><p> I ask my colleague, Mr. East, who is more familiar with the technical sides of the agreement to expand on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Reuben East" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021041300002#G00200"><p>I will address the reason CETA is essential because this complements what Ms Drisdelle has said.  Investors may pursue action against a state in the domestic courts or through the ICS.  The ICS does not preclude an action before the domestic courts.  There are, therefore, two possibilities.  However, it is important to be more precise, in answer Deputy Howlin's question on dropping the ICS system.  If there were no ICS or dispute settlement system to enforce the obligations under the CETA investment chapter, chapter 8, the investor would have no recourse to make a claim before the domestic courts because these are matters of international law.  </p> <p>  Article 30.6 of CETA makes clear that there is no direct right of action for parties in the domestic courts.  This is important as it means that, absent the ICS, there would be no ability to enforce the investment chapter obligations.  This does not mean an investor cannot take action in the courts but this is usually in the realm of matters such as a judicial review or any rights of action already provided in the domestic system.</p> <p>  CETA does not limit the jurisdiction of the Irish courts in any way because it states the scope of a tribunal is such that it can only decide claims related to the substantive obligations under the chapter.  Opining on domestic laws, for example, or court decisions is outside the jurisdiction of the ICS.</p> <p>  A specific provision in Article 8.3.1 indicates ICS tribunals cannot overturn government decisions or laws.  A tribunal can consider the domestic law of a party but only as a matter of fact and must follow the prevailing interpretation given to the domestic law by domestic courts, including the Irish courts.</p></speech>

I want to make it clear that these protections are in place for Irish companies too.  For example, an agricultural exporter like ICM is in the Deputy's constituency.  These protections can be availed of by Irish companies as well, which is important to reference.  I invite Deputy Howlin and all the members of the committee to read articles 8.1, 8.10 and 8.12.  If members read these short articles, which are less than a page, they would reflect and say they would hope any company in their constituencies would have these types of protections when dealing internationally with international goods.  I invite members of the committee to read those articles.</p></speech>

Mr. Collenette briefly mentioned Wicklow.  There are very strong connections between Wicklow and Canada going back to 1847, particularly around the Coollattin estate, from where thousands of Wicklow people were sent by the Fitzwilliams to help build the New Brunswick-Quebec railway line.  This was probably one of the first trade agreements, in that Wicklow citizens were sent over and in return Lord Fitzwilliam got shares within the railway company and was paid for these Wicklow residents who were sent over.  I daresay this was probably one of the first trade agreements between Canada and Wicklow.</p> <p>  I note that the speakers all referred to the importance of ratification in terms of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Canada.  I ask whether the speakers are honestly saying that diplomatic relations could be damaged because Ireland chooses to trust its own independent court system to settle investor disputes?  I note some of the comments made already.  It has to be said that our court system has served investors well and has facilitated decades of inward investment from Canada and other countries.  </p> <p>  I also point to the recent executive order issued by President Biden very shortly after he assumed the presidency.  Within his first few days he halted the Keystone XL pipeline, a decision made more possible by the fact that the US and Canada had renegotiated investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, out of their United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, USMCA, a trade agreement which dates back to 2018.  It has to be noted that on the day before the two presidents met in February, President Biden reaffirmed his position and said it was not up for review.  On 23 February the two presidents announced the US-Canada partnership roadmap.  I will ask a very direct question.  Are speakers saying that Ireland will be treated differently from its US counterparts because we choose to reject the investor dispute mechanism?</p></speech>

I will allow all three witnesses an opportunity to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.317" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Collenette" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021041300002#H00400"><p>I will say quickly that Ireland would not just be saying no to the ISDS, but it would be saying no to the entire agreement.  It is not a pick and choose situation.  It was negotiated over many years.  Changes were made that reflected some of the concerns regarding the previous ISDS.  From a larger standpoint, does it help the relationship?  No, it does not help the relationship.  I will be clear on this.</p><p> I was asked why we need it.  The Deputy is right that the Irish courts have served the interests of the State and international companies very well here.  A couple of years ago, the Commercial Court was introduced and that was really so that the normal courts system did not get clogged up with commercial disputes up to a certain amount.  What the ICS provides is an arbitration dispute mechanism that allows parties - companies and countries - to resolve their issues.  I should note that in the text, it notes that any dispute should be dealt with immediately and will, hopefully, come to a conclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Drisdelle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021041300002#J00200"><p>To add to Mr. Collenette's comments, the Embassy of Canada and the Government of Canada believe firmly that this is a good deal for Ireland, and I would like to reiterate that.  We have a very positive collaborative historical relationship.  In terms of what my colleagues said earlier, the ratification process is really a matter for each member state of the European Union and we fully respect the democratic process and the consultations, such as we are having today, that must happen for that.  We are very confident this is a good deal for Ireland.</p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on why the ICS was not part of some other trade agreements, every trade agreement is based on each party's interests and, in this case, Canada agreed with the European Union's request to modernise the investor dispute platform within CETA.  This is not always the case with other partners and conditions are quite different in other situations.  This is a new, innovative approach.  CETA does set a precedent.  It is a gold star free trade agreement that encompasses more than just trade.</p> <p>  I reiterate that I have no concerns, and Canada has no concerns, that this will be damaging to Ireland, its democratic process, the rights of its citizens or the right of the State to regulate in its own interest.</p></speech>

Canada certainly respects the Irish court system and Canadians are very proud, rightly so, of the Canadian court system.  Nothing in CETA precludes an investor from pursuing a case before the domestic courts under the domestic law, as it provides.  As I, hopefully, explained earlier, without recourse to an ICS and to that system, there would be no recourse, essentially, for an investor in regard to the obligations under the investment chapter, and one could not argue, for example, a breach of national treatment before the Canadian courts pursuant to the investment chapter.  It is really important for Canada that our investors have the same type of recourse abroad as they would have domestically, so, for us, it is really important to have these core obligations to go with it and the ability to enforce those obligations.  That is what the ICS does.  Certainly, we are very proud of our domestic system and Ireland is rightly proud of its own domestic system for the courts, but this aspect of recourse is quite important.</p></speech>

My family home is in Kildare and I have Canadian neighbours, so I am aware at first hand of how Canadians built up our county.  Some time ago I had the privilege of leading a trade mission to Peterborough in Canada where there were street names such as Cavan Street, Donegal Street - which will be music to the ears of our Chair - and Monaghan Street.  I had heard all about it but I was taken aback by the sheer deep mutual respect our countries have.  Of course, Monaghan is twinned with Prince Edward Island.  As all that is a given, what I will say next I say safely to our good friends, because that deep friendship is so unflinching that I have no deep worries about agreeing to disagree with Canada on this.</p><p>Ms Drisdelle spoke about predictability being very important in agreements, and I fully agree, but is it absolutely necessary to have that in the form of an arbitration option in the investor state courts, although that is an option?  She also said that a platform is required for disputes and of course it is.  She also said that enhanced mediation is really important and of course it is and the Irish courts do that.  I have reservations.  I am a fan and advocate of arbitration.  Many years ago I became a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.  It has a vital role to play and I would like to see it play a much more enhanced role in our country.  However, allowing a foreign corporation to sue a sovereign state in a situation where a case is heard outside the state's legal system is not something that I support.  Of course it does not overturn our Government's decisions.  If the witnesses are trying to give me succour by saying that, we would have lost our independence if that was true.  However, I would be in dereliction of my duties if I was so blinded by the deep mutual respect and love we have for our countries not to point out the elephant in the room.  I know this morning's discussion is not a legal examination but I am asking the witnesses whether, were they able to turn back the clock, it was absolutely necessary to usurp the role of the Irish courts.  I believe the Canadian courts are just as good.  They are tried and tested.  They operate and exercise their judgments without fear or favour and have been tested before.  Their integrity and competency is beyond question.  It was a safe bet.  Why give them up?</p><p>I know the economic benefits, which have been highlighted in compelling and stark terms.  They are hugely attractive but I must speak as a public representative who values our country's sovereign and constitutional courts.  The witnesses can say that it is an option but everyone knows that the selling point of arbitration, and one of its hallmarks, is that it is private and confidential.  I do not want my country in a private and confidential dispute; I want transparency.  Everyone knows that arbitration, even this kind of advanced, non-<i>ad hoc</i>type, is binding and cannot be reopened.  One only litigates on it to enforce it or, in a rare exception, to try to annul it.  It is hugely difficult to get into an arbitration hearing.  We have safeguards in this country and in the celebrated democracy in Canada.  Why this one-size-fits-all approach?  Why stir things - I ask that with the upmost respect - when it could have been done in a way that all would have embraced, including me?  Why go that extra yard to cause this sacrificial, unnecessary tension when we could have had just as good a deal with the same amazing celebration of our mutual economic benefits without it?  I accept it is not quite a one-way street and that Ireland had done well.  I say &quot;thank you very much&quot; to our brothers and sisters in Canada.</p><p>We love them but we do not like private, unaccountable, confidential dispute hearings involving our country when they are not absolutely necessary.  I thank the witnesses.  I hope that I balanced my comments with my unequivocal respect for the economic benefit but, most importantly, for Canada.  It is up there.  I have seen the love that our country has received, the way it is treated in Canada by leading that trade delegation.  I have also seen that Canada is very independent and non-judgmental.  I am sure that we will agree to disagree on this issue.  We have different views but it does not, and should never, affect our overall super relationship.</p></speech>

I fully understand that this is an open discussion and as the Senator said, we can safely discuss the issues.  I appreciate his thoughts.<br/><br/>The Senator mentioned safeguards and talked about transparency.  Those are exactly the things that are built into the ICS system.  The ICS specifically and intentionally outlines the processes and details and it is done in a way that is more transparent than the older <i>ad hoc</i>system of arbitration.  Again, we are not questioning the validity of our domestic courts but it is essentially why the EU asked Canada for a revised and modernised system for arbitration.  <br/><br/>In respect of safeguards, there are very specific elements which are untouchable and on which the member state or Ireland has a right to regulate in its own area.  This includes elements like public health, safety, environment, climate and labour.  These are elements that are outside of the areas that would be considered eligible for debate and a claim within the ICS.  I ask my colleague, Mr. East, to elaborate further on that point.</p></speech>

Some of the concerns outlined by Senator Martin have not only been acknowledged but addressed, in the reformed ICS system.  Some of those areas include not only the right to regulate that is across the agreement that the charg&eacute; d'affaires, Ms Drisdelle, mentioned, but a new permanent, transparent and institutionalised dispute settlement tribunal system that is quite different to the traditional commercial arbitration system, because, for example, it no longer includes the ability to have <i>ad hoc</i>tribunal members.  There is a roster of members that the states appoint themselves.  The investors have no say in this, unlike under the <i>ad hoc</i>system.  There are enhanced ethical requirements in a strict code of conduct that is quite innovative and goes beyond many of the old-style pieces in this area.<br/><br/>Senator Martin mentioned the limited right of appeal.  I believe that he referred to it as an annulment.  I acknowledge that under any of the old ISDS systems, such as cases taken under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, system, there is a very narrow right of appeal but it is very different under CETA.  Indeed, the appellant system that was created provides very broad grounds of appeal.  Therefore, it is quite innovative.  A tribunal can uphold, modify or reverse an award.</p><p>I would argue that this is an example of the reformed system that Canada and the EU were trying to accomplish with this new investment court system, ICS.  <br/><br/>On transparency, we very much appreciate and acknowledge those concerns but hearings are, by default, open and documents are accessible to all.  There is also an ability for non-disputing parties to make submissions as <i>amicus curiae</i>.There are actually quite a few reforms as well, to have a very transparent system.</p></speech>

I am from County Louth, where we have the Thomas D'Arcy McGee Summer School in Carlingford.  The last time we were lucky enough to be able to go to events, I was there and met General John de Chastelain.  Obviously there are very close relationships between Ireland and Canada and I do not think that decoupling ISDS from any particular trade deal is necessarily going to impact on that greatly.</p> <p>  There is a belief that with ICS and CETA, we are undermining the chances of a UN multilateral dispute mechanism, which could have all of the benefits to which people have referred.  In fairness, the benefits in relation to trade and increasing trade relate to the fact that the deal has been done and is in operation outside of the ICS.  The French are openly talking about pulling out of the Energy Charter Treaty because it is hampering climate action.  We know that the Dutch and others are being sued at the minute.  We are seeing moves away from ISDS.  Under the previous US Administration, the ISDS element of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, was renegotiated between the US and Canada and has practically been abolished in the new agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico.  President Biden's Administration seems to be following the same approach and is on the record regarding its opposition to including such ISDS provisions in future trade agreements.  To a degree, it looks like we have moved away from it.  I accept that tribunals are not necessarily going to change law but am worried about the chilling effect.  The example we keep hearing about is the Philip Morris case and the fact it not only had an impact where it was taken, in Australia, but also had a huge impact in countries like New Zealand, which did not operate the same legislation for almost six and a half years.  It is that chilling effect that worries me.  In 2028 New Zealand's Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Mr. David Parker, announced that his Government had signed letters of agreement with five other countries that were party to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, CPTPP, to exclude compulsory ISDS and a further arrangement was made bilaterally with Canada to restrict the use of ISDS.  </p> <p>  SMEs were mentioned earlier but I think we all accept that what we are talking about here is big companies and corporations.  I would like the witnesses to give an example of the direct right of action that a company does not have currently but would have under this agreement.  Could that include, for example, an energy company that is impacted by a change in the law here, introduced from the point of view of the public good, banning the import of fracked gas?  That might have an impact on an energy company, which might be able to take us over the coals and sue us.  Would we be leaving ourselves hamstrung and open on the basis of ISDS?  </p> <p>  It looks like a significant number of EU countries are in no rush to ratify this deal.  Like a lot of deals, it may be the case that this element is never actually ratified and we just continue on, as is.  </p></speech>

I invite members to read Article 8.10 of the relevant section in CETA.  We are not just talking about multinationals, we talking about all companies that could avail of this.  Consider a company from County Louth, for example, that employs people in the Deputy's constituency.  Does he not believe that they should have the same rights to an open and fair arbitration in order to resolve a dispute in Canada?  I guess that is really my question to the Deputy.  I invite him to read Articles 8.10 and 8.12.  It is my understanding that the worst-case scenario is that a fair market value is attributed to any decision, which I do not believe seems unreasonable in any way.</p></speech>

The fear is that if the State wants to introduce legislation, it has the chilling effect on the basis that the State has left itself open to being sued because the corporation has the legitimate expectation of profit.  While that is fine, if we want to introduce legislation for the public good, for example on climate change or anything else, we certainly do not want it hampered by this.</p> <p>  It has also been said by many others that this State, Canada and the European Union, already have a number of courts systems that are fit for purpose.  We are not talking about rogue legal states.  A number of trade deals have been drawn up in the past while and there seems to be a move away and a decoupling from ISDS.  I note that even Canada has been involved in some of these.  Perhaps we need a wider arbitration system but it should be done on a global basis with all those protections to protect from the chilling effect.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the Energy Charter Treaty.  Canada is not a party to that treaty.  If there are any cases due to the Energy Charter Treaty, it could not come from a Canadian company.</p> <p>  To pick up on the point made by Mr. Collenette regarding Canadian SMEs, while I do not have the exact figure for Canadian SMEs operating in Ireland, I am aware that 88% of Canadian exports to Ireland are from SMEs.  It would not surprise me if there was a similarly high number.  I also heard the ministers at the CETA joint committee in March state that 99% of Canadian and EU companies using CETA are SMEs.  Actually there is a very high number of SMEs using it; it is not necessarily just large corporations.</p> <p>  On the concerns about decisions of the Irish Government or court decisions, CETA is quite clear that the ICS cannot overturn a decision of the Irish courts and cannot overturn an Irish law of any kind.  That is quite important.</p> <p>  We are aware of the concerns about the old ISDS system and the Deputy mentioned the Philip Morris case in that regard.  This is a very different system that actually took those concerns to heart.  I was one of the negotiators on this treaty and I worked very closely with my EU counterparts.</p><p>We heard about these decisions and concerns and did our best to alleviate those concerns by coming up with a reformed ICS that is meant to be something that would not go against a multilateral investment court but, rather, complement it.  It is a stepping stone and CETA makes mention of this.  One does not preclude the other.  In fact, it is our hope that it will be a good example when it is put in place of how a reformed ICS can work.  We are very hopeful on the multilateral investment court front, but that is some years away, I think.</p></speech>

They are very useful and have been very informative to me.  I note and welcome this shared agreement for all the reasons outlined.  However, I am interested in understanding and I think the reason we are here today is to understand, at least for me it is.  I understand we do not have these types of agreements with the US or the UK in respect of legal disputes and we have carried out trade with them for decades.  This implies that the Canadian and Irish courts are not fit for purpose in the context of disputes.  Considering that my questions have been asked by previous speakers and considering trust between countries, I have an alternative question.  Is it possible to give examples of the types of disputes that might come up, considering so many are prohibited, as noted here today, including with regard to the environment, etc.  The worry is that we hear sovereign states are being sued for billions by corporations across the globe.  I say this considering we are a small open economy in which some multinational companies have bigger pockets than the State.  I would be very grateful if the witnesses could give some examples of disputes that might come up because that would help me understand.  We are, as I said, a small economy and if someone tries to sue us for billions of euro, it will seriously affect our economy.</p></speech>

It is hard to speculate exactly on the cases that would come before the ICS, but what I can say is that the ICS was designed in response to concerns about the old ISDS system.  I speak from experience because I have argued these cases for Canada under the old ISDS system.  I am aware of what it is like to operate in that system and what these reforms might do for a state in trying to defend these claims.  Let me point out a few things that are absent in the old ISDS system but present in the CETA ICS.</p><p>One is specific direction in the text.  There are many examples.  I know we have referred often to the right to regulate but this is not an empty piece of text.  When the parties put in something powerful such as the right to regulate and various other directions, these are directions to a tribunal about how to interpret the treaty.  One starts with the text when interpreting the treaty and every tribunal member has to do that.  The parties were quite deliberate in putting in this type of language.  That is why one sees so many instances of clear language about the right to regulate.</p><p> The second point is that there were instances under the old system with cases that were essentially frivolous in nature but were attempting to sue for high amounts in damages.  These are sometimes referred to as frivolous claims.  Under the old system, there are not necessarily provisions to deal with that.  Under CETA, there are two provisions to deal with that specifically.  One is that there is a specific provision to deal with frivolous claims.  The second is about when they can be dealt with.  A claim can be dismissed by a tribunal before the first hearing.  This is essentially the consultations phase.  It is not even a formal claim yet, but the claim can be dismissed.  Under that circumstance, it saves the state money and perhaps awards against the investor in a frivolous claims example.</p><p> There are two other safeguards.  Parties have an ability under the CETA investment court system to issue joint interpretations.  This is powerful because it can be on any part of the agreement.  This can also happen at the consultations phase.  The parties can issue a joint interpretation very early, not even at the formal stage yet, to clarify the meaning of a particular text, whether it is about the environment, labour regulations or such.  Those joint interpretations are binding for the tribunals in future, which is important.</p><p> There is usually is not a real ability to appeal a case.  Under the ICS, there is an appellate system which has broad grounds of appeal.  This is different from the old ISDS model where there were usually narrow grounds to try to annul a case.  I hope that helps the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am grateful for their attendance.  I will not reiterate what others have said about the ISDS system in general.  Am I right in thinking that a US company could, by making an investment through a Canadian subsidiary, attract protections under CETA that would not exist if it was a direct investor in Ireland?</p></speech>

CETA does not allow enterprises from third countries to benefit from CETA's investment dispute resolution provisions simply because they have some activities in Canada or the EU, as the case may be.  It is not in Canada's interest to provide CETA's benefits to third countries.  We would like Canadian and European companies to have a competitive advantage over third countries under this agreement.  I will illustrate with an example of an Irish investor operating in Canada.  CETA's investment provisions would offer protection to an Irish investor or enterprise that is established in Canada or owned or controlled by an Irish enterprise or, third, can demonstrate that it has substantial business activities in Canada.</p><p>That aspect is very novel under the ICS system.  This means that an Irish company which was owned or controlled by, for example, a US investor, would be precluded from bringing a case forward or if it were still owned or controlled by an Irish investor but were merely a letterbox company, as they sometimes call them, it would also not have substantial business activities and would be precluded from bringing a case forward.</p></speech>

There are substantial companies created and established in Canada that have American shareholders.  I think those American shareholders can decide to operate through their own companies when investing in Ireland or through a Canadian company which has a real connection to Canada.  In those cases - not letterbox cases - is there effectively a back door for multinationals, which are established on both sides of the US-Canadian border, to cherry-pick and take advantage of investing through an established Canadian company?  That kind of protection would not be afforded by Ireland to an American company or by America to Ireland under existing trading arrangements.</p></speech>

One would need to look at the exact scenario to make a determination.  The tests that I have outlined are quite clearly set out in CETA to guide tribunals in that.  However, they are designed with the intent of barring those trying to access this agreement through a back door, as the Senator referred to it.  The agreement is designed to assist Canadian and EU companies, in this case Irish companies, and not third country companies.<br/><br/>If there is a bona fide a Canadian company with substantial operations, that investor or that enterprise has a right of action.  However, a US shareholder, as I think the Senator was describing, would itself not have that ability.  It would need to have access through another agreement.  It is really the Canadian company that can bring an action under that scenario.  We are trying to protect such a Canadian company, or an Irish company the other way around, not a US shareholder <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

I join others in acknowledging the close economic, cultural and social relations between our two countries.  Long may they continue.</p> <p>  Following the presentations, my takeaway points are as follows.  Ireland has a &euro;1.6 billion trade surplus with Canada.  Since CETA was provisionally applied, Irish exports to Canada have increased by 58%.  Those are significant statistics.  I thank the speakers, particularly Mr. Collenette and Mr. East, for the clarity they have given regarding the competencies of the domestic courts versus the competencies of the investor court system.  That is certainly something the committee should take away from this discussion.</p> <p>  Given Mr. East's experience with international trade agreements generally, were this trade agreement to fall as a result of the EU not ratifying it, how practical would a renegotiation be?</p><p>Obviously, this deal has been many years in the making.  Would it effectively signal the end of the trade agreement in real practical terms?</p><p> I have another point to make to Ms Drisdelle.  This trade agreement has to be ratified by the parliaments of all EU states, and some regional parliaments within certain states, so there is still a bit to go in respect of it.  Even a regional parliament could throw the deal out and cause the whole thing to fall.  Is that something about which the Canadian Government is concerned?  Is it proactive in selling the benefits of this agreement in the other EU states?  Is the Canadian Government conscious of this issue and is it being proactive about it in other EU states, because it may be that Ireland will not have to deal with this issue at all if some regional parliament rejects the agreement?</p></speech>

There is a lot of news in the media today.  It does not always trickle down.  It is a comprehensive agreement.  Even here in Ireland, we have reached out to many organisations across the country, including chambers of commerce, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and several business associations in the areas of meat, dairy, whiskey, spirits, food and beverages, to understand the needs of Irish companies but also to ensure that small companies in particular are aware of the benefits of CETA.  The Government is absolutely behind the benefits to Europe and to Canadian companies and it has an interest in making sure that is communicated to companies on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>  With regard to ratification, this is a complex and comprehensive agreement.  We definitely respect the democratic process of each member state and the discussions that form part of those.  As was alluded to earlier, if we are talking about opening it up again, I will say that this is not the time to throw away this opportunity.  Right now, Ireland faces the impact of Brexit and needs to address the economic recovery.  This is absolutely the time to use frameworks such as CETA to enable companies across all sectors, and especially small companies, to build resilience.  As part of our outreach, we spoke to Irish whiskey producers and to the Irish whiskey organisations.  Through audits and complementary dialogue and through CETA, they uncovered pricing issues in Canada that were resolved as of 1 April this year because of CETA.  Irish whiskey is now more competitively priced in many Canadian provinces because CETA allowed that to happen.  There are many other benefits, including benefits for the meat and dairy industries.  The data speak for themselves.</p> <p>  This is not the time to consider reopening such a comprehensive agreement.  Canada and the EU, including Ireland, are very like one another in our shared values and common approaches.  If we cannot figure out a way to create a structure and framework for trading, who else can?  We are aligned and like-minded.  This negotiated arrangement is based on our common values.  We have addressed many of the issues that have been raised and we continue to do so.  I refer to issues involving labour and the environment.  The Canadian Government and Canada are definitely behind this.  We allow member states to carry out their own democratic processes for ratification.  I hope that answer's the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Maybe I will start with the appeals mechanism the Senator asked about.  As I understand it, the Senator asked to where does one make an appeal.  The answer is that there is an appellant system in the investment court system, ICS, itself.  The parties appoint to a roster members to be on that tribunal.  In other words, there is a tribunal at first instance and in the event of an appeal, it goes to the appellate tribunal under the system itself.</p></speech>

For example, in Canada, it is an open call.  It is an open and transparent system.  One can apply to be a member.  Of course, there is a series of attributes that one looks for in arbitrators - knowledge of public international law, experience as a judge and things of this ilk that would make one qualified.  That becomes a permanent system in the sense that the arbitrators are paid a stipend for that as opposed to on a case-by-case basis and that can turn into a salaried system.  The idea is one has a permanent system of both at first instance and appellate tribunal.  I hope that answers that question.  If the Senator could repeat for me the first question she asked because there was something there too that I should answer.</p></speech>

Under Article 8.9, paragraph 2, "the mere fact that a Party regulates, including through a modification to its laws, in a manner which negatively affects an investment or interferes with an investor's expectations, including its expectations of profits, does not amount to a breach of an obligation under" the agreement.  That is a clear direction to a tribunal on how to interpret that.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Keogan as I was hoping somebody would ask this question.  It is one of the technical areas I am more familiar with.  When we were engaged with several Irish business groups last fall, this issue came up, and especially with regard to Irish cream liqueur which has a protected geographic indication in Canada.  We engaged several legal counsel and lawyers in Brussels and Canada to help Irish producers understand how they can action their geographic indication, GI, protection in Canada.  What came out of that discussion - we reached out directly and had a round-table with several producers - is that the EU system for geographic indications is different from Canada's and there had been an understanding that it worked the same way.  It is through our intellectual property, IP, system in Canada and it requires the producer to action its rights under the geographic indication.</p><p>For example, with Irish cream liqueur, what is required is for those producers to produce a cease and desist letter or to address the matter with producers in Canada.  GIs are not very common in Canada and we are not as familiar with them.  We do not have a history, as the European Union does, with GIs.  This is why, in many cases, it would be just a matter of informing producers in Canada, who may not even be aware that they are imitating something that is protected, such as Irish cream liqueur in this case.  In many jurisdictions where this has been the case and a letter was sent to the producer in Canada, it usually helped in over 80% of the cases.</p><p> This is an area in which we are well versed.  We are very keen to ensure that Irish producers take advantage of this and as has been mentioned, there are others that will probably request GI protection.  We would be very pleased to work with producers to help them understand the Canadian system so they can action their rights under that system.</p></speech>

Not only does CETA not prevent countries from creating or changing their laws, it specifically states that a covered investment can be nationalised or expropriated on a number of bases, including the public purpose, under due process of law and in a non-discriminatory manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021041300002#T00300"><p>I thank the witnesses.  I have heard that Canada and Ireland are like-minded.   I had the privilege, when I was an MEP, of working with Ms Maude Barlow, the chair of the Council of Canadians, and speaking with representatives from Canadian trade unions who had concerns about CETA.  I do not wish to tell the committee how to do its business but it would be interesting to hear from the Council of Canadians.</p> <p>  My questions are for Mr. Collenette in particular.  I had a look at the membership of the ICBA advisory council.  In the interests of transparency, we know Irving Oil, a Canadian oil and gas company, has a refinery in Cork.  Vermilion Energy is now the main shareholder of the Corrib gas field operation, with almost &euro;700 million worth of assets in that field.  Vermilion is also the company that threatened the then French environment minister, Mr. Nicolas Hulot, with a billion dollar lawsuit when he wanted to phase out oil and gas.  The chilling effect of that legal threat meant that the French Government changed its plans and decided to not phase out oil and gas until after 2040.  It is also worth noting the language used by Vermilion in that threat to the French Government is similar to the language used in Article 8.10 of CETA, which concerns the right to fair and equitable treatment.  It is also correct that under Article 8.10.2(f), there can be an amendment post-ratification as to what constitutes fair and equitable treatment.</p> <p>  Another advisory council member is the law firm of Arthur Cox. Its website refers to the successful defence of multiple judicial reviews against the Corrib gas fields.  The advisory council has quite a number of other law firms, including William Fry, corporate lawyers for dispute resolution for oil and gas development, and Pinsent Masons, which is one of the top 100 law firms in the world, with energy again listed as a specialty.  There is also Eversheds Sutherland, which boasts 70 arbitration lawyers who regularly act for the energy sector in high-profile disputes and which believes gas to be an important component in the future energy mix, promising to do what its clients need wherever needed.  It also lists how arbitration is a preferred mechanism due to the advantage of enforcement over domestic court systems.</p> <p>  In the interests of transparency, is it not fair to say the ICBA and the members of its advisory council, given their make-up and legal-heavy membership, would have an interest in ratifying CETA with the ICS mechanism in place?  That is as opposed to just allowing the provisional application of the deal to continue.</p><p>That was the case in the Energy Charter Treaty.  Some signatories to that treaty provisionally ratified it for decades and have continued to be able to operate.</p></speech>

First, we are a business association, an association of businesses.  Yes, our interest is to ratify CETA, and what is on the table is ratification of CETA with the ICS.  Nobody is proposing that it be ratified without it, or at least not now.  I wish to note that I am here and that this is a voluntary organisation with a voluntary director.  A number of times when we have surveyed all our members, not just those the Senator mentioned, CETA ratification has come up.  That is the case for all our members, including those that employ the approximately 25,000 Irish people here.  I should note that the Canada Pension Plan, CPP, the Canadian Government pension plan, made up of Canadian individuals owns the majority of the Corrib gas field, if I am correct, and Vermilion is an operator.  I also note that the operation employs approximately 400 people, supporting families in the member's constituency of Mayo.  Is that correct?  I believe that is the employment level of Vermilion in Mayo.</p> <p>  I cannot get into the specifics of the case with regard to Vermilion and the French Government other than to say I do not know it.  However, I presume that it felt that it had a case to take and it did so.  That could be done as part of an ICS or it could be done in French courts as well.  I again note that the ICBA is a business association.  We represent businesses doing business between the two countries, including many SMEs and many Irish businesses.  We cannot specifically say that we only want to ratify CETA because of the ICS or because of the composition of some members of our advisory board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Reuben East" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021041300002#U00300"><p>I will respond quickly on a few points.  I thank the Senator for the questions, especially the one on fair and equitable treatment.  I do not often get to talk about fair and equitable treatment in detail as a technical person, but I enjoy the opportunity to do so.  I will say something about this standard and the way it was drafted under CETA, which is quite different from the old ISDS model.  I believe it is important.  Usually the fair and equitable treatment provision has a very opaque reference, because it is a customary international law standard.  If one looks at the oil treaties, there is mention of customary international minimum standard of treatment or fair and equitable treatment, but no description of what the content is.  The EU and Canada were very deliberate in setting out exactly what the customary international law standard is and listed the aspects.  These are things such as complete denial of justice, for example, no ability to have any recourse before a domestic tribunal, or manifest arbitrariness.  Things such as this are listed under article 8.10.2.  The parties were quite deliberate in setting these out.</p> <p>  As to the question relating to paragraph 3 of that provision, as it is a customary international law standard it will evolve from time to time.  The parties have an ability through the specialised committees to meet and, as needed, to basically acknowledge this.  However, even without that, a tribunal could take notice of a customary international law standard and how it evolves.  What is innovative here is that the parties are in control of this.  The parties set the standard and they can then indicate if it is evolved or not.  That is quite different and I argue that it provides a narrower ability to use this provision.</p> <p>  On the Senator's point about concerns, I cannot speak on specific cases.</p><p>Some of the concerns she has raised in respect of specific cases relate to the old ISDS model.  CETA does something quite different by, for example, giving a specific direction in the text to tribunal members and by having a frivolous claims provision that can lead to the early dismissal of claims, which vastly reduces costs to the state in defending these claims.  There are joint interpretations to clarify the meaning of certain provisions, including in respect of the environment, labour and so on.  These are binding on tribunals and there is an appellate system that does not usually exist under these old ISDS claims.  These are reforms that respond somewhat to these concerns.  They were acknowledged and addressed by the parties in my submission.</p></speech>

It is correct to say that the Oireachtas would have no further oversight of any amendments to what constitutes fair and equitable treatment.  Once we ratify it, Irish legislators will have no further oversight of those amendments; it would involve just the EU and Canada.</p></speech>

Canada uses its federal government to negotiate and enter into agreements.  In some of the committees, there is not only federal participation but also provincial government participation, for example, in respect of mutual recognition agreements, which usually fall within the provincial competence.  That depends in the case of Canada and I cannot speak as to how the EU and its member states would organise that.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for allowing me to sit in on this very important and interesting discussion.  I have a number of questions, first, for Ms Drisdelle, and hopefully then I can then come back with a question for Mr. Collenette.</p> <p>  We are hearing today of the benefits of the ICS.  Last week we had experts in who said that they were very concerned about the system.  From speaking to my constituents, there are many concerns among people as to what we might be signing up to not just for the immediate future but for a 20-year period into the future.  Much of this will come down to when the deal is ratified and in operation and to the interpretation of the text and how court systems interpret what is within the agreement.  Taking that into consideration, do our witnesses accept the concept of the chilling effect and that the very nature of this agreement could impede a government in making a policy decision without being fearful of what that decision could incur by way of compensation costs or through the ICS?  Regardless of the outcome of such a court process, the potential is there to impede a government in making a decision for the benefit of its own people.  We were given a few examples last week such as Romania withdrawing from the nominations of the UNESCO site because of a gold mine in its territory and the risk relating to an environmental permit.  A number of cases show that the chilling effect is real.  Do our witnesses believe that this is something that could impact on an Irish or Canadian Government in respect of CETA?</p> <p>  Second, there has been discussion about SMEs as it is not just the large corporations that are covered under this agreement.</p><p>The 2019 judgment of the European Court of Justice raised a concern that the cost of these courts under the ICS would be prohibitive for SMEs.  It stated: "The extent of the financial risk undertaken by bringing proceedings before the CETA Tribunal may accordingly be such, for a natural person or a small and medium-sized enterprise, as to deter that investor from initiating the proceedings."  Was this something about which the witnesses were concerned?</p><p> I will revert with a quick question for the representative of the ICBA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Drisdelle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021041300002#W00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  As my colleague, Mr. East, mentioned, many of the examples we have heard of companies suing various jurisdictions were based on a different system, namely, the ISDS.  The ICS will replace it with a more predictable and accessible mechanism.  I can understand there being an emotional concern and a fear of the idea of a foreign company somehow having an effect on local laws, but as we continue to reiterate, CETA protects the domestic government and ensures it can regulate in its own right on these matters of substance and importance in the public interest.  As such, I do not see there being a risk of a chilling effect.</p> <p>  In terms of SMEs, I am hearing an assumption that the ICS will encourage arbitration or somehow bring more cases against states.  I am not sure why that is.  If cases come about and there is a need for them to be dealt with and discussed, the ICS provides a better system, one with more predictability and several processes it must go through, including vetting to ensure that frivolous claims are not put forward.  This will reduce the cost for SMEs.  Without the ICS, the SMEs will be left with fewer tools.  If one is dealing with 27 different jurisdictions, what one needs to do is not as obvious or predictable and there is no consistency.  The ICS benefits SMEs and their ability to access an arbitration system and have it be predictable and consistent in a way that deals with different concerns.  I do not see that as being an issue or the chilling effect as being a serious concern.</p></speech>

I will ask a quick question of Mr. Collenette that is similar to what Senator Boylan asked.  Is there a list of his organisation's membership on its website?

Mr. Collenette was clear on that.  I am wondering whether any commitments were made during those meetings with Government officials or Ministers that were held late last year in the third and fourth quarters regarding CETA?  I know his primary efforts were in respect of expediting the ratification of CETA.  Was Mr. Collenette surprised at how quickly CETA came onto the D&aacute;il agenda late last year?  Many of us in the Oireachtas were surprised when CETA came out of the blue onto the agenda, and that there was quite an effort to get it through the D&aacute;il system and process very quickly.  Was Mr. Collenette surprised when this happened?</p></speech>

First, we have not represented to expedite CETA.  It has been provisionally applied since 2017.  Our position is that we want to get on with it and get it over the line.  We are not trying to rush it through; our position is that it is best for the economy to do so, for all the great reasons we have listed.  No commitments were made; it was only agreed that CETA was something in which the Government saw value.  With regard to the manner in which it was introduced before Christmas, I agree with Senator McDowell, who wrote an article on the issue some time ago.  I believe that 55 minutes was too short a period of time in which to discuss a Bill of this nature.  I was glad to see that it made it onto the Oireachtas schedule, but we certainly did not advocate for it to be advanced in a more expedited manner than one would hope for, if that is clear.</p></speech>

I am very interested in our common and shared democratic values. However, the fact is that the values that Canada and Ireland, or indeed the EU, might share are not values that need to be shared by corporations.  They have different sets of values.  That is why in general, globally, we have seen a shift away from international arbitration mechanisms.  There are still arbitration mechanisms in new deals that are being agreed, but they are mechanisms for arbitration between the parties that actually sign the deals.  It is arbitration, for example, between Canada and the EU, that does not include private corporate investors who do not sign up to the deal or have obligations under the rest of it.  That is what we have seen in the case of the US.</p> <p>  The question has not been answered in respect of the fact that we have seen a new level of partnership between the US and Canada immediately following changes in deals involving the removal of investors from the arbitration mechanisms.  I know that private investors are still included in relation to Mexico.  That is a key point.  It is also worth noting that during the renegotiation, NAFTA continued to apply.  Therefore, the provisional application can continue while we discuss these measures.  It was much faster - just two years.  When there is not a controversial element, it seems that trade deals get negotiated much quicker.  </p> <p>  On the common values piece, Mr. Collenette has been very clear that his interests are business interests.  That is what he will represent.  In that regard, I am concerned when I hear about the lobbying.  When I think about this consultation and mediation phase that is going to happen when an ICS case might be taken.  I am concerned that during the mediation phase we will see these parties engaged in the very high level of access that they have had in relation to this in mediation.  Is that where the chilling effect happens?</p><p>Is that the point where it will happen most, where there is mediation and states back down on their roles?</p><p> I have three very specific questions for Mr. East.  We have all looked at the CETA tribunal.  The term, "fair and equitable treatment" is still very wide; it does include reasonable expectations.  In Article 8.9, it is not the mere fact alone that constitutes the breach but the mere fact plus the fair and equitable treatment.  It is interesting that Article 8.9.4, in respect of the removal of subsidies, specifically states there will not be an obligation on compensation for investors.  Do the witnesses agree that the direction given to the ICS on the removal of subsidies indicates that compensation might not be expected but that the direction in respect of regulation does not give any insurance that compensation might not be expected?  That is the key piece of the chilling effect.  </p><p> Mr. East said that Canadian companies are not suing under the energy charter but Vermillion Energy, which is a member of this Ireland Canada Business Association, is suing and has threatened to sue France specifically under the energy charter.  Will we see that used?  There is a question on legitimate expectation.  Mr. East stated that companies should expect the same treatment domestically as internationally.  Is it not the case that the compensation which will be given to companies under this international arbitration is far higher than what they would expect nationally because it includes those legitimate future expectations? </p></speech>

I agree with her interpretation in respect of the piece on subsidies.  It states "For greater certainty, nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing a Party from discontinuing the granting of a subsidy" and there is no compensation that goes with that.  However, I respectfully disagree with her interpretation on Article 8.9.2, to which she compared it. Senator Higgins knows it well but I will read it for everyone's benefit.  It states "For greater certainty, the mere fact that a Party regulates, including through a modification to its laws, in a manner which negatively affects an investment or interferes with an investor's expectations, including its expectations of profits, does not amount to a breach of an obligation".  If it does not amount to a breach of an obligation, then there is no compensation that goes with it.  I suggest that paragraph and paragraph 4 amount to the same thing.  If there is no breach of obligation then there is no compensation - paragraph 4 speaks to compensation - and one arrives at the same thing.</p></speech>

I imagine that Mr. Collenette might have that view.  He certainly seems to have it.</p> <p>  I refer to the diplomatic work that we are doing together on things such as sustainable development goals and climate change goals.  Does Ms Drisdelle see a tension when the goals that countries might share are at odds with those which corporations might have?  Does she think that is the case with the Keystone pipeline or cases such as that of Vermillion Energy and France?</p></speech>

One is that Canada, Ireland and the EU share climate change and environmental goals.  We have exactly the same goals.</p><p>While it is true that Canada is very resource dependent and its economy has traditionally been based on the energy sector, I reiterate that with Canada's strengthened climate change strategy, announced in December, and for the past ten years, the transition to the carbon economy is happening.  It is something that companies are involved in whether they like it or not.  The energy transition in Canada does involve the oil and gas sector.  It is making investments in new technologies for increased efficiency, reduced emissions and alternative forms of energy.  This must happen in collaboration with the sector.  The chapters in CETA that touch on environment include one in which various climate commitments are regularly discussed within the context of CETA and its joint committees.  We are with the EU and are in step with each other in addressing climate change.  I do not see CETA as being contrary to that.</p></speech>

People are stepping away from it for fear of corporations suing.</p> <p>  Regarding article 8.10, enough has been said regarding fair and equitable treatment but creating a legitimate expectation.  The chilling effect is what we are still talking about.  That is obvious.  We have positivity from the deal that has been done and its provisional application.  Is there any major obstacle to this going on?  If there is time, can Mr. East give an example of the direct actions not open to companies, with reference to my earlier example of fracking?</p></speech>

Concerns about the old ISDS system were mainly raised by civic society groups.  I participated in the negotiations with the EU and it is really important to emphasise that these concerns were taken very seriously.  Not only did we acknowledge them, we made some pretty substantial revisions to the investment chapter to address those concerns.  Canada and the EU very much turned their minds to the question the Deputy posed when we negotiated CETA in the investment court system.  The agreement is very clear.  It bears repeating that various chapters, not just the investment chapter, guarantees parties the right to regulate in the public interest, for example, in areas such as the safety of agricultural goods, public services, environment, culture, health and safety and labour protection, among others.</p> <p>  That is supplemented by specific exceptions and reservations taken by the parties in the form of Annexe 1 and Annexe 2.  I mention them because it essentially means that, for certain areas, certain obligations do not apply.  Essentially, they have carved out public policy space.  This is quite important because those areas cannot be the subject of a dispute.  This is an important way to buttress this potential concern about a chilling effect.</p> <p>  CETA does not, in my view or in Canada's view, prevent the Irish or Canadian Governments from regulating in the public interest nor does it require that an investor be compensated simply because a government measure has affected its expectation.</p><p>It also does not allow an ICS tribunal to require that a government change its laws, regulations or policies.  These are all very important elements in this ICS that are quite different from the old ISDS model.  In my view, they will act as safeguards in respect of the concerns about the old ISDS model.</p></speech>

I know members were very anxious to underpin the conversation and engagement today by emphasising the importance of the relationship, historical and otherwise.  In our recent history, in 2011, the Canadian Government signed off on 10,000 visas during very dark days in this country when many young men and women had to emigrate.  The relationship is important.  We have evidence of this and no doubt the continued relationship will be positive.</p> <p>  Many questions were raised today and there are still a lot of questions.

We have our full membership present.  We have one item of committee business to be addressed before I call our witness, Dr. Ronan Glynn, to present to us.  I take it that the draft minutes of our private and public meetings of last Thursday, 8 April, are agreed and that there are no matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Obviously, this is a matter for NIAC in terms of the public health measure and putting safety first.  I have no problem with that.  It is more the implications of the decision.  We need to hear from the HSE and NIAC next week that they have a plan to mitigate this decision because we do not want this to interrupt in any way the roll-out.  We know how important the vaccine roll-out will be.  We will deal with this issue in this session with the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in the context of the impact the roll-out will have on allowing us to make decisions on reopening, outdoor dining and other outdoor activities, so this is very important.  I am not satisfied at all with the responses we have got from the Minister for Health in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks.  He is not presenting a plan.  He is not presenting timeframes or targets.  We have the HSE in next week and we have NIAC, and they need to come in with a plan.  I am asking in advance of this hearing next week that we write to them and ask them for a very detailed note and a plan that assures us that we can mitigate this because it is obviously a serious development.  When we have them in next week, they need to come in with a plan and give it to us in advance of the hearing.</p></speech>

Also, since NIAC and, in particular, the HSE are coming in, I am very concerned about the roll-out of the HPV vaccine.  We need to get an update on that as well and on whether there is any proposal to have a catch-up programme, given the fact that schools have been closed now for a significant period of the past 12 months.  I have dealt with a couple of parents who are trying to get their children the HPV vaccine and they are being told it will cost them something in the region of &euro;500.  This catch-up programme was run successfully in 2018 and we need another one, so perhaps the HSE and NIAC could be alerted to the need to come in and to give us an update on that as well.  I would appreciate that.</p></speech>

The latter is something over which neither we nor the HSE have any control.  It is all down to one thing: supply.  If the companies do not supply or are not capable of supplying enough vaccines or if there is a safety issue involved, what will we do?  Will we superimpose ourselves between the HSE and the general public and set ourselves up as the people to go to in the case of healthcare?  If something goes wrong and there is a health issue and an inquiry into it, are we going to take responsibility for that?  This is an area we need to be very careful about.  It is all very fine to criticise the Minister and so on, and I am sure he is well able to look after himself, but we are not the experts in this area-----</p></speech>

The witnesses will present virtually to our meeting to provide us with an update on where we are on tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.  I welcome Dr. Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer, Mr. Gerry O'Brien, director of health protection division at the Department of Health, and Professor Philip Nolan, president of Maynooth University.  During the session I ask Dr. Glynn to direct me to whom he believes should be responding to a question.</p> <p>  Before we hear the opening statement, I need to point out to our witnesses that there is uncertainty about how parliamentary privilege will apply to their evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.

I am joined by Professor Philip Nolan, who is the chair of our modelling group, and Mr. Gerry O'Brien, who is the director of the health protection division at the Department of Health.  The public health strategy for addressing Covid-19 is comprehensive and it is continually being strengthened.  I will provide an overview of the current epidemiological status and recent developments in our response.</p> <p>  We have more reasons to be hopeful now than at any time in the pandemic to date.  Our national vaccine programme is well under way.  Last week, Ireland reached the milestone of 1 million vaccines administered.  As of last Saturday, 19.3% of Ireland&rsquo;s adult population have had at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine and 8% of adults, including those most vulnerable in our population, are fully protected.  The positive impact is already being felt.  For example, the percentage of Covid-19 cases in health care workers has been decreasing significantly and is down from 10% of all cases notified at the start of December to less than 2% of cases over the past 14 days.</p> <p>  We are seeing good progress in the trajectory of the disease.  Our most recent data, up to midnight on 11 April, shows that the 14-day incidence rate decreased to 132 per 100,000 population, a reduction of 15% from the previous week.  The five-day moving average of new cases reduced to 404, a reduction of 23% from the previous week.  Case numbers reported on Sunday were the lowest reported since mid-December.  This is further proof that our collective efforts continue to make a real difference.  The average number of close contacts has held remarkably low and steady over the past month, and this is proving critical to preventing the spread of the virus.</p> <p>  Hospital and intensive care numbers are also moving in the right direction.  As of this morning, there were 206 Covid patients in acute hospitals, 48 of whom were in ICU.  This is the first time the number of people in critical care has been fewer than 50 since New Year's Day.  We have seen a dramatic reduction in the numbers dying with this disease.  At the end of January 2021, the average number of deaths being reported over a seven-day period was 49 per day and by the end of March it was down to eight deaths per day.</p> <p>  We have resumed our priority public services.  Yesterday, schools returned in full, childcare fully resumed at the end of last month, and the HSE has a comprehensive plan in place for the full resumption of non-Covid health and social care services over the course of this year.  We should not underestimate this achievement.  Schools remain closed across many EU countries and healthcare systems across the continent are under immense pressure.  We have also taken our first steps this week on what will, hopefully, be a steady pathway to reopening our economy and society.  Further measures will ease later in the month, enabling more outdoor activities and socialisation to improve the health and well-being of society.</p> <p>  All of this means that we can be hopeful of a return to better and more normal times.  However, while significant progress is being made in controlling the disease and in rolling out vaccines, we still have a high level of infection.  We are dealing with a much more transmissible virus than last year, and the absolute number of people fully protected through vaccination remains low.</p><p>This means that there remains a considerable risk that Ireland will experience a further wave of infection if public health measures are eased too quickly.  However, modelling has shown that a further wave of infection can be substantially mitigated if levels of social contact across the population remain largely unchanged over the next six weeks.  For the coming weeks, the priority must be maintaining control over the disease until vaccination can offer a widespread population level of protection.</p><p> NPHET's advice to the Government continues to recommend a cautious approach and that any further easing of measures should be gradual and phased and allow adequate time between phases to assess the impact.  Our priorities also remain the same: to protect the most vulnerable, facilitate the safe return of in-school education and childcare services, and resume non-Covid health and social care.  NPHET will continue monitoring the epidemiological situation closely over the coming weeks to assess the impact of the reopening of priority services and the easing of measures.  NPHET and the Government will consider the position again at the beginning of May.</p><p> We are also continuously strengthening key elements of our response to ensure that we have comprehensive systems for preventing and containing the transmission of this virus.  The HSE has developed significant capacity and capability across its testing and contact tracing service and a range of further enhancements were implemented recently.  These included the introduction of walk-in testing centres in high-incidence areas where asymptomatic people can get a test free of charge, the expansion of source investigation to identify where transmission may have occurred in more cases, and the further roll-out of rapid antigen testing pilot studies.  Significant steps have also been taken to strengthen measures in respect of international travel.  Many countries continue to struggle with high levels of infection and there are a number of variants of the virus that cause us great concern.  It is important that we not risk the progress that we are making nationally by exposing ourselves to variants that may have serious consequences on the impact of our vaccination programme.</p><p> We must be careful that we not consider any one of the above measures as a panacea.  Our consistent message throughout the pandemic has been that a combination or layering of measures is the most effective means of controlling this disease.  The most effective measures of all are those that we can take ourselves - wearing a face mask, keeping our distance, practising good hand hygiene, keeping indoor spaces well ventilated, and isolating and presenting for testing if we have symptoms.</p><p> While we now have tangible reasons for hope, we must continue together to move cautiously over the coming weeks to ensure we protect the significant gains we have made in recent months and to allow us time to protect more people, particularly the most vulnerable, through vaccination.  Despite the very understandable levels of fatigue, we know that the level of support for public health guidance remains high.  The efforts of the vast majority of the population are continuing to help suppress viral transmission in our communities.  I thank the public, in particular healthcare workers, for their ongoing support.  My hope is that we will never again have to recommend more restrictive measures.  However, to achieve this, we must continue to hold the line in the coming weeks as our vaccine programme ramps up.</p></speech>

Vaccine hesitancy could creep into the population, given the decision of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Is Dr. Glynn concerned about this and should we be seeking an increased supply of other vaccine brands to combat it?  I note today's decision of the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, in the US to recommend a pause of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Covid vaccine while it investigates reports of blood clots.</p> <p>  The UK is seeing its largest surge in testing to date, as dozens of cases of the South African variant have been found in south London.  Israel reported that this variant could break through the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's protection.  Has the South African variant reached our shores and what will the consequences be if it does?  Early results from France show the major potential of the Valneva vaccine.  According to Professor Luke O'Neill, they are unbelievable results.  Is NPHET engaging with its French counterparts in that regard?</p> <p>  Across the water in the UK, pubs and restaurants are reopening.  Has NPHET information or a roadmap on when the hospitality sector might reopen in Ireland and in what form that should take place?</p><p>I ask because businesses need to plan.  Again, a balance must be struck between opening the economy and health concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.465" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#D00200"><p>Yes, we are obviously always concerned about vaccine hesitancy.  While that has been less of a concern over the first number of months of roll-out in that anyone who gets a vaccine or is offered a vaccine has been very keen to avail of it, we have been aware of the need to maintain levels of confidence in the programme.  That has been a key component of the approach that we have taken.  We have tried to be proactive in assessing the latest data, in communicating that and in ensuring that the public understands the rationale for decisions and that they understand that safety comes first in terms of our decisions.  It is thanks to the work of NIAC, and the work of colleagues in the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and across agencies that despite what has been a bumpy road, not alone in Ireland but internationally in terms of these vaccines, almost nine out of ten people in Ireland say that they will probably or definitely take a vaccine when it is offered to them.  Clearly, we cannot take that level of confidence for granted.  Clearly, we have to continue to communicate and address concerns.  As I have said on many occasions, there will be 20% or 30% of the population who will have very legitimate questions and concerns.  We need to continue to address those.  In particular, we need to address the concerns of vulnerable communities and hard to reach groups over time to ensure that we see equitable access and equitable uptake as the vaccines are rolled out.</p> <p>  On the second question, we have had 46 cases of the variant that was first reported in South Africa reported here to date.  We are concerned about levels of variants, either actual levels in the country now or, potentially, increasing levels of those variants over time.  In particular, we are concerned about their potential impact on the effectiveness of vaccines and the potential, were they to spread, for them to have a detrimental impact on what we want to do in easing measures across society over the coming months.  Thankfully, at the moment the numbers are low but we need to keep them low.  As the Senator indicated, in the UK and, indeed, here, that necessitated a very robust and comprehensive public health response each time one of these cases has been identified.  We have had very robust responses from our public health doctors for a number of months now around these variants as they have been identified.  Indeed, updated guidance around that response was brought to NPHET last week and endorsed.  The HSE is in the process of operationalising that.</p> <p>  I cannot speak to the issue of hospitality.  I understand that will leave many members frustrated but I am not going to speak to specific measures that may or may not happen over the coming months.  We will look at the data over the next two to three weeks and we will provide updated advice again to the Government at the end of April.  The intention is that we will provide a roadmap from there for May and June, and onwards.  That is subject to the disease remaining stable or, indeed, continuing to improve over the next couple of weeks.  Clearly, there is a need for a plan.  People need to know what is coming and the broad parameters for when they can expect various measures to ease so let us see what the next couple of weeks bring.  Clearly, the last week was very positive in terms of the disease but that was in the context of the Easter break and we just need to see what a normal week looks like this week.</p></speech>

I ask Dr. Glynn to comment on that and on the French Valneva vaccine.</p> <p>  Some of the basic messaging on hand hygiene has been hugely important but I believe anecdotally and from reports around the country that the practice of hand sanitising has reduced, certainly in shops.  I have seen that happen in places and I saw it happen in a shop here in Dublin where there was no hand sanitiser available for three weeks but there was subsequently.  In service stations I have seen instances where people have had to look around for a hand sanitiser, which should be in someone's line of vision.</p><p>I believe better, improved and newer signage is necessary to remind people of the importance of hand sanitising to prevent the spread of Covid-19, particularly with new variants and in view of the benefits of hand hygiene in the context of preventing the spread of other diseases as well.  Perhaps Dr. Glynn will reply to those questions.</p></speech>

We want to use any vaccine that comes through and is shown to be safe and effective.  Colleagues in the Department will continue to monitor that.  With regard to the news about the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine from the US, the EMA is monitoring the situation.  After this meeting, because the news emerged as I came on this call, I will liaise with the HPRA to get an update.  I know the EMA has been monitoring that situation.</p> <p>  On the Senator's final point, I fully endorse the need to re-emphasise, strengthen and improve the messaging about the basic measures.  Regardless of what happens with vaccination over the coming six weeks to three months, it is those basic measures that will allow us to ease up on the measures that are much more important to us at a societal level.  There has been talk that fomite transmission or transmission by touching surfaces is less of an issue than we previously thought, but Cillian de Gascun is quite clear that the science is not as clear as some would suggest that we no longer need to worry about that form of transmission.  Again, it is not one panacea.  We should still have a very strong emphasis on hand hygiene.  The signage at parks and shops could be refreshed and updated.  We need ongoing messaging on the importance of ventilation and all the other measures such as keeping one's distance and wearing a mask.  If we can continue to use those measures as a society, that will allow us far more options through the summer in terms of what sectors we can open up and in society more broadly.  We should keep those basic measures going.</p></speech>

With regard to monitoring businesses and shops and ensuring that they have, for example, a basic supply of hand sanitiser, whose role is it to ensure that a shop complies with what we have known for the past year to be very important and which is one of the core messages from NPHET and advocated by the Government?</p></speech>

It is what we would like to see from the various sectors and we can communicate with colleagues across government.  In many instances, the measures taken by individual retailers or individual businesses across the country have been on a voluntary basis and on the basis of buying into the need to protect each other.  I hope that will continue and that people will see the value of doing that as a contribution to the wider efforts to reduce transmission.  However, I take the Senator's point that, perhaps, we need to stress more vocally the need for the basic measures to be strengthened, refreshed and continued over the coming months.</p></speech>

I wish them well in the time ahead.  It is difficult for everybody and Dr. Glynn acknowledged in his opening statement the difficulties posed for the general population.  He also acknowledged, which is significant and important, that we have more reasons to be hopeful now than at any time during the pandemic.  He said we can be hopeful of a return to better and more normal times.  Obviously, we all want that.  He clearly set out the ingredients which will lead us to a better place in terms of test and trace, travel checks, the roll-out of the vaccine and the current restrictions continuing.  I have a number of questions about that.</p> <p>  Dr. Glynn said that he does not want to talk about the specific easing of measures that might be possible in the short term.  I assume he does not want to speculate at this point in time and that he will continue to evaluate the data as it emerges over the next number of weeks.  He also said that if levels of social contact across the population remain largely unchanged over the next six weeks, NPHET will be in a position to re-evaluate matters.</p><p>Is that where we are at, first of all?  At this point in time, is it NPHET's position that the level of restrictions currently in place will remain so for the next six weeks or is there the possibility of additional changes within that period?</p></speech>

I hope my opening statement is first and foremost a hopeful message as opposed to one that is causing worry about a fourth wave.  We are not predicting a fourth wave; we are simply saying it remains a possibility while also acknowledging that the vast majority of indicators appear to be going in the right direction.</p></speech>

I know he does not want to go into specifics but the obvious areas would be outdoor activities and sport, and outdoor dining and hospitality were mentioned as well.  Can he give us some indication, in general terms, of what areas we can expect to see some movement on in that six-week period, before I move on to what happens after that?  As Dr. Glynn said, people want hope.  Will he give us some indication, without being overly specific if that is what he cannot do, of what we can expect?</p></speech>

I hope by the end of the month we will be able to set out a plan or at least an indicative high-level approach that we can hopefully adhere to over the following six to eight weeks which will bring us through May and June and into July.</p></speech>

However, if we take outdoor dining and outdoor events, certainly from a business perspective, as one of the options, then there must be a lead-in time.  There must be some heads-up given to those businesses so they can prepare.  I know Dr. Glynn will accept that, if it can be factored in.</p> <p>  If I can I want to expand on the matter of any modelling NPHET may have done on the vaccine roll-out and the relationship between it and our ability to ease restrictions.  What milestones must be reached in the vaccine roll-out to allow us to significantly ease restrictions?  I ask because in the letter Dr. Glynn sent to the Minister on 29 March, he said the vaccine roll-out gives real hope that there can be a much more widespread easing of measures during the summer months.  "Widespread" is obviously significant.  Therefore, in Dr. Glynn's view what milestones or staging posts in the vaccination roll-out must be reached to allow NPHET to make more decisions about easing restrictions?</p></speech>

The benefits which can be accrued from the roll-out at any point in time depend on where we are with the disease.  If we can continue to keep this disease under control over the next couple of months and we have a significant proportion of the population vaccinated, that will give us much greater options than if it gets out of control and we are coming off another-----</p></speech>

Before Professor Nolan comes in I wish to bring up an additional point Dr. Glynn made in his letter to the Minister.  He said that: "Vaccination will significantly and quickly reduce risk over a short period of time from May 2021 to August 2021."  He also said that: "It will [...] reduce mortality when those over 70 are fully vaccinated but will initially have a smaller effect on hospitalisation and critical care until the wider adult population, especially vulnerable adults and those aged 50-69 years, are protected...".  Is that the type of staging post or milestone we must reach?</p><p>Are there numbers of people we need to see vaccinated before we can see what the witnesses called the "widespread easing of restrictions"?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Nolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#G00300"><p>It is important to look at it in two ways.  First, there is the reduction in mortality risk, that is, the risk of people dying.  There is an important milestone when people over 70 are effectively protected and at that point one sees a radical reduction in the likelihood of people dying.  Some people who are younger than 70 remain at risk of mortality and there is a much wider risk of hospitalisation but the effect of vaccination is progressive.  If half of the adult population were vaccinated, the virus would find it twice as difficult to transmit.  I do not think-----</p></speech>

Has NPHET, for example, looked at what is possible if we get 50% of the adult population vaccinated, if we get the medically vulnerable and all those over 55 vaccinated and so on?  Is such modelling done and is that something that informs the advice?  I know there are others issues related to deaths, hospitalisations and admissions to ICU but has NPHET done the modelling specifically with regard to the vaccines?  Has NPHET identified the milestones to be reached that will provide the opportunity to ease restrictions and can it inform the public of same, if that is the case?</p></speech>

The fundamental thing shown by that model is that we should not be thinking in terms of benchmarks of 25%, 50% or 75% of the population vaccinated and then we can do one big thing.  What the model shows is that the impact of vaccination is progressive.  The more people that are vaccinated, the harder and harder it is for the virus to transmit.  Ultimately, we might get to the point of herd immunity, where the virus cannot transmit and sustain the epidemic but far in advance of that, we begin to find fewer cases-----</p></speech>

I am not specifically talking about percentages of the population vaccinated.  I am talking about whether it is by age cohort or by people with underlying conditions.  Are there benchmarks, targets or staging posts that NPHET believes will leave us in a better position if we reach them?  Dr. Glynn was talking about the possibility of easing more restrictions over the next six weeks.  Beyond that, hopefully there will be further easing and the vaccine roll-out will be central to that.  Can the modelling done in that regard be shared with this committee?</p></speech>

I am not avoiding the question.  The truth is that it is progressive and rapidly so.  There are no actual milestones.  If one looks at the layout of the vaccination programme, the rate at which the population is vaccinated ramps up very quickly over a short number of weeks.  We go from having 25% to 50% to 75% of the population effectively vaccinated over the course of less than 12 weeks under the current programme.</p></speech>

Just to be clear - it is a key part of our response in the short term in particular.  I hope that we will see a rapidly improving situation, particularly across Europe as countries step up their vaccination programmes over the next six to eight weeks as well.  At least for the next six to eight weeks, we need to do all we can to keep the disease on the island under control and to prevent the introduction of variants as much as possible.  We will not prevent the introduction of all variants but what we need to do is minimise that to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>

I am sorry that time does not allow us to be more effusive than that but they can take it that we very much appreciate the work they are doing.  I will not say that we have learned from mistakes, but a significant amount has been learned since before Christmas.  I believe everyone understands the need for the cautious and gradual approach which, although tedious for the public, is working.  We, as the body politic, get that and I believe the public also increasingly gets it.

To be clear, we are also concerned about B.1.1.7, which is the dominant variant in the country, because further mutations of this variant are now emerging internationally.  There have also been one or two cases of additional mutations here.  Other variants include P.2 and P.3, which were first identified in the United States, B.1.525 and B.1.526.

At that point, I hope that there will not be much need to differentiate between what vaccinated people and unvaccinated people can do.  For example, there has been some suggestion that vaccinated people will be allowed to get a haircut.  I hope that, if the disease remains under control, everyone will be able to go and get a haircut long before that becomes an issue, because the disease is under control.</p></speech>

I am sure other members will be asking the witnesses to flesh out the details in that regard, so I will leave that to them.  We are due to get 600,000 doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, which is essentially equivalent to 1.2 million doses of AstraZeneca or another two-jab vaccine.  We know the USA has paused administration of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and that the Australian Government stated on Tuesday that it would not purchase it.  What is the reaction of the witnesses to those developments?</p></speech>

The report from the United States literally came out as we joined the meeting.  I know it has been reported that there have been six cases out of 7 million vaccine doses given.

I absolutely support hotel quarantine, but I do not get why there is an insistence on it for those who have a house here, are fully vaccinated and quite willing to quarantine at home.

First and foremost, we are still not entirely clear what impact a vaccine or different vaccines have on transmission of the virus.  A person can be vaccinated and carry one of the variants of concern, bring it into this country and give it to somebody else.</p></speech>

We need to learn more about that in the coming weeks.  Different variants will have different effects on different vaccines.  We are seeing increasing reports on a daily basis, or certainly a weekly basis, internationally of cases and clusters arising among people who have been fully vaccinated, particularly in cases involving the B.1.351 South African variant.  There is still a question as to the length of immunity or protection that is afforded by vaccine-induced immunity.

I will stop Dr. Glynn there.  That was a comprehensive answer.  It would be very useful if he could arrange for a brief paper on that issue to be sent to the committee because it is a question that often comes up from constituents.</p> <p>  My final question also relates to constituents.  GPs have received calls this morning, politicians have received emails and calls in the past 24 hours and I am sure the witnesses have received their fair share of emails, all from people who are now anxious about taking the AstraZeneca vaccine. The issue has been all over the radio.  Much of it has been covered.  I listened to the witnesses' discussing the issue last night.  They covered as much as they could but the thing is that the cattle have been spooked, to use that Western movie analogy.  The line from NPHET - which I understand - is that one should take the vaccine one is offered.  However, should it not be the case that people with serious reservations in that regard are able to exercise those reservations, just as those who do not wish to take the vaccine can exercise their reservations?  Those who do not wish to take a particular vaccine should not be "punished" by having to wait a lengthy period to be administered another vaccine, particularly in the case of the over-70s or the over-60s, who are in vulnerable positions.</p><p>Should they not be in a position where they are able to receive a vaccine, regardless of whether it is AstraZeneca, as quickly as possible and, in an ideal situation, in the order they were intended to receive it?  That is my final question.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I understand that there would be concerns.  I am very sympathetic to those concerns and I am sympathetic to politicians and to general practitioners all across the country today who, I have no doubt, are fielding questions and having to deal with concerns.  We need to address those concerns and resolve them as opposed to going down an alternative route.  This vaccine is safe and effective, as are the other vaccines, in the age group for whom it is being recommended.  The approach taken by ourselves and by NIAC is a very conservative approach.  One could argue that a lower age cut-off be recommended but, as we said last night, with an abundance of caution the 60 year age cut-off was chosen.  This is in line with Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and a number of other European countries.</p></speech>

Perhaps NPHET is also going to have to exercise this caution potentially with another vaccine or two as they come along.  There is a significant piece of work to be done here.  It is about reassuring people.  The clear message from Dr. Glynn today seems to imply that a GP could address the concerns on a one-to-one basis with a patient.  Is that one of the avenues being suggested by him?</p></speech>

Ultimately, we know that the consultation between the general practitioner and a patient is the single, most effective way of addressing concerns around vaccines, ensuring that people have those concerns addressed and are then willing to take the vaccine when it is offered.</p></speech>

I thank them for their ongoing work.</p> <p>  Dr. Glynn said earlier that we must do all we can to prevent the introduction of new variants and we all agree with that.  In that context, I wish to ask some questions about the decisions on mandatory hotel quarantining and the rationale for the selection of those countries included on the list.  Will he provide us with some of the reasons underpinning those decisions please?</p> <p>  In a radio interview yesterday morning, the Minister for Health said that the main criterion for selecting EU countries for mandatory hotel quarantining is the level of variants.  Questions arise about this.  Why is there a distinction between the selection of EU countries and the rest of the world with regard to the criteria that will apply?</p><p>There is an issue with the dependence on new variants in the selection criteria for several EU countries that do not engage in genomic sequencing and instances where that science is weak.  We know from an ECDC report back in February that several European countries do not carry out genomic sequencing.  What is Dr. Glynn's view on the implications of the fact that many EU countries cannot be relied on to provide data on genomic sequencing?  Is it the case that those countries are rewarded by not being included on the list for mandatory hotel quarantine?</p><p> How is it that the incidence of the virus seems to be set aside when it comes to selecting countries at EU level?  When we look at the figures, countries on the list such as Italy, Belgium and Austria have a 14-day incidence rate of approximately 500 cases per 100,000.  Other countries that are not on the list have in the region of 1,000 cases per 100,000.  What exactly is the science underpinning the selection of those countries? </p></speech>

We recognise that many countries have a challenge in either carrying out, or for whatever reason, reporting data on variants of concern.  It is our belief that it is appropriate to examine overall disease incidence in countries because we know that incidence is associated with the emergence and spread of variants of concern.  We know the ECDC has previously been clear on the potential threat posed by variants and the likely further spread of those variants, both within the EU and internationally.  It is in all of that context that we provide advice, which looks at both variants and incidence.</p></speech>

As I said last week, we updated protocols and guidance regarding those variants and that guidance was endorsed.  I am sure the HSE can update the committee on that next week.  We can certainly provide a note on the approach being taken if that is more appropriate.</p></speech>

Before I start my other questions, however, I am aware that some European countries have decided that if a person is halfway through the process and has taken the first dose, he or she will not continue with the second dose and instead start with a new vaccine .  Will that be the case here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#M00600"><p>At present, the plan is that someone at high risk or very high risk of a severe outcome were he or she to contract Covid-19 and who has received his or her first dose, should receive the second dose as planned after 12 weeks.  The benefits of a person receiving that vaccine to protect him or her outweigh any potential risks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#M00800"><p>That is the same across all age cohorts.  Equally, all people aged 60 or older who have received a first dose should receive the second dose as planned after 12 weeks.  For all people under 60 years of age who have received a first dose and are not high risk or very high risk, the second dose should be deferred until 16 weeks after the first.  Those people then will not be due to get their second dose for approximately another five or six weeks.  That will give NIAC further time to consider whether an alternative strategy might be more appropriate and whether that would involve, for example, giving a different vaccine as a second dose.  It is important to point out that 800,000 second doses of AstraZeneca have been given to date in the UK with no negative outcomes.  It may be, therefore, that this issue which has been identified is something that shows itself after a first dose as opposed to after a second.  As I said, however, the next few weeks will allow us to further assess that and come back with updated recommendations.</p></speech>

That seems to make sense.  Does Dr. Glynn have any sense of how many people will be in the cohort we are talking about who already received the more than 200,000 doses that have been given?</p></speech>

We have talked a little about businesses and sport.  One of the areas around which I have received the most correspondence is maternity care and access to services during pregnancy and birth and labour.  I am aware that hospitals are obviously a nucleus of activity when we are talking about a pandemic.  I am not, therefore, asking for a date or anything.  In terms of a roll-out when we see things reopening, however, at what stage does Dr. Glynn expect to see more free and available access to hospital services and the reopening of those kinds of facilities as part of the general opening up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#M01200"><p>I am sorry.  I missed the very start of the question.  Is the Deputy talking about, for example, access to maternity for partners?</p></speech>

Somebody told me yesterday that she had given birth and was in the hospital on her own for the day.  She would have liked to have her partner there and was simply not able to do that.  When will we see that in the roll-out?  I do not necessarily want a date.  When in the framework of the roll-out will that particular service be more available to people, however?</p></speech>

It will not be satisfactory but that is actually not something on which we have ever given specific advice.  The approach taken was based on advice and guidance within the HSE.  The HSE has always determined that position and may, therefore, well be able to update the committee next week.  Ultimately, however, it will come down to the level of disease in the community which, hopefully, will continue to improve over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

That issue, particularly as it relates to nursing homes, has arisen at previous meetings.  Can Dr. Glynn expand on the pilot studies and how they are going?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#N00200"><p>Sure.  These are pilot studies that are being established by colleagues in the HSE.  As the Deputy may be aware, the relevant authorities have already validated and used these antigen tests in some acute hospital settings.  As she may also be aware in the context of her reference to nursing homes, we updated our recommendations regarding visitation a few weeks ago and we will be returning to the issue shortly with NPHET.  One data point which may give people more hope and which shows the impact of vaccines is that no new outbreaks were reported in nursing homes across the country last week.  It is the first time that has happened since last July.  It is a really welcome development and shows the impact that vaccination can have.  In respect of nursing homes, we are looking at the issues of visitation and serial testing and the ongoing role it can play.  We will look at those issues in more detail over the remainder of this week and next week.</p> <p>  On antigen testing, the HSE is looking at the potential for its deployment and use as an additional tool in childcare settings across the various components of the education sector and in higher education, working with colleagues in the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  It is also being deployed to some extent in the meat processing industry.  An evaluation of that is happening as we speak and is focusing on the value and utility or otherwise of it versus cost and other considerations.  It has been rolled out over the past month.</p> <p>  Subject to the recent report of the Covid-19 rapid testing group, I know that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and a range of other Departments are looking at the potential for adding antigen testing as one more layer in their approach.</p></speech>

I might try and get one quick question in before I finish.  I would like to state that the news that there have been no new cases in nursing homes is certainly a massive good news story.</p></speech>

Fair enough.</p> <p>  Earlier, Dr. Glynn noted that we need an adequate amount of time between phases of reopening in order to assess the impact of that reopening.  Could he give us a sense of what that adequate amount of time would be?  Would it be 14 or 20 days on each occasion there is a new phase in the reopening  What does he consider to be an adequate period to facilitate making an assessment?</p></speech>

Of course, as we are seeing at the moment, there was a change in measures on Monday and there will be further changes this month.  Prior to another substantial set of changes, we would want at least three weeks to fully understand if there has been a negative impact.</p></speech>

It gives many people hope with regard to the public health emergency through which we are all living.  It also contains a note of caution.  That is also welcome, because we are living in times when things can go wrong.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Dr. Glynn about this note of caution and hope, particularly in the context of the next six weeks.  It will be a vital phase in the pandemic and in the vaccine roll-out.  What weaknesses does he potentially see in the next six weeks that could undermine the good work that has been done in the past three months in particular?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#N00800"><p>I do not know that there are weaknesses <i>per se</i>.  I would characterise it by stating that there are uncertainties.  For example, there are uncertainties around the potential emergence of a variant.</p><p>A super spreading event, or a small number of super spreading events, of a variant of concern could alter the picture, as could further issues with vaccine roll-out or the planned roll-out of vaccine in which 80% of the population has its first dose by the end of June.  They are the key elements.</p><p> I am sure no one believes it but I remain, and have always remained, optimistic about the public's willingness to buy into measures, despite the fatigue.  The fact we have not seen an increase in close contacts, per case, since the middle of February is phenomenal.  It shows that despite well-publicised incidences in which a small number of people have not complied, the vast majority of people are continuing to try to do the right thing.  That, more than anything else, makes me hopeful that we will continue along an appropriate trajectory over the coming weeks and will get to where we need to be by June and into July.</p></speech>

What does Dr. Glynn think the consequences of the overall vaccine roll-out are in terms of the interruption of the recommendations by NIAC?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#O00300"><p>We will need to wait and see how the HSE reallocates the vaccine to various cohorts and how it plans to deploy available vaccines, but AstraZeneca only accounts for approximately 20% of vaccines over the next eight weeks.  A significant number of people who have not been vaccinated are eligible and will be eligible for AstraZeneca and a significant number of people will require a second dose of this vaccine.</p> <p>  All those people receiving AstraZeneca will leave the Pfizer, Moderna and, hopefully, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines available for other groups of people.  I hope, on the basis of last night's recommendations, the impact on the overall roll-out at population level should be minimal, when one looks forward to where we will be at the end of May or June.  Obviously, there is an interruption this week but, hopefully, it can be addressed quite quickly.</p></speech>

Is that possible over the next six weeks?</p></speech>

AstraZeneca can be used on anyone aged 60 and older, so, clearly, a substantial supply of AstraZeneca vaccine will be available for people in that cohort.  I expect, subject to hearing from the HSE, people who would otherwise have been waiting longer to get vaccine will now be offered AstraZeneca.</p></speech>

Vaccine supply will be ramped up.  Is Dr. Glynn confident we have enough vaccinators to meet the demand to vaccinate people?  There have been problems with the criteria of vaccinators and getting them into the position in which they can vaccinate.  Will we reach a choke point at which there is a supply of vaccines but not enough vaccinators?  Is Dr. Glynn confident we can meet the demand through the 11,000 plus people needed to vaccinate people over the coming six months?</p></speech>

The Department and the high-level task force on vaccines are comfortable in terms of vaccinations through April and May and recruitment to ensure the vaccination workforce is in place thereafter is ongoing.</p><p>It is not just vaccinators; we have GPs and then, at some stage, pharmacists and others coming on board.  It is therefore a very broad-ranging offering of people who can vaccinate.  As for the mass vaccination clinics and the population that will be vaccinated there, the HSE is doing everything it can to recruit people.  Certainly for April and May we have confidence that the numbers are there already to do that.</p></speech>

This could become a bigger issue than we would like.  The one thing we do not want is for vaccine hesitancy to become a bigger issue than it is.  Are there any plans to clarify, particularly with advertisements, hesitancy about the vaccines that will be available for supply over the next three to six months?</p></speech>

The HSE is doing very specific work in that regard, in particular around possibly harder-to-reach groups or groups that may require information in different ways or in different languages.  From our perspective, as I said at the press conference last night, we need to step it up.  As a society, however, we need to move away from a certain focus.  I fully appreciate and understand the focus on numbers, and we need to keep that focus, but in tandem with that we need to focus increasingly on other issues around vaccines - why people want to get vaccines and why they do not want to get them and what their concerns are - and address them across a range of forums.  Again, if people have suggestions for ways in which we need to communicate differently or better regarding vaccines, we are happy to take any of them on board and to try to get messages out through different forums.</p></speech>

May I go back to the AstraZeneca issue?  I know many people have raised it.  It is about getting information out there.  We are now talking about the over-60s and saying the focus will be on AstraZeneca, but we have a huge problem now in that they are not convinced.  I wonder if a lot more could be done to get information out there to show why this decision has been arrived at.  What has been put out there so far - the details of the research, etc. - may be available but is not out there in a broad sense, and I wonder if a lot more could be done on that.  Is Dr. Glynn aware of any plans by the HSE to get information out there to the public on the issue?</p></speech>

That effort needs to continue.  The NIAC advice is up on the RCPI website already, to the best of my knowledge.  However, this comes back to an earlier point, which is that what we really need to do is to equip our healthcare professionals in the community to address the concerns as individuals raise those questions with them.  Over the coming days we will step up our communication efforts to try to answer specific questions and concerns about the vaccine.</p></speech>

It is about the use of antigen, in particular as it relates to, for argument's sake, attending maternity wards, and that issue was raised.  We are now talking about doing a pilot project on this, but is there not enough research done on this already?  We fully accept that it is not comprehensive or conclusive, but why do we need to do a pilot test when all the information on the use of the antigen test is already there?  Why can we not use it regarding maternity services, for instance?</p> <p>  The other big issue now, given that most people over 80 have been vaccinated, is that there is a need to open up day centres they used to attend.  It should be remembered that they have been locked up for more than 12 months now.  They want to get out.  Can that not also be used to try to open up those centres rather than delaying their reopening for another six months?  Will that be considered at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.581" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#Q00100"><p>The second question is for the HSE directly.  With regard to antigen testing, the Deputy has raised an interesting point on whether the evidence is not there.  There is a real debate going on in the medical and scientific community on the value or otherwise of antigen testing.  Just because we all want something to be really effective and make an enormous difference it does not mean that it will.  Some of the portrayal of antigen testing internationally is that it would prevent lockdowns and would be the panacea.  There simply is not evidence in the medical or scientific literature to support this.  Our public health and pathology colleagues in the HSE who deal with these issues on a daily basis do not support this view.  However, there is a role for antigen testing in particular settings as an additional layer.  Ultimately, it has to be driven by our clinical colleagues in the HSE and where they see a value in antigen testing.  To be very clear, wherever antigen testing can play an additional role and bring additional value over and above our public health response, it should be facilitated, trialled and used.  I also reiterate that we have been looking very closely at the evidence on antigen testing since last August.  It is not that the issue was ignored or sidelined.  It was looked at actively and the reality is that certainly up to a couple of weeks ago there was no test validated for use on asymptomatic people.</p></speech>

In the US people are being allowed in from abroad provided they can show they have had the required vaccination.  Why can we not apply the same rule here?  We could introduce antibody testing, whereby when people arrive a test can be done to see whether people have antibodies.  Can this be considered rather than going down the road of quarantine?  This is with regard to people who have clear evidence they have gone through the entire vaccination process.</p></speech>

The position at present is that a very small proportion of our population is fully protected and very small proportion of populations internationally are fully protected.  Even where they are fully protected we still do not have sufficient information on the issue of transmission.  Even where they are fully protected from the variant we have here at present we do not yet have enough information, and internationally we are seeing increasing incidences of breakthrough infection with other variants in people who have been vaccinated.  Furthermore, there is the issue of whether we could have a system that properly authenticates vaccine certificates.  None of this is insurmountable.  None of this is forever.  The epidemiological situation throughout the EU is improving as we speak and the EU is looking at an EU-wide system of vaccination certification.  We are all going in the right direction but it will take weeks to get there.</p></speech>

It is veering a little bit of course.  Why does NPHET make recommendations for nursing homes but not for maternity services?  I know of the reasoning that not all maternity services and wards have spacing and capacity but I would hazard that no two nursing homes are of the same size or layout and NPHET does make recommendations on when people can go in and out of them.  Is there a differentiation that I just do not know about?  Why does NPHET not make recommendations on maternity services but does for nursing homes?</p></speech>

Some of it is historical with regard to areas of focus at a particular time.  The issue with nursing homes is that they are across sectors and society.</p><p>For example, they are not necessarily all HSE nursing homes.  That factor plays into this.  What happens within the HSE is a matter for the HSE.  If there is a need for a wider policy discussion about that at NPHET, it can happen.  To date, however, the issue of maternity services has been dealt with by the HSE.</p></speech>

I was interested in the issue.</p> <p>  Will Dr. Glynn give us his thoughts on how taking or refusing the jab could affect employment and access to services?  NPHET makes far-reaching recommendations on many matters that affect society's health and the economy.  As part of the ongoing roll-out, has it planned or considered a recommendation in respect of those who, for whatever reason, cannot or will not get the jab?  Dr. Glynn stated that approximately 80% of the adult population will have to get at least one dose of the vaccine by June to get things moving reasonably, but what recommendations will NPHET make about managing the situation when cohorts of people cannot or will not get vaccinated?  I do not necessarily mean a discussion on vaccine passports and so on, but there is a genuine question to be asked about NPHET's recommendations as regards what people, businesses and the Government should do in such circumstances.</p></speech>

It is an ongoing conversation.  For example, NPHET last week considered the approach to healthcare workers who have decided not to get vaccinated.  Speaking from a personal perspective, we need to focus over the next few months on one-to-one conversations and ensuring people have the information so that their concerns are addressed.  Generally speaking, across vaccination programmes and countries, 5% at most of an adult population is resolutely anti-vaccine.  Those people will not change their minds.  No matter what measures we introduce or do not introduce, they have already decided that they will not take one of these vaccines.  What we need to do is address the concerns of the proportion of people who have legitimate questions.</p> <p>  At this point, I would be hesitant personally to suggest that we go down the route of differentiating at a societal level between people who have been vaccinated and those who have not.  I hope the majority of people will see that the vaccine offers protection for themselves and their families and will choose to accept it when it is offered to them.  Obviously, this situation is something that we will have to continue monitoring.  For the time being, however, our focus needs to be on ensuring we can maintain the very high level of vaccine confidence that is in the country at present.</p></speech>

We are still in the initial roll-out of the first rounds, so it might be premature of me to consider later phases.  In the long term, how does Dr. Glynn see the virus being managed and vaccination working out?  Is there the potential for the situation to become like the flu vaccine, with large swathes of the population having to get a vaccine regularly?  If so, how would its roll-out be managed?  Would it be done in pharmacies like the flu vaccine or would it remain with GPs and other health settings?</p></speech>

At this stage, it is more likely that we may need a booster programme next autumn or winter, although that is not entirely clear either.</p> <p>  The question of how the vaccination programme will be deployed largely depends on the developments in vaccines over the coming weeks and months, whether we are still using all of the vaccines that we currently have, and whether better and different vaccines come along and what the requirements are in terms of their deployment and administration.  If we needed to run a similar programme next autumn and had to offer a vaccine to everyone aged 16 years and older in the population, we would have to use every available avenue to ensure the uptake was as high as it could be.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a number of questions.  Like others, I had planned on asking about the AstraZeneca vaccine, but it has been well covered and I thank the witnesses for answering the questions thus far.</p><p> I wish to mention the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which is something that I have delved into over the past number of weeks.  How much engagement does NPHET have with the centre on a weekly basis?  The centre is based in Stockholm but I was alarmed to discover that it only employs 300 people and its annual operational budget is &euro;50 million when compared with its US equivalent and co-ordinating health body that has an annual budget of &euro;12 billion.  Have there been many weekly interactions?  Have deficiencies been found in the information supplied by the ECDC in a co-ordinating capacity across the European Union bloc?     </p></speech>

We would also have people who would sit on the advisory and management board forum for the ECDC.</p> <p>  There has been a recognition at European level that the response overall was not as optimal as it could have been, that we need to reflect on that and ensure that we are better prepared in the future.  From that perspective, the EU has already developed something but I will not call it an agency at this stage because it is not entirely clear what the format will be but it is a health emergency preparedness and response authority.  So there is work ongoing on that and I would expect to have more detail on that, probably by the end of the summer.</p> <p>  The ECDC has played an important role in our understanding, particularly around disease transmission.  Of course, we do not rely on the ECDC alone.  We have very regular engagement with colleagues in Northern Ireland and across the UK.  We also keep abreast of developments at WHO and CDC levels.</p></speech>

Considering that NPHET for Covid-19 was only set up on 27 January 2020, it has done a hell of a lot of good work in that time.  However, it seems unforgivable that an entity set up following the first outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, in 2002 or 2003 has years later, in this instance, proven unfit for purpose.</p> <p>  This morning, the Taoiseach spoke at the National Tourism and Hospitality Expo.  When the media questioned him about the reopening of various sectors he clearly hinted that there will, hopefully, be a reopening of bed and breakfast accommodation, guesthouses and hotels in the June period.  Everyone now wonders how NPHET views bars and restaurants.  When Dr. Glynn answers he might also tell us the logic behind NPHET's differentiation between a gastropub that serves food versus a wet pub.  I understand what is served by both types of pub is rather different but in a health context how do they differ?  I ask because it is a question that we have been asked repeatedly and one for which we do not have a good answer. </p></speech>

At the end of this month we would hope to look again at the data to see how we have gotten through April and will set out a plan for May, June and July.  As part of that we will give consideration to the whole area of hospitality.</p> <p>  In terms of pubs versus gastropubs, NPHET never said one word about a &euro;9 meal but we do have a concern about alcohol in the context of a global pandemic.  Again, I know that I will be painted in the wrong way because of this.  One cannot get away from the fact that when we have a drink or a few drinks we let our guard down.  We drop our guard and are less likely to social distance.  We are less likely to ensure that we follow all of the measures that we should.  Many of these establishments are poorly ventilated.  It involves the mixing of many multiple households.  Whether we like it or not we saw the effect of that at various times last summer and over the Christmas period.</p><p>Unfortunately, and this is not a message anybody wishes to hear, these are high-risk environments in relative terms.  We have to put that in context when we weigh up the risk of further waves, further outbreaks and the risk of super-spreading events versus the need to keep children in school, the need to get the hospital services up and running and the need to protect the most vulnerable until they are vaccinated.  I understand that it is not an easy message.  We all want to go to the pub, but we are not there yet.</p></speech>

I have one minute remaining so I will ask some brief questions.  I consider the digital green certificate to be very positive.  It is a pathway back to a safe resumption of international air travel.  Does Dr. Glynn think Irish people can realistically look forward, beyond a trip with a bucket and spade to the coast or the beach this summer, to having a holiday abroad with the introduction of the digital green certificate?</p> <p>  Finally, NPHET was established on 27 January 2020.  I thank it for what it is doing, but does Dr. Glynn envisage a continued role for NPHET - Dr. Glynn, Dr. Tony Holohan and all the team - beyond the immediate period of next autumn and winter?  He continuously tells us that Covid could be around for five or ten years.  Does he think there will be a need for an advisory body on the shoulder of the Government and the health services for all of that period?</p></speech>

We have a public health role to play and I hope that, as vaccination rolls out and if we can keep incidence low, our role will become less visible, less important and less on the front pages of the newspapers.  That is not where we want to be, contrary to some public opinion.  It is not what we enjoy.  I hope that if we can get the majority of the adult population vaccinated and if disease levels are still low, at that point there will be a step change in the NPHET response.  We need to move away from what has been, essentially, an emergency response to-----</p></speech>

I appreciate it.  I never thought that in my lifetime, and I am a long time on this earth, I would see a pandemic such as this.  This is all new for everybody.  I believe NPHET is doing a great job and I thank it for that.</p> <p>  I do not have a great deal to say.  The concerns I have are about the long-term impact on mental health and the tsunami that will come in the future.  There is no person on this island who has not been impacted in some way.  Many people are struggling with loneliness.  We can also look at the impact on health workers and front-line staff.  I believe we are facing a tsunami of mental health issues.  I have a question, and I realise much of it has been covered today.  Many people are concerned about the rare blood clotting disorder associated with the AstraZenaca vaccine.  As has been said today, this could lead to people refusing the vaccine.  I recently heard that the Taoiseach said the blood clotting disorder is treatable.  I want to check if this is true.  I believe people's minds would be put at rest if they knew that this blood clotting disorder is not fatal.</p><p>If it is true that it is non-fatal and treatable then that is where we should really look at the media.  One hears all the time from the media that AstraZeneca causes blood clots but I would prefer if we could hear that it is going to be okay, that it is treatable, that people are not going to die and that it is more important to deal with the Covid pandemic than to deal with the blood clotting.  I am wondering what the NPHET members' thoughts are on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-04-13a.609" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ronan Glynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2021041300002#U00200"><p>There is still significant uncertainty around the extent to which this is an issue.  From NIAC's perspective, it was conservative; it took all events to date and assumed they were all these very serious clotting events, whereas we do not know that to be the case just yet because some of them remain under investigation.  However, we know that somewhere between four and ten of these events will happen for every million people who are vaccinated.  To date, the EMA has only been notified of approximately one fatality per million people vaccinated.  Therefore, the majority of people - at least of the cases notified to date - with these conditions have survived.  It is a serious condition but the majority of people have, as I said, survived.  To come back to my earlier point, the risk of a person in their 60s dying from Covid is 85% higher than their risk of suffering one of these clotting events and in the event they suffer one it is not a given, as I said, that it will be a fatal event.  Thus the balance is firmly in favour of getting the vaccine for anyone who is offered it.</p></speech>

It may irrelevant; I am not sure.  The North is ahead of us with the roll-out of vaccinations; I think it is now on people who are in their 40s.  Do the NPHET members have any concerns about the North opening up before the South?  Will people be travelling up to the North and maybe going to a few pubs?  What do the members think?  Is it something they are concerned about?</p></speech>

Equally however, while the North is ahead of us, it is moving in a conservative manner as well.  We are not that far behind in terms of our measures.  I know that every week feels like an eternity to people with what is in place but in overall terms we are not that far behind.  If our vaccination programme rolls out as it should over the coming weeks we will catch up as far as our level of protection is concerned.  If we can avoid an increase in incidence over the coming weeks we will be in a position that is very similar so that we will again have an all-island epidemiological unit as opposed to two jurisdictions.</p></speech>

Many of the questions I would have asked have already been asked and I do not intend to go back over that ground.  However, there is a concern now with nursing homes, in the sense that they received their first dose in January, shortly after that got their second and are, to a large extent, fully vaccinated.  The concern is what happens in six months because we do not really know, certainly the public does not, what length of time the immunity will last.  Has NPHET given any consideration to the period beyond the next six months, particularly in regard to nursing homes?</p> <p>  I will ask my second question then invite observations from the NPHET members.  From their perspective and from a public health one, I am quite concerned about a particular matter, though perhaps it is unfounded.  We are seeing vaccination centres for vulnerable people and vulnerable people being vaccinated in Dublin.  That is a good thing and anyone being vaccinated is very welcome.</p><p>When one sees vulnerable people travelling from Donegal to Dublin to be vaccinated, however, it does not make sense.  We are talking about a four-hour journey in both directions and it is most likely that those vulnerable people will have to be transported.  Surely there is a risk and a concern in that regard.</p></speech>

Our current position is that people can reasonably expect to be protected for a period of up to six months after being fully vaccinated.  In fact, I would be hopeful that the duration of protection will extend far beyond that but we simply have not had enough time to collect that data because people have not been vaccinated for long enough yet.  The evidence is promising and this is something we are monitoring on a monthly to six-weekly basis.

Obviously, there will be protocols in place and recommendations and so on.  This is work that NPHET should be engaged on at present because regardless of whether hospitality reopens in May or June for outside dining, we all hope it is going to happen at some stage in the coming months.  I am sure, with the evolution of the virus, we will be looking at new recommendations in terms of tables being 1 ft. or 2 ft. apart, a certain number of people per table and so forth.  Is preparatory work being done on this?  To be fair to the hospitality industry, some prior notice will be needed.  The Government should also be given some prior notice because financial supports may have to be put in place to accommodate any new recommendations or changes.</p></speech>

I accept the Senator's point, which was also made earlier, that various sectors need time to anticipate their reopening and the form it will take.  Hopefully, at the end of this month, if the disease remains stable or indeed, improves over the coming weeks, we will be in a position to set out a plan for May, June and beyond so that various sectors can see, in broad terms, when they can expect to be reopening all or parts of their businesses.</p></speech>

I wish to first ask about the stillbirths that have been connected with Covid.  We know that seven cases of  coronavirus-related infection of the placenta have been detected here in Ireland.  Unfortunately, that resulted in six stillbirths and one baby being delivered by emergency C-section.  I believe that these seven cases make up one third of the global cases.  Do the witnesses have a view on why that rate of Covid-related stillbirth is happening in Ireland?  Why is it being detected here and not being detected in other countries?</p><p>It is a very unusual pattern.  On that point, will the Department make any recommendations regarding the vaccination of pregnant women or any other measures that should be put in place given these very worrying findings?</p></speech>

There is a difference between seeing something and reporting it.  We have certainly always been very good at reporting here.  The reasons for this are not entirely clear.  What is clear is that these cases emerged during a period in which there was a massive increase in the incidence of the disease and when community transmission was widespread with a new variant.  Beyond that, it is difficult to identify the precise reasons this was seen here while other jurisdictions have not yet reported it.  The matter remains under investigation by colleagues in the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and in the women and infants programme of the HSE.</p> <p>  I want to reassure women and their partners that the experience in this country with regard to maternity care and Covid has been very positive.  We have had no maternal deaths over the past year and we hope that will continue.  Women who have been diagnosed with Covid should make their medical practitioners aware of that diagnosis and follow all the protocols that are in place in that regard.  </p> <p>  The Senator's second question was about vaccinations.  NIAC is keeping the issue under active review.  Any woman who is at high or very high risk because of an underlying condition will have been prioritised for vaccination.  Beyond that, NIAC is keeping the matter under review.  It would be a significant move forward to decide to vaccinate all pregnant women on the basis of information that is, to date, very limited, albeit concerning.  We need to collect more information both in Ireland and internationally with regard to the issue.</p></speech>

The reason we are reporting it is that our colleagues in pathology have followed up on these cases very assiduously and have investigated them and reported them.

Our public health colleagues in the HSE are very clear that the centres have had a positive impact.  As we continue with them, which we certainly need to do, the challenge is to ensure that local politicians, local stakeholders and local organisations get behind the centres each time they are set up in the area.  We need to ensure they raise awareness and ensure that people know the centres are there and what their purpose is so that they will come forward and get tested.</p><p>The Senator asked about the average positivity rate.  Almost 30,000 people have gone through the various centres since the end of March and almost 800 positive cases have been identified to date.  The overall positivity rate is approximately 2.8%.  The rate varies from site to site but, generally speaking, the positivity rates have been between 1.5% and 5.5%.</p></speech>

Has there been a reduction in the rate of community transmission?  With the first wave of these pop-up centres, has a real difference been seen?  I know areas with high incidence rates were being targeted.</p></speech>

Certainly our public health colleagues in the HSE are saying they have seen a very significant improvement in local level engagement, the willingness of people to come forward more generally and awareness among people in those communities of the need to isolate and get tested if they develop symptoms.  Everything I am seeing suggests the centres have been a positive development and I think we need to continue with them in the weeks to come.</p></speech>

We have been pleasantly surprised by the profile of the disease over the past week but there is uncertainty around that because of the nature of the week in question.  We will have to monitor the situation in the coming weeks.  Although there are people who do not wish to hear it, our bigger concern about schools reopening is not so much the impact of what might happen in schools themselves on transmission and the R number but, specifically, that wider society will take it as a message that they can return to their workplaces and to other forms of mobility and social contact.  We are asking parents, guardians and others across society to please continue to work from home because, in the context of what we want to do and are trying to do more broadly as a society and while I understand that many people would prefer to be in a workplace than to be at home, working from home is a really powerful thing that people can do to contribute to keeping this under control in the coming weeks.  Professor Nolan may wish to come in on this issue.</p></speech>

All present understand why that was the case.  We will not necessarily see any increase in the incidence of disease, provided that people do not take the return to school as an opportunity to return to the workplace, as Dr. Glynn pointed out.  The other positive thing we are seeing in mobility data is far more outdoors activity.  If people read the signals well and get out and about for their socialisation and mental health rather than doing anything indoors, we could well keep the disease under control for the next couple of weeks with schools open.</p></speech>

Those in the eye of the storm are usually in the best position to tell us how and when it can be done better.  I also compliment the very large cohort of people who have observed the regulations to the letter.  Again and again, they made the sacrifices, stayed indoors and kept socially distancing.  A minority of people did not do so.  Of course, that is always the case.</p> <p>  At this stage, we must look cold and hard at what lies ahead.  In the next four, five or six weeks, there may be some indication of resurgence in certain areas.  I do not know whether that will be the case.  What would be the best thing to do in the case of an indication of resurgence of the virus in various locations throughout the country?</p></speech>

We need to continue to deploy this where there are issues of concern.  Increasingly, we need to give further voice to our local health colleagues on the ground.  We in NPHET have become the face of this response over the past year.  The people doing the actual work, and the people who really need to be thanked, are those who have been following up every case and every outbreak all across the country in departments of public health, those in the contact tracing centres and the people across all the various elements of the response.  We need to facilitate and empower our local public health leaders to come forward on local radio and in local media so that people understand what is happening in their communities.</p><p> The third aspect, which reflects the earlier comments, is that time and again we have seen that the vast majority of people in Ireland understand what is going on with this disease and they understand when things are taking a turn for the worse.  They listen to us when we voice our concerns.  They might not want to hear the message but they listen to the message.  When we say, "Look, we are seeing a signal and we have increasing concern so please pull back a little bit and please decrease your social contacts", at a population level people have responded to that time and again.  That, more than anything else, is what has defined the response to this.  When this is all done, that is what we should proudly look back on as a country.  The way people come together in communities and in solidarity will be the key to getting us to where we need to be over the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

The longer this continues the more desperate it becomes and the more disheartened the public will become.  We must make some crucial intervention to try to ensure we do not allow it to continue.  In the event of there being an unprecedented upsurge of the virus in the next two to five weeks, what do we do?</p></speech>

I sincerely hope that we will not be in the position described by the Deputy.  The things that people can do now are, by and large, very safe activities such as meeting up outside, travelling within the county for outdoor activities, and children going back to school to what have proven time and again to be low-risk environments.  I have no doubt that the next few weeks will not be straightforward.  We will have ups and downs, but we will continue to respond to that.  Ultimately, our local public health colleagues and the population generally will respond to that.  I am very hopeful that we can keep this under control and get to where we need to be in June, July and onwards from there.</p></speech>

This is a key part of the NPHET analysis every week.  We cannot exclude a possibility like that.  We know that this will be the headline - that I cannot rule out a further lockdown.  We are not predicting another lockdown.  We do not want to go backwards with these measures, but we must respond robustly if we see an issue.  The key points in what we do or do not do, and the key points in whatever measures are eased through May and June, is that we need to continue to keep a focus insofar as possible on outdoor activities, and where there are indoor activities, that they are controlled and avoid the criteria and conditions that facilitate super-spreader events.  Given the incidence we have currently, it would require only a small number of super-spreader events, and particularly a superspreader event with a variant, to get us into trouble.  We are in a very good position.  We are third best in Europe by incidence at the moment and I am hopeful that we can stay there.</p><p>There are uncertainties, however, and we need to continue to review and respond.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for the presentation and for the information they have provided.</p> <p>  Today is the 198th day of workplace closure in this State.  If one compares and contrasts the number of days and the length of time and the severity of our lockdowns, they are significantly higher than in any other European country at the moment.  I understand that the characteristics of Ireland's health service, population, etc., are different from those of many other European countries, but it still remains true that the policies chosen here are radical outliers in international terms.  The WHO has even said that lockdowns should not be the main coronavirus defence and yet we have literally had one since December.  In formulating the policies relating to the restrictions in this country, what comparative analysis had NPHET carried out in respect of other European countries?</p></speech>

We are not out of line with their approaches.  The difference between us and those countries is that we had an enormous surge in December and January that we are still recovering from.  Many of those countries are now undergoing an enormous surge while we are in a much better position.  For example, schools are closed in many of those countries at present.  There will be plenty of time for in-depth analysis when this is all done.  I am confident that if we can keep things positive and going in the right direction over the coming weeks, the analysis of our epidemiological performance versus other countries will show that the measures taken were, by and large, the correct ones.  That is not for a second to discount the very significant impact this has had on various sectors within our economy.</p></speech>

While workplace closures here are, according to Reuters, for example, far longer than in other European countries, there is little difference between morbidity and mortality rates between countries such as Germany and Ireland.  I understand that waves have happened at different times but, in general, many countries have managed to lock down far less and without the massive cost that we would imagine that would bring.  The policies in Ireland are outliers in the context of Europe.</p></speech>

In broad terms, we are not outliers in terms of epidemiological performance.  If one looks at schools, nobody would argue that they should have opened before they did given what happened.  What happened in December and January happened and we had to respond to that in epidemiological terms.  We did not want to respond.  The last thing we ever want to do is give advice that, for example, schools should not open or that businesses need to close.  We understand that no one wants to hear that but at a point in time, looking at the data, morbidity and mortality, we give public health advice.  Contrary to some perceptions, we give advice based on our assessment of the public health position and there are always wider considerations.</p></speech>

I thought I was going to get to ask a couple of questions.</p><p>I have not had the opportunity to ask any questions.  We do not have the time.  I need to finish up the meeting.  Apologies to end on a negative note.</p><p> First, on behalf of the committee, I thank our guests and apologise again for the technical issues we had today.  The witnesses have passed on some really good information to the committee today, particularly around the numbers of deaths, which are down.  Do we know why?  Is it linked to the number of cases of people who are getting Covid-19?  Perhaps Dr. Glynn could come back to us on that.  Is it down to the hospitals and medical staff getting more experience in dealing with Covid-19?</p><p> There is really positive work, for example, the initiative around people who are asymptomatic and the introduction of walk-in centres.  We need to do more around encouraging more people to use those centres.  Again, it is probably a role not only for public representatives but something in which the community can be involved.  I am concerned about some areas.  I know of one in Dublin where something like 150 people used the walk-in centre.  One might look at an area such as Finglas, where 6% of those captured had Covid-19.  There is, therefore, much positive work.</p><p> The biggest concern many of us have is that we are losing people with regard to many of the restrictions, the logic of which people do not understand.  For instance, we are allowing children to go back to school.  If one looks at the figures of the outdoor transmission of Covid-19, however, people will say we are allowing children back into schools but they cannot go out for a game of hurling in the yard with their friends or whatever.  Those types of issues concern people.  Bookshops have some suppliers that are open while others are not.  Many issues out there could probably be addressed.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their work.  It has been really useful for the committee to get their feedback.  Again, we would appreciate if Dr. Glynn could forward that information on the modelling.  I thank him and his colleagues.</p><p> That concludes our business for today.  The meeting now stands adjourned until 3.30 p.m. next Tuesday, 20 April, when we will get a briefing from the HSE and the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, on the roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccine, which we covered today.  Again, I thank all present and look forward to seeing members at the private meeting this afternoon.</p></speech>
