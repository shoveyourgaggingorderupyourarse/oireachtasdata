He is joined today by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  I have not had an opportunity to review the minutes of the previous two meetings.  I propose we hold them over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with briefing material and opening statements.  Nos. 2249A, 2256A, 2257A, 2258A and 2259A are from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish those.  </p> <p>  No. 2255A is from Mr. Allen Morgan and provides an opening statement for this afternoon&rsquo;s private meeting.  We will note this item and discuss whether to publish it during the course of the meeting this afternoon.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.</p><p>No. 2161B dated 10 May, which was held over from previous meetings on 13 May and 13 June, is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the higher Education Authority.  It encloses the report regarding the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities undertaken by Mazars.  We have already noted and published this item but it was held over for discussion if any member of committee would like to discuss it briefly.  I know one or two members with a particular interest in this matter are not here.  We have noted and published it but we will hold it over in case any wants to discuss it.  For anybody who is interested in the document, it has already been noted and published.  We might have a further detailed discussion about it at the next meeting.</p><p> No. 2201B dated 31 May 2019 is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the most substantial item of correspondence we have today.  It encloses a minute from the Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on periodic report No. 5 of the Committee of Public Accounts, which covered our meetings from September to November 2018.  The report was published by the committee in March 2019 and I welcome the prompt response, which we received at the end of May, as I said.  I will go through the comprehensive letter.  I reiterate that organisations present their accounts to the committee after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We discuss their accounts but that the public meeting of the committee is not the end of the matter.  We proceed to examine the matter in further detail, prepare a report or chapter on each meeting we have and publish the report with recommendations.  We send that to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who prepares a formal response to our recommendations in consultation with the relevant Departments, which is then submitted to the committee.  We now have the response from the Minister.  We take these responses seriously and committee members will make a number of observations.  I will go through each of the report's recommendation.</p></speech>

I have gone through the report and I do not expect the committee to go through all 20 pages in public session.  I will highlight the key points and if members would like clarification about certain matters, that can be done subsequently.  I would like to clear this today.  There are one or two points that invite follow up.</p> <p>  We received this 20-page document before our previous meeting.  I will explain and put it in context.  Our report included chapters on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the President's establishment, Teagasc, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Higher Education Authority, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We made recommendations in each chapter and the Minister has responded to the committee having consulted the various Departments as to whether our recommendations are accepted.  Practically all of the recommendations were accepted and only one or two were rejected.  We want to deal with those issues.</p> <p>  Our first recommendation dealt with NAMA.  The agency's lack of systematic and routine verification of declarations under section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 was unacceptable and we recommended that NAMA put in place a system to verify these declarations for the remainder of its operation.  This was one of the most discussed recommendations.  The Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform rejects this recommendation and has set out his reasons for doing so.  We noted that we were conscious that NAMA had published its annual accounts recently and 95% of its work had been completed.  We noted it was expecting a surplus at the end of its operation in the order of &euro;4 billion and that we were making our recommendation for the remainder of NAMA's work.  The reason given by the Minister for rejecting the recommendation is that providing purchaser compliance with the section 172 agreement would necessitate a comprehensive asset search of every purchaser of NAMA secured assets and would be time-consuming.  He stated the delay could jeopardise any purchase sales and that the process would involve a comprehensive verification of purchaser confirmations and would appear to imply that NAMA does not regard purchaser's written confirmations as having much standing.  He stated the recommendation operates a presumption that many purchasers of NAMA secured assets are willfully breaking the law on this issue.  The committee will write to NAMA about that.  Before Deputy Catherine Murphy speaks about it, I will give my own view on the matter.  By asking for a verification, the committee did not at any stage suggest that NAMA-secured clients were wilfully breaking the law.  That is attributing to us an assumption that we never made.  The Chairman of NAMA was a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue has a self-assessment system in place and does spot checks now and again.  That does not mean there is a presumption that all taxpayers are wilfully breaking the law.  We were only suggesting some verification.  We never suggested that everyone was wilfully breaking the law and I reject the implication to that effect that the Minister has thrown back at this committee.</p> <p>  The Minister goes on to say that NAMA is taking steps on this matter, in particular to ensure that the purchaser is the same party that executed the contract for sale.  The party executing a contract for sale might not be the same party that completed the purchase agreement.  It was NAMA which spotted that.  The document also notes that NAMA expects new regulations to be in place under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019 on 22 November.  A central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies will be publicly available at that stage.  Even at EU level, there is acceptance of the need for some verification but that will not happen until the end of November when NAMA will be nearly finished its work.  </p> <p>  I want to counter any suggestion that has been attributed to this committee by NAMA that we were even remotely making a presumption that people were wilfully breaking the law.  We never made any such presumption.</p></speech>

I pointed out, in the section 226 report, that it is very restricted legislation.  It only applies to a sale by NAMA, not by a borrower or a receiver.  It only applies to the sale of a property and not the sale of a loan.  There are definitions of connected persons or debtors for the purposes of the section.  Because NAMA sells loans rather than property, what it has tried to do is to extend that principle to loan sales and it is to be commended on that.  That means that, while there is a legal structure there and a potential that, if NAMA were selling property, there would be some infringement or criminal offence, it is not in the same league when it has applied the same approach or looked for the same declarations in relation to the sale of a loan.  It is very complicated.  Any infringement or irregularity in a declaration that was made around the sale of a loan would not, strictly, be an offence under section 172.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#B01300"><p>I do not think people fully appreciated the need for a section 172 declaration when the legislation was drafted.  It exists on the sale of assets but does not exist, and was not contemplated, for loans.  NAMA has put in place some internal structures to try to capture some of that, even thought it is not specifically covered in the legislation.</p><p>On Project Nantes, we received correspondence which highlighted the difference between the sale of a loan and an asset.  There is a particular distinction, of which we were not aware up to that point.  Mr. McCarthy is working on-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00200"><p>I am working on a report on Project Nantes.  Another issue that arose in that regard was what was a connected person for the purposes of section 172.  However, section 172 only applies to the sale of a property by NAMA.  That is not what was happening in Project Nantes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00300"><p>The advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers was that a director of the same company might not necessarily be a connected person.  It was stated a director of a similar company might have been involved in the purchase of a loan.  However, under the legislation, a director may be and, in many cases, is a connected person, but that is not always the case.  We are getting into distinctions some people will follow.  Their job is to tease out the detail of the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00400"><p>Essentially, the legislation was presented in a particular light.  The expectation was that anyone who was the original owner and transferred to NAMA would not become the beneficial owner again at a reduced price.  That is shorthand for how it was presented.  NAMA is probably being blamed for a shortfall in the legislation and in anticipating how things would play out.  The public expectation was that a person would not be able to buy back a loan at less than its face value before the discount.  That was an important assurance that was given.  The criticism may be focused on NAMA and that may be legally wrong.  At least one Garda investigation is under way and it probably relates to the circumstances outlined in a reply I received to a parliamentary question which states NAMA concluded its investigations and is satisfied that no breach occurred.  What it is stating is right from its perspective.  I have not listened to the definition, but the allegation is that a person is back in control of an asset that was substantially discounted.</p> <p>  Another aspect relates to SI 110/2019 under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  This information was also contained in the reply to my parliamentary question.  Essentially, we are told that there will be a central register of beneficial ownership information.  I do not think it will be backdated, but it will be of great importance in knowing who are the beneficial owners.  As was identified when we discussed the matter of connected persons, there is a deficiency in the law and a gap in terms of what the expectation was and knowing who is the beneficial owner.  I have no doubt that some people are back in control of their assets.  It may be that the loan was sold and that there was a second transaction.  If examples are being identified, it may be down to a flaw in the legislation.  It is very frustrating to see such practices, particularly where people can point to things that others were able to do that they were not.  That is certainly not the way the public expected the legislation to work in practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00500"><p>The Deputy is correct in that regard.  It is strange that we are almost at the end of the NAMA story and 95% of the issue has been dealt with, but this issue is only coming out now.  When the legislation was being drafted, it was decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency.  I know that the asset was the loan, but people were thinking of properties and the sale thereof when the legislation was being enacted.  The sale of loans was not as common at the time as it is today.  It is only with the passage of time that it has become more widespread.  Financial institutions around the world are no longer buying property assets from each other; rather, they are buying loans that control the assets.  That was probably not envisaged from a business perspective when the NAMA legislation was being drafted.  As these practices became more common, the legislation should, perhaps, have been amended.  We might ask NAMA to comment on this matter.  We accept what it states.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019, but they will only apply to companies incorporated here; therefore, there is a limit straightaway in dealing with this issue.  It would be interesting to know how much of the disposal of NAMA's entire portfolio consisted of loan sales which were not covered by section 172 and how much consisted of the sale of assets through receivers or the owners of the assets selling and making good their loans.  Mr. McCarthy may know those details.  In other words, what percentage of NAMA's activity was loan sales by it which were not strictly covered by section 172?  Does Mr. McCarthy have that information or should we seek it directly from NAMA?</p></speech>

The Oireachtas drafted the legislation, not NAMA.

We drew attention to the fact that there was no verification process thereafter.  NAMA has outlined some of the constraints and practicalities that apply.

When the NAMA Bill was going through the Houses, I was in the Senate and said that this is all new territory and I would not be surprised if, as things evolved, there needed to be a NAMA No. 2 or No. 3 Bill.  There never was.  Perhaps it is my conspiratorial mind, but there is form here.  We are having this exact discussion on the oversight of the IBRC liquidation.  Given the way the legislation is written, history will record that Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly and the NAMA team have done an exceptional job.  It is us who did not do such a good job in providing the necessary oversight and agility in that regard.  History will also record that the overall effect of authorities in Northern Ireland extracting the building industry from the NAMA process here, notwithstanding any ongoing criminal investigations, allowed them to do deals all over the place and get back to normality an awful lot quicker than us.</p> <p>  Sadly, without the appropriate oversight, the only reflection mechanisms we have in this country are tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation.  That is a failing in NAMA, but it is not a failing of the leadership of NAMA, who, under the legislation, has done as good a job as it could.  It was envisaged that it would take 20 years and might make &euro;1 billion; it will now be done in ten to 12 years and will make a profit of &euro;4 billion.  Those are the headline figures but there are a lot of individual stories where people may have gripes about how they were dealt with; the courts will deal with those.  </p> <p>  There is form here, however.  On reflection, we feel that the Oireachtas got it wrong, but we are doing precisely the same with the IBRC liquidation, except we have been highlighting it for two years now without any progress.</p></speech>

The spirit of section 172 could never have played out, and NAMA would have seen that most directly.  We have all been knocking on doors recently, and I have noticed a gap in the planning legislation in relation to strategic projects.  It is a small thing but when one notices it, one has to ask how it can be dealt with.  I would have thought that part of NAMA's remit would be to make sure that the public got the absolute maximum.  If something was bought and then quite quickly sold to the original owner for a fraction of-----</p></speech>

The mechanism was not effective and there was a further onus on the body, because it was aware that the mechanism was defective.  That is the point I started to make.

The sponsoring Department had to be aware of this from its ongoing contact with NAMA.  It is impossible that the Department was not aware of this.  I do not blame NAMA but it was impossible for the Department not to have been acutely aware of this issue all along.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted it in his report, NAMA's legal advice is clear and the legal advice in the Oireachtas is clear.  The Department must have understood the position for years; it is the Department that should have spotted this.  We will see it three or four more times, where the issues we have highlighted are essentially deficiencies in the legislation that the various Departments should have dealt with.  We have had a good discussion and will note the response.</p> <p>  The next recommendation is the final one in relation to NAMA.</p></speech>

I was shown a schedule of what was offered to each local authority by NAMA, the houses that were taken up and the reason for the rejection of particular houses in specific locations.  Some of them were expensive properties in the wrong locations and in other cases there was no infrastructure in place to service the sites.  My local authority was able to explain satisfactorily to me.  Every local authority should able to do likewise because they have the same information.  The Deputy asked that NAMA be requested to provide a list of the 7,000 properties.  That would be a long list.  I do not want to put undue work on the system.  I suggest that she asks her local authority for a list of what was accepted and rejected by it in regard to the offer by NAMA.</p></speech>

If anyone wants further detail on it, we will provide it.  </p> <p>  The next issue in our periodic report is the President's Establishment in respect of which the committee made a recommendation on the audit committee that did not meet.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the recommendation is accepted and the audit committee is now up and running.  The next recommendation - which is a key recommendation - is in regard to there being no statutory audit of the &euro;317,000 residential allowance paid from the Central Fund, which is granted to the Presidential Establishment under statutory instrument.  The Minister for Finance notes the recommendation that relates to non-voted expenditure from the Central Fund is administered by his Department and does not require D&aacute;il approval.  The Minister has further informed the committee that while the allowance for the President's Establishment is established the principle of paying an allowance from non-voted central funds is established in the Presidential Establishment Act 1938 and any amendment would require a change to primary legislation.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to draft legislation but it is open to any Oireachtas Member to draft a Private Members' Bill to deal with the issue.  This committee has taken this as far as it can.  We are now in a situation whereby legislation is the issue.  It is a legislative matter for the Oireachtas.  Members can choose to follow it up if they so choose.  The committee has done its bit on it.</p></speech>

It is now &euro;317,000 per annum.  This is not about the current President any more than it is about Douglas Hyde.  It is about appropriate oversight.  There are expenses associated with the Presidency, be that wardrobe expenses and so on, that I am sure the public would support and understand.  The value that the President gives in terms of promoting Ireland internally and abroad, at &euro;12 million, is cheap but the &euro;317,000 allowance does not help the complexion when we are here trying to sort out other issues.  I appreciate it is not the committee's function to legislate.  I may consider bringing forth a Private Members' Bill which, hopefully, will get cross-party support.  I am again at pains to point out and underline that this is not about the current President anymore than it is about any previous or future President but it is a matter that needs to be rectified.</p></speech>

First, 12 months ago one would have thought that this allowance was established for the current President in his previous term but it had to pointed out that it dates back to 1938.  It not having been administered in a public fashion did not afford the President, as a candidate, any protection in regard to it.  It is the responsibility of the Houses not to put the current President or future Presidents in the position of having to set up an independent committee.  There is no doubt goodwill has been shown on the part of the President, as we said at the time.</p> <p>  Second, in regard to the committee's recommendation that this allowance be considered under Vote 1, therefore making it subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, did the Department think we were suggesting it just be shoved into that Vote?  Of course, it requires a change in legislation.</p></speech>

This fund is paid from the Central Fund, which does not go through a Vote in the Oireachtas.  In addition to the President's allowance, the Central Fund also includes payments for the Judiciary and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am a layman, but the President's Establishment, the Judiciary, and the Comptroller and Auditor General are three independent constitutional offices.  It is probably to ensure the independence of those offices from the political argy-bargy that could go on in the D&aacute;il if judges' salaries had to go through it every year during the debate on Estimates.  Whether it is right or wrong, it is an effort to keep the independence of the-----</p></speech>

The Chairman cannot say there was not.  That may be the intention but it is not how it played out.</p></speech>

That is the only aspect of it that is different from the others.  The amount paid to those officeholders is published and known because it is a salary, whereas this allowance has a different character.</p></speech>

There might have been political argy-bargy, or it might have been interpreted as such, but it is not our fault it ended up being the only issue in the presidential campaign.  It was a fairly dead campaign anyway.  I voted for the incumbent, so it is not about that any more than it is about Douglas Hyde.  The Department is coming back with the usual statement that it has been noted.  For the Department, "note" is just another word for a rejection, because that is what it is doing.  The Department is saying it is not accepting this, and wishing us good luck.  We need to have some amount of money that is available to the President for him or her to do with what he or she wants.  I do not have a problem with that.  It is great that there is an independent internal committee, and I have looked on the website too, but those are broad brush strokes.  I first raised this before the presidential election, and I am not saying that we necessarily want to see what every shilling was spent on, but I would be happy if the Comptroller and Auditor General did.  It might not be for public consumption, but if the Comptroller and Auditor General is able to say that he has audited it and is happy, that is enough.  On that basis, I might, perhaps in a private capacity, consider an amendment to the Presidential Establishment Act.</p></speech>

The next item relates to Teagasc.  The committee recommended that Teagasc ensures procurement processes are complied with, and that has been accepted in full.  We spotted an issue, and that has been accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation states:</p><blockquote>The committee recommends that a more sustainable method for establishing funds for both (a) infrastructural maintenance and (b) longer term capital projects be developed by Teagasc, in consultation with relevant Government Departments.</blockquote> <p>The Minister has accepted that, but he also notes that there is an annual Estimates process, so that is an issue for long-term planning as the Estimates are an annual process.  However, the Department accepts what we are saying.</p><p>We then move on to the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We made a recommendation relating to the new headquarters for the Department of Health, the Miesian Plaza, that there be more engagement and consultation with the staff of any public body.  We felt adequate consultation between the OPW and the Department of Health did not occur in this case.  That is fully accepted and the Minister has informed us that the OPW intends to pilot a changed management consultancy approach for single, large-scale relocation programmes, which will improve the lines of communication.  That is good.Recommendation 8 also deals with the Miesian Plaza and the fact that there was an overpayment of &euro;10 million due to the measurements used in the project.  The OPW accepts that recommendation and the Minister informs us that an independent review of all the final copies of all leases against what was originally agreed in the original terms prior to the lease agreement will be implemented, and has already been implemented in new leases.</p><p>We will move on to the next recommendation, which states:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the development of business cases by the Office of Public Works in relation to major projects include a robust analysis of key options and alternatives, plus associated costs, as required under the public spending code.</blockquote> <p>That is accepted.  The OPW further states that, as part of the sanction process, the technical aspects of their cost effectiveness analyses were reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to sanction being given.  On the issue of leasing properties versus purchasing them, the OPW has carried out detailed assessments of two recent major projects.  That matter is being examined and it has started looking at the long-term benefits of buying or building versus leasing.  It is looking at that, but that is something the Oireachtas is always going to have to keep a regular eye on in future, because it is not a once-off issue.</p><p>Next, we recommended that legislation should be implemented on a timely matter-----</p></speech>

There are better value locations and higher cost locations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#F01700"><p>The next chapter in the report relates to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We had a discussion on the new single public service pension scheme.  We were critical of the fact that the Department had not carried out its work before the legislation was passed, and it has accepted that completely.  The Department says that, due to other pressures, it did not have the resources available to support the implementation of the legislation.  That is dreadful.  It goes on to say that the Department undertook a comprehensive analysis of the public service bodies to be included in the legislation in 2018, which was two years after the legislation was passed.  It says it submitted a report to the Committee of Public Accounts in February 2019 and the only outstanding issue was the Dental Council of Ireland, which we dealt with last week.  The Department has given us a complete update and that matter is now closed, but is only closed because of the committee's close scrutiny of the particular issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had highlighted that, so at least that topic is now fully closed and being dealt with as a result of our vigilance on the matter.</p><p>The next item also deals with the single pension scheme.  We recommended that consideration be given to investing these pension funds in a fund similar to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It fully accepts this recommendation but the Department says it is a complex matter and would be a major change in approach for funding public sector pensions as contributions under the single pension public pension scheme are slightly different from the old arrangement.  The Department further states:</p><blockquote>Given the complexity of the matter, a substantial time and resource investment is required in order to ensure that the correct approach is arrived at. Accordingly, while this matter is progressing, it will not be concluded in the short term. The Department can update the PAC on progress, as required.</blockquote> <p>If somebody wants to come forward with amending legislation on how that fund is invested, that would be a matter for any Member of the House or of this committee, but not for the Committee of Public Accounts itself.  We have highlighted the issue and the matter is now being examined.</p><p>The next item relates to leasing, and again to the Miesian Plaza.  We were not satisfied that the balance between leasing properties and the acquisition of properties was correct and it accepts that fully.  It has commenced a review, and has conducted a detailed assessment on two major projects recently.  That recommendation is accepted by the Department, but we again have to follow its implementation.</p><p>The next issue refers to the credibility of the annual Estimates.  We recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should work closely with Departments with a history of requesting Supplementary Estimates, in order to ensure the Estimates presented to the Oireachtas are accurate from the outset.  It notes that and hears what we are saying but does not want to accept that it presented inaccurate Estimates.  I did not expect it to accept that, though we believe it.</p><p>It is saying &quot;We hear what you say.&quot;  We will ask for information on what is stated about the Department of Health because the Department of Health requires the biggest Supplementary Estimates each year.  The bottom of page 9 states:</p><blockquote>The creation of a new oversight group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform, to monitor spending and act as an early warning mechanism [in respect of the Department of Health Vote].<br /><br />Monthly spending reports from Health to be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health each month, and<br /><br />A quarterly health financial management memo to Government, to update Government on the overall health position.</blockquote><p>I note the Government is voicing concern over health expenditure overruns at a much earlier stage in the year than was historically the case.  I propose writing to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it to give us the background to this oversight group on the health Vote - who is on it; who chairs it and what its instructions are.  I am pleased to see it is there, but this is the first I had heard of it and we now see it in print.  Let us find out more about it.<br/><br/>On the Estimates, we recommended &quot;that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform takes all necessary steps to ensure that the Estimates are approved by the Oireachtas before the beginning of the calendar year to which they relate&quot;.<br/><br/>The letter notes this recommendation and states that the Estimates for 2019 were &quot;published before the end of 2018 [on] 19 December 2018&quot;, which is fine.  That is only the first step of the process, however.  There is then the Revised Estimates process, which can include extra matters.  They were published normally in February and go on for debate.  We need to get the exact dates of when the Revised Estimates were published for the past two or three years, what the plan for next year is, and when the debate on the Revised Estimate can take place in the Oireachtas committee.  While the Estimates are published early on, there is no D&aacute;il debate on them until several months into the year when the Revised Estimates come out.  The European Union has set timetables.  We will ask for more specific details on the timetable for discussing and approving the Estimates, including the Revised Estimates by the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>On the Higher Education Authority we recommended &quot;that, when drafting Higher Education Authority legislation, the Department of Education and Skills ensures that the Higher Education Authority is granted sufficient powers to allow it to provide effective oversight of the third level sector&quot;.  That came as a result of the investigation into Waterford Institute of Technology.  It fully accepted the recommendation and gave two pages of detailed response, referring to a number of changes to legislation.  It states:</p><blockquote>Currently, a Memorandum for Government is being drafted with the aim of submitting this for approval in June 2019.  This Memorandum will seek approval for:- the updating of the Higher Education Act, 1971 and the broad policy approach being adopted,<br /><br />- the inclusion of a review power for the HEA in the legislation,<br /><br />- the publication of the consultation report.</blockquote><p>That is important.  We highlighted practical issues over what is happening with spending.  Here we find the legislation was deficient in the first place and it is now being corrected.  Quite a bit of what we are uncovering in terms of following the taxpayers' money has its problems in defective or inadequate legislation in the first place.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to draft the legislation; our job is to highlight it.  It is up to the Oireachtas, any Member of the Oireachtas or the Government to act accordingly.  We have taken it as far as we can.<br/><br/>The next issue also relates to the HEA.  We recommended &quot;that the governing bodies of third level institutions acquire and maintain the appropriate skills&quot; etc.  It fully accepts that there should be an appropriate skills mix.  The governing bodies should identify gaps themselves.  There should be an annual self-assessment of the board.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, greater emphasis has been given to this issue.  This matter needs to be included in the proposed Higher Education Authority legislation.  Hopefully it will be.<br/><br/>We come to the Revenue Commissioners.  We had a recommendation for reducing the threshold at which they deem people to be high-wealth individuals for investigation.  They fully accept the recommendation.  We had a good outcome last week.  They wrote to us last week saying they had done it and increased the number of cases now under this as a result of reducing the threshold from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million for high-wealth individuals to be examined by the large cases division.  There were 200 cases involved.  This has resulted in another 475 being added, which is a very big increase.  That is now being implemented and we dealt with that in correspondence last week.  That is a very good outcome.<br/><br/>We recommended &quot;that Revenue investigates the possibility of developing guidelines regarding out of court settlements for tax avoidance schemes in order to ensure a level of consistency in reaching such settlements in future&quot;.  We discussed this matter.  It is in our report, so people will remember what we are talking about.  The Revenue Commissioners stated that in the majority of cases, like the ones we are talking about, there were out-of-court settlements and they reached settlements of &euro;500 million in those cases.  Maybe we did not delve into the detail.  They say they have detailed compliance notes on that.  The letter states that Chapter 8 of Revenue's &quot;Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions&quot; deals with that.  We are pleased to see that.<br/><br/>On high-wealth individuals, we recommended that &quot;consideration is given to requiring High Wealth Individuals to provide Revenue with an annual statement of assets held in Ireland&quot;.  It states this would require a legislative change.  Here we are.  We highlighted a legitimate issue.  When we delve into our stuff, again the problem is that the legislation does not cover it.  It is not the Revenue's fault.  I am highlighting that if any Member wants to deal with that topic by way of legislation, he or she should feel free to do so.  It accepts the reality that it is a legislative issue that needs to be dealt with.<br/><br/>The next recommendation for the Revenue Commissioners dealt with the tobacco trade and the very low level of fines, which we felt were not a deterrent.  They accept the recommendation, which is good.  The response states, &quot;The imposition of these penalties in individual cases is a matter for the Courts.&quot;  Tax represents 80% of the cost of a packet of cigarettes.  The Revenue Commissioners raise &euro;1.4 billion in tax from tobacco products each year.  They estimate that 13% of all cigarettes smoked in Ireland are illegal.  Revenue estimates the loss to the taxpayer at approximately &euro;229 million per annum.  Between January and October of last year when we were doing our work, in the cases they prosecuted they followed up about &euro;23 million worth of cases, which meant that 93% of their estimate of what was illegal was not detected or followed up on.  Fines were issued for &euro;140,000, which is fairly abysmal.  They say it is up to the judges and the fines will be increased.  I feel there is not sufficient detection of the issue if there is that level of revenue loss.<br/><br/>The next item also related to the Revenue Commissioners.  We recommended &quot;that the Minister considers whether separate identification of trading losses forward and capital allowances can be provided for in future legislation&quot;.  Under the legislation, any business that has losses from a previous year can carry it forward against future profits to reduce its taxable profits in a future year.  Most people accept that if a company has a trading loss, that is fair enough.  Sometimes, if the losses are as a result of capital allowances relating to capital expenditure, we proposed that these be identified separately so that we can get a measure of all these losses forward.  There is a big gap in knowing how the losses forward are made up.<br/><br/>The Minister noted the recommendations but under the scheme of corporation tax, they do not actually do the breakdown.  The letter stated, &quot;The amount of any trading losses... is not broken down between that which relates to capital allowances and that which relates to other trading expenses&quot;.  That is exactly what we asked them to do.  The Minister for Finance looked at this issue in respect of the banks, which is relevant to all corporate entities, in a report published in 2018.  Again people might want to draft legislation on the matter; it cannot be done without legislation.  The Revenue Commissioners made it clear that they have no legal authority to seek the information and the legislation does not require it.</p><p>If people feel it is a matter that needs to be dealt with by legislation, they should do so.</p></speech>

Is that slightly different?  This is stated just after recommendation A.21.  Is it slightly different?  Is the Minister considering previous money and just saying it is a matter of legislation?  Is that a subtle difference?</p></speech>

It takes years of experience.</p> <p>  We accept that.  He sees the validity and notes what we are saying, and he is saying he will consider it.  He is not saying "Yes" or "No", and he has not rejected it.  It is up to any Oireachtas Member if they want deal with that issue.  That is how I see it.  It is legislation, full stop.  It is the finance Bill.  One would then have to get the signature of the Taoiseach, and I am sure there would be a cost to the Exchequer, but we will not even get into that debate.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The report states that the committee recommends that an annual review take place to ensure the new controls regarding overpayments to jobseeker's under 25 are working effectively.  When they introduced that scheme, there were different rates for persons under 21, those aged 21 to 25, and those over 26.  It was difficult for the Department.  It was a new scheme and there were inconsistencies across the Department.  Officials told us at the time there was one person in each office with particular expertise who looked at all of this.  They have acknowledged the work has been carried out.  The most recent review was conducted in February 2019 and all cases reviewed were confirmed as being correct.  A further review is being planned, subject to the outcome being satisfactory and, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is proposed to schedule further reviews on an annual basis.  The Department has taken up the recommendation and worked on it.  The recent reports of cases examined means they are fully correct, so at least the recommendation is being carried through and the Department is going to keep an eye on it into the future. </p></speech>

On a minor but important issue which I come across, flexibility is also required in some of these matters.  I have dealt with youngsters who perhaps grew up in a foster arrangement or in care.  When they are 18, they are in a very different position from somebody who is at home in a middle-class household.  Whereas we are sometimes looking for rigidity or consistency in how something is applied, we should not lose sight of the fact that flexibility can be important as well.</p></speech>

I was nervous of this recommendation lest it be seen that we were trying to get at vulnerable young people.  We tried to make our recommendation as sensitive as possible because we all understand the point the Deputy is making.  We hope the Department is listening to that.</p></speech>

We were concerned about delays in dealing with any payments that required a medical assessment, such as disability or invalidity benefit, in that there is a lack of doctors and there is always a delay on the medical side.  We made the recommendation to examine the possibility of contracting nurses to carry out medical assessments more promptly.  The Department fully accepts the recommendation and states:</p><blockquote>Overall, the numbers of medical opinions provided have been maintained over the two years - 2017 and 2018- at 87,908 and 87,603 respectively.  Currently the numbers awaiting a medical opinion at claim stage are below 1,000, [which seems quite low] with an average waiting time of less than 2 weeks for most schemes, 3 weeks for Domiciliary Care Allowance and 4 weeks for Disability Allowance.<br /><br />Following the recent recruitment competition for medical assessors, seven candidates have been successfully placed on a panel and the first placements commenced in early March 2019.<br /><br />The Department is currently considering the option of employing registered clinical nurse practitioners [as part of this process].</blockquote> <p>It also points out these applications can be held up because of means tests but we were concentrating on the medical side.  The Department seems to have acknowledged there was an inordinate delay.  It has recruited the staff since March of this year.</p></speech>

Essentially, the problem goes further back.  There is a non-acceptance of medical evidence and the case then has to be reassessed.  This is where a consultant says somebody has an illness that will continue for 12 months, and, in any case, the person will not qualify for, say, invalidity pension unless the disability is going to be continuous for a period of not less than 12 months.  While the consultant says that and the GP backs that up, the case can still be rejected.  The Chairman has seen this himself.</p></speech>

There is a rush to disallow some of these applications.  The number of cases overturned on appeal shows us there is a problem in the original decision, despite there being a decent volume of evidence.  I am not saying people should be paid allowances or benefits without providing the information but, in my office, I see people submitting copious volumes of information.  This was prevalent in regard to domiciliary care payments and we just told people to expect a refusal and, if they did not get one, it was a bonus.  There is a problem further back.  While some of that has been rectified, there is still a problem in regard to the rate of refusals that are overturned.</p></speech>

Somebody in the Department should undertake a strategic analysis of the outcomes of these cases from the appeals office.  If so many are being overturned, perhaps the criteria the appeals office are using should be used as the criteria for stage 1 of the application.  We all know that when a case goes to the appeals office, the officials will tell the person to get more up-to-date medical information due to the passage of time, if nothing else, given the long delays involved, and the person will need to have an up-to-date consultant's report.  That tends to work in the appeals office.  The question is why it did not work on day one.  The Department should examine what is done in the appeals office and see what manuals it is using, and then try to use the same approach from day one.  We all share the same experience.</p> <p>  The next item deals with the same Department.  The committee recommends that the JobPath programme be reviewed on a value for money basis to determine whether the programme should continue.  The Department accepts the recommendation in full.  It has conducted many surveys and the CSO has conducted a survey, with the statistics and business intelligence unit within the Department.</p></speech>

The Department says it has examined this and it concluded that 20% more people get jobs when compared to those who did not go in the first instance, although that is not very high.  It then says that those who do get jobs earn, on average, 16% more than those who do not, perhaps because they get a better job.</p><p>The Department states that it is going to compile another report on the savings from the scheme as a result of people no longer claiming social protection payments.

It is very important for the protection of employees that the proper PRSI is deducted and recorded.  The report also states :</p><blockquote>This programme included a special Employer Inspection Conference that took place in early April 2019 and was attended by approx. 200 Inspectors.  [...]  Arising from this, and as part of its 2019 control plan, the Department has now set a target of 8,000 employer inspections for this year.  In 2018, the Department carried out just over 2,050 employer inspections.</blockquote> <p>That is nearly a quadrupling of inspections.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I want to tell employers that there will be four times as many inspections of the records of employers' PRSI contributions in the future in order to ensure that people who are in employment are getting the benefit of the PRSI contributions to which they are entitled.  The Department is stepping up those investigations.  Some people will like that.  It is important for the protection of employees.  That took a long time.  It is a big report.  It is an example of the work we do.  I want to quickly move on to-----</p></speech>

It is up to members to deal with that.</p> <p>  I now want to move on to the rest of the correspondence as quickly as possible.  Some of it is relevant to this issue.  One of the reasons I want to mention some of it is that issues raised within it are mentioned in some of this morning's newspapers.  As Chairman, letters went out in my name to quite a few public bodies whose accounts were not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of March.  We would like to see accounts within three months of the end of the year in the interests of good financial governance.  We waited until the end of April to send these letters, thereby giving the bodies a bit of leeway.  There are 18 bodies on the list and we have received replies from 13 so far.  I will mention them briefly.</p> <p>  No. 2202B is correspondence from Water Safety Ireland in which it states it submitted its accounts by 30 May.  We will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us a report on the small number of bodies which have still not submitted their accounts at next week's meeting.

That is good.</p> <p>  We also have a letter from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, regarding the financial statements for the fishery harbour centres.  I am not completely happy with this.  He states that the emphasis in the Department is on getting the Vote accounts ready for audit, which is fine, and that, as this is now well advanced, the Department has been liaising with the staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and has confirmed that the statements for the fishery harbour centres will be submitted for audit later this month.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can give us an update next week, although I would still ask the Secretary General to get these statements in on time in future and to ensure that the Department has the resources to do so.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2231B from the Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This is on a different topic.  We will hold this item over until the next meeting.  It is not on the topic about which we are talking.</p> <p>  No. 2232B is from the HSE and has regard to the account for the long-stay repayment scheme, the long-stay repayment scheme donation account and the private property account.  The HSE says that the first two of these accounts have been submitted and the patient private property account was submitted on 3 June.  They are all coming in.  The reason I am reading these out is that some of them may be of public interest.</p> <p>  The next item is from Dublin City University, DCU.  It has sent a long letter.  It states that there was a once-off issue due to the DCU incorporation project.  That involved the amalgamation of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education into DCU.  We understand that this was a start-up process.  As a result of all of this, DCU had to restate its previous financial statements, which had been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and KPMG.  I can understand that involved quite a bit of once-off work.  The university says that, notwithstanding that, it is working closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General and KPMG in this regard.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is scheduled to begin its audit on 24 June.  We will get an update on that.  The letter is quite detailed.  We will note and publish it, even though I believe it is already in the public domain.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2234B, which is correspondence from St. Angela's college, Sligo, which states that its audit was scheduled to commence on 17 June.  As it is now 20 June, I take it that the accounts are in.  We will get the update.</p> <p>  University College Cork states that its audit is due to commence with a site visit on 24 June.  I take it that the accounts will be submitted in time for that.</p> <p>  No. 2238B is from the Legal Aid Board.  Its accounts were submitted on 31 May.</p> <p>  The next item is from the Church of Ireland united diocese of Dublin and Glendalough with regard to the Church of Ireland College of Education.  It states that the college was being wound up.</p></speech>

I am informed that the accounts will be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office this week, on 21 June..</p> <p>  I also received a reply from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, regarding financial statements for the environment fund.  Departmental officials agreed last year that the accounts would be submitted on 30 June.  Mr. Griffin indicates that arrangements have been put in place to ensure that timeline is met.</p> <p>  The reply from the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council thanks the committee for its letter and indicates that its accounts have since been submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  There may have been a slight misinterpretation of our letter in that the council took it to mean that we wished to see its accounts before they went to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To clarify, our letter was to request that they be submitted to Mr. McCarthy's office.</p> <p>  That last batch of letters came into my possession yesterday.  I did not have time to circulate them before today's meeting but I wished to get them on the record.  We have made great progress in ensuring that public bodies submit their financial statements for audit.  It may be boring stuff, but it is important to keep the pressure on them.  If they do not produce annual financial statements, they are not doing their work and we cannot do ours.</p></speech>

In response to a priority question I asked in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Minister indicated that he is not going to set up a committee of inspection.  He also said that the special liquidator has produced six voluntary reports, which are available on the Department's website.  Those reports do not necessarily form part of the scrutiny we are conducting here, but some of the content may be relevant.  It would be useful to go through them if we are having a discussion here, so that we can compare one thing against the other.</p></speech>

We have no statements of account to consider.  We will shortly welcome delegates from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss the 2017 appropriation account for Vote 30.  In the afternoon, we have a private meeting with Mr. Allen Morgan, a former surveyor at the Office of Public Works.  I ask as many members as possible to try to attend the afternoon session.</p> <p>  Next Thursday, we will have delegates from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive here to discuss in public session the health Vote and the HSE's financial statement for 2018.  The following Thursday, we have a discussion with delegates from the National Treasury Management Agency.  The State Claims Agency will probably be our main focus in that discussion, so we might allocate separate time for that.  On 11 July, we will discuss the accounts for the Houses of the Oireachtas, followed by a private meeting that afternoon to discuss the IBRC liquidation.</p> <p>  In addition, we will have a private meeting next Tuesday at 1 p.m. to consider the first input to our next periodic report, which is a discussion document produced by the secretariat.  We might have to hold another meeting the following day, because we must complete our first reading of it next week if it is to be ready for publication before the recess.  I have a word of caution for any journalists listening who may receive a copy of the document that is issued to committee members this week.</p><p>The document is not from the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a discussion document prepared by the secretariat, so people should draw conclusions or reprint potential conclusions at their peril.  The report will be significantly amended by the committee over the course of our three or four meetings on the matter.  Anyone who prints what they think is a conclusion is barking up the wrong tree.  That is all I can say.  They can print away if they want.  I make that observation because it tends to happen, so I am putting out that public warning.  That is the work programme and those are the private meetings.  We might have to go into private session before the witnesses come in, or we can do the private session this afternoon.  Some items correspond, but the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, was mentioned.</p></speech>

The six reports are glorified PowerPoint presentations, which we would have received.  There is not much in them besides a headline figure so they will not give us much detail on that, though we could review them before the private meeting.  It is good that Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about IBRC, but the response was unsatisfactory.  The Minister is obviously a very busy man and these responses are often written on Ministers' behalf by their teams.  We can understand that.  However, in his answer to Deputy Catherine Murphy, which she has shared with me, the Minister clearly sets out that we disapplied normal rules in legislation for this liquidation, which is the biggest in the history of the State.  The Minister says we can go through the six PowerPoint presentations on the website to see the headline figures.  However, we have established here that two people have effectively been put in place in lieu of a committee of inspection, and that was reaffirmed recently.  Based on my own humble experience, having voluntarily liquidated my own company with very modest turnovers and so on, it is just laughable.  The issue here is not that we are not going to get to the end of this, because we will, no matter how long it takes.   We will all celebrate and back-clap and say how well it was done, but we have highlighted that we had no benchmark position because no evaluations were done at the beginning, and so on.  Apart from that, the Government is heading for costs, by its own admission, of &euro;306 million, and we do not know if that represents good value.  The Minister cannot be satisfied, despite what he said in response to Deputy Catherine Murphy's question.  We need to stay on this and keep pushing it because long after we are gone, that reflection mechanism Deputy Connolly spoke of will be no doubt set up, there will be a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry, and we could save the State a great deal of money by just doing a few little bits now.</p></speech>

From the Department, we are joined by its Secretary General, Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Dr. Cecil Beamish, Mr. Martin Crowley, Ms Patricia Heeney and Mr. Paul Dillon.  We are also joined by Ms Georgina Hughes Elders from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn their phones off entirely or setting them to airplane mode.  Merely putting them on silent will interfere with the broadcast system.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that committee members shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>Before I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, I wish to point out that the meeting will also deal with the fishery harbour centres' accounts for 2016 and 2017, the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund, the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.</p><p>I apologise to Mr. Gleeson and his colleagues for the late start but we had to deal with a large amount of correspondence which was held over from the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance which I wanted to clear today.  However, it took some time.  I am conscious that Mr. Gleeson has a flight to catch in the afternoon and the committee will ensure he does not miss it on its account.</p></speech>

This represented a 10% increase on the spend of 1.26 billion in 2016.  The account is presented under four programmes, as indicated in the diagram provided to members.  These programmes correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2016-2019.</p> <p>  Programme B was the largest programme.  This relates to farm and sector supports and controls, and mainly comprises payments which benefit farms and farmers.  Total expenditure charged to the programme amounted to &euro;726 million in 2017 - an increase of over &euro;100 million from the 2016 level of expenditure.</p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding from the Vote each year to a number of State bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  By means of a Supplementary Estimate passed in December 2017, the Department was able to reallocate unspent funds on some subheads totalling almost &euro;50 million to other expenditure subheads.  There was no overall increase in the estimate provision for the Vote through the supplementary process.</p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;24 million less than provided for.  Some &euro;23.8 million in unspent capital allocations - mainly under the farm and sector supports and controls programme - was carried over for spending in 2018.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, an amount of &euro;207,000, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  Note 3 provides explanations for the variances in spending and transfers of funding from the various subheads.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control, which discloses non-competitive procurement by the Department of nearly &euro;19 million worth of goods and services in 2017, including a significant level of procurement which was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue for the Department.</p> <p>  The Department directly manages the six fishery harbour centres, which are accounted for separately from the Vote.  The form of the fishery harbour centres' financial statements was devised many years ago.  Unusually, the financial statements of the fishery harbour centres are prepared on both a cash and an accruals basis.  The day-to-day operations of the centres are funded through harbour dues and charges set by law, and rents from State-owned properties.  The income and expenditure account show a surplus for 2017 of &euro;1.5 million.  In addition, annual capital grant funding from the Department is made available for the development and maintenance of harbour facilities.  Capital funding from the Department in 2017 was &euro;17.5 million.</p> <p>  I issued a special report in 2014 on significant ongoing deficiencies in the financial management and reporting for the fishery harbour centres, including significant delays in the timeliness of presentation of accounts.  The report included seven recommendations intended to enhance the financial management of the centres.  The statement on internal financial control discloses the progress the Department has made so far in implementing those recommendations.</p> <p>  As Members are aware, the Department manages significant funds provided by the EU.  Where these are applied on schemes that are co-funded by the Exchequer, the funding is reflected in the vote.  However, payments to farmers and market-related expenditure that are almost fully funded by the EU are not accounted for in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account, even though the Department manages the payments.  Such payments amounted to just over &euro;1.2 billion for 2017.  These are accounted for to the EU in financial statements that are not subject to audit by me.  However, note 6.1 in the appropriation account provides some information about the amounts received from the EU each year.  </p> <p>  At the request of a previous Committee of Public Accounts, it was agreed that the Department, in co-operation with the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, would prepare an annual composite account to provide an overview of the funds flowing to agriculture, fisheries and rural communities, and that this would be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Accordingly, the 2017 financial statements of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund have been prepared and presented, and are before the committee today.</p> <p>  The financial statements present the income and expenditure of these three fund programmes in Ireland, including both EU and Exchequer financing.  They indicate that the combined income and expenditure of the funds was &euro;1.77 billion in 2017, of which &euro;1.5 billion was funded by the EU.  Of course, funds for other, non-agriculture, programmes are also received from the EU, and there are significant annual payments from Ireland to the EU.  These composite accounts before the committee today do not give a sufficiently rounded picture of the transactions with the EU, and so I recently published a special report on Ireland&rsquo;s Transactions with the EU in 2017, which gives a more comprehensive picture.  Members will recall that this was examined with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance.  I recommended in that report that there should be annual reporting, on a consolidated basis, of all Irish contributions to and receipts from the EU.  If the Department of Finance takes up that suggestion, the committee may wish to consider if there is a continuing need for the current composite reporting of EU funding to the agriculture and fisheries sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#M00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I refer to the Department's appropriation account for 2017 and two associated sets of financial statements.  The first is a non-statutory account, provided for the sake of transparency, which shows the interaction between the funding received from the European Union and the Department's Vote.</p><p>This funding is accounted for separately under EU rules and audited by the EU institutions.  Because the bulk of it is not matched by national funds, much of it does not appear in the  Department&rsquo;s appropriation account and therefore these financial statements provide a fuller picture of total departmental expenditure at both national and EU levels.</p><p> The second is the financial statements for the six fisheries harbour centres owned and operated by the Department.  I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross Estimate for 2017 was &euro;1.49 billion.  This included a carryover of capital savings of &euro;21.7 million from 2016.  This represented an overall increase of almost &euro;120 million over the gross voted Estimate for 2016.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.387 billion, an increase of &euro;131 million over 2016.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities by the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.  The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development and animal disease programmes.  In 2017 these receipts amounted to &euro;258.9 million, some &euro;78 million less than the Estimate of &euro;337 million, largely because EU receipts expected in December 2017 in respect of rural development schemes were not received until January 2018.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include disease eradication programmes such as those relating to tuberculosis, TB, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, testing for residues in food products, on-farm controls, plant protection controls and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading amounted to just over &euro;80 million in 2017, excluding staff and administration costs.  This is a saving of &euro;5.5 million compared to the budgeted amount.</p><p> Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than basic payments, which are entirely EU-funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2017, following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just under &euro;806 million.  This was some &euro;182 million greater than the &euro;623 million outturn in 2016.  In 2017 almost 50,000 people participated in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  More than 24,000 participated in the beef data and genomics scheme and the sheep welfare and knowledge transfer schemes were launched.  Other co-funded schemes included the areas of national constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the organics scheme, and the forestry programme, which alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.  The eventual outturn was for this programme was &euro;726 million.  This was more than &euro;100 million greater than the previous year but also &euro;80 million short of the available funds.  Key factors in this shortfall were the fact that participation in the new schemes for sheep welfare and knowledge transfer was lower than provided for, and an adjustment to deadlines for certain actions in the knowledge transfer scheme slowed the payment process, with some falling into 2018.  Similarly, our ambitious target for payments to a very high portion of GLAS participants within the calendar year was not achieved.  However, for the 2018 scheme year close to 90% of GLAS applicants were paid their annual advance within the calendar year.</p><p> On the capital side, the TAMS investment scheme saw a greatly improved drawdown compared to 2016 with &euro;33 million spent, although drawdown was lower than the provision.  To help with the  financial management of the scheme we reduced the time allowed for applicants to submit payment claims.  The experience in the past 18 months reflects good levels of investment in improved on-farm facilities.  Expenditure on the forestry programme was lower than hoped in 2017, and this remains a continuing but critically important challenge.  The capital carryover into 2018 from 2017 was largely drawn from the TAMS and forestry savings in 2017.  I should say that programme B also includes an element of national funding on EU market support schemes such as intervention.</p><p> Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training and several food support schemes, as well as grants-in-aid to some of our State agencies.  The outturn slightly exceeded the voted allocation of &euro;338 million, due partly to several additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector to confront the challenge of Brexit.  Those initial measures included an increase in Bord Bia's allocation by &euro;8.6 million to assist it in its marketing and promotion of Irish food overseas.  In addition, the sum of &euro;9 million was provided for the agri-food sector component of the SME Brexit loan scheme.  This scheme was jointly established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Along with &euro;14 million from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, this provision leveraged a working capital loan fund of &euro;300 million for SMEs at an interest rate not exceeding 4%.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contribution ensured that at least 40% of the fund would be available for the food sector.  Savings which emerged in other parts of the programme, particularly research, allowed us to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for the earliest possible release of the final element of funding under our 2016-2018 strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in payments of &euro;14 million to the World Food Programme in 2017.</p><p> Programme D relates to seafood.  Expenditure under this heading in 2017 included some &euro;21 million for the upgrading and development of fisheries harbours.  Around 88% of fish landed in Ireland now are landed into the six centres owned by the Department.  The value of those landings has increased from &euro;224.3 million in 2013 to &euro;271.5 million in 2017.  Programme D also includes &euro;5.6 million under the seafood development programme and grants-in-aid to the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  This programme also includes expenditure of &euro;4 million on the commencement of substantive work on the remediation of Haulbowline Island.</p><p> I will now touch very briefly on the financial statements of the Irish operations for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime Fisheries Fund.  This account consolidates financial data on a calendar year basis, incorporating EU and Vote funds.  It was devised in the early 2000s, at the request of this committee, to provide visibility of expenditure across all these funds as some of the expenditure is not Vote-related.  Notable features in 2017 include EU receipts of more than &euro;1.5 billion across the Irish operations of the three funds.  When combined with the national Exchequer funding of &euro;266.6 million, total expenditure under the funds in 2017 amounts to &euro;1.77 billion.  More generally, I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has prepared a special report on the full range of Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU in 2017.  That report provides a very clear picture of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU across all funds and all Departments.</p><p> Finally, I would like to refer to the account relating to fisheries harbour centres.  The harbours were the subject of a special report in 2014 and we are continuing to address some of the  recommendations.  Turning to the financial performance of the harbours themselves, the higher level of harbour dues and profit on disposal were the main factors behind the increases in receipts and the surplus on the revenue account.  The accounts also show the substantial increase in capital investment at the harbours with substantial projects at each of the six harbours, the vast majority of which is funded through the Department's Vote.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their attention and I will try to answer any questions that arise. </p></speech>

I would appreciate succinct answers so that we can get through the several topics I wish to touch on.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the 72 sites throughout the State, which account for nearly 1,000 ha.  One of those is the site at Backweston, with which I am very familiar.  How does the Department control and manage that estate?  Does it map those sites?  Is there a list?

We have a long list of sites around the country, most of which are small holdings with forestry or agricultural land.  We have several research farms.  Costs are associated with the operation of places where we are actively engaged.  One example is the Tops farm in Donegal where we are actively involved in managing a research facility.  There is a farm near Backweston which is managed for the purposes of agricultural sites.  We have a list of these sites.  Many of them are very small sites in rural areas without any significant activity.  No significant costs are associated with their management.</p><p>We have a list of these sites and many are sites in rural areas where there is not significant activity or costs associated with their management.</p></speech>

We got a list of Garda stations that were to be sold and we were quite amazed at some of the things in that list.  It could be useful to have such a list.</p> <p>  The Department had a number of claims and compensation and legal costs to pay.  From my reading, the legal costs were substantially in excess of the amount paid out in the claims.  Why would that have happened?</p></speech>

There was, for example, a case taken by a contractor on the basis of what he regarded as a change in his conditions of engagement.  There was a case involving a ferry company relating to the nature of the departmental fees charged for ferries.

There was an element of compensation paid and that is charged to the fishery harbour centres fund but the legal costs were borne by the Department and they account for nearly half of that figure.  It was a very long-running case that went to the Supreme Court.  There is further detail in the fishery harbour centres account about that case.</p></speech>

Procurement is an issue to which the Committee of Public Accounts pays particular attention and it is a major concern.  It appears that some non-compliance is on general, non-specialist matters.  What kinds of controls does the Department have in place and why was it not compliant in the first place?</p></speech>

This is based on a declaration by the Department of non-competitive procurement and non-compliant procurement, which are not necessarily the same.  In some circumstances where there are specialist requirements for which there is only one supplier or an issue of urgency, there can be a requirement to go to market without competition.  Insofar as our return on this is concerned, if a contract is signed, it remains on the list until such time as the contract is closed off.  There is a cumulative effect such that contracts that might have been declared in 2016 will run for two or three years.  They remain on the list in the following year.  We have done an awful lot of work in the Department on resolving these procurement issues and we are making significant progress.  I can go through some of the figures if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

I am just giving that bit of perspective.  That was from procurement of approximately &euro;100 million.  Within the Department, we have established a central procurement unit and a network of procurement liaison officers in every division.  We have trained those procurement officers in proper procedures.  The value of those non-compliant contracts has diminished.  I will return to the Deputy with a figure shortly.</p> <p>  We had 38 contracts valued at &euro;5.6 million in 2017 and the reasons for those fell outside the exceptions provided in the procurement rules.  While this is not in any way to excuse this, I assume that the people who involved themselves in those procurements felt that they complied with the exceptions provided for in the circular.  That should not happen.  We now have a system of assessment by a senior officer before any procurement exception is allowed and it is also assessed by the central procurement unit.  The objective of that system is to eliminate non-compliance altogether and we are confident that we are well on the way to doing that.</p> <p>  Of those 38 contracts, 20 with a value of &euro;1.71 million related to separate contracts that were aggregated.  It is possible that different people contracted with the same party and were dealt with separately.  For the purposes of our return, we felt for the sake of transparency and propriety that they should be aggregated and returned as a single batch.  A substantial part of that non-compliance involved separate contracts with the same vendor.  We do not permit that to happen any more.  Eight of the contracts with a value of &euro;1.8 million were contracts rolled over beyond a reasonable time period.  In other words, they were existing contracts for some services and instead of running a new procurement, they were rolled over.</p></speech>

The difficulty that we had was that there was no information on the location of the list of assets when one went to check on them.  We therefore could not find where the recorded asset was.  On the other hand one could look at the assets and could not necessarily trace them back to an entry on the fixed asset register.  It has been an ongoing issue that we have been raising with the Department.  The unit has been set up since January 2017.

All I can say is that we established a formal process here with a unit and an assessment of what the priorities should be in how to rank and where to start with this project.  This was the ranking that we came up with.  Most assets are fully depreciated in any event and are beyond the depreciation date from a value and accountancy point of view.</p></speech>

The office equipment is, as the Deputy can see, where most of the expense has been incurred.  It is also very heavily depreciated.  These are assets that have been in use for a long time.  These will include such items as ICT equipment and other office equipment.  Is there any software in there?</p></speech>

It must be decided then how funds will be spent.

One is to get a handle on what is out there.  The second is to ensure that the system does not permit this to happen again.  When one looks now at our staff accounts system, a person when making a purchase order is required to put that on the capital assets register.  Those purchases are assessed by the asset management unit now to ensure this happens.  There is a system in place now to prevent this from happening in the future.  It requires the expenditure to be brought to account as a capital asset.</p></speech>

Those requirements arise because the UK intends to leave the Single Market and the customs union.  We flagged a requirement, for when that happens, of almost 500 staff between certification and additional controls.  In the event, there were several false starts with Brexit and we were left having to decide how to handle the recruitment process in circumstances where it was uncertain whether the UK would leave.  The objective was to be able to fulfil the statutory requirements but not commit ourselves in perpetuity to an additional 500 staff.

One of the leases is close to expiry.  Is the Department in the process of renewing the lease?  If so, I understand that commercial sensitivity might be associated with it.

It is an implementing regulation of the European Union and has been published.  The Commission will provide &euro;50 million in funding and calls it a temporary adjustment scheme.  The conditions include membership of an environmental scheme or of a quality assurance scheme, and a requirement for some kind of temporary reduction is imposed by the Commission.  The Commission has looked at the case made on the market.  It has indicated, as it did in the case of the temporary voluntary reduction scheme in the dairy sector a couple of years ago, that if it is a market scheme and farmers want the &euro;50 million, one of the conditions is that there must be some temporary adjustment in supply to address the market issue.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the implementing regulation is before the monitoring committee today.  Afterwards, we will know clearly what the regulation stipulates and we will then have some kind of a consultation with farm bodies about what to do.  We will be constrained by the parameters in the regulation.  A reduction in the number of animals could be a requirement but there will not be a requirement for a permanent adjustment, in case that is what people are afraid of.  It will be voluntary.</p></speech>

The Commission believes that if it is to provide money to Ireland, there will have to be some kind of supply adjustment.  That is its perspective.</p> <p>  The heading on the regulation will be temporary adjustment aid.  The same happened with milk in 2016, when there was a voluntary reduction scheme for farmers who wanted to reduce the supply.  It is the same kind of initiative.</p></speech>

It should not have been in the food chain.  Separately, and I cannot say very much about this, there is a Garda investigation into allegations involving potentially misidentifying horses and trying to get them into the food chain in circumstances where they should not be in it.

Ireland does not claim those waters but we reject the UK's territorial claim.  The fisheries issue is that if the UK succeeds in its territorial claim, it will establish a 12 mile zone around Rockall where other European member states cannot fish.  I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but I believe I can do so.  We do not accept the UK's territorial claim and, therefore, those waters are European Union waters and access to those waters and the quotas are determined at European Union level in the negotiations that happen every December.</p></speech>

What I can say is that Ireland does not accept the territorial claim and, therefore, from our point of view they are European Union waters.  We have a quota for haddock in those waters.  It is a significant fishery for squid, for which we do not have a quota as it is a non-quota species.  We do not accept the territorial claim and we will continue to reject it.

We received two tranches of money under the exceptional measures provision we are now speaking about for beef.  For the first of these tranches, we sent the money to every dairy farmer in the country.  For the second, we decided we would use it in a better way to leverage loan funding for farmers and there seemed to be a demand in the scheme.  The first of these schemes was &euro;150 million and we put in upfront money to meet first losses and as an interest subsidy.  That was available to farmers.  This particular Brexit scheme came from that idea.  It was a &euro;300 million scheme through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and us.  It was intended for SMEs as a working capital loan scheme because that seemed to be what was required.  We put in &euro;9 million and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation put in &euro;14 million for first losses and interest subsidies.  We worked with the SBCI and European Investment Bank to create the loan fund of &euro;300 million.</p></speech>

There is a subsidy relating to the scheme that was also intended to keep the cost for farmers down.  It only relates to that scheme, however, it does not relate to the operation of knackeries generally.  They are critically important services because if one lives out at the end of the Beara Peninsula or somewhere like that, it is a long way to the nearest knackery.  It is important, therefore, that they are maintained.</p> <p>  The current subsidy rates for bovines aged over 48 months are &euro;30 for the collection, which is paid to the knackeries, and &euro;78 per animal which is paid to the category 1 rendering operators because these animals will go from the knackery and are then rendered and sent for destruction.  The cost of collection of those animals to the farmer is capped at &euro;54.  If we did not pay the subsidy, that cost to the farmer, notwithstanding the fact that I am sure farmers think it is extraordinarily high, would be significantly higher.

There is a good deal of consultation taking place.  There is serious concern in terms of the derogation and its being rolled out in the future.  I met representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, in Kilkenny earlier in the week in order to discuss that matter.  According to the statistics, only 19% of farmers are availing of this derogation in terms of 130 kg to 250 kg of fertiliser per hectare; 81% are under 130 kg so it does not affect them.  The IFA representatives I met stated that they are doing a two or three-year survey of people who have been getting this derogation and that it has emerged that it has no adverse effect on rivers, water levels, wells, etc.  Why is this derogation under review?  Is it with a view to cutting it back, excluding people from obtaining it or bringing it to an end?</p></speech>

After a week of discussions about the environment and climate change, when we look at Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports, generally speaking, they indicate that water quality is not improving.  We have approximately 7,000 derogation farmers who have a special dispensation, so to speak, to operate at higher intensity levels than most others,.  There are additional conditions attaching because high-intensity farming needs to be controlled.  All we are saying is that we want to look again at the derogation against the backdrop of all of the information we have, including whatever comes from the IFA, but that we will rely on our own judgment for determining whether any adjustments are required and will have a public consultation about it.  It is vital that we do this because it is very important that people are sensitised to the need to farm in a sustainable way.  This this is part of that effort.  What we are involved in right now is a public consultation.</p></speech>

The IFA maintains that the water quality in rivers here is cleaner than those in the EU.  Ireland is in the top four or five in that regard.  I do not know whether that is factual.</p></speech>

I am fearful of saying this because I might be wrong but the situation is that our pristine waters are diminishing in quality and our middle-grade waters are improving slightly in quality.  The overall picture, however, is not great in terms of the direction of travel.  We just have to be very careful that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.  If we are making a pitch for Irish agriculture on an international market based on its environmental sustainability, we have to be sure that we are doing what we are saying we do.  This consultation is part of that effort.</p></speech>

Agriculture has been blamed for 32.3% of emissions.  The Department states that we should increase production with a view to ensuring food safety and producing food of a good quality but how can we marry the two of those if we are told we must reduce emissions?  At the same time, we want solidarity in terms of food availability and the quality of food.  Production in the dairy sector is increasing, which is good for the country in terms of exports etc.  If we cut down on beef production in terms of the scheme Mr. Gleeson is talking about, we will have to import beef from South America or elsewhere.  Where is the saving on carbon footprint in terms of the world market?  We need to have a happy medium in this regard.  All systems have to survive.  Mr. Gleeson stated that smart technology is important but we also have to keep an industry going for the well-being of this country.</p></speech>

There was a difference of opinion between Ireland and the United Kingdom for many years on where the boundary of the exclusive economic zone fell going north west from Donegal for 200 miles.  The continental shelf and jurisdictions are the business of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and an agreement was reached on the seabed boundary in 1988.  In 2013, there was agreement on the boundary in the water above the seabed.  They are the same single maritime boundary.  The drivers in reaching that agreement were concerns about who had responsibility for maritime pollution incidents and who would respond in different areas.  Some issues arose at the time.  There was also the matter of the development of offshore wind facilities and in which jurisdiction they could be located if consented.  The boundary was set but even when there were two different boundaries in terms of the exclusive economic zone, Rockall was always on the UK side of that boundary.  There was never a point where Rockall was not in the UK EEZ.  The fact that a single boundary was agreed in 2013 and that the continental shelf boundary was agreed in 1988 did not change the Rockall issue.</p> <p>  The Rockall issue centres on whether a claim by the UK of sovereignty and its unilateral actions to support that are accepted by the State.  This State, through successive Governments, has never accepted it.  Ireland has never claimed sovereignty of Rockall.  It is a dispute over the UK's creation of sovereignty on that rock and, subsequent to that, the creation of a 12-mile zone that the UK claims for exclusive access around Rockall.  That is not accepted by the State either.  There is detail behind that.  In earlier decades, there was debate as the United Kingdom was seeking to establish a new exclusive economic zone based on Rockall as a starting point, which would have pushed it way out.  The United Kingdom conceded that claim and no longer makes such a claim.  That matter does not arise.  There are other ongoing disputes about the continental shelf involving Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Ireland that are unresolved.  They concern seabed issues.  The 2013 agreement has no relevance to current issues around fisheries rights around Rockall.</p></speech>

It is a trade negotiation with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  To an extent, we have relied for some of our arguments on the Commission's own cumulative impact assessment of the damage that would be done to the European beef sector.  That is now several years old.  The impact would of course depend on the details of the deal, if there is to be one.  We already have approximately 220,000 tonnes of product coming in from South America under other TRQs and the question is how much more would come in under such a deal, over how long this would be phased, the rate of tariff and the quota management system.  We have consistently argued that if this is going to be done - we do not want it done - the quota division should arise from the fall of the carcass.  If the TRQ is to be 50,000 tonnes, we do not want 50,000 tonnes of steaks to be sent here; the beef should be broken up in the same way as the carcass is divided.  Those are the kinds of arguments we have made.  The economic analysis has been that the Commission's own cumulative impact assessment-----</p></speech>

Often deals are made in the EU sphere with the benefit of officials, including Irish officials, having done years of work.  When it comes to the Oireachtas trying to react or proactively influencing the process, we are blind.  If we are depending on data prepared elsewhere and looking at a cumulative impact across the Union, although we are less than 1% of that the impact to us on our own may be huge compared with that cumulative position.  I formally and respectfully ask that the Department, with Bord Bia, examine a range of scenarios.  We know a figure of 70,000 tonnes has been mentioned but it could be 100,000 tonnes if recent media reports are to be believed.  It would be useful.  I do not want to stray into the agriculture committee's remit but there would be financial implications.</p> <p>  It does not arise today but within the budget on an annual basis, is there a contingency set aside in case inclement weather leads to a fodder crisis in the autumn and winter months?

We divvy up &euro;16 million a year.  When they get into a hole for &euro;20 million, we buy something from the board for &euro;20 million that is worth &euro;12 million.  This issue has been before the committee previously.  When I asked for the valuation of Bord na gCon on that day, it was also termed "commercially sensitive".  The real story was not that it was commercially sensitive; it was that my back of an envelope valuation was closer to Savills' valuation.  The Valuation Office was retrofitting a valuation to allow Peter to be robbed to pay Paul, but that is an aside.  It is very frustrating when Mr. Gleeson, as manager of the line Department responsible for an organisation to which we divvy up &euro;16 million per year and which has not covered itself in glory in recent times with regard to governance, says that he cannot give the report to the committee because the organisation told the Department it was commercially sensitive.  The Department would never have received that report were it not for the substantial questioning of Deputy Alan Kelly through parliamentary questions.  Now the Department has the report, Mr. Gleeson has read it and he concurs with Bord na gCon.  To paraphrase, I am bound to say they did not want to give the Department anything.  Through the actions of other people such as Deputy Alan Kelly, the Department has the report and is backing up the board by saying, "We cannot let this out".</p></speech>

It could be the case that the conditions were not complied with and it was then difficult to recover the funding.  If the participant remained in a scheme, the money was recovered from his or her next payment.  That was easy enough, but if somebody reaches the end of a five-year contract, it has to be pursued.  We had a significant number of these historical debts and came up with this systematic arrangement to determine whether the debt was recoverable, based on whether it had gone beyond the Statute of Limitations.</p></speech>

It is an appendix to the accounts on the lands the Department owns.  I agree with it.  It is great that a State agency owns land.  It is set out on pages 40 and 41 where the land is in the various counties.  The properties range from 1,000 ha to less than 1 acre.  It is a huge range of properties, with which I am delighted.  I am delighted that we have property options.  How are they managed?  For instance, I know that in Galway security firms tell me that they are not involved in managing them.  Are there management teams?  Are there private companies managing the properties, or is the Department managing them directly?</p></speech>

I think there were no sales included in the 2017 accounts, but if there were, they would have been put out to public tender and we would have carried out evaluations.  As the Deputy can see, most of the properties are small, but if we were to sell any of them, it would be valued.  Incidentally, we have also sent the list to the Land Development Agency.  Therefore, if it was interested in it from a housing perspective, it has the list.</p></speech>

On climate change and the report this week, 35 actions have been recommended for the Department.  I presume Mr. Gleeson is very familiar with the 35 or maybe he has not had time to become familiar with them.  There are 35 specific actions for the Department.  How is the Department fixed in relation to those?</p></speech>

In the context of determining what that target should be, the Government took into account the fact that the forestry and land use sector had already contributed a significant amount of mitigation to the overall national target.  We then had a toolbox established by Teagasc, namely a marginal abatement cost curve, that lists actions that might be taken to abate and sequester carbon.  As such, there are three pillars to the effort.  One is measures to reduce carbon emissions from agriculture.  That will involve things like reducing the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers and improved breeding of animals.  The second pillar is sequestration.  That will involve trying to meet our forestry targets, which is a challenge, planting more trees-----</p></speech>

Sequestration will also involve better management of certain kinds of land.  For example, there could be land on the margins of bogs which might have to be managed less intensively.  There are certain types of mineral soils which may have to be drained.  That will contribute to sequestration.  The third leg of the stool is the contribution agrifood can make on the replacement of fossil fuels with renewables.</p></speech>

We have all had to read the reports over and over.  Every year when Departments have come before the committee, we have asked for this to be done proactively.  My question is where the Department is on that and the 35 actions.  I understand that one of the actions is to bring back a Teagasc report that was not acted on.  Is that right?</p></speech>

It was the identification of measures that could contribute to a reduction in emissions from the sector.  We are doing some of those things already.  A significant portion of our CAP budget is dedicated to environmental and climate change measures.  We have a programme to improve the breed efficiency of animals and improve the environmental sustainability of farmers but we will have to do a great deal more on that.  We have a programme for forestry.</p></speech>

We need to go forward, working together.  I am not about divide and conquer, even with carbon tax.  Climate change is the biggest risk for us.  Over the past two and a half years on this committee, I have not had the sense that Departments are taking it seriously.  It is not just the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I do not have that sense.  It does not appear here as a risk.  Brexit appears as a risk, not climate change, in the Department's financial statements.  Will that change?  Does the Department consider climate change to be a risk?  On the 35 actions, we are limited.  What programme will be rolled out on the 35 actions, when will that be and so on?  We had Teagasc before us at one stage and it stated clearly that the trajectory was going the wrong way.  It said that publicly.  Teagasc is not particularly radical in its statements and I would have thought that one was a cause not only for reflection but serious action.  That did not happen.  We will be monitoring the 35 actions closely.</p></speech>

I will be accountable to another committee.  We are entering a negotiation on a new Common Agricultural Policy and how farmers do those actions will have to be configured.  We will also have to use regulation.  It will be a combination of incentive and regulation to deliver on all of those actions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Gleeson for the detail on the fisheries harbour.  There was a special report on that by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 and it contained seven recommendations.  There was a general reference in Mr. Gleeson's opening statement that some have been dealt with.  Where are we with the seven recommendations?  Serious issues were raised about governance and management.  I have one last question and then I will be finished.</p></speech>

There was one particular matter on page 31, namely extra receipts payable to the Exchequer.  It referred to proceeds of a land sale of &euro;642,000, which was a sizeable sum that I overlooked.

The third speaker is my issue.</p> <p>  I thank the officials for attending this morning.  I want to go back to the assets issue that has been raised several times, including tagging items and putting them on the register.  Up to 2017, when a microscope, bailer or testing kit was purchased with Department money, no one put a sticker with a reference number on the item and entered the information on a spreadsheet.  Is that the way the Department was doing business?  It is a yes-no answer - I am under pressure for time.</p></speech>

We did not have a system that forced people, when they were in the procurement system, to put things on the asset register.  It was flawed.</p></speech>

I am worried about that.  We are number one for efficiency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>greenhouse gas emissions in the dairy sector and number five in the beef sector.  We are improving all of the time in terms of education and Teagasc is doing great work with genomics and so on.  I understand the argument here in terms of climate change, agriculture and the pressures we are under.  However, greenhouse gas is in the air above all of us in Europe.  We are exporting over 90% of our agricultural products and are feeding almost 60 million people in Europe.  We are now looking at feeding people further afield.  Why would it be efficient to reduce beef numbers?  We have to eat.  Would it not be much better to invest the money in breeding, genomics and improving our number five position in Europe to number one or number two?  Obviously if there is a hard Brexit and the beef industry is hit very hard, farmers will need a subvention in order to be able to pay their bills but in terms of the longer-term use of taxpayers' money, it does not seem to make any sense for the Secretary General of the Department to propose a voluntary reduction in beef numbers.  Perhaps I am pulling him up on the wrong point but I would have thought his remit was to promote beef and the efficient production of same.</p></speech>

In the context of agricultural practices feeding into human health and environmental health, would it be a good idea to have an Oireachtas committee that meshes these issues together?  I sit on the health committee but we never discuss the effect of the world of agriculture on the world of human health.  There seems to be a lack of connectivity in that regard.  Issues like water run-off, slurry being spread on land and so on all feed into this.  We had the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in before us recently and we discussed drug residues, both illicit and legal,  in our water table.  It seems strange to me that the Oireachtas does not have a joined-up, whole world approach to this involving the EPA and the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health all working together and feeding through the same information.  There is no point in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine doing great work, gathering data on antibiotics if pharmaceutical and human health interests are not using it.  Does Mr. Gleeson understand my point?</p></speech>

This is a continuum and that has already been recognised by the various agencies that are dealing with human and animal health.  We are working together on AMR and there is definitely a connection to the environment as well.  What the Deputy says makes sense.</p></speech>

I am not aware of it happening but the issue certainly came up a few years ago in the context of the treatment of sewage.  At the time, although my memory of this might be imperfect, we looked at quality assurance schemes and so on but felt that it was not consistent with our objectives under quality assurance.</p></speech>

The committee will return at 2.30 p.m. for a meeting in private session with Mr. Alan Morgan, former valuer with the OPW.</p> <p>  Following on on the matter of farm safety, the annual report states that farms were the largest category of workplace fatalities in Ireland.  There were 24 incidents, of which 14 were people over 65 years.  It was mentioned at a previous meeting - I do not recall if it was with Mr. Gleeson or his predecessor.  While he says it is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority, I make a plea to him, as I did on the last occasion, that someone in the Department take a bit more interest in it.  It might be done through Teagasc or another body.  Now that the economy is picking up, people who might otherwise have been available to work on the farm are gone.  It is grandfathers who are doing all the work now.  I look at my county, and most of the farmers are in their 70s because their sons have gone out to work.  They are trying to do the work and maybe their sons or daughters help out in the evening.  I can envisage this getting worse because more people are working on their own on farms.  Years ago, there would have been two or three people working on a farm, but now it is only one.  People are working alone with big machinery and if something goes wrong with it or an animal does something it is a problem.  I know it is a policy issue but in the interest of people working in rural industry, I ask the Department to take some initiative.  I know Teagasc has done something on it, but more needs to be done.  If there were 24 deaths in the health sector, which is the biggest employer in the country, people would be up in arms, or similarly in the construction sector.  Because the fatalities are so dispersed and are one here or there, it is not as visible.  Mr. Gleeson will get the point I am making.  We need more to be done, and I worry it will get worse.</p></speech>

She is a member of the health committee.  It could take a step back and deal with some of the issues that are in its remit, and bring the issue back to the producer.  The health committee could stretch back to that.  Is the Food Safety Authority of Ireland a separate organisation or is it under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine?</p></speech>

There is an unusual arrangement in Ireland.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is at the top of a pyramid over several other agencies.  For the purposes of food safety, the Department is one of those agencies.  We operate on the level of a service level agreement with the FSAI.  That is something we agree periodically.  It comes down and audits us on the standard set.  We work with the FSAI.  It provides independent scrutiny of what we do but it comes under the remit of the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I am not looking for the service level agreement or anything but just an information note.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two other points.  I was disappointed to see the figure in the accounts for grants to the organic sector.  In 2016 is was &euro;53.566 million and in 2017 it was &euro;45.063 million, a reduction of &euro;8.503 million.  It says the scheme is closed to new applicants and payments are progressing as profile.  Why in this day and age, with climate change and climate action, and health and food safety, would we close down grants to the organic sector?  I am baffled.  Will Mr. Gleeson explain?</p></speech>

People operate for five years.  The figure to which the Chairman referred represents commitments built up over time.  They are reducing because people are leaving the five-year contracts.  I think that explains the reduction.</p></speech>

It says the scheme is closed to new applicants.  The Department is letting the old scheme run out or expire but why are there not new people coming onto it every year?  Surely people want food that is produced organically.  I know it can be more expensive and it may be a niche market but if the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has stopped the scheme to encourage people to produce organic or the grant system will not be renewed, that is something people these days would find to be seriously remiss.  What is the thinking?</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it.  We have travelled to a lot of markets and there is inexhaustible demand for organic produce.  It is important.  One of the difficulties is that we have to get the big processing sectors interested in organic produce, which is not easy.  In the context of the schemes, it is a function of managing a limited budget over a period of time and assessing demand.  In a way, the Chair is asking is a policy question.  The scheme was phased out at that time and reopened in November 2018.</p></speech>

He is going to say the Department is working on it but we know that.  However, I find what is in front of us to be extraordinary.  I am only talking about the office equipment and other machinery, not buildings or anything like that.  There was a cost valuation of &euro;233 million and depreciation of &euro;221 million.  The net value of the assets was &euro;10 million.  That is what the balance sheet shows on page 13.  It shows the Department had additions of &euro;5.5 million in 2017.  The Comptroller and Auditor General informs me there were additions of &euro;3 million in 2016 and &euro;4.7 million in 2015.  Even allowing for depreciation on what was purchased in 2015, 2016 and 2017, they would have a net asset value of &euro;10.6 million.  If those figures mean anything, they are saying that everything prior to that had been at 100% depreciation.  Are those figures based on the time since the foundation of the State?  We would want to be going back 70 years to have purchases of office equipment of &euro;232 million given that the Department is spending &euro;3 million to &euro;5 million a year.  Is that figure inclusive of figures that are 60 or 70 years old?  It seems that way to me.  The Department should forget about trying to update that register if it has stuff going back 70 years.</p></speech>

There will be massive write-offs into the future.  While good progress is being made, we are not there yet in respect of the evidence of that and the cleaning up of the asset register.</p></speech>

This is one of the chapters we are working on for this year.  We have been talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this.  There are a lot of problems with it.  We need better accounting policies and greater clarity around what is to be in, what is an expectation for write-off and tidying this up.  It is not satisfactory.</p></speech>

A register should ultimately link into the financial statement.  It should be possible to reconcile them.  I would say to the Comptroller and Auditor General that if this is an issue across the board, we may have to take it up with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we may want to have periodic reports arising from it.  That schedule has no basis in current day reality.  To say the cost of assets is &euro;232 million and there is depreciation of &euro;221 million suggests decades and decades are being included.  It means nothing.  Some of this stuff might be gone after five or ten years.  I would say that very little of that figure could be tracked down in reality.</p></speech>

There would have been assets brought on at that stage.  Presumably, they were all in existence at that point.  However, it has been accumulating for 25 years.</p></speech>

In summary, the change to the articles is to increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases at the IFC.  The Government seeks D&aacute;il approval for this change under Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution as the IFC's Articles of Agreement are an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds.  I will now set out for the committee some background on the IFC and the reasons for this proposed change.</p> <p>  IFC is the part of the World Bank which seeks to promote private sector development in developing countries.  It does so by providing loans, investments and advisory services to companies engaged in projects with development impact.  In April 2018, shareholders of the World Bank agreed on a capital increase for the bank.  The agreed financial package includes a $7.5 billion capital increase for IBRD, the World Bank's main lending arm, and a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC.  The capital increase for the IFC is a response to the ambition of the sustainable development goals and the increased levels of finance required.  Simply put, the sustainable development goals will not be met through existing domestic resources or traditional overseas aid.  The annual funding gap is estimated to be $2.5 trillion.  It is, therefore, essential to leverage private sector capital to have a realistic chance of achieving the sustainable development goals.  Standing between policymakers and private finance, IFC is well-positioned to bridge this gap and encourage investment in developing countries.  The proposed capital increase has the potential to double IFC investment to $25 billion by 2030.  Under the agreed package, this increased investment will be targeted toward the world's most disadvantaged countries and to address gender equality and climate change.  The capital package also includes reforms to increase efficiencies at the bank.</p> <p>  The Government is supportive of the capital increase for the bank which is the largest development actor globally with the scale, expertise and experience to deliver transformative development impact.  The deliverables of the capital increase are closely aligned with Ireland's priorities as articulated in our new development policy, A Better World.  Ireland has the option to take up shares in the IFC under the capital increase which would require a total subscription of $12.6 million over five years.  Our subscription to IFC would count toward the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance.  While we are supportive of the overall capital package, at this stage, a final decision on our take-up of shareholding has not been taken by the Minister for Finance.</p> <p>  An essential part of the agreement on the capital package was the proposed amendment to the IFC's Articles of Agreement which we are here today to discuss.  Specifically, this amendment would increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases from 80% to 85%.  This change will maintain the veto power of the USA in relation to future capital increases at the IFC.  During negotiations, the USA indicated that while it would not contribute to the capital increase, it would not oppose the increase provided that it did not reduce the USA's voting power below the level at which it could exercise a veto.  This was an essential condition for the final agreement.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposed change requires D&aacute;il approval.  This is in line with Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution which outlines that the State will not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement, including any amendments, have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To be clear, the proposed amendment to the IFC's articles does not in itself result in any new immediate charge upon public funds.  However, as the amendment will ultimately create a charge on public funds, the Government is seeking D&aacute;il approval.  A D&aacute;il resolution to approve the proposed change to the IFC's Articles of Agreement will allow Ireland to vote in favour of the amendment.  This will assist in paving the way for the IFC to complete this capital increase and allow it to progress its important mission.</p></speech>

The committee very much supports the proposal.  The work of the World Bank and, in particular, of the International Finance Corporation is important in the developing world.  The proposal is focused very much on the sustainable development goals, climate action and poverty.  While the proposal must ultimate go before the D&aacute;il, is it the case that passing this provides Ireland with an option rather than an obligation?</p></speech>
