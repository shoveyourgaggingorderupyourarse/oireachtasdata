He is joined today by Ms Josephine Mooney, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  I have not had an opportunity to review the minutes of the previous two meetings.  I propose we hold them over to the next meeting, when we can deal with any matters arising.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A deals with briefing material and opening statements.  Nos. 2249A, 2256A, 2257A, 2258A and 2259A are from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These are the briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  We will note and publish those.  </p> <p>  No. 2255A is from Mr. Allen Morgan and provides an opening statement for this afternoon&rsquo;s private meeting.  We will note this item and discuss whether to publish it during the course of the meeting this afternoon.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up material from previous meetings of the committee and other items for publication.</p><p>No. 2161B dated 10 May, which was held over from previous meetings on 13 May and 13 June, is from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the higher Education Authority.  It encloses the report regarding the review of the relationship between Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies and entities undertaken by Mazars.  We have already noted and published this item but it was held over for discussion if any member of committee would like to discuss it briefly.  I know one or two members with a particular interest in this matter are not here.  We have noted and published it but we will hold it over in case any wants to discuss it.  For anybody who is interested in the document, it has already been noted and published.  We might have a further detailed discussion about it at the next meeting.</p><p> No. 2201B dated 31 May 2019 is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the most substantial item of correspondence we have today.  It encloses a minute from the Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on periodic report No. 5 of the Committee of Public Accounts, which covered our meetings from September to November 2018.  The report was published by the committee in March 2019 and I welcome the prompt response, which we received at the end of May, as I said.  I will go through the comprehensive letter.  I reiterate that organisations present their accounts to the committee after they have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We discuss their accounts but that the public meeting of the committee is not the end of the matter.  We proceed to examine the matter in further detail, prepare a report or chapter on each meeting we have and publish the report with recommendations.  We send that to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who prepares a formal response to our recommendations in consultation with the relevant Departments, which is then submitted to the committee.  We now have the response from the Minister.  We take these responses seriously and committee members will make a number of observations.  I will go through each of the report's recommendation.</p></speech>

I have gone through the report and I do not expect the committee to go through all 20 pages in public session.  I will highlight the key points and if members would like clarification about certain matters, that can be done subsequently.  I would like to clear this today.  There are one or two points that invite follow up.</p> <p>  We received this 20-page document before our previous meeting.  I will explain and put it in context.  Our report included chapters on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the President's establishment, Teagasc, the Office of Public Works, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Higher Education Authority, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We made recommendations in each chapter and the Minister has responded to the committee having consulted the various Departments as to whether our recommendations are accepted.  Practically all of the recommendations were accepted and only one or two were rejected.  We want to deal with those issues.</p> <p>  Our first recommendation dealt with NAMA.  The agency's lack of systematic and routine verification of declarations under section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 was unacceptable and we recommended that NAMA put in place a system to verify these declarations for the remainder of its operation.  This was one of the most discussed recommendations.  The Minister of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform rejects this recommendation and has set out his reasons for doing so.  We noted that we were conscious that NAMA had published its annual accounts recently and 95% of its work had been completed.  We noted it was expecting a surplus at the end of its operation in the order of &euro;4 billion and that we were making our recommendation for the remainder of NAMA's work.  The reason given by the Minister for rejecting the recommendation is that providing purchaser compliance with the section 172 agreement would necessitate a comprehensive asset search of every purchaser of NAMA secured assets and would be time-consuming.  He stated the delay could jeopardise any purchase sales and that the process would involve a comprehensive verification of purchaser confirmations and would appear to imply that NAMA does not regard purchaser's written confirmations as having much standing.  He stated the recommendation operates a presumption that many purchasers of NAMA secured assets are willfully breaking the law on this issue.  The committee will write to NAMA about that.  Before Deputy Catherine Murphy speaks about it, I will give my own view on the matter.  By asking for a verification, the committee did not at any stage suggest that NAMA-secured clients were wilfully breaking the law.  That is attributing to us an assumption that we never made.  The Chairman of NAMA was a former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue has a self-assessment system in place and does spot checks now and again.  That does not mean there is a presumption that all taxpayers are wilfully breaking the law.  We were only suggesting some verification.  We never suggested that everyone was wilfully breaking the law and I reject the implication to that effect that the Minister has thrown back at this committee.</p> <p>  The Minister goes on to say that NAMA is taking steps on this matter, in particular to ensure that the purchaser is the same party that executed the contract for sale.  The party executing a contract for sale might not be the same party that completed the purchase agreement.  It was NAMA which spotted that.  The document also notes that NAMA expects new regulations to be in place under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019 on 22 November.  A central register of beneficial ownership of companies and industrial and provident societies will be publicly available at that stage.  Even at EU level, there is acceptance of the need for some verification but that will not happen until the end of November when NAMA will be nearly finished its work.  </p> <p>  I want to counter any suggestion that has been attributed to this committee by NAMA that we were even remotely making a presumption that people were wilfully breaking the law.  We never made any such presumption.</p></speech>

I pointed out, in the section 226 report, that it is very restricted legislation.  It only applies to a sale by NAMA, not by a borrower or a receiver.  It only applies to the sale of a property and not the sale of a loan.  There are definitions of connected persons or debtors for the purposes of the section.  Because NAMA sells loans rather than property, what it has tried to do is to extend that principle to loan sales and it is to be commended on that.  That means that, while there is a legal structure there and a potential that, if NAMA were selling property, there would be some infringement or criminal offence, it is not in the same league when it has applied the same approach or looked for the same declarations in relation to the sale of a loan.  It is very complicated.  Any infringement or irregularity in a declaration that was made around the sale of a loan would not, strictly, be an offence under section 172.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#B01300"><p>I do not think people fully appreciated the need for a section 172 declaration when the legislation was drafted.  It exists on the sale of assets but does not exist, and was not contemplated, for loans.  NAMA has put in place some internal structures to try to capture some of that, even thought it is not specifically covered in the legislation.</p><p>On Project Nantes, we received correspondence which highlighted the difference between the sale of a loan and an asset.  There is a particular distinction, of which we were not aware up to that point.  Mr. McCarthy is working on-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00200"><p>I am working on a report on Project Nantes.  Another issue that arose in that regard was what was a connected person for the purposes of section 172.  However, section 172 only applies to the sale of a property by NAMA.  That is not what was happening in Project Nantes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00300"><p>The advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers was that a director of the same company might not necessarily be a connected person.  It was stated a director of a similar company might have been involved in the purchase of a loan.  However, under the legislation, a director may be and, in many cases, is a connected person, but that is not always the case.  We are getting into distinctions some people will follow.  Their job is to tease out the detail of the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00400"><p>Essentially, the legislation was presented in a particular light.  The expectation was that anyone who was the original owner and transferred to NAMA would not become the beneficial owner again at a reduced price.  That is shorthand for how it was presented.  NAMA is probably being blamed for a shortfall in the legislation and in anticipating how things would play out.  The public expectation was that a person would not be able to buy back a loan at less than its face value before the discount.  That was an important assurance that was given.  The criticism may be focused on NAMA and that may be legally wrong.  At least one Garda investigation is under way and it probably relates to the circumstances outlined in a reply I received to a parliamentary question which states NAMA concluded its investigations and is satisfied that no breach occurred.  What it is stating is right from its perspective.  I have not listened to the definition, but the allegation is that a person is back in control of an asset that was substantially discounted.</p> <p>  Another aspect relates to SI 110/2019 under the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019.  This information was also contained in the reply to my parliamentary question.  Essentially, we are told that there will be a central register of beneficial ownership information.  I do not think it will be backdated, but it will be of great importance in knowing who are the beneficial owners.  As was identified when we discussed the matter of connected persons, there is a deficiency in the law and a gap in terms of what the expectation was and knowing who is the beneficial owner.  I have no doubt that some people are back in control of their assets.  It may be that the loan was sold and that there was a second transaction.  If examples are being identified, it may be down to a flaw in the legislation.  It is very frustrating to see such practices, particularly where people can point to things that others were able to do that they were not.  That is certainly not the way the public expected the legislation to work in practice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#C00500"><p>The Deputy is correct in that regard.  It is strange that we are almost at the end of the NAMA story and 95% of the issue has been dealt with, but this issue is only coming out now.  When the legislation was being drafted, it was decided to establish the National Asset Management Agency.  I know that the asset was the loan, but people were thinking of properties and the sale thereof when the legislation was being enacted.  The sale of loans was not as common at the time as it is today.  It is only with the passage of time that it has become more widespread.  Financial institutions around the world are no longer buying property assets from each other; rather, they are buying loans that control the assets.  That was probably not envisaged from a business perspective when the NAMA legislation was being drafted.  As these practices became more common, the legislation should, perhaps, have been amended.  We might ask NAMA to comment on this matter.  We accept what it states.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of the European Union (Anti-Money Laundering: Beneficial Ownership of Corporate Entities) Regulations 2019, but they will only apply to companies incorporated here; therefore, there is a limit straightaway in dealing with this issue.  It would be interesting to know how much of the disposal of NAMA's entire portfolio consisted of loan sales which were not covered by section 172 and how much consisted of the sale of assets through receivers or the owners of the assets selling and making good their loans.  Mr. McCarthy may know those details.  In other words, what percentage of NAMA's activity was loan sales by it which were not strictly covered by section 172?  Does Mr. McCarthy have that information or should we seek it directly from NAMA?</p></speech>

The Oireachtas drafted the legislation, not NAMA.

We drew attention to the fact that there was no verification process thereafter.  NAMA has outlined some of the constraints and practicalities that apply.

When the NAMA Bill was going through the Houses, I was in the Senate and said that this is all new territory and I would not be surprised if, as things evolved, there needed to be a NAMA No. 2 or No. 3 Bill.  There never was.  Perhaps it is my conspiratorial mind, but there is form here.  We are having this exact discussion on the oversight of the IBRC liquidation.  Given the way the legislation is written, history will record that Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly and the NAMA team have done an exceptional job.  It is us who did not do such a good job in providing the necessary oversight and agility in that regard.  History will also record that the overall effect of authorities in Northern Ireland extracting the building industry from the NAMA process here, notwithstanding any ongoing criminal investigations, allowed them to do deals all over the place and get back to normality an awful lot quicker than us.</p> <p>  Sadly, without the appropriate oversight, the only reflection mechanisms we have in this country are tribunals of inquiry and commissions of investigation.  That is a failing in NAMA, but it is not a failing of the leadership of NAMA, who, under the legislation, has done as good a job as it could.  It was envisaged that it would take 20 years and might make &euro;1 billion; it will now be done in ten to 12 years and will make a profit of &euro;4 billion.  Those are the headline figures but there are a lot of individual stories where people may have gripes about how they were dealt with; the courts will deal with those.  </p> <p>  There is form here, however.  On reflection, we feel that the Oireachtas got it wrong, but we are doing precisely the same with the IBRC liquidation, except we have been highlighting it for two years now without any progress.</p></speech>

The spirit of section 172 could never have played out, and NAMA would have seen that most directly.  We have all been knocking on doors recently, and I have noticed a gap in the planning legislation in relation to strategic projects.  It is a small thing but when one notices it, one has to ask how it can be dealt with.  I would have thought that part of NAMA's remit would be to make sure that the public got the absolute maximum.  If something was bought and then quite quickly sold to the original owner for a fraction of-----</p></speech>

The mechanism was not effective and there was a further onus on the body, because it was aware that the mechanism was defective.  That is the point I started to make.

The sponsoring Department had to be aware of this from its ongoing contact with NAMA.  It is impossible that the Department was not aware of this.  I do not blame NAMA but it was impossible for the Department not to have been acutely aware of this issue all along.  The Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted it in his report, NAMA's legal advice is clear and the legal advice in the Oireachtas is clear.  The Department must have understood the position for years; it is the Department that should have spotted this.  We will see it three or four more times, where the issues we have highlighted are essentially deficiencies in the legislation that the various Departments should have dealt with.  We have had a good discussion and will note the response.</p> <p>  The next recommendation is the final one in relation to NAMA.</p></speech>

I was shown a schedule of what was offered to each local authority by NAMA, the houses that were taken up and the reason for the rejection of particular houses in specific locations.  Some of them were expensive properties in the wrong locations and in other cases there was no infrastructure in place to service the sites.  My local authority was able to explain satisfactorily to me.  Every local authority should able to do likewise because they have the same information.  The Deputy asked that NAMA be requested to provide a list of the 7,000 properties.  That would be a long list.  I do not want to put undue work on the system.  I suggest that she asks her local authority for a list of what was accepted and rejected by it in regard to the offer by NAMA.</p></speech>

If anyone wants further detail on it, we will provide it.  </p> <p>  The next issue in our periodic report is the President's Establishment in respect of which the committee made a recommendation on the audit committee that did not meet.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the recommendation is accepted and the audit committee is now up and running.  The next recommendation - which is a key recommendation - is in regard to there being no statutory audit of the &euro;317,000 residential allowance paid from the Central Fund, which is granted to the Presidential Establishment under statutory instrument.  The Minister for Finance notes the recommendation that relates to non-voted expenditure from the Central Fund is administered by his Department and does not require D&aacute;il approval.  The Minister has further informed the committee that while the allowance for the President's Establishment is established the principle of paying an allowance from non-voted central funds is established in the Presidential Establishment Act 1938 and any amendment would require a change to primary legislation.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to draft legislation but it is open to any Oireachtas Member to draft a Private Members' Bill to deal with the issue.  This committee has taken this as far as it can.  We are now in a situation whereby legislation is the issue.  It is a legislative matter for the Oireachtas.  Members can choose to follow it up if they so choose.  The committee has done its bit on it.</p></speech>

It is now &euro;317,000 per annum.  This is not about the current President any more than it is about Douglas Hyde.  It is about appropriate oversight.  There are expenses associated with the Presidency, be that wardrobe expenses and so on, that I am sure the public would support and understand.  The value that the President gives in terms of promoting Ireland internally and abroad, at &euro;12 million, is cheap but the &euro;317,000 allowance does not help the complexion when we are here trying to sort out other issues.  I appreciate it is not the committee's function to legislate.  I may consider bringing forth a Private Members' Bill which, hopefully, will get cross-party support.  I am again at pains to point out and underline that this is not about the current President anymore than it is about any previous or future President but it is a matter that needs to be rectified.</p></speech>

First, 12 months ago one would have thought that this allowance was established for the current President in his previous term but it had to pointed out that it dates back to 1938.  It not having been administered in a public fashion did not afford the President, as a candidate, any protection in regard to it.  It is the responsibility of the Houses not to put the current President or future Presidents in the position of having to set up an independent committee.  There is no doubt goodwill has been shown on the part of the President, as we said at the time.</p> <p>  Second, in regard to the committee's recommendation that this allowance be considered under Vote 1, therefore making it subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, did the Department think we were suggesting it just be shoved into that Vote?  Of course, it requires a change in legislation.</p></speech>

This fund is paid from the Central Fund, which does not go through a Vote in the Oireachtas.  In addition to the President's allowance, the Central Fund also includes payments for the Judiciary and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I am a layman, but the President's Establishment, the Judiciary, and the Comptroller and Auditor General are three independent constitutional offices.  It is probably to ensure the independence of those offices from the political argy-bargy that could go on in the D&aacute;il if judges' salaries had to go through it every year during the debate on Estimates.  Whether it is right or wrong, it is an effort to keep the independence of the-----</p></speech>

The Chairman cannot say there was not.  That may be the intention but it is not how it played out.</p></speech>

That is the only aspect of it that is different from the others.  The amount paid to those officeholders is published and known because it is a salary, whereas this allowance has a different character.</p></speech>

There might have been political argy-bargy, or it might have been interpreted as such, but it is not our fault it ended up being the only issue in the presidential campaign.  It was a fairly dead campaign anyway.  I voted for the incumbent, so it is not about that any more than it is about Douglas Hyde.  The Department is coming back with the usual statement that it has been noted.  For the Department, "note" is just another word for a rejection, because that is what it is doing.  The Department is saying it is not accepting this, and wishing us good luck.  We need to have some amount of money that is available to the President for him or her to do with what he or she wants.  I do not have a problem with that.  It is great that there is an independent internal committee, and I have looked on the website too, but those are broad brush strokes.  I first raised this before the presidential election, and I am not saying that we necessarily want to see what every shilling was spent on, but I would be happy if the Comptroller and Auditor General did.  It might not be for public consumption, but if the Comptroller and Auditor General is able to say that he has audited it and is happy, that is enough.  On that basis, I might, perhaps in a private capacity, consider an amendment to the Presidential Establishment Act.</p></speech>

The next item relates to Teagasc.  The committee recommended that Teagasc ensures procurement processes are complied with, and that has been accepted in full.  We spotted an issue, and that has been accepted.</p><p>The next recommendation states:</p><blockquote>The committee recommends that a more sustainable method for establishing funds for both (a) infrastructural maintenance and (b) longer term capital projects be developed by Teagasc, in consultation with relevant Government Departments.</blockquote> <p>The Minister has accepted that, but he also notes that there is an annual Estimates process, so that is an issue for long-term planning as the Estimates are an annual process.  However, the Department accepts what we are saying.</p><p>We then move on to the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We made a recommendation relating to the new headquarters for the Department of Health, the Miesian Plaza, that there be more engagement and consultation with the staff of any public body.  We felt adequate consultation between the OPW and the Department of Health did not occur in this case.  That is fully accepted and the Minister has informed us that the OPW intends to pilot a changed management consultancy approach for single, large-scale relocation programmes, which will improve the lines of communication.  That is good.Recommendation 8 also deals with the Miesian Plaza and the fact that there was an overpayment of &euro;10 million due to the measurements used in the project.  The OPW accepts that recommendation and the Minister informs us that an independent review of all the final copies of all leases against what was originally agreed in the original terms prior to the lease agreement will be implemented, and has already been implemented in new leases.</p><p>We will move on to the next recommendation, which states:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the development of business cases by the Office of Public Works in relation to major projects include a robust analysis of key options and alternatives, plus associated costs, as required under the public spending code.</blockquote> <p>That is accepted.  The OPW further states that, as part of the sanction process, the technical aspects of their cost effectiveness analyses were reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform prior to sanction being given.  On the issue of leasing properties versus purchasing them, the OPW has carried out detailed assessments of two recent major projects.  That matter is being examined and it has started looking at the long-term benefits of buying or building versus leasing.  It is looking at that, but that is something the Oireachtas is always going to have to keep a regular eye on in future, because it is not a once-off issue.</p><p>Next, we recommended that legislation should be implemented on a timely matter-----</p></speech>

There are better value locations and higher cost locations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#F01700"><p>The next chapter in the report relates to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We had a discussion on the new single public service pension scheme.  We were critical of the fact that the Department had not carried out its work before the legislation was passed, and it has accepted that completely.  The Department says that, due to other pressures, it did not have the resources available to support the implementation of the legislation.  That is dreadful.  It goes on to say that the Department undertook a comprehensive analysis of the public service bodies to be included in the legislation in 2018, which was two years after the legislation was passed.  It says it submitted a report to the Committee of Public Accounts in February 2019 and the only outstanding issue was the Dental Council of Ireland, which we dealt with last week.  The Department has given us a complete update and that matter is now closed, but is only closed because of the committee's close scrutiny of the particular issue.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had highlighted that, so at least that topic is now fully closed and being dealt with as a result of our vigilance on the matter.</p><p>The next item also deals with the single pension scheme.  We recommended that consideration be given to investing these pension funds in a fund similar to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It fully accepts this recommendation but the Department says it is a complex matter and would be a major change in approach for funding public sector pensions as contributions under the single pension public pension scheme are slightly different from the old arrangement.  The Department further states:</p><blockquote>Given the complexity of the matter, a substantial time and resource investment is required in order to ensure that the correct approach is arrived at. Accordingly, while this matter is progressing, it will not be concluded in the short term. The Department can update the PAC on progress, as required.</blockquote> <p>If somebody wants to come forward with amending legislation on how that fund is invested, that would be a matter for any Member of the House or of this committee, but not for the Committee of Public Accounts itself.  We have highlighted the issue and the matter is now being examined.</p><p>The next item relates to leasing, and again to the Miesian Plaza.  We were not satisfied that the balance between leasing properties and the acquisition of properties was correct and it accepts that fully.  It has commenced a review, and has conducted a detailed assessment on two major projects recently.  That recommendation is accepted by the Department, but we again have to follow its implementation.</p><p>The next issue refers to the credibility of the annual Estimates.  We recommended that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should work closely with Departments with a history of requesting Supplementary Estimates, in order to ensure the Estimates presented to the Oireachtas are accurate from the outset.  It notes that and hears what we are saying but does not want to accept that it presented inaccurate Estimates.  I did not expect it to accept that, though we believe it.</p><p>It is saying &quot;We hear what you say.&quot;  We will ask for information on what is stated about the Department of Health because the Department of Health requires the biggest Supplementary Estimates each year.  The bottom of page 9 states:</p><blockquote>The creation of a new oversight group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and reform, to monitor spending and act as an early warning mechanism [in respect of the Department of Health Vote].<br /><br />Monthly spending reports from Health to be submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health each month, and<br /><br />A quarterly health financial management memo to Government, to update Government on the overall health position.</blockquote><p>I note the Government is voicing concern over health expenditure overruns at a much earlier stage in the year than was historically the case.  I propose writing to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform asking it to give us the background to this oversight group on the health Vote - who is on it; who chairs it and what its instructions are.  I am pleased to see it is there, but this is the first I had heard of it and we now see it in print.  Let us find out more about it.<br/><br/>On the Estimates, we recommended &quot;that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform takes all necessary steps to ensure that the Estimates are approved by the Oireachtas before the beginning of the calendar year to which they relate&quot;.<br/><br/>The letter notes this recommendation and states that the Estimates for 2019 were &quot;published before the end of 2018 [on] 19 December 2018&quot;, which is fine.  That is only the first step of the process, however.  There is then the Revised Estimates process, which can include extra matters.  They were published normally in February and go on for debate.  We need to get the exact dates of when the Revised Estimates were published for the past two or three years, what the plan for next year is, and when the debate on the Revised Estimate can take place in the Oireachtas committee.  While the Estimates are published early on, there is no D&aacute;il debate on them until several months into the year when the Revised Estimates come out.  The European Union has set timetables.  We will ask for more specific details on the timetable for discussing and approving the Estimates, including the Revised Estimates by the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>On the Higher Education Authority we recommended &quot;that, when drafting Higher Education Authority legislation, the Department of Education and Skills ensures that the Higher Education Authority is granted sufficient powers to allow it to provide effective oversight of the third level sector&quot;.  That came as a result of the investigation into Waterford Institute of Technology.  It fully accepted the recommendation and gave two pages of detailed response, referring to a number of changes to legislation.  It states:</p><blockquote>Currently, a Memorandum for Government is being drafted with the aim of submitting this for approval in June 2019.  This Memorandum will seek approval for:- the updating of the Higher Education Act, 1971 and the broad policy approach being adopted,<br /><br />- the inclusion of a review power for the HEA in the legislation,<br /><br />- the publication of the consultation report.</blockquote><p>That is important.  We highlighted practical issues over what is happening with spending.  Here we find the legislation was deficient in the first place and it is now being corrected.  Quite a bit of what we are uncovering in terms of following the taxpayers' money has its problems in defective or inadequate legislation in the first place.  It is not for the Committee of Public Accounts to draft the legislation; our job is to highlight it.  It is up to the Oireachtas, any Member of the Oireachtas or the Government to act accordingly.  We have taken it as far as we can.<br/><br/>The next issue also relates to the HEA.  We recommended &quot;that the governing bodies of third level institutions acquire and maintain the appropriate skills&quot; etc.  It fully accepts that there should be an appropriate skills mix.  The governing bodies should identify gaps themselves.  There should be an annual self-assessment of the board.  Under the Technological Universities Act 2018, greater emphasis has been given to this issue.  This matter needs to be included in the proposed Higher Education Authority legislation.  Hopefully it will be.<br/><br/>We come to the Revenue Commissioners.  We had a recommendation for reducing the threshold at which they deem people to be high-wealth individuals for investigation.  They fully accept the recommendation.  We had a good outcome last week.  They wrote to us last week saying they had done it and increased the number of cases now under this as a result of reducing the threshold from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million for high-wealth individuals to be examined by the large cases division.  There were 200 cases involved.  This has resulted in another 475 being added, which is a very big increase.  That is now being implemented and we dealt with that in correspondence last week.  That is a very good outcome.<br/><br/>We recommended &quot;that Revenue investigates the possibility of developing guidelines regarding out of court settlements for tax avoidance schemes in order to ensure a level of consistency in reaching such settlements in future&quot;.  We discussed this matter.  It is in our report, so people will remember what we are talking about.  The Revenue Commissioners stated that in the majority of cases, like the ones we are talking about, there were out-of-court settlements and they reached settlements of &euro;500 million in those cases.  Maybe we did not delve into the detail.  They say they have detailed compliance notes on that.  The letter states that Chapter 8 of Revenue's &quot;Code of Practice for Revenue Audit and Other Compliance Interventions&quot; deals with that.  We are pleased to see that.<br/><br/>On high-wealth individuals, we recommended that &quot;consideration is given to requiring High Wealth Individuals to provide Revenue with an annual statement of assets held in Ireland&quot;.  It states this would require a legislative change.  Here we are.  We highlighted a legitimate issue.  When we delve into our stuff, again the problem is that the legislation does not cover it.  It is not the Revenue's fault.  I am highlighting that if any Member wants to deal with that topic by way of legislation, he or she should feel free to do so.  It accepts the reality that it is a legislative issue that needs to be dealt with.<br/><br/>The next recommendation for the Revenue Commissioners dealt with the tobacco trade and the very low level of fines, which we felt were not a deterrent.  They accept the recommendation, which is good.  The response states, &quot;The imposition of these penalties in individual cases is a matter for the Courts.&quot;  Tax represents 80% of the cost of a packet of cigarettes.  The Revenue Commissioners raise &euro;1.4 billion in tax from tobacco products each year.  They estimate that 13% of all cigarettes smoked in Ireland are illegal.  Revenue estimates the loss to the taxpayer at approximately &euro;229 million per annum.  Between January and October of last year when we were doing our work, in the cases they prosecuted they followed up about &euro;23 million worth of cases, which meant that 93% of their estimate of what was illegal was not detected or followed up on.  Fines were issued for &euro;140,000, which is fairly abysmal.  They say it is up to the judges and the fines will be increased.  I feel there is not sufficient detection of the issue if there is that level of revenue loss.<br/><br/>The next item also related to the Revenue Commissioners.  We recommended &quot;that the Minister considers whether separate identification of trading losses forward and capital allowances can be provided for in future legislation&quot;.  Under the legislation, any business that has losses from a previous year can carry it forward against future profits to reduce its taxable profits in a future year.  Most people accept that if a company has a trading loss, that is fair enough.  Sometimes, if the losses are as a result of capital allowances relating to capital expenditure, we proposed that these be identified separately so that we can get a measure of all these losses forward.  There is a big gap in knowing how the losses forward are made up.<br/><br/>The Minister noted the recommendations but under the scheme of corporation tax, they do not actually do the breakdown.  The letter stated, &quot;The amount of any trading losses... is not broken down between that which relates to capital allowances and that which relates to other trading expenses&quot;.  That is exactly what we asked them to do.  The Minister for Finance looked at this issue in respect of the banks, which is relevant to all corporate entities, in a report published in 2018.  Again people might want to draft legislation on the matter; it cannot be done without legislation.  The Revenue Commissioners made it clear that they have no legal authority to seek the information and the legislation does not require it.</p><p>If people feel it is a matter that needs to be dealt with by legislation, they should do so.</p></speech>

Is that slightly different?  This is stated just after recommendation A.21.  Is it slightly different?  Is the Minister considering previous money and just saying it is a matter of legislation?  Is that a subtle difference?</p></speech>

It takes years of experience.</p> <p>  We accept that.  He sees the validity and notes what we are saying, and he is saying he will consider it.  He is not saying "Yes" or "No", and he has not rejected it.  It is up to any Oireachtas Member if they want deal with that issue.  That is how I see it.  It is legislation, full stop.  It is the finance Bill.  One would then have to get the signature of the Taoiseach, and I am sure there would be a cost to the Exchequer, but we will not even get into that debate.</p> <p>  The next item concerns the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The report states that the committee recommends that an annual review take place to ensure the new controls regarding overpayments to jobseeker's under 25 are working effectively.  When they introduced that scheme, there were different rates for persons under 21, those aged 21 to 25, and those over 26.  It was difficult for the Department.  It was a new scheme and there were inconsistencies across the Department.  Officials told us at the time there was one person in each office with particular expertise who looked at all of this.  They have acknowledged the work has been carried out.  The most recent review was conducted in February 2019 and all cases reviewed were confirmed as being correct.  A further review is being planned, subject to the outcome being satisfactory and, in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is proposed to schedule further reviews on an annual basis.  The Department has taken up the recommendation and worked on it.  The recent reports of cases examined means they are fully correct, so at least the recommendation is being carried through and the Department is going to keep an eye on it into the future. </p></speech>

On a minor but important issue which I come across, flexibility is also required in some of these matters.  I have dealt with youngsters who perhaps grew up in a foster arrangement or in care.  When they are 18, they are in a very different position from somebody who is at home in a middle-class household.  Whereas we are sometimes looking for rigidity or consistency in how something is applied, we should not lose sight of the fact that flexibility can be important as well.</p></speech>

I was nervous of this recommendation lest it be seen that we were trying to get at vulnerable young people.  We tried to make our recommendation as sensitive as possible because we all understand the point the Deputy is making.  We hope the Department is listening to that.</p></speech>

We were concerned about delays in dealing with any payments that required a medical assessment, such as disability or invalidity benefit, in that there is a lack of doctors and there is always a delay on the medical side.  We made the recommendation to examine the possibility of contracting nurses to carry out medical assessments more promptly.  The Department fully accepts the recommendation and states:</p><blockquote>Overall, the numbers of medical opinions provided have been maintained over the two years - 2017 and 2018- at 87,908 and 87,603 respectively.  Currently the numbers awaiting a medical opinion at claim stage are below 1,000, [which seems quite low] with an average waiting time of less than 2 weeks for most schemes, 3 weeks for Domiciliary Care Allowance and 4 weeks for Disability Allowance.<br /><br />Following the recent recruitment competition for medical assessors, seven candidates have been successfully placed on a panel and the first placements commenced in early March 2019.<br /><br />The Department is currently considering the option of employing registered clinical nurse practitioners [as part of this process].</blockquote> <p>It also points out these applications can be held up because of means tests but we were concentrating on the medical side.  The Department seems to have acknowledged there was an inordinate delay.  It has recruited the staff since March of this year.</p></speech>

Essentially, the problem goes further back.  There is a non-acceptance of medical evidence and the case then has to be reassessed.  This is where a consultant says somebody has an illness that will continue for 12 months, and, in any case, the person will not qualify for, say, invalidity pension unless the disability is going to be continuous for a period of not less than 12 months.  While the consultant says that and the GP backs that up, the case can still be rejected.  The Chairman has seen this himself.</p></speech>

There is a rush to disallow some of these applications.  The number of cases overturned on appeal shows us there is a problem in the original decision, despite there being a decent volume of evidence.  I am not saying people should be paid allowances or benefits without providing the information but, in my office, I see people submitting copious volumes of information.  This was prevalent in regard to domiciliary care payments and we just told people to expect a refusal and, if they did not get one, it was a bonus.  There is a problem further back.  While some of that has been rectified, there is still a problem in regard to the rate of refusals that are overturned.</p></speech>

Somebody in the Department should undertake a strategic analysis of the outcomes of these cases from the appeals office.  If so many are being overturned, perhaps the criteria the appeals office are using should be used as the criteria for stage 1 of the application.  We all know that when a case goes to the appeals office, the officials will tell the person to get more up-to-date medical information due to the passage of time, if nothing else, given the long delays involved, and the person will need to have an up-to-date consultant's report.  That tends to work in the appeals office.  The question is why it did not work on day one.  The Department should examine what is done in the appeals office and see what manuals it is using, and then try to use the same approach from day one.  We all share the same experience.</p> <p>  The next item deals with the same Department.  The committee recommends that the JobPath programme be reviewed on a value for money basis to determine whether the programme should continue.  The Department accepts the recommendation in full.  It has conducted many surveys and the CSO has conducted a survey, with the statistics and business intelligence unit within the Department.</p></speech>

The Department says it has examined this and it concluded that 20% more people get jobs when compared to those who did not go in the first instance, although that is not very high.  It then says that those who do get jobs earn, on average, 16% more than those who do not, perhaps because they get a better job.</p><p>The Department states that it is going to compile another report on the savings from the scheme as a result of people no longer claiming social protection payments.

It is very important for the protection of employees that the proper PRSI is deducted and recorded.  The report also states :</p><blockquote>This programme included a special Employer Inspection Conference that took place in early April 2019 and was attended by approx. 200 Inspectors.  [...]  Arising from this, and as part of its 2019 control plan, the Department has now set a target of 8,000 employer inspections for this year.  In 2018, the Department carried out just over 2,050 employer inspections.</blockquote> <p>That is nearly a quadrupling of inspections.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I want to tell employers that there will be four times as many inspections of the records of employers' PRSI contributions in the future in order to ensure that people who are in employment are getting the benefit of the PRSI contributions to which they are entitled.  The Department is stepping up those investigations.  Some people will like that.  It is important for the protection of employees.  That took a long time.  It is a big report.  It is an example of the work we do.  I want to quickly move on to-----</p></speech>

It is up to members to deal with that.</p> <p>  I now want to move on to the rest of the correspondence as quickly as possible.  Some of it is relevant to this issue.  One of the reasons I want to mention some of it is that issues raised within it are mentioned in some of this morning's newspapers.  As Chairman, letters went out in my name to quite a few public bodies whose accounts were not submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the end of March.  We would like to see accounts within three months of the end of the year in the interests of good financial governance.  We waited until the end of April to send these letters, thereby giving the bodies a bit of leeway.  There are 18 bodies on the list and we have received replies from 13 so far.  I will mention them briefly.</p> <p>  No. 2202B is correspondence from Water Safety Ireland in which it states it submitted its accounts by 30 May.  We will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give us a report on the small number of bodies which have still not submitted their accounts at next week's meeting.

That is good.</p> <p>  We also have a letter from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, regarding the financial statements for the fishery harbour centres.  I am not completely happy with this.  He states that the emphasis in the Department is on getting the Vote accounts ready for audit, which is fine, and that, as this is now well advanced, the Department has been liaising with the staff of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and has confirmed that the statements for the fishery harbour centres will be submitted for audit later this month.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can give us an update next week, although I would still ask the Secretary General to get these statements in on time in future and to ensure that the Department has the resources to do so.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2231B from the Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This is on a different topic.  We will hold this item over until the next meeting.  It is not on the topic about which we are talking.</p> <p>  No. 2232B is from the HSE and has regard to the account for the long-stay repayment scheme, the long-stay repayment scheme donation account and the private property account.  The HSE says that the first two of these accounts have been submitted and the patient private property account was submitted on 3 June.  They are all coming in.  The reason I am reading these out is that some of them may be of public interest.</p> <p>  The next item is from Dublin City University, DCU.  It has sent a long letter.  It states that there was a once-off issue due to the DCU incorporation project.  That involved the amalgamation of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, the Mater Dei Institute of Education and the Church of Ireland College of Education into DCU.  We understand that this was a start-up process.  As a result of all of this, DCU had to restate its previous financial statements, which had been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and KPMG.  I can understand that involved quite a bit of once-off work.  The university says that, notwithstanding that, it is working closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General and KPMG in this regard.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is scheduled to begin its audit on 24 June.  We will get an update on that.  The letter is quite detailed.  We will note and publish it, even though I believe it is already in the public domain.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 2234B, which is correspondence from St. Angela's college, Sligo, which states that its audit was scheduled to commence on 17 June.  As it is now 20 June, I take it that the accounts are in.  We will get the update.</p> <p>  University College Cork states that its audit is due to commence with a site visit on 24 June.  I take it that the accounts will be submitted in time for that.</p> <p>  No. 2238B is from the Legal Aid Board.  Its accounts were submitted on 31 May.</p> <p>  The next item is from the Church of Ireland united diocese of Dublin and Glendalough with regard to the Church of Ireland College of Education.  It states that the college was being wound up.</p></speech>

I am informed that the accounts will be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office this week, on 21 June..</p> <p>  I also received a reply from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, regarding financial statements for the environment fund.  Departmental officials agreed last year that the accounts would be submitted on 30 June.  Mr. Griffin indicates that arrangements have been put in place to ensure that timeline is met.</p> <p>  The reply from the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council thanks the committee for its letter and indicates that its accounts have since been submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  There may have been a slight misinterpretation of our letter in that the council took it to mean that we wished to see its accounts before they went to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  To clarify, our letter was to request that they be submitted to Mr. McCarthy's office.</p> <p>  That last batch of letters came into my possession yesterday.  I did not have time to circulate them before today's meeting but I wished to get them on the record.  We have made great progress in ensuring that public bodies submit their financial statements for audit.  It may be boring stuff, but it is important to keep the pressure on them.  If they do not produce annual financial statements, they are not doing their work and we cannot do ours.</p></speech>

In response to a priority question I asked in the D&aacute;il yesterday, the Minister indicated that he is not going to set up a committee of inspection.  He also said that the special liquidator has produced six voluntary reports, which are available on the Department's website.  Those reports do not necessarily form part of the scrutiny we are conducting here, but some of the content may be relevant.  It would be useful to go through them if we are having a discussion here, so that we can compare one thing against the other.</p></speech>

We have no statements of account to consider.  We will shortly welcome delegates from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to discuss the 2017 appropriation account for Vote 30.  In the afternoon, we have a private meeting with Mr. Allen Morgan, a former surveyor at the Office of Public Works.  I ask as many members as possible to try to attend the afternoon session.</p> <p>  Next Thursday, we will have delegates from the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive here to discuss in public session the health Vote and the HSE's financial statement for 2018.  The following Thursday, we have a discussion with delegates from the National Treasury Management Agency.  The State Claims Agency will probably be our main focus in that discussion, so we might allocate separate time for that.  On 11 July, we will discuss the accounts for the Houses of the Oireachtas, followed by a private meeting that afternoon to discuss the IBRC liquidation.</p> <p>  In addition, we will have a private meeting next Tuesday at 1 p.m. to consider the first input to our next periodic report, which is a discussion document produced by the secretariat.  We might have to hold another meeting the following day, because we must complete our first reading of it next week if it is to be ready for publication before the recess.  I have a word of caution for any journalists listening who may receive a copy of the document that is issued to committee members this week.</p><p>The document is not from the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a discussion document prepared by the secretariat, so people should draw conclusions or reprint potential conclusions at their peril.  The report will be significantly amended by the committee over the course of our three or four meetings on the matter.  Anyone who prints what they think is a conclusion is barking up the wrong tree.  That is all I can say.  They can print away if they want.  I make that observation because it tends to happen, so I am putting out that public warning.  That is the work programme and those are the private meetings.  We might have to go into private session before the witnesses come in, or we can do the private session this afternoon.  Some items correspond, but the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, was mentioned.</p></speech>

The six reports are glorified PowerPoint presentations, which we would have received.  There is not much in them besides a headline figure so they will not give us much detail on that, though we could review them before the private meeting.  It is good that Deputy Catherine Murphy asked about IBRC, but the response was unsatisfactory.  The Minister is obviously a very busy man and these responses are often written on Ministers' behalf by their teams.  We can understand that.  However, in his answer to Deputy Catherine Murphy, which she has shared with me, the Minister clearly sets out that we disapplied normal rules in legislation for this liquidation, which is the biggest in the history of the State.  The Minister says we can go through the six PowerPoint presentations on the website to see the headline figures.  However, we have established here that two people have effectively been put in place in lieu of a committee of inspection, and that was reaffirmed recently.  Based on my own humble experience, having voluntarily liquidated my own company with very modest turnovers and so on, it is just laughable.  The issue here is not that we are not going to get to the end of this, because we will, no matter how long it takes.   We will all celebrate and back-clap and say how well it was done, but we have highlighted that we had no benchmark position because no evaluations were done at the beginning, and so on.  Apart from that, the Government is heading for costs, by its own admission, of &euro;306 million, and we do not know if that represents good value.  The Minister cannot be satisfied, despite what he said in response to Deputy Catherine Murphy's question.  We need to stay on this and keep pushing it because long after we are gone, that reflection mechanism Deputy Connolly spoke of will be no doubt set up, there will be a commission of investigation or a tribunal of inquiry, and we could save the State a great deal of money by just doing a few little bits now.</p></speech>

From the Department, we are joined by its Secretary General, Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Dr. Cecil Beamish, Mr. Martin Crowley, Ms Patricia Heeney and Mr. Paul Dillon.  We are also joined by Ms Georgina Hughes Elders from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn their phones off entirely or setting them to airplane mode.  Merely putting them on silent will interfere with the broadcast system.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that committee members shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>Before I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, I wish to point out that the meeting will also deal with the fishery harbour centres' accounts for 2016 and 2017, the European Agriculture Guarantee Fund, the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.</p><p>I apologise to Mr. Gleeson and his colleagues for the late start but we had to deal with a large amount of correspondence which was held over from the Department of Finance and the Minister for Finance which I wanted to clear today.  However, it took some time.  I am conscious that Mr. Gleeson has a flight to catch in the afternoon and the committee will ensure he does not miss it on its account.</p></speech>

This represented a 10% increase on the spend of 1.26 billion in 2016.  The account is presented under four programmes, as indicated in the diagram provided to members.  These programmes correspond to the four key strategic objectives set out in the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy 2016-2019.</p> <p>  Programme B was the largest programme.  This relates to farm and sector supports and controls, and mainly comprises payments which benefit farms and farmers.  Total expenditure charged to the programme amounted to &euro;726 million in 2017 - an increase of over &euro;100 million from the 2016 level of expenditure.</p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding from the Vote each year to a number of State bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  By means of a Supplementary Estimate passed in December 2017, the Department was able to reallocate unspent funds on some subheads totalling almost &euro;50 million to other expenditure subheads.  There was no overall increase in the estimate provision for the Vote through the supplementary process.</p> <p>  At year end, net expenditure under the Vote was &euro;24 million less than provided for.  Some &euro;23.8 million in unspent capital allocations - mainly under the farm and sector supports and controls programme - was carried over for spending in 2018.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, an amount of &euro;207,000, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.  Note 3 provides explanations for the variances in spending and transfers of funding from the various subheads.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account.  However, I drew attention to the Accounting Officer&rsquo;s statement on internal financial control, which discloses non-competitive procurement by the Department of nearly &euro;19 million worth of goods and services in 2017, including a significant level of procurement which was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue for the Department.</p> <p>  The Department directly manages the six fishery harbour centres, which are accounted for separately from the Vote.  The form of the fishery harbour centres' financial statements was devised many years ago.  Unusually, the financial statements of the fishery harbour centres are prepared on both a cash and an accruals basis.  The day-to-day operations of the centres are funded through harbour dues and charges set by law, and rents from State-owned properties.  The income and expenditure account show a surplus for 2017 of &euro;1.5 million.  In addition, annual capital grant funding from the Department is made available for the development and maintenance of harbour facilities.  Capital funding from the Department in 2017 was &euro;17.5 million.</p> <p>  I issued a special report in 2014 on significant ongoing deficiencies in the financial management and reporting for the fishery harbour centres, including significant delays in the timeliness of presentation of accounts.  The report included seven recommendations intended to enhance the financial management of the centres.  The statement on internal financial control discloses the progress the Department has made so far in implementing those recommendations.</p> <p>  As Members are aware, the Department manages significant funds provided by the EU.  Where these are applied on schemes that are co-funded by the Exchequer, the funding is reflected in the vote.  However, payments to farmers and market-related expenditure that are almost fully funded by the EU are not accounted for in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account, even though the Department manages the payments.  Such payments amounted to just over &euro;1.2 billion for 2017.  These are accounted for to the EU in financial statements that are not subject to audit by me.  However, note 6.1 in the appropriation account provides some information about the amounts received from the EU each year.  </p> <p>  At the request of a previous Committee of Public Accounts, it was agreed that the Department, in co-operation with the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, would prepare an annual composite account to provide an overview of the funds flowing to agriculture, fisheries and rural communities, and that this would be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Accordingly, the 2017 financial statements of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund have been prepared and presented, and are before the committee today.</p> <p>  The financial statements present the income and expenditure of these three fund programmes in Ireland, including both EU and Exchequer financing.  They indicate that the combined income and expenditure of the funds was &euro;1.77 billion in 2017, of which &euro;1.5 billion was funded by the EU.  Of course, funds for other, non-agriculture, programmes are also received from the EU, and there are significant annual payments from Ireland to the EU.  These composite accounts before the committee today do not give a sufficiently rounded picture of the transactions with the EU, and so I recently published a special report on Ireland&rsquo;s Transactions with the EU in 2017, which gives a more comprehensive picture.  Members will recall that this was examined with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance.  I recommended in that report that there should be annual reporting, on a consolidated basis, of all Irish contributions to and receipts from the EU.  If the Department of Finance takes up that suggestion, the committee may wish to consider if there is a continuing need for the current composite reporting of EU funding to the agriculture and fisheries sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019062000002#M00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I refer to the Department's appropriation account for 2017 and two associated sets of financial statements.  The first is a non-statutory account, provided for the sake of transparency, which shows the interaction between the funding received from the European Union and the Department's Vote.</p><p>This funding is accounted for separately under EU rules and audited by the EU institutions.  Because the bulk of it is not matched by national funds, much of it does not appear in the  Department&rsquo;s appropriation account and therefore these financial statements provide a fuller picture of total departmental expenditure at both national and EU levels.</p><p> The second is the financial statements for the six fisheries harbour centres owned and operated by the Department.  I will begin with the appropriation account.  The Department&rsquo;s gross Estimate for 2017 was &euro;1.49 billion.  This included a carryover of capital savings of &euro;21.7 million from 2016.  This represented an overall increase of almost &euro;120 million over the gross voted Estimate for 2016.  The gross outturn was &euro;1.387 billion, an increase of &euro;131 million over 2016.  The Department received a technical Supplementary Estimate to further address emerging priorities by the transfer of funds within the Vote.  I will refer to this in my later remarks.  The Department also receives appropriations-in-aid.  These principally comprise EU receipts in respect of rural development and animal disease programmes.  In 2017 these receipts amounted to &euro;258.9 million, some &euro;78 million less than the Estimate of &euro;337 million, largely because EU receipts expected in December 2017 in respect of rural development schemes were not received until January 2018.</p><p> The Department&rsquo;s Vote is divided into four programmes, each representing a key policy priority.  Programme A relates to the food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health programmes that underpin our agrifood sector.  These include disease eradication programmes such as those relating to tuberculosis, TB, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, TSEs, testing for residues in food products, on-farm controls, plant protection controls and other such headings.  Programme expenditure under this heading amounted to just over &euro;80 million in 2017, excluding staff and administration costs.  This is a saving of &euro;5.5 million compared to the budgeted amount.</p><p> Programme B covers our major farm support schemes other than basic payments, which are entirely EU-funded.  By and large, these schemes are intended to encourage sustainable agricultural practices and most of them receive co-funding from the EU under the rural development programme.  The final allocation for these schemes in 2017, following a Supplementary Estimate, came to just under &euro;806 million.  This was some &euro;182 million greater than the &euro;623 million outturn in 2016.  In 2017 almost 50,000 people participated in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  More than 24,000 participated in the beef data and genomics scheme and the sheep welfare and knowledge transfer schemes were launched.  Other co-funded schemes included the areas of national constraint scheme, the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, the organics scheme, and the forestry programme, which alone among these schemes is 100% nationally funded.  The eventual outturn was for this programme was &euro;726 million.  This was more than &euro;100 million greater than the previous year but also &euro;80 million short of the available funds.  Key factors in this shortfall were the fact that participation in the new schemes for sheep welfare and knowledge transfer was lower than provided for, and an adjustment to deadlines for certain actions in the knowledge transfer scheme slowed the payment process, with some falling into 2018.  Similarly, our ambitious target for payments to a very high portion of GLAS participants within the calendar year was not achieved.  However, for the 2018 scheme year close to 90% of GLAS applicants were paid their annual advance within the calendar year.</p><p> On the capital side, the TAMS investment scheme saw a greatly improved drawdown compared to 2016 with &euro;33 million spent, although drawdown was lower than the provision.  To help with the  financial management of the scheme we reduced the time allowed for applicants to submit payment claims.  The experience in the past 18 months reflects good levels of investment in improved on-farm facilities.  Expenditure on the forestry programme was lower than hoped in 2017, and this remains a continuing but critically important challenge.  The capital carryover into 2018 from 2017 was largely drawn from the TAMS and forestry savings in 2017.  I should say that programme B also includes an element of national funding on EU market support schemes such as intervention.</p><p> Programme C, policy and strategy, includes expenditure on research and training and several food support schemes, as well as grants-in-aid to some of our State agencies.  The outturn slightly exceeded the voted allocation of &euro;338 million, due partly to several additional measures designed to help build resilience in the sector to confront the challenge of Brexit.  Those initial measures included an increase in Bord Bia's allocation by &euro;8.6 million to assist it in its marketing and promotion of Irish food overseas.  In addition, the sum of &euro;9 million was provided for the agri-food sector component of the SME Brexit loan scheme.  This scheme was jointly established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Along with &euro;14 million from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, this provision leveraged a working capital loan fund of &euro;300 million for SMEs at an interest rate not exceeding 4%.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine contribution ensured that at least 40% of the fund would be available for the food sector.  Savings which emerged in other parts of the programme, particularly research, allowed us to respond to a specific request from the World Food Programme for the earliest possible release of the final element of funding under our 2016-2018 strategic partnership agreement.  This resulted in payments of &euro;14 million to the World Food Programme in 2017.</p><p> Programme D relates to seafood.  Expenditure under this heading in 2017 included some &euro;21 million for the upgrading and development of fisheries harbours.  Around 88% of fish landed in Ireland now are landed into the six centres owned by the Department.  The value of those landings has increased from &euro;224.3 million in 2013 to &euro;271.5 million in 2017.  Programme D also includes &euro;5.6 million under the seafood development programme and grants-in-aid to the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority.  This programme also includes expenditure of &euro;4 million on the commencement of substantive work on the remediation of Haulbowline Island.</p><p> I will now touch very briefly on the financial statements of the Irish operations for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime Fisheries Fund.  This account consolidates financial data on a calendar year basis, incorporating EU and Vote funds.  It was devised in the early 2000s, at the request of this committee, to provide visibility of expenditure across all these funds as some of the expenditure is not Vote-related.  Notable features in 2017 include EU receipts of more than &euro;1.5 billion across the Irish operations of the three funds.  When combined with the national Exchequer funding of &euro;266.6 million, total expenditure under the funds in 2017 amounts to &euro;1.77 billion.  More generally, I know that the Comptroller and Auditor General has prepared a special report on the full range of Ireland&rsquo;s transactions with the EU in 2017.  That report provides a very clear picture of Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with the EU across all funds and all Departments.</p><p> Finally, I would like to refer to the account relating to fisheries harbour centres.  The harbours were the subject of a special report in 2014 and we are continuing to address some of the  recommendations.  Turning to the financial performance of the harbours themselves, the higher level of harbour dues and profit on disposal were the main factors behind the increases in receipts and the surplus on the revenue account.  The accounts also show the substantial increase in capital investment at the harbours with substantial projects at each of the six harbours, the vast majority of which is funded through the Department's Vote.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their attention and I will try to answer any questions that arise. </p></speech>

I would appreciate succinct answers so that we can get through the several topics I wish to touch on.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the 72 sites throughout the State, which account for nearly 1,000 ha.  One of those is the site at Backweston, with which I am very familiar.  How does the Department control and manage that estate?  Does it map those sites?  Is there a list?

We have a long list of sites around the country, most of which are small holdings with forestry or agricultural land.  We have several research farms.  Costs are associated with the operation of places where we are actively engaged.  One example is the Tops farm in Donegal where we are actively involved in managing a research facility.  There is a farm near Backweston which is managed for the purposes of agricultural sites.  We have a list of these sites.  Many of them are very small sites in rural areas without any significant activity.  No significant costs are associated with their management.</p><p>We have a list of these sites and many are sites in rural areas where there is not significant activity or costs associated with their management.</p></speech>

We got a list of Garda stations that were to be sold and we were quite amazed at some of the things in that list.  It could be useful to have such a list.</p> <p>  The Department had a number of claims and compensation and legal costs to pay.  From my reading, the legal costs were substantially in excess of the amount paid out in the claims.  Why would that have happened?</p></speech>

There was, for example, a case taken by a contractor on the basis of what he regarded as a change in his conditions of engagement.  There was a case involving a ferry company relating to the nature of the departmental fees charged for ferries.

There was an element of compensation paid and that is charged to the fishery harbour centres fund but the legal costs were borne by the Department and they account for nearly half of that figure.  It was a very long-running case that went to the Supreme Court.  There is further detail in the fishery harbour centres account about that case.</p></speech>

Procurement is an issue to which the Committee of Public Accounts pays particular attention and it is a major concern.  It appears that some non-compliance is on general, non-specialist matters.  What kinds of controls does the Department have in place and why was it not compliant in the first place?</p></speech>

This is based on a declaration by the Department of non-competitive procurement and non-compliant procurement, which are not necessarily the same.  In some circumstances where there are specialist requirements for which there is only one supplier or an issue of urgency, there can be a requirement to go to market without competition.  Insofar as our return on this is concerned, if a contract is signed, it remains on the list until such time as the contract is closed off.  There is a cumulative effect such that contracts that might have been declared in 2016 will run for two or three years.  They remain on the list in the following year.  We have done an awful lot of work in the Department on resolving these procurement issues and we are making significant progress.  I can go through some of the figures if the Deputy wishes.</p></speech>

I am just giving that bit of perspective.  That was from procurement of approximately &euro;100 million.  Within the Department, we have established a central procurement unit and a network of procurement liaison officers in every division.  We have trained those procurement officers in proper procedures.  The value of those non-compliant contracts has diminished.  I will return to the Deputy with a figure shortly.</p> <p>  We had 38 contracts valued at &euro;5.6 million in 2017 and the reasons for those fell outside the exceptions provided in the procurement rules.  While this is not in any way to excuse this, I assume that the people who involved themselves in those procurements felt that they complied with the exceptions provided for in the circular.  That should not happen.  We now have a system of assessment by a senior officer before any procurement exception is allowed and it is also assessed by the central procurement unit.  The objective of that system is to eliminate non-compliance altogether and we are confident that we are well on the way to doing that.</p> <p>  Of those 38 contracts, 20 with a value of &euro;1.71 million related to separate contracts that were aggregated.  It is possible that different people contracted with the same party and were dealt with separately.  For the purposes of our return, we felt for the sake of transparency and propriety that they should be aggregated and returned as a single batch.  A substantial part of that non-compliance involved separate contracts with the same vendor.  We do not permit that to happen any more.  Eight of the contracts with a value of &euro;1.8 million were contracts rolled over beyond a reasonable time period.  In other words, they were existing contracts for some services and instead of running a new procurement, they were rolled over.</p></speech>

The difficulty that we had was that there was no information on the location of the list of assets when one went to check on them.  We therefore could not find where the recorded asset was.  On the other hand one could look at the assets and could not necessarily trace them back to an entry on the fixed asset register.  It has been an ongoing issue that we have been raising with the Department.  The unit has been set up since January 2017.

All I can say is that we established a formal process here with a unit and an assessment of what the priorities should be in how to rank and where to start with this project.  This was the ranking that we came up with.  Most assets are fully depreciated in any event and are beyond the depreciation date from a value and accountancy point of view.</p></speech>

The office equipment is, as the Deputy can see, where most of the expense has been incurred.  It is also very heavily depreciated.  These are assets that have been in use for a long time.  These will include such items as ICT equipment and other office equipment.  Is there any software in there?</p></speech>

It must be decided then how funds will be spent.

One is to get a handle on what is out there.  The second is to ensure that the system does not permit this to happen again.  When one looks now at our staff accounts system, a person when making a purchase order is required to put that on the capital assets register.  Those purchases are assessed by the asset management unit now to ensure this happens.  There is a system in place now to prevent this from happening in the future.  It requires the expenditure to be brought to account as a capital asset.</p></speech>

Those requirements arise because the UK intends to leave the Single Market and the customs union.  We flagged a requirement, for when that happens, of almost 500 staff between certification and additional controls.  In the event, there were several false starts with Brexit and we were left having to decide how to handle the recruitment process in circumstances where it was uncertain whether the UK would leave.  The objective was to be able to fulfil the statutory requirements but not commit ourselves in perpetuity to an additional 500 staff.

One of the leases is close to expiry.  Is the Department in the process of renewing the lease?  If so, I understand that commercial sensitivity might be associated with it.

It is an implementing regulation of the European Union and has been published.  The Commission will provide &euro;50 million in funding and calls it a temporary adjustment scheme.  The conditions include membership of an environmental scheme or of a quality assurance scheme, and a requirement for some kind of temporary reduction is imposed by the Commission.  The Commission has looked at the case made on the market.  It has indicated, as it did in the case of the temporary voluntary reduction scheme in the dairy sector a couple of years ago, that if it is a market scheme and farmers want the &euro;50 million, one of the conditions is that there must be some temporary adjustment in supply to address the market issue.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the implementing regulation is before the monitoring committee today.  Afterwards, we will know clearly what the regulation stipulates and we will then have some kind of a consultation with farm bodies about what to do.  We will be constrained by the parameters in the regulation.  A reduction in the number of animals could be a requirement but there will not be a requirement for a permanent adjustment, in case that is what people are afraid of.  It will be voluntary.</p></speech>

The Commission believes that if it is to provide money to Ireland, there will have to be some kind of supply adjustment.  That is its perspective.</p> <p>  The heading on the regulation will be temporary adjustment aid.  The same happened with milk in 2016, when there was a voluntary reduction scheme for farmers who wanted to reduce the supply.  It is the same kind of initiative.</p></speech>

It should not have been in the food chain.  Separately, and I cannot say very much about this, there is a Garda investigation into allegations involving potentially misidentifying horses and trying to get them into the food chain in circumstances where they should not be in it.

Ireland does not claim those waters but we reject the UK's territorial claim.  The fisheries issue is that if the UK succeeds in its territorial claim, it will establish a 12 mile zone around Rockall where other European member states cannot fish.  I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but I believe I can do so.  We do not accept the UK's territorial claim and, therefore, those waters are European Union waters and access to those waters and the quotas are determined at European Union level in the negotiations that happen every December.</p></speech>

What I can say is that Ireland does not accept the territorial claim and, therefore, from our point of view they are European Union waters.  We have a quota for haddock in those waters.  It is a significant fishery for squid, for which we do not have a quota as it is a non-quota species.  We do not accept the territorial claim and we will continue to reject it.

We received two tranches of money under the exceptional measures provision we are now speaking about for beef.  For the first of these tranches, we sent the money to every dairy farmer in the country.  For the second, we decided we would use it in a better way to leverage loan funding for farmers and there seemed to be a demand in the scheme.  The first of these schemes was &euro;150 million and we put in upfront money to meet first losses and as an interest subsidy.  That was available to farmers.  This particular Brexit scheme came from that idea.  It was a &euro;300 million scheme through the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and us.  It was intended for SMEs as a working capital loan scheme because that seemed to be what was required.  We put in &euro;9 million and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation put in &euro;14 million for first losses and interest subsidies.  We worked with the SBCI and European Investment Bank to create the loan fund of &euro;300 million.</p></speech>

There is a subsidy relating to the scheme that was also intended to keep the cost for farmers down.  It only relates to that scheme, however, it does not relate to the operation of knackeries generally.  They are critically important services because if one lives out at the end of the Beara Peninsula or somewhere like that, it is a long way to the nearest knackery.  It is important, therefore, that they are maintained.</p> <p>  The current subsidy rates for bovines aged over 48 months are &euro;30 for the collection, which is paid to the knackeries, and &euro;78 per animal which is paid to the category 1 rendering operators because these animals will go from the knackery and are then rendered and sent for destruction.  The cost of collection of those animals to the farmer is capped at &euro;54.  If we did not pay the subsidy, that cost to the farmer, notwithstanding the fact that I am sure farmers think it is extraordinarily high, would be significantly higher.

There is a good deal of consultation taking place.  There is serious concern in terms of the derogation and its being rolled out in the future.  I met representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, in Kilkenny earlier in the week in order to discuss that matter.  According to the statistics, only 19% of farmers are availing of this derogation in terms of 130 kg to 250 kg of fertiliser per hectare; 81% are under 130 kg so it does not affect them.  The IFA representatives I met stated that they are doing a two or three-year survey of people who have been getting this derogation and that it has emerged that it has no adverse effect on rivers, water levels, wells, etc.  Why is this derogation under review?  Is it with a view to cutting it back, excluding people from obtaining it or bringing it to an end?</p></speech>

After a week of discussions about the environment and climate change, when we look at Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, reports, generally speaking, they indicate that water quality is not improving.  We have approximately 7,000 derogation farmers who have a special dispensation, so to speak, to operate at higher intensity levels than most others,.  There are additional conditions attaching because high-intensity farming needs to be controlled.  All we are saying is that we want to look again at the derogation against the backdrop of all of the information we have, including whatever comes from the IFA, but that we will rely on our own judgment for determining whether any adjustments are required and will have a public consultation about it.  It is vital that we do this because it is very important that people are sensitised to the need to farm in a sustainable way.  This this is part of that effort.  What we are involved in right now is a public consultation.</p></speech>

The IFA maintains that the water quality in rivers here is cleaner than those in the EU.  Ireland is in the top four or five in that regard.  I do not know whether that is factual.</p></speech>

I am fearful of saying this because I might be wrong but the situation is that our pristine waters are diminishing in quality and our middle-grade waters are improving slightly in quality.  The overall picture, however, is not great in terms of the direction of travel.  We just have to be very careful that we do not throw the baby out with the bath water.  If we are making a pitch for Irish agriculture on an international market based on its environmental sustainability, we have to be sure that we are doing what we are saying we do.  This consultation is part of that effort.</p></speech>

Agriculture has been blamed for 32.3% of emissions.  The Department states that we should increase production with a view to ensuring food safety and producing food of a good quality but how can we marry the two of those if we are told we must reduce emissions?  At the same time, we want solidarity in terms of food availability and the quality of food.  Production in the dairy sector is increasing, which is good for the country in terms of exports etc.  If we cut down on beef production in terms of the scheme Mr. Gleeson is talking about, we will have to import beef from South America or elsewhere.  Where is the saving on carbon footprint in terms of the world market?  We need to have a happy medium in this regard.  All systems have to survive.  Mr. Gleeson stated that smart technology is important but we also have to keep an industry going for the well-being of this country.</p></speech>

There was a difference of opinion between Ireland and the United Kingdom for many years on where the boundary of the exclusive economic zone fell going north west from Donegal for 200 miles.  The continental shelf and jurisdictions are the business of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and an agreement was reached on the seabed boundary in 1988.  In 2013, there was agreement on the boundary in the water above the seabed.  They are the same single maritime boundary.  The drivers in reaching that agreement were concerns about who had responsibility for maritime pollution incidents and who would respond in different areas.  Some issues arose at the time.  There was also the matter of the development of offshore wind facilities and in which jurisdiction they could be located if consented.  The boundary was set but even when there were two different boundaries in terms of the exclusive economic zone, Rockall was always on the UK side of that boundary.  There was never a point where Rockall was not in the UK EEZ.  The fact that a single boundary was agreed in 2013 and that the continental shelf boundary was agreed in 1988 did not change the Rockall issue.</p> <p>  The Rockall issue centres on whether a claim by the UK of sovereignty and its unilateral actions to support that are accepted by the State.  This State, through successive Governments, has never accepted it.  Ireland has never claimed sovereignty of Rockall.  It is a dispute over the UK's creation of sovereignty on that rock and, subsequent to that, the creation of a 12-mile zone that the UK claims for exclusive access around Rockall.  That is not accepted by the State either.  There is detail behind that.  In earlier decades, there was debate as the United Kingdom was seeking to establish a new exclusive economic zone based on Rockall as a starting point, which would have pushed it way out.  The United Kingdom conceded that claim and no longer makes such a claim.  That matter does not arise.  There are other ongoing disputes about the continental shelf involving Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Ireland that are unresolved.  They concern seabed issues.  The 2013 agreement has no relevance to current issues around fisheries rights around Rockall.</p></speech>

It is a trade negotiation with Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.  To an extent, we have relied for some of our arguments on the Commission's own cumulative impact assessment of the damage that would be done to the European beef sector.  That is now several years old.  The impact would of course depend on the details of the deal, if there is to be one.  We already have approximately 220,000 tonnes of product coming in from South America under other TRQs and the question is how much more would come in under such a deal, over how long this would be phased, the rate of tariff and the quota management system.  We have consistently argued that if this is going to be done - we do not want it done - the quota division should arise from the fall of the carcass.  If the TRQ is to be 50,000 tonnes, we do not want 50,000 tonnes of steaks to be sent here; the beef should be broken up in the same way as the carcass is divided.  Those are the kinds of arguments we have made.  The economic analysis has been that the Commission's own cumulative impact assessment-----</p></speech>

Often deals are made in the EU sphere with the benefit of officials, including Irish officials, having done years of work.  When it comes to the Oireachtas trying to react or proactively influencing the process, we are blind.  If we are depending on data prepared elsewhere and looking at a cumulative impact across the Union, although we are less than 1% of that the impact to us on our own may be huge compared with that cumulative position.  I formally and respectfully ask that the Department, with Bord Bia, examine a range of scenarios.  We know a figure of 70,000 tonnes has been mentioned but it could be 100,000 tonnes if recent media reports are to be believed.  It would be useful.  I do not want to stray into the agriculture committee's remit but there would be financial implications.</p> <p>  It does not arise today but within the budget on an annual basis, is there a contingency set aside in case inclement weather leads to a fodder crisis in the autumn and winter months?

We divvy up &euro;16 million a year.  When they get into a hole for &euro;20 million, we buy something from the board for &euro;20 million that is worth &euro;12 million.  This issue has been before the committee previously.  When I asked for the valuation of Bord na gCon on that day, it was also termed "commercially sensitive".  The real story was not that it was commercially sensitive; it was that my back of an envelope valuation was closer to Savills' valuation.  The Valuation Office was retrofitting a valuation to allow Peter to be robbed to pay Paul, but that is an aside.  It is very frustrating when Mr. Gleeson, as manager of the line Department responsible for an organisation to which we divvy up &euro;16 million per year and which has not covered itself in glory in recent times with regard to governance, says that he cannot give the report to the committee because the organisation told the Department it was commercially sensitive.  The Department would never have received that report were it not for the substantial questioning of Deputy Alan Kelly through parliamentary questions.  Now the Department has the report, Mr. Gleeson has read it and he concurs with Bord na gCon.  To paraphrase, I am bound to say they did not want to give the Department anything.  Through the actions of other people such as Deputy Alan Kelly, the Department has the report and is backing up the board by saying, "We cannot let this out".</p></speech>

It could be the case that the conditions were not complied with and it was then difficult to recover the funding.  If the participant remained in a scheme, the money was recovered from his or her next payment.  That was easy enough, but if somebody reaches the end of a five-year contract, it has to be pursued.  We had a significant number of these historical debts and came up with this systematic arrangement to determine whether the debt was recoverable, based on whether it had gone beyond the Statute of Limitations.</p></speech>

It is an appendix to the accounts on the lands the Department owns.  I agree with it.  It is great that a State agency owns land.  It is set out on pages 40 and 41 where the land is in the various counties.  The properties range from 1,000 ha to less than 1 acre.  It is a huge range of properties, with which I am delighted.  I am delighted that we have property options.  How are they managed?  For instance, I know that in Galway security firms tell me that they are not involved in managing them.  Are there management teams?  Are there private companies managing the properties, or is the Department managing them directly?</p></speech>

I think there were no sales included in the 2017 accounts, but if there were, they would have been put out to public tender and we would have carried out evaluations.  As the Deputy can see, most of the properties are small, but if we were to sell any of them, it would be valued.  Incidentally, we have also sent the list to the Land Development Agency.  Therefore, if it was interested in it from a housing perspective, it has the list.</p></speech>

On climate change and the report this week, 35 actions have been recommended for the Department.  I presume Mr. Gleeson is very familiar with the 35 or maybe he has not had time to become familiar with them.  There are 35 specific actions for the Department.  How is the Department fixed in relation to those?</p></speech>

In the context of determining what that target should be, the Government took into account the fact that the forestry and land use sector had already contributed a significant amount of mitigation to the overall national target.  We then had a toolbox established by Teagasc, namely a marginal abatement cost curve, that lists actions that might be taken to abate and sequester carbon.  As such, there are three pillars to the effort.  One is measures to reduce carbon emissions from agriculture.  That will involve things like reducing the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers and improved breeding of animals.  The second pillar is sequestration.  That will involve trying to meet our forestry targets, which is a challenge, planting more trees-----</p></speech>

Sequestration will also involve better management of certain kinds of land.  For example, there could be land on the margins of bogs which might have to be managed less intensively.  There are certain types of mineral soils which may have to be drained.  That will contribute to sequestration.  The third leg of the stool is the contribution agrifood can make on the replacement of fossil fuels with renewables.</p></speech>

We have all had to read the reports over and over.  Every year when Departments have come before the committee, we have asked for this to be done proactively.  My question is where the Department is on that and the 35 actions.  I understand that one of the actions is to bring back a Teagasc report that was not acted on.  Is that right?</p></speech>

It was the identification of measures that could contribute to a reduction in emissions from the sector.  We are doing some of those things already.  A significant portion of our CAP budget is dedicated to environmental and climate change measures.  We have a programme to improve the breed efficiency of animals and improve the environmental sustainability of farmers but we will have to do a great deal more on that.  We have a programme for forestry.</p></speech>

We need to go forward, working together.  I am not about divide and conquer, even with carbon tax.  Climate change is the biggest risk for us.  Over the past two and a half years on this committee, I have not had the sense that Departments are taking it seriously.  It is not just the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I do not have that sense.  It does not appear here as a risk.  Brexit appears as a risk, not climate change, in the Department's financial statements.  Will that change?  Does the Department consider climate change to be a risk?  On the 35 actions, we are limited.  What programme will be rolled out on the 35 actions, when will that be and so on?  We had Teagasc before us at one stage and it stated clearly that the trajectory was going the wrong way.  It said that publicly.  Teagasc is not particularly radical in its statements and I would have thought that one was a cause not only for reflection but serious action.  That did not happen.  We will be monitoring the 35 actions closely.</p></speech>

I will be accountable to another committee.  We are entering a negotiation on a new Common Agricultural Policy and how farmers do those actions will have to be configured.  We will also have to use regulation.  It will be a combination of incentive and regulation to deliver on all of those actions.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Gleeson for the detail on the fisheries harbour.  There was a special report on that by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2014 and it contained seven recommendations.  There was a general reference in Mr. Gleeson's opening statement that some have been dealt with.  Where are we with the seven recommendations?  Serious issues were raised about governance and management.  I have one last question and then I will be finished.</p></speech>

There was one particular matter on page 31, namely extra receipts payable to the Exchequer.  It referred to proceeds of a land sale of &euro;642,000, which was a sizeable sum that I overlooked.

The third speaker is my issue.</p> <p>  I thank the officials for attending this morning.  I want to go back to the assets issue that has been raised several times, including tagging items and putting them on the register.  Up to 2017, when a microscope, bailer or testing kit was purchased with Department money, no one put a sticker with a reference number on the item and entered the information on a spreadsheet.  Is that the way the Department was doing business?  It is a yes-no answer - I am under pressure for time.</p></speech>

We did not have a system that forced people, when they were in the procurement system, to put things on the asset register.  It was flawed.</p></speech>

I am worried about that.  We are number one for efficiency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>greenhouse gas emissions in the dairy sector and number five in the beef sector.  We are improving all of the time in terms of education and Teagasc is doing great work with genomics and so on.  I understand the argument here in terms of climate change, agriculture and the pressures we are under.  However, greenhouse gas is in the air above all of us in Europe.  We are exporting over 90% of our agricultural products and are feeding almost 60 million people in Europe.  We are now looking at feeding people further afield.  Why would it be efficient to reduce beef numbers?  We have to eat.  Would it not be much better to invest the money in breeding, genomics and improving our number five position in Europe to number one or number two?  Obviously if there is a hard Brexit and the beef industry is hit very hard, farmers will need a subvention in order to be able to pay their bills but in terms of the longer-term use of taxpayers' money, it does not seem to make any sense for the Secretary General of the Department to propose a voluntary reduction in beef numbers.  Perhaps I am pulling him up on the wrong point but I would have thought his remit was to promote beef and the efficient production of same.</p></speech>

In the context of agricultural practices feeding into human health and environmental health, would it be a good idea to have an Oireachtas committee that meshes these issues together?  I sit on the health committee but we never discuss the effect of the world of agriculture on the world of human health.  There seems to be a lack of connectivity in that regard.  Issues like water run-off, slurry being spread on land and so on all feed into this.  We had the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in before us recently and we discussed drug residues, both illicit and legal,  in our water table.  It seems strange to me that the Oireachtas does not have a joined-up, whole world approach to this involving the EPA and the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health all working together and feeding through the same information.  There is no point in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine doing great work, gathering data on antibiotics if pharmaceutical and human health interests are not using it.  Does Mr. Gleeson understand my point?</p></speech>

This is a continuum and that has already been recognised by the various agencies that are dealing with human and animal health.  We are working together on AMR and there is definitely a connection to the environment as well.  What the Deputy says makes sense.</p></speech>

I am not aware of it happening but the issue certainly came up a few years ago in the context of the treatment of sewage.  At the time, although my memory of this might be imperfect, we looked at quality assurance schemes and so on but felt that it was not consistent with our objectives under quality assurance.</p></speech>

The committee will return at 2.30 p.m. for a meeting in private session with Mr. Alan Morgan, former valuer with the OPW.</p> <p>  Following on on the matter of farm safety, the annual report states that farms were the largest category of workplace fatalities in Ireland.  There were 24 incidents, of which 14 were people over 65 years.  It was mentioned at a previous meeting - I do not recall if it was with Mr. Gleeson or his predecessor.  While he says it is a matter for the Health and Safety Authority, I make a plea to him, as I did on the last occasion, that someone in the Department take a bit more interest in it.  It might be done through Teagasc or another body.  Now that the economy is picking up, people who might otherwise have been available to work on the farm are gone.  It is grandfathers who are doing all the work now.  I look at my county, and most of the farmers are in their 70s because their sons have gone out to work.  They are trying to do the work and maybe their sons or daughters help out in the evening.  I can envisage this getting worse because more people are working on their own on farms.  Years ago, there would have been two or three people working on a farm, but now it is only one.  People are working alone with big machinery and if something goes wrong with it or an animal does something it is a problem.  I know it is a policy issue but in the interest of people working in rural industry, I ask the Department to take some initiative.  I know Teagasc has done something on it, but more needs to be done.  If there were 24 deaths in the health sector, which is the biggest employer in the country, people would be up in arms, or similarly in the construction sector.  Because the fatalities are so dispersed and are one here or there, it is not as visible.  Mr. Gleeson will get the point I am making.  We need more to be done, and I worry it will get worse.</p></speech>

She is a member of the health committee.  It could take a step back and deal with some of the issues that are in its remit, and bring the issue back to the producer.  The health committee could stretch back to that.  Is the Food Safety Authority of Ireland a separate organisation or is it under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine?</p></speech>

There is an unusual arrangement in Ireland.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is at the top of a pyramid over several other agencies.  For the purposes of food safety, the Department is one of those agencies.  We operate on the level of a service level agreement with the FSAI.  That is something we agree periodically.  It comes down and audits us on the standard set.  We work with the FSAI.  It provides independent scrutiny of what we do but it comes under the remit of the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I am not looking for the service level agreement or anything but just an information note.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two other points.  I was disappointed to see the figure in the accounts for grants to the organic sector.  In 2016 is was &euro;53.566 million and in 2017 it was &euro;45.063 million, a reduction of &euro;8.503 million.  It says the scheme is closed to new applicants and payments are progressing as profile.  Why in this day and age, with climate change and climate action, and health and food safety, would we close down grants to the organic sector?  I am baffled.  Will Mr. Gleeson explain?</p></speech>

People operate for five years.  The figure to which the Chairman referred represents commitments built up over time.  They are reducing because people are leaving the five-year contracts.  I think that explains the reduction.</p></speech>

It says the scheme is closed to new applicants.  The Department is letting the old scheme run out or expire but why are there not new people coming onto it every year?  Surely people want food that is produced organically.  I know it can be more expensive and it may be a niche market but if the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has stopped the scheme to encourage people to produce organic or the grant system will not be renewed, that is something people these days would find to be seriously remiss.  What is the thinking?</p></speech>

There is no doubt about it.  We have travelled to a lot of markets and there is inexhaustible demand for organic produce.  It is important.  One of the difficulties is that we have to get the big processing sectors interested in organic produce, which is not easy.  In the context of the schemes, it is a function of managing a limited budget over a period of time and assessing demand.  In a way, the Chair is asking is a policy question.  The scheme was phased out at that time and reopened in November 2018.</p></speech>

He is going to say the Department is working on it but we know that.  However, I find what is in front of us to be extraordinary.  I am only talking about the office equipment and other machinery, not buildings or anything like that.  There was a cost valuation of &euro;233 million and depreciation of &euro;221 million.  The net value of the assets was &euro;10 million.  That is what the balance sheet shows on page 13.  It shows the Department had additions of &euro;5.5 million in 2017.  The Comptroller and Auditor General informs me there were additions of &euro;3 million in 2016 and &euro;4.7 million in 2015.  Even allowing for depreciation on what was purchased in 2015, 2016 and 2017, they would have a net asset value of &euro;10.6 million.  If those figures mean anything, they are saying that everything prior to that had been at 100% depreciation.  Are those figures based on the time since the foundation of the State?  We would want to be going back 70 years to have purchases of office equipment of &euro;232 million given that the Department is spending &euro;3 million to &euro;5 million a year.  Is that figure inclusive of figures that are 60 or 70 years old?  It seems that way to me.  The Department should forget about trying to update that register if it has stuff going back 70 years.</p></speech>

There will be massive write-offs into the future.  While good progress is being made, we are not there yet in respect of the evidence of that and the cleaning up of the asset register.</p></speech>

This is one of the chapters we are working on for this year.  We have been talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about this.  There are a lot of problems with it.  We need better accounting policies and greater clarity around what is to be in, what is an expectation for write-off and tidying this up.  It is not satisfactory.</p></speech>

A register should ultimately link into the financial statement.  It should be possible to reconcile them.  I would say to the Comptroller and Auditor General that if this is an issue across the board, we may have to take it up with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and we may want to have periodic reports arising from it.  That schedule has no basis in current day reality.  To say the cost of assets is &euro;232 million and there is depreciation of &euro;221 million suggests decades and decades are being included.  It means nothing.  Some of this stuff might be gone after five or ten years.  I would say that very little of that figure could be tracked down in reality.</p></speech>

There would have been assets brought on at that stage.  Presumably, they were all in existence at that point.  However, it has been accumulating for 25 years.</p></speech>

In summary, the change to the articles is to increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases at the IFC.  The Government seeks D&aacute;il approval for this change under Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution as the IFC's Articles of Agreement are an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds.  I will now set out for the committee some background on the IFC and the reasons for this proposed change.</p> <p>  IFC is the part of the World Bank which seeks to promote private sector development in developing countries.  It does so by providing loans, investments and advisory services to companies engaged in projects with development impact.  In April 2018, shareholders of the World Bank agreed on a capital increase for the bank.  The agreed financial package includes a $7.5 billion capital increase for IBRD, the World Bank's main lending arm, and a $5.5 billion capital increase for the IFC.  The capital increase for the IFC is a response to the ambition of the sustainable development goals and the increased levels of finance required.  Simply put, the sustainable development goals will not be met through existing domestic resources or traditional overseas aid.  The annual funding gap is estimated to be $2.5 trillion.  It is, therefore, essential to leverage private sector capital to have a realistic chance of achieving the sustainable development goals.  Standing between policymakers and private finance, IFC is well-positioned to bridge this gap and encourage investment in developing countries.  The proposed capital increase has the potential to double IFC investment to $25 billion by 2030.  Under the agreed package, this increased investment will be targeted toward the world's most disadvantaged countries and to address gender equality and climate change.  The capital package also includes reforms to increase efficiencies at the bank.</p> <p>  The Government is supportive of the capital increase for the bank which is the largest development actor globally with the scale, expertise and experience to deliver transformative development impact.  The deliverables of the capital increase are closely aligned with Ireland's priorities as articulated in our new development policy, A Better World.  Ireland has the option to take up shares in the IFC under the capital increase which would require a total subscription of $12.6 million over five years.  Our subscription to IFC would count toward the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNP for overseas development assistance.  While we are supportive of the overall capital package, at this stage, a final decision on our take-up of shareholding has not been taken by the Minister for Finance.</p> <p>  An essential part of the agreement on the capital package was the proposed amendment to the IFC's Articles of Agreement which we are here today to discuss.  Specifically, this amendment would increase the voting threshold for approval of future capital increases from 80% to 85%.  This change will maintain the veto power of the USA in relation to future capital increases at the IFC.  During negotiations, the USA indicated that while it would not contribute to the capital increase, it would not oppose the increase provided that it did not reduce the USA's voting power below the level at which it could exercise a veto.  This was an essential condition for the final agreement.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposed change requires D&aacute;il approval.  This is in line with Article 29.5.2o of the Constitution which outlines that the State will not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement, including any amendments, have been approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To be clear, the proposed amendment to the IFC's articles does not in itself result in any new immediate charge upon public funds.  However, as the amendment will ultimately create a charge on public funds, the Government is seeking D&aacute;il approval.  A D&aacute;il resolution to approve the proposed change to the IFC's Articles of Agreement will allow Ireland to vote in favour of the amendment.  This will assist in paving the way for the IFC to complete this capital increase and allow it to progress its important mission.</p></speech>

If, however, they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I welcome Dr. Thomas Leahy of Cardiff University and Ms Margaret Urwin from Justice for the Forgotten.

What I will speak about first is how the Irish Government has dealt with conflict legacy.  I also thank all those who contributed to my research, especially victim and survivor groups and their representatives.</p> <p>  I will speak briefly about what the research looks at, which is essentially three key questions.  The first is how effectively the Irish Government has dealt with Northern Ireland conflict legacy.  Second, what more could the Irish Government do to assist dealing with conflict legacy?  Third, how might the Irish Government enhance its efforts in that regard?</p> <p>  When we look at the overall conclusions from my research so far they suggest that the Irish Government has taken steps towards dealing with conflict legacy since 1998, but more needs to be done to meet the needs of victims and survivors.  In the early 2000s there were various reports into legacy cases in Ireland by Mr. Justice Barron and Mr. Justice MacEntee.  In addition, Judge Peter Smithwick's tribunal report was released in 2013.  The Irish Government also supported the Stormont House Agreement's proposed legacy mechanisms in 2014.</p> <p>  Ireland has faced external challenges to progressing specific legacy cases.  These include Brexit, the UK authorities' lack of co-operation at times in specific cases and the collapse of power-sharing in Northern Ireland.  Nevertheless, my recommendations outline how the Irish Government can still take further steps towards dealing with conflict legacy.</p> <p>  Why should the Irish Government deal with conflict legacy?  In terms of dealing with the past, the primary focus so far has been on Northern Ireland because an estimated 3,453 of the 3,720 conflict-related deaths occurred there.  However, the conflict also had a direct impact on the Republic of Ireland.  There were at least 121 conflict-related deaths in this State.  Thirty four people, for example, died following the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in May 1974.  Some 300 others were injured in this attack.  On the recent anniversary of this atrocity in May 2019, the Taoiseach's statement reminded us that the Dublin and Monaghan bombings represent "the highest number of casualties in any single day during the Troubles".</p> <p>  There were other cross-Border attacks by both loyalist and republican paramilitaries into or originating from the Irish State.  Examples include attacks in Belturbet, Castleblayney, Dundalk, Dublin and cross-Border incidents in counties Armagh Derry, Down, Fermanagh and Tyrone.  Some of those incidents are detailed in the written evidence I have provided.</p> <p>  Seven Irish security force members were also killed during the conflict.  In addition, various interviewees for the research highlighted the Irish Government's crucial role in building and sustaining peace.  The evidence shows that the Irish State was directly involved during the conflict and also the peace process.</p> <p>  What are the key priorities for the Irish Government to consider when dealing with conflict legacy?  My recommendations are made with three key priorities that interviewees and others want at the heart of the legacy process.  The first is to assist victims and survivors in their search for justice, truth and closure.  That is the key priority.  The second priority is to ensure public confidence in the Irish Government across these isles.  The third priority is to enhance British and Irish relations by co-operating on conflict legacy.</p> <p>  The recommendations I made come under six themes.  The first theme relates to full engagement with the Stormont House Agreement.  Some of the key recommendations under this theme include that the Irish Government should, first, parallel the historical investigations unit, HIU, in Northern Ireland.  Alternatively, it should create an oversight committee, body or appoint an independent person to help oversee ongoing legacy cases in Ireland.  Another recommendation under the theme is to assist the independent commission for information retrieval, ICIR, by sharing archival documents where required to cross-check information provided.</p><p>There is also the idea of creating an oversight mechanism, individual, committee or academic team, or all of these, to help oversee the national security redaction process of archival documents.  Moreover, there is a suggestion of reappointing a victims commissioner for the Republic of Ireland.  The second theme covers transparency and sustained communication with victims and survivors.  One key recommendation is that the Government should create a citizens' assembly or victims' forum in Ireland to ensure maximum engagement opportunities for and with victims and survivors.  The third theme is about mental and physical health services for victims and survivors.  The Irish and British Governments must ensure that victims and survivors are able to equally access required services across these islands.  The fourth theme is about engagement and co-operation between Irish and British authorities.  The recommendations include trying to increase engagement and co-operation.  This could include committee members or Government officials visiting the UK to raise awareness of legacy cases with interested parties and politicians in the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Westminster Parliament.  Ministers and politicians can raise awareness of legacy cases in the UK media as well.  The fifth theme concerns remembrance.  The suggestion is that the Government should organise and hold an annual remembrance day related to the Troubles alongside the British and Northern Irish authorities.  The sixth theme relates to acknowledgement statements.  The suggestion is that the Government should consider giving acknowledgement statements alongside all sides involved in the conflict.  The key point is that these are not necessarily apologies but an acknowledgment that each side took different approaches during the conflict which negatively affected, or have been perceived as counter-productive to, other groups.</p><p> I will comment on the research methods for this project.  The foregoing recommendations are partly based on interviews conducted with: various victims and survivors groups; Irish and UK politicians, past and present; former Irish and UK security force personnel; former Irish republican and Ulster loyalist activists and prisoners; and academics.  I cross-referenced interviewee responses with others alongside other sources detailed in my report.  I look forward to discussing and reviewing some of these recommendations with the committee in due course.</p><p> Finally, as requested, I will provide some thoughts on the impact of Brexit on citizenship across the island of Ireland.  Professor Niall &Oacute; Dochartaigh, from NUI Galway, and myself have produced a paper entitled Citizenship on the ethnic frontier: nationality, migration and rights in Northern Ireland since 1920.  We looked at the rights of Irish people in England, Scotland and Wales and the rights of UK citizens moving to Ireland from 1920 to date.  There are two central points I wish to mention briefly about how Brexit might impact citizenship on this island.</p><p> The Good Friday Agreement partly helped to end the conflict by recognising the contested nature of British and Irish citizenship in the North.  The peace agreement accepted the right of all people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves as Irish or British or both.  The Agreement states that this right would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland.  It is vital to ensure that dual citizenship in Northern Ireland remains.  Otherwise, Irish people living in the North will feel their voice is ignored and their identity is overlooked.  This point matters because one fact encouraging conflict on this island between 1912 and 1998 was the perception or actual existence of particular national identifies being suppressed.</p><p> The second point is our research found that Irish people moving to England, Scotland or Wales and UK citizens moving to Ireland have received generous citizenship rights.  For example, an Irish person moving to Britain permanently for work does not face restrictions in voting or accessing healthcare.  The key question is whether Irish people living in the UK will still experience the same generosity following Brexit.  I believe that still remains unclear.  I look forward to questions on this topic from the Chair, Deputies and Senators.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate it.  My role is to deal with some of Dr. Leahy's recommendations.  We agree with all of his recommendations as set out in his report.  I will now comment on some of the recommendations in his executive summary.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 1 is that the Government should set up a parallel historical investigations unit to its proposed counterpart in Northern Ireland.  Failing that, he recommends that an oversight committee, body or independent person or persons should be appointed to monitor the progress of State institutions in investigating legacy cases.  Justice for the Forgotten has consistently argued that such a body should be established.  The failure to do so discriminates against families of victims of the conflict in this jurisdiction.  They are prevented from having access to the principal mechanism of the Stormont House Agreement.  All victims of the conflict should be treated equally.  This is particularly important for the families of the victims of the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973 and those of the Belturbet bombing of December 1972 because they have no other avenue available to them.  Complaints on their behalf to the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland were not accepted for investigation.  The remit of the ombudsman extends only to misfeasance by former police officers.  If a complainant does not have enough evidence or information, then the ombudsman will not investigate misfeasance by the British Army or the UDR.  Thus far, our Government has been resistant to setting up this mechanism, although at a meeting with An Taoiseach on 7 February 2019 he promised to examine the issue.  We await the outcome of his examination.</p> <p>  These legacy cases cannot be lumped in with ordinary criminal cases.  The Northern Ireland Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, Judith Thompson, is fully supportive of this approach.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 5 relates to the oral history archive.  This clearly needs to be accessible to potential contributors across Ireland and cannot simply be based in Belfast alone.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 6 concerns the Government holding its own consultation on the Stormont House Agreement.  We believe it should await feedback about its role from the Northern Ireland Office consultation process and thereafter hold meetings with victims' groups and others.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 9 suggests the Government should implement any outstanding recommendations from the Barron, MacEntee and Smithwick reports.  There are certainly outstanding recommendations from the Barron reports that have never been implemented.</p> <p>  In February 2005, the sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights recommended in its final report on the Dublin bombings of December 1972 and January 1973 that aspects of the Garda investigations into the bombings of 1972 and 1973 and other issues in the period 1970-74 should be included in the Commission of Investigation into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings of 1974.  This, however, did not happen.  Another recommendation from that report was that, because of the vast number of files in the Department of Justice that had not been made available to the National Archives, a committee of independent academics should be appointed to advise the Department.  That committee was established but, in correspondence with Professor Mary Daly, who chaired the group, and Professor Eunan O'Halpin, who also served on the committee, we have been informed that it was suspended in 2009.  This was allegedly due to the financial crisis at the time.  It has not resumed its work.  The basis for setting up the group in the first place was to consider the release of files from the Department relating to British and loyalist violence during the 1970s.  At the time the committee was suspended it had reached only as far as the 1940s.  Our understanding is that the failure to release files is in breach of the National Archives Act 1986.</p><p>In March 2006, the sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights recommended in its final report on the murder of Seamus Ludlow that two commissions of investigation with very specific terms of reference should be established into the case.  I cannot think of a family in any legacy case in this jurisdiction that has been treated as badly by the State and the Garda as the Ludlow family.  That was acknowledged during the public hearings.  Apologies were proffered to the family from two former Garda Commissioners, Pat Byrne and Noel Conroy, for the unconscionable failure to follow up a vital lead in the Garda investigation when the names of four suspects were made available to it.  They also apologised for the failure to inform the family of the date of the inquest and for allowing the inquest to proceed in the absence of any family member.  They also received apologies on those two aspects of the case from the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, now Senator Michael McDowell.  Despite the apologies, successive Governments have refused to implement the recommended commissions of investigation, one to deal with the Garda investigation and the suspects and the other to examine the availability and location of documents.</p><p> Recommendation No. 10 is that Dr. Leahy recommends that the Irish Government should consider reappointing a victims' commissioner for the Republic of Ireland.  We believe that would be a very positive move, as it would provide victims with an opportunity to discuss all issues of concern with a dedicated person who would, in turn, be in a position to liaise with the appropriate Departments on their behalf.</p><p> In recommendation No. 14, Dr. Leahy states that private discussions between victims and survivors with members of the Irish State should continue to be organised and facilitated by peace and reconciliation organisations.  We would add human rights organisations to that recommendation.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work of Justice for the Forgotten and Ms Urwin because those issues have been forgotten and only for the group they would not get any attention at this stage.  My first question is more of a philosophical or general one.  Why do the witnesses think this has been a mammoth, uphill battle in order to resolve these issues?  Why has it taken so long and what were the stumbling blocks?  I ask the witnesses to pinpoint what they think in response to that general question.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have an example of international best practice when it comes to legacy issues?  We know that unresolved issues and conflict lead to the next one.  The best example is the Second World War, which came out of unresolved issues following the First World War and the way the peace agreement was drawn up.  The violence in Yugoslavia came out of what happened during the Second World War.  We have had a peace process in South Africa and the peace process in Colombia is ongoing at the moment.  Is there any good example the witnesses could give that would be useful for us to know?  The British Government has ignored three D&aacute;il motions and anything else that has come up, and it has been most unco-operative on this matter.  Can there be a resolution if it continues like that?  Can the other recommendations that do not involve the British Government bring about a full resolution?  If the witnesses had to pinpoint one thing that would kick-start a resurgence in trying to resolve all this, which one would they identify?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.896" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Thomas Leahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019062000002#E00400"><p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan for the questions.  As to why it has been a mammoth, uphill task, there are going to be different reasons for each of the states and actors involved.  In particular, when we look at cases from the 1970s, much of the academic research would suggest that for the Republic of Ireland there was a general fear on the part of the Government at the time that any involvement in dealing with cases would have led to some kind of backlash in the conflict that could potentially seep over the Border such as further paramilitary attacks in this State.  That is not to justify that at all.  That is to say that is the perception I get from looking at the academic research and also some of the files.  In particular, in more recent times I get the impression that it is partly about first steps.  That is a positive thing about the Stormont House Agreement.  Particular victims and survivors groups might not be very happy with the Stormont House Agreement, but from my perspective and talking to different interviewees, it is trying to put things in motion that operate in synch and to give everyone access to at least some form of truth, justice or closure where possible.  I still get the impression at the moment that it is partly about first steps and who is going to take the first step.  What I mean by that is that perhaps there is an element of fear that, let us say, if the Irish Government did go first it would put it in the spotlight and that considerable blame might be put on it for particular events or activities.  That is more of a contemporary thing and that would be echoed in different parties from the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British Government.  I refer to the fear that the blame would be entirely on them.  That has been partly evident in the debate that has been happening in the UK about amnesties for UK forces because there is a fear about that happening.  In a sense, my comment on that, which I have put in the recommendations as well is that in a sense it is not a fear that is grounded in the reality of what the Stormont House Agreement is trying to do, which is for everyone to try to move forward together in tandem with this process.  Difficult truths will come out and there might be things people might not want to know in certain States but everyone is going to have an element of that.  Moving together in tandem does not mean that any one State or particular side is going to have to fear that the portion of blame will be allocated to it.</p> <p>  Going back to the question on the mammoth, uphill struggle, the tension in both Governments, in Ireland and in the UK, was very much about the conflict during the time and anything that was perceived, rightly or wrongly, as potentially leading to further tension or a further upsurge in violence was, to put it bluntly, not looked at, or just bypassed at the time.  I think that comes into play since 1988.  I get the perception that there is an element of fear about who takes the first step due to the fear that the blame could be apportioned to them.  If one moves forward with a process like the Stormont House Agreement, for all its faults, I do not think that will be the case because there will be an overlook of various cases.</p> <p>  In terms of international best practice, there is often reference to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, but the point I would make is that, universally, the victims and survivors groups that I represented do not want a process where at this time a truth commission comes into play because an amnesty is given first so that people will come forward.  We should remember as well that for all the benefits that would have happened from the South African process there would have been victims and survivors who were disappointed that there were not any prosecutions that could have come forward that they might have wanted and they might not have had a universal say in that process.  I do not say that should be ruled out.  Perhaps after the mechanisms of the Stormont House Agreement come into play that would be up to victims and survivors groups and the politicians as well to have a think about whether they want further truth to come out.  It is important to note that in the case of the South Africa process, victims and survivors who should be at the centre of the process did not want that at the time in terms of people getting an amnesty beforehand.</p> <p>  In the case of what we saw in the former Yugoslavia, which led into the international war crimes tribunal and cases, in that respect it was slightly different because there were external actors involved such as the United States of America and also UN forces.  That shows there is a justice element to it and in cases linked to Srebrenica, for example, families at least felt vindicated by some of the truths coming out and that they had the opportunity for justice, and if that could not happen then some truth might come out.  The Stormont House Agreement gives people options.  Victims and survivors can go for a justice option if they want to try to do that.  They can go for a truth option by means of the Independent Commission on Information Retrieval or they can decide not to opt into the process.  Some people have moved on and do not want to do that.  I think that is important.  The Stormont House Agreement could become an example of international best practice because it gives victims a choice about which avenue they want to take.</p> <p>  In terms of the British Government ignoring any requests to co-operate in going forward, that links very much to theme 4 in which I talked about there being an opportunity for a select committee or Members of these Houses, in particular in the current climate with the UK in terms of Brexit, to further raise public awareness there about the conflicts and about unresolved legacy cases.</p><p>That would mean, if not working with a Government party in the UK, working with politicians in different parties, including in the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.  Where UK politics is in flux there are people there who could be in government this time next year.  Establishing contacts with, and raising awareness among, them could help that process as would raising it in the UK media.  I note that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, raised Brexit in <i>The Guardian</i>.  That is an example of how this can be done, using UK media outlets.  On the one hand, Brexit might distract from the conflict legacy process but what I have really noticed, partly from teaching on this topic, among my students but also among the general public in England, Wales and Scotland, is that because of Brexit there is an interest in the Troubles and in affairs and relations between Ireland and the UK.  That is an opportunity to take this up and move forward with it.  I have not put this in the report but the Government here might as it has done in the past, consider bringing some cases to the European Court of Human Rights if the British Government does not co-operate.  That should always be an option.  It would be essential.<br/><br/>Can the Deputy remind me of her fourth question?</p></speech>

This is important, to judge by what I gather from victims and survivors, because it gives them an opportunity to raise any points about or problems they have with the process as it is unfolding at the time with someone who can reach a high level and get feedback.  It is important for all these mechanisms that there is oversight, while they are operating as we try to move forward and build this process, so that at the end people are not saying they were not happy with the way it operated and did not feel they could feed back into it and to the Government.  Many of the oversight mechanisms are very important and that stands out in recommendation No. 1 about the historical investigations unit.  If that is not going to happen in this State there has to be some form of oversight mechanism because it is fundamental for victims and survivors to trust in the process and feel that it is transparent.  That is my view and it arises from the evidence gathering.  It is important for public confidence in that process in this State and across the aisles in the Irish Government, and it is important for the triangular Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and the rest of the UK relationship, that everyone feels oversight was built in and that at the time the maximum was done that could be done.</p></speech>

We have this alternative but would Dr. Leahy have any confidence that this can fulfil the role that is needed, as he has outlined?</p></speech>

There needs to be some form of oversight mechanism or individual while the process continues because if people have points they want to raise about particular cases or how they are being handled they must have a point of contact that can raise these at high Government levels and get a response and a dialogue.  If that does not happen at the time I know from the research and what various interviewees say that there would not be confidence in that process.  It would also ensure that things would not be left in such a way that afterwards people will say the process did not fulfil their expectations.  That would be key.  I would also have a concern, and this has been raised by some victim survivor groups and politicians, that some in the North wanted the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, to oversee the process.  They did however accept that would place a huge burden on the PSNI alongside contemporary policing needs.  I would be concerned in this State too about how the Garda could deal with these often quite complex legacy cases alongside everyday policing matters, given the Garda's contemporary resource needs.  That has to be considered and some of these oversight mechanisms can help with that process.</p></speech>

We do not know yet whether it will be implemented at all.  The consultation process with the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, ended early last October and here we are coming to the end of June and there is no sign of it happening.  As Dr. Leahy said, it is important that everybody moves forward together.  The Stormont House Agreement was signed by all the parties in the North as well as the Irish and British Governments.  If it is implemented it is imperative that we have some form of HIU in this State.  The Minister for Justice and Equality told me in a letter last year that legacy cases here would be lumped in with all other ordinary criminal cases.  That just cannot happen.  If it happens it means that victims in this State are discriminated against.  The Taoiseach did seem to hear what we were saying when we met with him in February and said he would consider the issue.  We have not had any outcome from that yet but we are hopeful that some form of HIU will be established here.  That is the most important point.  The British Government has decided not to comply with the three motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and has felt very comfortable not co-operating and under no pressure to do so.  It is never questioned by the media.  I would like the Irish Government to come out publicly and criticise it for not complying with the motions.  The Stormont House Agreement is essential and should be implemented and the HIU should be implemented here.</p></speech>

There are two relevant cases in my constituency of Newry and Armagh and both happened in Dundalk.  One is the bombing of Kay's Tavern in December 1975, the other, which Ms Urwin mentioned, is the murder of Seamus Ludlow in May 1976.  Both cases highlight the failure of successive southern Governments to deal with the issues.  Seamus Ludlow was murdered in 1976 and by 1979 the RUC was able to pass the names of four suspects to the Garda but nothing was done.  Almost 20 years later those four suspects were arrested and were questioned.  Two of them were serving Ulster Defence Regiment, UDR, soldiers.  They were never interviewed by the Garda, no action was taken.  The day after Mr. Ludlow's funeral a brother-in-law of his, Kevin Donegan, was kidnapped by the British Army and questioned about the Garda findings but nothing was ever done about that.</p> <p>  In Kay's Tavern, where Mr. Rooney and Mr. Watters were killed, it appears that the authorities North and South were aware that there was going to be an incident in Dundalk but nothing was done.  Those two incidents highlight failures where steps could have been taken.  In respect of the Seamus Ludlow murder what would now be termed "fake news" was put about in the form of a smear campaign saying republicans had been involved in his murder which was not the case.  When questioned by the RUC two of the suspects admitted that they were present when Mr. Ludlow was murdered but did not take part.  They were never charged.  I raise these issues because they happened in Dundalk where I spent much of my youth socialising as it is probably the nearest town in the South.</p><p>It is just to highlight the ongoing problems.  The Ludlow family have taken a case and it is going to the Court of Appeal, probably next year.  It has taken a long time, particularly when one considers that the events we are discussing date back to 1976.  Ms Urwin highlighted the lack of respect and the lack of truth for families.  The Ludlow family are a particular example of how people have been so badly treated.</p></speech>

The Ludlow family have taken a case here regarding commissions of investigation, which they lost and are appealing.  I appeal to this committee to get these commissions set up, as was recommended by the sub-committee of the joint Oireachtas committee in 2006.  That should happen.  I know the family is also taking a case in the North in respect of a decision made by the DPP in the past.</p> <p>  At least we have an investigation into the Dundalk bombing because it has been accepted by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland as part of Operation Newham, which involves all of the linked Glenanne cases, North and South.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings are also included in that, as is the murder of John Francis Green and the Castleblaney bombing.  They are all linked to that and are all being investigated by the Police Ombudsman.  However, the other cases - the Ludlow case, the Dublin bombings of and 1972 and 1973 and also the Belturbet bombing - were not accepted.  As I explained, this arises if there is not enough information on malfeasance by the RUC as the Police Ombudsman's remit does not extend to looking at the UDR or the British Army unless it is part of what he is looking at in the context of the police.  At least the Dundalk bombing is being investigated.</p></speech>

A second inquest has been held since but it seems an appalling state of affairs that they were not informed and that it actually went ahead on the day.  The two Garda Commissioners and Senator McDowell, the former Minister, apologised for that at the time.  However, it is amazing the recommendations of the committee in regard to that case were not followed up, at least to give some consolation to the family.</p></speech>

It contains a number of recommendations that I would like to discuss.  I particularly commend Ms Urwin, who has attended the committee previously.  We cannot but be inspired every time she comes into the committee due to the way she takes on the case for justice and truth.  Mr. Brady touched earlier on some of the failures on the side of the Irish Government.  Our own party colleague, Eddie Fullerton, was murdered in 1991 and the family are still seeking truth and justice in that case as well.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 6 of the report refers to the consultation process.  There are thousands of consultees to that process but it seems the Northern Ireland Office has not got the answers it wanted, so it is stalling the process before opening it up again for further consultation.  Part of the recommendation is that the Irish Government should hold its own consultation but it then goes on to say, as Ms Urwin noted, that it might be necessary to hold off to see what the responses are.  I do not know when those responses will arrive and we could be waiting another ten years for some of the responses to come forward from that consultation.  Would it not be beneficial for the Government to initiate that in order to try to put pressure on the British Government, and certainly the Northern Ireland Office, to start to produce the results of that consultation process?  That is one question.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 7 states that there should not be an amnesty.  I totally agree.  For example, there is the soldier F scenario which has run right through the North of Ireland at this time.  In my constituency, the Ballymurphy families are currently going through their court cases with regard to what happened to their loved ones.  Yet, when some of those family members are going to the court on a near-daily basis, they have to drive past banners and posters about soldier F.  It is very hurtful to those families, who have to go and listen to some of the soldiers who were involved in that atrocity in the early 1970s.  It is very hurtful that some ex-members of the British forces and even some Members of the British Parliament are enmeshed in the amnesty issue.  It is very damaging to the families who are suffering this on a daily basis that they have to drive past those banners.  Some of those banners may be illegal, and I dare say most are illegal, given that there is a need for planning permission to put up banners and nobody has been seeking planning permission for them.  Yet, the PSNI is standing with the hooded men who are putting up some of these banners, which is very hurtful.  I believe the recommendation on amnesties is correct.  People have suffered too long.  They are seeking justice but that is not happening quickly enough, while others are causing hurt to those families by putting up these banners and posters.  It can be very hurtful.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 16 states that mental and physical health should be supported.  Has that been forthcoming?  Has the right treatment been given, whether for physical health or, probably more importantly given the length of time it has taken, for the psychological treatment that some of these people rightly deserve?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.910" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Thomas Leahy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2019062000002#G00600"><p>I thank members for the points and questions raised.  Ms Urwin raised a good point on the consultation process.  I would be aware, and the evidence I have submitted shows, that there are a number of groups and organisations that have sent across papers in response to the consultation by the British Government and Northern Ireland Office, and these papers have made various points about the Irish Government's role in this process.  I can definitely see Ms Urwin's point that there would be no point repeating the process again if it just gets fed back.  Those discussions could start between the Irish Government and victims and survivors groups and others who are interested in raising this point.  It is definitely a good point.  If this is just delayed constantly and there is no result from it, then I do not see why the Irish Government would not be able to initiate its own process, and have discussions with victims and survivors groups and others who are interested.  Rather than having to repeat work, organisations could submit what they submitted to the UK consultation and then draw up points about the Irish Government's role.  I believe that would be beneficial.</p> <p>  That touches on a key point from this research, which is that the Irish Government can take a lead on this process.  I recognise that this might lead to some uncomfortable things coming out but I believe it would be respected by people across Northern Ireland, the UK, Europe and the world that it has taken a lead on this process.  This would show that the Government is attempting to build public confidence in the State and that it is willing to recognise errors it has made in the past and things that have happened, and willing to try to introduce reforms, putting victims and survivors at the centre, and, at least in its own way, trying to move forward with co-operation between these islands.  That would be a key point and is something the Government could initiate itself.  I do not see any reason it could not do that.  This does not have to be written at a particular time and it could be done online, and there are various ways of doing the process.  It is definitely a good point.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on amnesties, what is interesting is that I did not speak to one victims or survivors group which thinks amnesty is a good idea.  This is vital from a victims and survivors point of view.  As we said, despite some of the faults that could be pointed out with regard to the Stormont House Agreement, it finally gives victims and survivors, who have often been completely disempowered during the conflict and into the peace process years, a sense that they have an opportunity to decide which route they want to take.  They have a choice to go down the justice route in order to get some truth and acknowledgement of what has happened, or perhaps they just want to leave this and move on.  That is the important thing the Stormont House Agreement does.  If one side passes an amnesty, that immediately means victims and survivors are no longer in a position where they are, in a sense, able to direct what is happening in that process.  It would disempower them, even to the extent that it could re-traumatise people.</p> <p>  There is also a point about public confidence in the state in regard to amnesties, whether this State or the UK.  It would not just affect Troubles-related cases and it could be things that have happened with regard to the police force or the Army in other cases and other scenarios.  It is not good that organisations that are supposed to abide by the rule of law can have amnesties in place.</p><p>That would set a precedent.  As I drew attention to in my evidence, former British soldiers recognise this.  Sometimes in the UK media it appears that the British army in its entirety backs an amnesty, but that is not the case.  A number of people in the British army have said that it is not good.  The British army is supposed to uphold law and order, which it said it was doing in Northern Ireland, and therefore if people have gone over or against regulations, they have to be held to account.<br/><br/>If amnesties are passed out for some groups and not others, we will end up with a group of second-class victims and survivors and a hierarchy of perpetrators.  That is not what this process is supposed to be about.  That is key.  It is important for public confidence and for relationships between different jurisdictions on these isles that there is a process for victims and survivors to hold people to account if they wish to do so, or to at least find out the truth.<br/><br/>Mental and physical health facilities were mentioned.  In 1999, the original Victims' Commissioner in this State, John Wilson, brought up this point in his report, <i>A</i><i>Place</i><i>and a Name</i>, which looked at ways of moving forward in dealing with conflict legacy.  He said that the mental and physical health facilities available to victims and survivors had to be improved and, if possible, integrated across the isles for accessibility.  Judith Thompson, the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors in the North, gave evidence here a couple of months ago, and it was interesting that she made the point that people still do not have access to those facilities or find them difficult to access.  It is alarming that, 20 years down the line, that is the case.  That is fundamental.<br/><br/>The whole process is about enabling people to get closure, truth and justice but, alongside that, the day-to-day well-being of people is at stake.  Governments in the UK and in this jurisdiction have a responsibility to ensure that citizens have access to those facilities and that joined-up processes are in place.  I very much support that the provision of mental and physical health services should be a priority for both Governments.</p></speech>

The elephant in the room is the British Government.  Without it, can that resolution come about?  We know what has to happen down here, where we need something similar to address the issues, and those of us in the Parliament will keep pursuing that.</p> <p>   Another point was brought home to me recently by the various contenders in the election for the British Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister.  They have shown absolute ignorance of and a lack of interest in Ireland and Irish history; they just do not know.  I also think that they do not know what is in the Good Friday Agreement either, and my fear is that legacy will go further down the line of priorities.  I wonder whether Dr. Leahy could comment on that.</p></speech>

Will we reach resolution through the Stormont House Agreement without the involvement of the British Government?  The simple answer is "No".  However, for some of the cases mentioned in recommendation 9 and issues that have come out of the Barron report, the McEntee report and the Smithwick Tribunal, the Government in this State can at least hold its head up and say that it has done as much as it can in fulfilling the obligations asked of it and moving the process forward.  Importantly, that indirectly puts pressure on the British Government to acknowledge that some cases are not being resolved because it is not fully co-operating.</p> <p>  For this Government, there is the interest of public confidence in the State.  If reforms, lessons and ideas are needed for the future, it is important right now for citizens in this State that they are implemented.  Examples of that are some of the processes from the Barron report, which could be implemented without a thumbs up or thumbs down from the British Government.  It is a public confidence issue.</p> <p>  If the British Government do not co-operate, it might not help UK and Irish relations at Government level, but the Irish Government must do the maximum that it can to help cross-Border communities.  It might want to look at particular cases and release archival files to build trust with some of the Border Protestant and unionist communities.  There is still opportunity for the Irish Government to move forward if the British Government does not co-operate, and to interact with people across these isles to show that it is trying its best to move things forward.  It is in its gift to do so.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan made a point about ignorance, and that is clear from the UK media.  However, this is where theme 4 and the recommendations are important.  There is an appetite among people of all age groups in Wales, England and Scotland to know about what happened in the conflict.  These issues can be raised in the UK media or with politicians and parties who are more engaged, of which there are many in Scotland, Wales and England.  At some point, the UK Government will change.  UK politics is in flux and to have contact with those who are raising these issues is very important in trying to put them to the forefront of the agenda. It is also important to raise public awareness in the UK.  One example of this is the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I know from teaching students that if there is an idea of what happened in the conflict, the stand-out attack is the Omagh bombing.  There is no awareness that the greatest number of people to die on one day was in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  It is important to try to give a nuanced perspective of what has happened across these isles.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan talked about public confidence.  On the one hand, the slightly depressing answer is that the British Government might not co-operate.  However, there are ways of engaging with the UK public.  At the moment, there is real interest in Irish affairs and relations between these isles because of Brexit.  It might appear to be a difficulty, but I think that Brexit is an opportunity.  The UK public and media are asking why the backstop is relevant and what the conflict was about.  There is an opportunity to feed into that and explain about the legacy process.</p></speech>

We have tended not to do that and have looked more at the economic aspects and cross-Border co-operation, and legacy issues have been down the priority list.  The committee should have that in mind when we meet those delegations.  Dr. Leahy made a very interesting point about other politicians.  It was hoped that there would be a debate on this in the House of Commons but other issues have taken over in the meantime.  However, such a debate is needed.</p></speech>

Very good assistance is given for those with physical difficulties; for example, hearing aids, prosthetic limbs and so on.  The Victims of Crime Office within the Department of Justice and Equality is very good on that, and I want to stress that that is very much appreciated.  Unfortunately, there is huge reluctance when it comes to mental health services and simply asking for some counselling.  Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe, Deputy Smith and others have raised this issue with successive Ministers for Justice, including Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, but they are very resistant to providing any type of counselling.  Thankfully, WAVE has now appointed a counsellor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, and any of our people who want to access counselling can go to him, if agreed by WAVE.  We have had to rely on Belfast for that, because the Government here simply refused.  It is not as though there is a whole crowd of people looking for counselling; the numbers are very small.</p> <p>  Dr. Leahy said that young people in Britain are not aware of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings but are aware of the Omagh bombing.  They are not the only ones; it is the very same here.  In at least one history text book for the Junior Cert, the child of our youngest survivor found to her horror that there was no mention of it and that the conflict did not happen here at all; it stopped at the Border.</p><p>The Dublin and Monaghan bombings are not mentioned.  It mentions May 1974 and important dates, but what does it cover in May 1974?  It is the Ulster Workers Council strike.  There is no mention of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, what happened in Dundalk or any of the other attacks.  The only reference is to the total number killed, which is not correct anyway.  We have raised that with the Minister for Education and Skills, but everybody claims somebody else has responsibility and it is a committee or something that decides what should be included in history textbooks.  We were quite horrified at that.</p></speech>

My party colleagues in Westminster and I have met three or four British MPs, all former members of the British army, who are trying to introduce a motion about an amnesty.  They had no knowledge of specific incidents, particularly two children in my constituency, Kevin Heatley and Majella O'Hare, who were murdered by British army soldiers.  They were not concerned.  They obviously had done no research.  It was simply that they wanted an amnesty and that was it.  This reinforces what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is saying.  I have found an appalling ignorance and lack of knowledge in Westminster about any political situation, not just in the North, but in Ireland as a whole.</p></speech>

I refer to the Kay's Tavern and Seamus Ludlow cases.  Ms Urwin spoke about how to implement some of the recommendations on how to move these cases forward.  It is really about drawing out the public interest here.  There are various suggestions about how certain state authorities operate.  That matters to the public because it matters today about how the police operates and they can carry ideas or lessons forward from the past.  These things should be considered and implemented.  It is not something that would not be in the public interest; it is in the public interest for that reason.</p> <p>  Mr. Brady spoke about republicans being blamed for the Seamus Ludlow incident.  My recommendation 8 under theme 1 relates to the implementation and reconciliation group.  It is interesting that this has come up from various victims' and survivors' groups, politicians and others who have engaged with this research.  I will not prejudge the implementation and reconciliation group because that will come out of the Historical Investigations Unit, the Independent Commission for Information Retrieval etc.  The academic panel would then be asked to look into themes about the conflict.</p> <p>  From the response I have had to this and looking at some of the responses to the Stormont House Agreement that have been put in by various organisations, it would be important to look at the role of the Irish Government in the conflict and peace process.  Various academics I have interviewed for my research have said that.  There would be various themes under that, such as the Irish Government's dealings with cross-Border loyalist attacks, cross-Border republican attacks and also the dealings with the British Government, British intelligence etc.</p> <p>  It should also include how this State responded at the time with things like the broadcasting ban, the Offences against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court.  I do not necessarily mean to criticise these, but it could be useful to analyse if similar mechanisms could be implemented if such a situation arose in the future.  I am aware, for example, the Special Criminal Court still exists but we should examine how it operated.  Was it effective in keeping public opinion onside about how the Irish Government was dealing with the situation?</p> <p>  This is an important conversation for the Irish Government to have in order to move forward.  That analysis should include things that worked well, including the Irish Government's role in the peace process, which is seen positively from most groups.  That should be used to learn lessons and find ideas for the future.  It would be particularly useful for the IRG to look at some of the themes arising about how the Irish Government interacted with particular groups during the conflict.</p> <p>  Mr. Maskey spoke about the amnesty proposal and a lack of knowledge about particular cases.  I think engagement from this committee and politicians from this State with the UK public is really important because there is an appetite for it.  This is slightly anecdotal, but in my university the course related to the conflict is oversubscribed, which now, 21 years on, one might not expect.  There is a real interest in what happened and a yearning for a nuance about that debate and not just things one might hear in certain sections of the media.  That is really important because they can raise public awareness across these isles about these cases.  That will start to introduce people to different thinking and different sides of the debate.  That can end up putting pressure on governments to react and to look into particular cases.  In one respect there is a ray of light on the ignorance point in that there are ways forward with that engagement with the public.</p></speech>

In that respect one could talk about overall policy and how they saw that linking into events on the ground.  Particular incidents sometimes got mentioned although the research did not necessarily look at that because I was aware there might be restrictions on what particular officials, past and present, might be able to talk about.  It was important to get the sense.</p> <p>  I will give an example from the work I did about intelligence conflict there - how to understand how particular incidents can occur and there might not have been oversight in place because there might be big policies that said the aim is to fulfil X, but the government would not always keep tabs on that in terms that that is the policy and how people want to implement that generally is up to them; in terms of where that might lead particularly in some of the cases with things such as collusion, there is an understanding of the structure and culture that might have been created around that.  Yes, I would have spoken to them.</p> <p>  I am also carrying forward this research about how the Irish Government deals with conflict legacy.  We will be looking to speak further to former representatives of the State, past and present, and also particularly former British security forces members.  There is more nuance when we are talking about things like amnesties than it would seem when one actually talks to people.  There is a lot more division within even the British army, past and present, about whether that is a good or a bad thing.</p></speech>

We have done that consistently through the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Some members of this committee are also members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which comprises Members from the Oireachtas, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the British Parliament, and the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies. I met Karen Bradley twice to discuss the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I also met Mr. Brokenshire twice or three times.  I raised specific questions during Question Time at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly on the scandalous way the British Government has consistently ignored the three requests of a sovereign Parliament.  As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said earlier, this House has passed motions unanimously in 2008, 2011 and 2016.  The British Government has ignored those requests.</p> <p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, Deputy Crowe and I also met the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, to discuss the issue.  We have constantly kept the issue on the agenda.  We will also raise it with our counterparts in the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies and again in Westminster.  The people have been treated in an appalling way with the request of a sovereign Parliament being ignored.  Those were very considered and reasoned motions.  A lot of thought went into them so that in 2008, 2011 and 2016 everybody could agree to them.  They encompassed the work of Ms Urwin's group, Justice for the Forgotten, and the families with whom we liaise constantly.</p><p>One ingredient might be missing.  The presentations by Dr. Thomas Leahy and Ms Margaret Urwin were excellent.  It is very good for the work of the committee.  People are getting older and when I speak to Mr. Anthony O'Reilly, whose sister Geraldine was killed in Belturbet or the families of the victims of the Monaghan bombings or other such happenings, such as my friend, Mr. Kevin Ludlow, who is brother of the late Seamus Ludlow, they mention that they are all getting older and there is no sign of any justice being served or that they are getting the truth.  It was always urgent that we would have a proper investigation and that the truth would be told but it is getting more urgent as every day passes.  Memories do not improve either.  People are getting older.  Their health does not improve and again so many of them will talk to us about their utter frustration that nobody is listening.  </p><p> As a committee regardless of politics, people of all parties and none, we re-emphasise every opportunity we get the need to deal with the legacy issues in a proper way and it is more urgent now than ever.  </p><p> The presentations were exceptionally good and this is a process that we have in this committee of revisiting the legacy issues and having presentation by different individuals and groups.  We keep working on this because it is so important.  Let us think of May 1974, the day of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  There were many dark days in Ireland inflicted by paramilitaries from both sides and by some State forces as well.  The British Government continues to ignore the request of our Parliament.  That is unacceptable. </p><p> I thank Dr. Thomas Leahy and Ms Margaret Urwin for their presentations.  I am sure we will have an opportunity in the future to engage with them.  </p><p>I welcome Ms Monica Duffy-Campbell, Mr. Pat Fay and the visitors in the Public Gallery.</p><p> Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, Sean Crowe and I engage constantly as a group in this House with the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and we are all conscious of the families of other victims in other incidents such as Castleblayney, and Dundalk, where Mr. Seamus Ludlow was found dead.  Ms Geraldine O'Reilly and Mr. Paddy Stanley were the victims of a bombing in Belturbet in December 1972.  When we discuss legacy issues, all the families of those victims are remembered and we recall all of the victims in our deliberations.</p></speech>

When I was elected, I promised the people in my constituency that I would try to address their needs in the Oireachtas.  The issue of depopulation in the north west is a long-term and insidious blight on my county of Leitrim and other parts of the region.  There are many reasons for this.  We need jobs, infrastructure and transport, but we also need to fight to hold onto what we have.  This Bill is designed to tackle the situation of young families who want to stay in rural Ireland not being able to get planning permission to build homes there.  The problem lies in the nature of the soil in parts of the region and in parts of the south west and other parts of the country.  It is particularly bad in Leitrim and west Cavan where the soil is very dense.  In these areas, the current code of practice of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has virtually halted construction of one-off dwelling houses in areas of heavy soil.  The nature of the soil is such that the standard T-test, the percolation test, will not be passed.  According to the EPA code of practice, there must be zero discharge of effluent, regardless of the efficiency of the wastewater treatment systems.  The achievement of zero discharge is impossible in these areas and, particularly, in the Irish climate but it is possible in this day and age to install a system which will mean that the wastewater produced will be bathing water standard.</p><p>This amendment to the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 will allow the Minister to design and regulate a discharge licence which would be issued by local authorities for one-off houses where the percolation test fails.  The Government has acknowledged that rural Ireland needs rehabilitation after years of neglect and austerity.  In my own area, I can instance dozens of young families who, for the refusal of planning permission, have not been able to settle in their home place where they wanted to live for the rest of their lives.  If discharge licences of this nature are granted in an appropriate and proportionate way, there is no danger to the environment from this amendment.  I truly believe that this is a good move for rural Ireland and I propose this amendment in that spirit. </p><p>Refusal of planning permissions has been a problem in Leitrim for many years, including prior to the introduction of the EPA code of practice.  The council has tried to develop alternative guidelines.  Over the past 20 years, in almost all places where planning permission was sought mechanical treatment systems had to be used.  Usually, they had to go to a percolation area where there was imported top soil or to a raised percolation.  The council was trying to address this problem long before the stringent code of practice came into effect.</p><p>A lot of people in rural areas are conscious of the mindset that houses in clusters are good and one-off houses are bad - once described to me as the <i>Animal Farm</i>type mindset that all two legs are bad and all four legs are good.  That kind of mindset does not recognise the reality of the world we live in.  It is a closed mindset that we need to open up.  There are hundreds of parishes around the country where there are no towns and people living in isolated rural communities.  In my own parish of Aughavas in County Leitrim there are 600 people living in houses scattered around the countryside.  There is no town or village but there is a small three-teacher school.  For the past ten years, practically no new houses have been built in the community.  There are at least a dozen young people who would like to live in the area but they cannot get planning permission to build.  The aforementioned school will become a two-teacher school next September and will, probably, close within the next ten years.  The situation is similar in all the small rural areas in County Leitrim, including Drumreilly and Gortletteragh.  The response is often that those who want to live in these areas should live in the town.  The nearest town is seven or eight miles away.  People are living in rural communities because it is where they want to live.  In terms of where I live, on leaving the main road, my house is the first house on the left-hand side of the L1511.  There are 2 km between my house and the main road.  There are a couple of hundred metres between my house and the next house.  This is not about wanting to have houses close to each other, cluster developments, ribbon developments or over-development.  Where that is proposed, appropriate planning is necessary.  </p><p>In regard to the EPA guidelines, where problems arose in the past with heavy soils, Leitrim County Council and other councils developed other means of addressing them.  I have come across many situations in west Cavan and Leitrim where people got planning permission having put in place reed bed systems to deal with the effluent, which was a natural way of addressing the problem.  Willow beds can also be used.  Willow trees are planted and as the sewage comes through from the septic tank the evaporation from the willows soaks up and deals with all of the nutrients.  This is a very effective way of dealing with the problem.  Mechanical treatment systems have been used in many cases.  Most of them do an excellent job as well.</p><p>At the time the EPA guidelines came into effect I was on Leitrim County Council.  The general view was that they would lead to practically nobody in the rural areas getting planning permission.  I think it was former Senator Paschal Mooney who organised a trip of representatives of the council to Leinster House for a meeting with representatives of the EPA and the Department who told us that what happened was an unintended consequence, that they had not foreseen that this would happen and that they would try to find a solution.  Since then, Leitrim County Council and other councils around the country and the EPA have undertaken studies on how to achieve zero discharge.  One of those studies is research No. 161 by Laurence Gill, which outlines the examination process in regard to the systems.  I have a copy of the main findings of the study, which I can provide to members after this meeting, but I would like to go through a couple of them now.  The study examined the evapotranspiration, ET, system.</p><p>In such systems, when a septic tank is installed, the percolation area becomes a shallow bed.  A large area in the garden is dug out, an impermeable plastic layer is inserted and the hole is refilled with soil.  The willows are planted and given a year to start to grow before the effluent is added to the bottom of the system.  The system works very well.  In the research paper's conclusions, it is shown that the system of using willow trees is unlikely to act as a zero-discharge system.  The problem is the zero discharge, but why?  The requirement for zero discharge was put in place to achieve zero effect.  We want zero effect that has no impact on the environment.  As is stated in the conclusion of the report, the evapotranspiration or ET system promotes excellent pollutant attenuation, significantly reduces the net discharge to the environment and, therefore, should be considered a viable passive treatment.  The conclusion also states it would require a change to the current consent procedures to allow for such a controlled discharge to surface water.  The conclusion of  the EPA's report states the willow ET system produces an effluent of similar quality to the effluent from a system with no sewage discharge entering it.  The EPA found the system had zero effect.  If that is the case, we need to examine why we have a zero-discharge rule.<br/><br/>It was in that context I presented the Bill.  In fairness, Leitrim County Council has since done more work on the ET system and continues to do so.  It has a pilot scheme in place to try to minimise the rainfall entering the system.  It found that it could achieve zero discharge for most of the year except in winter, when there was heavy rainfall, although it was mostly rain escaping rather than any pollutant effluent.  The council is considering building willow beds and sloping it off in order that as little rain as possible can enter, to try to achieve zero discharge.  My argument, which I consider logical, is that if there is zero effect, it will have the same impact as zero discharge.  If one takes water from the river, puts it in a 40-gallon barrel, keeps it until night-time and returns the water to the river, it will have a zero effect on the river, which is exactly what the Bill provides for.  There will be a zero effect.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that the Department has raised some issues with the Bill, which I examined.  One such issue is that it appears that the local authority must issue a licence under section 4.  I cannot find the word &quot;must&quot; anywhere in the Bill.  Rather, it states, &quot;Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing nothing in this section shall prevent a water services authority from granting a waste water discharge licence [...]&quot;  That there is nothing to prevent a water services authority from granting a licence does not mean that it must.  Similarly, the Bill provides that the Minister &quot;shall&quot; introduce regulations to provide for the application for a wastewater treatment licence.  He shall introduce regulations to do it but will not insist that it must happen.  It will happen only when a person or agent applies for a licence and meets the standards required.<br/><br/>The Bill further states: &quot;The Minister may introduce such regulations as are necessary, incidental, supplementary or consequential for the purposes of giving effect to this section.&quot;  This new section - section 13 - will do nothing to affect any of the other sections in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1997, and <i>vice versa</i>.  The present system of issuing a discharge licence is in place specifically for cases where there is a large number of houses or an industrial-type unit, which is fine.  Provision needs to be made, however, for a different type of licence for single houses where a system is in place that will ensure zero effect and allow for minimal discharge.  That is what we want to achieve.  Others, such as the EPA and many of the local authorities, are working in a similar vein to try to do so but the sole obstacle in the way is the issue of zero discharge.<br/><br/>If we wanted, we could try to change the code of practice but doing so is difficult, which I understand because an application has been lodged with the European Commission.  The code of practice states that if a house fails to pass the T-test, it must have zero discharge or a discharge licence.  My Bill will put in effect a means of granting a small discharge licence to deal with that in an appropriate way where all other planning requirements are already met, and assessing how a zero impact on the environment can be achieved, such as with the type of ET system developed by the local authorities in co-operation with the EPA.  <br/><br/>I welcome any questions.</p></speech>

While County Leitrim was mentioned, other areas in counties Sligo and Cavan and elsewhere are dying, not least in the form of schools and football clubs, as Deputy Martin Kenny noted.  Rural people from certain areas cannot obtain planning permission because of the current situation.  We should most sincerely try to bring in a system where people can be allowed to live in their own areas.  In farming communities, when young farmers take over family farms and so on, they cannot build on their own land.  Deputy Martin Kenny's proposal is reasonable.  It will allow a local authority to issue a discharge licence provided there is no pollutant in the discharge.  I accept that the matter has persisted for some time and it is a big issue in many places.  We should try to do whatever we can to facilitate the families affected.  Not everybody can live in a town or village; some people must live on the land they farm and it is not viable to move away.  We are trying to keep local rural areas alive.</p> <p>  I compliment Deputy Martin Kenny on his Bill, which we will support.</p></speech>

As someone who lives in a rural community, it is clear he knows and understands the issue.  As Deputy Scanlon said, we must encourage and support people who wish to live in rural communities outside the cities and towns, but in a sustainable and environmentally healthy and responsible way.  It is becoming an issue and Deputy Martin Kenny made a strong argument.</p> <p>  I worked with the school of botany at Trinity College Dublin, TCD, and, therefore, I am very familiar with its work on biomass in respect of willows and Salix.  It is carrying out research on the matter and there is an ongoing body of work on the use of willows and the scheme in question.  Deputy Martin Kenny may know something about that and, if so, he might share it with the committee.</p></speech>

I am not familiar with the ins and outs of the school's work, apart from being aware that it was doing something related to the matter.  The partnership is doubtless good and I have a sense that Leitrim County Council is proactively engaging with TCD.  Will Deputy Martin Kenny comment on that?</p></speech>

One of its objectives was to achieve a zero discharge.  That was its logic.  It found that, as of yet, it was virtually impossible to achieve a zero discharge, mainly because of rainfall rather than effluent entering it.  In a standard house, less than 1,000 l of wastewater enters the system every day.  TCD found that does not have an impact and was being addressed.  The addition of rainfall, however, caused the problem.</p><p>The research paper states that the system was acting as excellent pollutant containment even if it could not fully achieve a zero discharge system on an annual basis.  It cannot operate at a level of zero discharge but it can achieve a zero impact.  That is the point I am making.  The amount of water leaving was equal to the amount of water coming from a system that had not been fed any effluent.  If the testers took samples from the run-off from the concrete yard at the back of the house and from the effluent that went through the evapotranspiration system, they were equal.  There was an equal loading of phosphates and they were well within any standard.  I know of an evapotranspiration system in a house outside Mohill near Loch Rynn Castle Estate.  I know the old man there well.  He said now and again the testers come and take tests.  He got them to call him back.  He said the man who called him back after carrying out the tests told him that the water was similar to bathing water standard.</p><p> The zero effect is what we need to achieve.  All of us want that.  No one wants to pollute or destroy our environment.  We understand that the water in our rivers and lakes often ends up in our taps because it goes back through the system.  We want to ensure that we have a zero effect.  The natural systems involving the growth of willow or reed beds are best in dealing with these situations.  This is the key question.  Are we able to do it right every time?  Are we able to ensure that we can come up with a system that will work at every site correctly?  Can that be monitored and checked?  Is it affordable?  That research is now being done, but when the research is done we come back to the problem at the end of it.  In fairness, the Environmental Protection Agency said at the time that unintended consequences can arise and that zero discharge blocks even that.</p><p> Let us suppose we had a system that produced potable water, and it was only letting out 1 litre per day.  Given the rigidity of the system we have at the moment, we are not allowed to discharge that water.  That is a ridiculous situation in any context.  Really, we need to work with the EPA, Trinity College, Laurence Gill and the others who have done this research to ensure we can come up with a system.  Everyone involved in the process to date is confident that a system can be found that would have zero impact but it will not have zero discharge.  It will have a certain level of discharge mainly due to rainfall.  Once we achieve that, we come back to the problem of the zero discharge rule.  The way to get over the zero discharge rule is to put a small licence in place that a local authority can issue.  That is how to solve the problem.  That is what the Bill intends to do.  Of course, if people in the Department have particular issues that they would like to see resolved, I am open to hearing about it.  Sensible amendments can come from anywhere.  We are not all geniuses in this situation.  We all know that there may be unintended consequences somewhere that we do not see but we can find a way to overcome all of those.  That is what we need to work on.</p></speech>

I will make some comments.  I come from a rural area myself.  Having dealt with one-off rural housing for the past 15 years I know that it is probably one of the most frustrating processes any family can go through.  Not only do they have to deal with qualification rulings, location details and the visual impact that a house might have on the area, they also have to deal with traffic regulations and the increase in traffic from one-off rural housing.  Now, there is the question of effluent discharge raised by Deputy Kenny today.  In my county of Wicklow there are areas where there are complications but we seem to be able to get over them by raising the bed and importing a different soil type.  Deputy Kenny referred to areas in Cavan with similar heavy soils getting planning permission for one-off rural housing.  Was that based on reed beds or willow beds?  If it is a similar situation, how can the local authority in Cavan grant permission?  Can Deputy Kenny explain that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.950" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#G00300"><p>It is a similar situation.  In Leitrim approximately 80% of the soil is dense.  Anyone who goes to a funeral in County Leitrim and looks into a graveyard can see that six inches down we have good soil but when we look below that we have dog heavy soil.  That is what we find in much of County Leitrim.  In west Cavan we have a similar situation, but west Cavan has considerable mountainous areas and we do not have as many planning applications, although we have some.  It is equally difficult for people to get planning in some parts of west Cavan.  There is a similar situation in some parts of Sligo and Donegal.  In counties where a lower percentage of the soil is heavy, people have more options to find land that has good enough absorption for building a house.  A person could have 40 acres but maybe only an area of three acres has suitable soil.  That is where the person will build the house.  That option many not be available in large parts of County Leitrim.</p> <p>  If we go back ten or 15 years before these regulations came in, many planning permission applications would have been granted in these areas.  They would have used willow beds and reed beds in parts of Cavan, Sligo and other counties.</p></speech>

Does Deputy Kenny have any indication of how many planning applications are refused?  We have figures on planning permissions granted.  Does he have any indication of the number of applications that are refused?</p></speech>

I do not know how many planning applications have been refused.  However, I know how many people would go and meet with a planning officer and say they were thinking about applying for planning.  People are always encouraged to have a pre-planning meeting.  In many of those pre-planning meetings they are told they have no hope and they do not even apply.  That is the case for 90% of people who wish to apply for planning.  There are parts of Leitrim where people still get planning where there is good land.  In different areas around Manorhamilton people get planning permission in some cases.  Annaduff is another parish.  If I go down through Dromod towards Carrick-on-Shannon there is reasonably good land there where the odd person will get planning permission.  It can be difficult even there.  Anyway, in most of County Leitrim it is difficult.  People do not seek planning because they have been told in the pre-planning meeting that they do not have a chance.  That has created a backlog.  If we had a situation in my parish where people could get planning, there would probably be eight or ten houses that people would like to build.  In the entire county there might be 40 houses.  Then, that number would quickly go back down to ten or 12 per year.  We are not talking about vast numbers of houses.  The numbers are small but the fact that these small numbers of houses are not being built is having a detrimental impact on the rural community.  Part of our environment is our people.  If we starve our rural communities of people then we run into a major problem.</p></speech>

For new builds, site characterisation must be carried out in accordance with the EPA code of practice for wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses 2009.  In regard to this code of practice particular attention is drawn to the provision that where the T-test is in excess of 90 then the site is unsuitable for discharge of treated effluent to the ground. </p> <p>  In County Leitrim, the landscape is characterised by drumlins which contain high clay content.  Unfortunately, due to the underlying nature of the sub-soils which are present across the majority of our county, estimated at 87% of our soils, the soil percolation tests fail to meet the acceptable percolation rates required to comply with the EPA code of practice and the sites are deemed unsuitable for discharge of treated wastewater or effluent to the ground. </p> <p>  This is proving to be a significant impediment to the granting of planning permission for individual dwellings in the countryside by Leitrim County Council's planning authority and indeed is preventing many prospective applicants making applications in the first instance as agents are aware that the subject sites will be deemed unsuitable once the soil percolation tests are undertaken.  This situation is not unique to County Leitrim but no county is affected to the same extent as County Leitrim. </p> <p>  The number of planning permissions granted for individual houses reliant on individual wastewater treatment systems is set out in a table which I have supplied to the committee with a copy of this statement.  It ranges from four in 2017 to 13 in 2018.  The figures in preceding years from 2012 are similar.  </p> <p>  Leitrim is a sparsely populated county with the 2016 census showing a population of 32,044.  The county is highly rural in nature with the vast majority of the population living in a non-urban environment.  This profile of the county represents the history and culture of Leitrim with a high proportion of small family farms.  In the context of this fabric the imposition of the percolation standards through the 2009 code of practice has had what the council believes to be unintended consequences.  These consequences are most acutely felt in the small farm holding scenario where, despite many acres of land being available, the farmer's offspring, son or daughter, who may wish to establish their home on the family farm to continue to farm the land and be of support to their aging parents, will fail to secure planning permission.  The compounding effect of these restrictions for almost ten years is a contributing factor to the continued depopulation of areas of rural County Leitrim which will have a corresponding effect on the sustainability of the surrounding community and its facilities and services such as primary schools etc.</p> <p>  In this regard Leitrim County Council, while maintaining a responsible attitude to the protection of the environment, as is required by law, set about identifying options that could be explored to provide a wastewater treatment system solution that would be suitable, acceptable and affordable.  In addition, the council has at all times maintained a responsible attitude through its county development plan to rural planning with a variety of policies that ensure the appropriate establishment of one-off rural housing in Leitrim and would not see the restrictions of the code of practice as necessary or relevant from a rural planning control tool perspective.</p> <p>  The existing EPA code of practice is under review with a new document expected to be published in the next couple of months.  It is anticipated that the review of the code of practice may widen slightly the acceptable parameters of percolation rates which will result in a limited number of marginal sites in County Leitrim now becoming acceptable for discharge of treated effluent to ground but, as only marginal in nature, it is felt that the Council must continue to pursue these alternative solutions.</p> <p>  Leitrim County Council has been pursuing innovative solutions to facilitate the design of a wastewater treatment and disposal facility that would be suitable in the poor draining soils.  Through this process the council identified a treatment solution that has the potential to have a zero discharge or near-zero discharge of effluent and, if successful, would allow sites with poor percolation characteristics to treat the discharge of wastewater in a manner which was not prejudicial to public health or the protection of the environment.  The nature of the wastewater treatment system is a willow-based system constructed within a sealed soil basin.  The council has engaged with Dr. Laurence Gill, a professor in environmental engineering in the school of engineering, Trinity College Dublin as academic support to the process.  Dr. Gill has extensive experience in assessing the operation of individual wastewater treatment systems and was co-author of the EPA publication that Deputy Kenny mentioned earlier.</p> <p>  The willow evapo-transpiration system consists of a sealed basin that has been refilled with the original soil excavated on site in order to install an impermeable liner and distribution pipe network, which has then been planted with willow cuttings.  The system receives wastewater effluent fed to the base of the basin and treated and removed via evapo-transpiration, primarily during the growing season when the willow trees have high water demand but it also occurs on a limited basis all year round.  Results from 12 trial systems to date have shown that the system provides excellent pollutant attenuation greatly reducing organic, nutrient and indicator bacteria.  Through the most recent design concepts the level of rainfall entering the system will be significantly reduced if not eliminated thus ensuring minimal if any overflow from the system and if such were to happen tests available already show the characteristics of such escaped liquid to be similar to ground run-off.</p> <p>  Currently the water pollution legislation provides for discharges to ground and surface waters.  In regard to domestic waste water treatment systems there is an exemption for discharge to ground where the quantity to be discharged is less than 5 m3 per day.  However, a discharge to surface waters can only occur under licence from the local authority.  As a consequence a detailed application process is required in order to comply with the legislative requirements.  The application process is lengthy and requires significant data collection on the identified receiving waters such as all year round flows and assimilation capacity along with a rigorous monitoring regime thereafter in regard to items such as ongoing sampling analysis, inspection chambers, record keeping and licence renewal processes.  This system of licensing discharges is more designed to deal with matters such as industrial by-products rather than domestic waste water treatment systems.</p> <p>  A pilot scheme is currently proposed in Leitrim to further test the willow system for zero discharge, that there is no discharge or escape of effluent from the willow plantation basin at any time based on a more refined design taking learning from the trials to date.  However, on other trials to date in Ireland the objective of zero discharge from the system has not been fully realised.  In addition to that detailed earlier in regard to attenuation what is also known is that the willow system does deliver a significantly reduced level of effluent discharge, with discharge only in winter months.</p> <p>  Taking into account the research already available what is now required is a means to dispose of the limited, if any, resulting discharge proven to be primarily arising from rainfall.  The option for this discharge is to proceed to surface discharge only, given that the ground conditions on the subject site prevents discharge to ground.  Given the proven reduced scale of effluent, its proven standard and the fact that the discharge arises during the wetter times of the year, there is a case for the development, in the context of output from these systems, for a less rigorous regulatory regime that is both appropriate and proportionate and which would therefore move away from the rigours of the current authorisation process for discharge to surface waters.</p><p>This reformed regulatory process can be limited to provide only for installations meeting certain design standards based on the experience of the willow systems to date, for example.  The data available also provides the basis for both design guidelines for the system and design parameters for this discharge, particularly in regard to volumes, effluent standard, and so on.</p><p> Through the work carried out nationally to date, along with the work of Leitrim County Council, there is now an immediate opportunity to address the unintended consequences of the provisions of the code of practice of 2009 in regard to sites of low permeability.  This opportunity relates to the use of the domestic wastewater evapotranspiration treatment system, coupled with the requested regulatory reform under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977.  This would provide a clear option for the provision of a new rural dwelling where the housing need to be accommodated in rural Leitrim is of an absolute requirement, which in turn could be of general application in areas of the country with similar soil conditions.  The pilot scheme in Leitrim will continue to pursue the objective of zero discharge, which would be the ultimate preferred outcome.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.960" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#J00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting the Environmental Protection Agency to assist in the detailed scrutiny of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill 2018.  I am joined by my colleagues from the EPA&rsquo;s Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, Mr. Darragh Page and Mr. Noel Byrne.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the EPA is an independent statutory body established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  Our organisational vision is to protect and improve the environment as a valuable asset for the people of Ireland, and also to protect our people and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation and pollution.  To that end, the EPA performs a number of functions that are particularly pertinent to the current discussions, including monitoring the quality of the Irish environment, in particular the quality of our water courses.  We are responsible for the development of the national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems, and the co-ordination and reporting on the implementation of that plan.  We develop and maintain a code of practice on wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses, as mentioned by previous speakers.</p> <p>  With regard to water quality, I would highlight a number of troubling findings in recent EPA reports that are relevant to our discussions.  Water quality in Irish waters has deteriorated, with a net overall decline of 3% in good water quality between 2015 and 2017.  Long-term loss of high-quality river sites is continuing, with a further 0.6% decline since 2015.  The EPA groundwater national monitoring programme found that 43% of groundwater monitoring wells were contaminated with faecal coliforms in 2017.  These findings illustrate the vulnerability of our ground waters, which provide much of our drinking water in rural Ireland, as well as the vulnerability of our surface waters, where we are failing to arrest the continued decline in quality.  These are priority, shared challenges in terms of human health protection and environmental protection.</p> <p>  The Water Services Act 2007, as amended, and associated regulations, among other things, provide for inspections of domestic wastewater treatment systems by water services authorities.  The EPA is responsible for preparing the national inspection plan, which specifies the minimum number of inspections across the country for each local authority area.  Inspections target areas where there is the greatest potential for improving water quality and improving the protection of human health.  The EPA reports regularly on the implementation of the plan and the report for the 2017-18 period, due for publication shortly, will show the following: almost half of the domestic wastewater treatment systems inspected in the reporting period failed the inspection, which is consistent with previous years and shows persistent problems with existing systems; failures are due to system construction defects and systems not being maintained and cleaned properly; over one quarter of systems were found to be causing a risk to the environment or human health; and almost one third of systems that failed during the 2013-18 period are still not fixed, with many of those unresolved for more than one year.</p> <p>  Domestic wastewater treatment systems are a risk to human health and the environment if they are not constructed and maintained properly.  They can contaminate a householder&rsquo;s drinking water well or their neighbour&rsquo;s well.  In this context, it should be noted that Ireland has the highest rate of VTEC infection in the EU, with over 1,100 cases in 2018.  One possible source of this infection is contaminated drinking water from private wells.</p> <p>  The EPA published the code of practice on wastewater treatment and disposal systems serving single houses in 2009.  The code is referenced throughout technical guidance document H on drainage and wastewater disposal developed under the building regulations.  The purpose of the code is to ensure that domestic wastewater treatment systems are constructed and maintained properly so they do not contaminate groundwater and surface waters and endanger people&rsquo;s health.  Essentially, the code sets out how to determine if a site is suitable for the installation of a treatment system and the standards necessary for the construction and maintenance of the system, providing several construction options, depending on the site constraints and householder requirements.</p> <p>  The current code was published over a decade ago and the EPA is cognisant of the importance of ensuring that national guidelines reflect available and emerging technologies and techniques.  To that end, research funded by the EPA was recently conducted through a collaboration between researchers at Trinity College Dublin, National University of Ireland Galway and National University of Ireland Maynooth to examine further domestic wastewater treatment options in areas of low permeability soils.  This research identified two new technologies - low pressure pipe and drip dispersal systems - which can operate in low permeability soils, increasing the percolation limits and, hence, providing greater flexibility for householders and planners.</p> <p>  These new technologies and the associated increase in the percolation limits are incorporated in the draft revised code which was published in December 2018 for three months of consultation.  During the consultation period, 36 submissions were received, including almost 500 individual comments on the code.  The code revision process is being overseen by a steering committee which is currently considering the submissions, with a view to finalising the revised code by end of the year.  The steering committee is comprised of representatives of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and local authorities, as well as industry and the research community.</p> <p>  The code of practice represents the best available technical and scientific knowledge for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  For homeowners, it provides the assurance of having their site assessed to a proper standard and that the system chosen will operate satisfactorily in the long term, protecting their health, the health of their neighbours and the environment.  I assure the committee that the EPA will continue to work closely with local authorities, Departments and others to assist in the assessment of possible solutions and strategies in this area, and to support further research where that is identified, with the primary objective of ensuring the protection of people's health and the environment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#J00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today as part of the detailed scrutiny of the Bill.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. David Flynn, principal adviser.  By way of preliminary comment, the Department understands and appreciates the intent behind the Private Members&rsquo; Bill, that is, to make possible and facilitate the choice of those who wish to live in rural communities outside cities, towns and villages.</p> <p>  In the context of the rationale behind the Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, last week organised a meeting with Deputy Martin Kenny and a delegation of public representatives and officials from Leitrim County Council to discuss the particular challenges of providing domestic wastewater treatment systems in Leitrim.</p><p>As we heard this morning, Leitrim County Council, with the support of the EPA, has been working with Trinity College to investigate treatment systems that use willow beds.  The Department agreed at the meeting last week to follow up with a more detailed technical engagement with the county council and the EPA to explore how a pilot project could be supported.  The Department also noted that there was unanimity at the meeting regarding any solutions which may be developed and which do not give rise to a threat to human health and the environment.  That is in line with the current general statutory requirement not to allow the deterioration of the chemical or ecological status of bodies of water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters, and groundwater.  The imperative to maintain good water quality is the right thing to do in any event in to manage risk and for the protection of human health.<br/><br/>The Bill seeks to make it easier to issue discharge licences under the Water Pollution Acts in cases where EPA-approved domestic wastewater treatment systems would not be adequate.  However, as set out in the Department's letter to the committee, the Department is concerned that the Bill does not contain adequate safeguards to ensure Irish law is compliant with the EU water framework directive or would not give rise to potential significant threat to the environment and public health.<br/><br/>Ireland has high dependence on individual wastewater treatment systems.  We have already been found guilty by the Court of Justice of the European Union of failure to put in place adequate safeguards for the environmental performance of these systems.  The inspection regime and the current plans the Department has put in place are in response to that judgment.  In 2012, the court found that Ireland had failed take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without processes or methods that could harm the environment.  The judgment led to financial penalties of &euro;2.76 million and had implications for 440,000 wastewater treatment systems serving single houses.  As a result, the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 introduced registration and inspection arrangements for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  I am highlighting this because the Bill before us seeks to amend section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 to provide for the granting of discharge licences to surface water in order to allow for the development of single houses.<br/><br/>We have some experience, primarily in Wexford, where the local authority used discharge licences to facilitate house construction in the 2000s.  The difficulties encountered by householders in managing licensed discharges to surface waters included the technical challenges of managing wastewater treatment systems and achieving the required effluent standard.  Where difficulties were encountered, such as the malfunctioning of the domestic wastewater treatment system causing pollution to the receiving waters, significant local issues arose, including public health concerns, the use of water for livestock drinking and problems with foul odours.  The majority of these licences have had to be revoked at considerable cost to householders.<br/><br/>Since 2009, Wexford County Council has worked in collaboration with householders to find sustainable solutions to minimise the impact of these legacy systems.  In many cases, householders requested that licences be terminated because of the difficulties they have encountered in managing the systems.  In these instances, alternative solutions not involving direct discharges to receiving waters have been developed in consultation with Wexford County Council.  In most cases, the alternative solutions placed a significant additional financial burden on householders.<br/><br/>It is also important to note, as we heard from the EPA, that there are reliable and sustainable technical solutions available to those building new houses under the current regulatory framework for domestic wastewater treatment systems.  In addition to septic tanks, the feasibility of using alternative treatment systems for low permeability soils, such as low pressure pipe and drip dispersal systems, has been researched.  In the context of the new guidelines the EPA is developing such alternatives may be permissible for some areas that may have previously failed percolation tests and are unable to support percolation areas.<br/><br/>From an environmental perspective, the proposal in the Bill, as drafted, would pose a significant risk to the water quality in the receiving rivers, lakes and estuarine waters in rural areas.  This is because discharges of septic tank effluents directly to surface waters generally pose a higher risk to water quality than discharging to groundwater via a septic tank percolation area.  The percolation area which domestic treatment systems use is a vital component in treating and reducing the pollutant load of the wastewater effluent.  Making it easier to license less safe effluent discharge options is likely to pose unacceptable risks.<br/><br/>Effluent discharging to surface waters from domestic-scale wastewater treatment systems poses a significant risk to the water quality in the receiving waters.  The consequence is likely to be degraded quality in receiving waters, which would be contrary to our legal obligations, with all the attendant increased risks to human health.  In particular, section 4(13)(<i>a</i>) appears to suggest that a local authority must issue a licence under section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 regardless of whether the discharge would cause deterioration in water quality and would be contrary to any existing water policy and associated water quality standards and objectives.  I heard Deputy Martin Kenny's comment on whether that was a necessity.  The Department considers that it opens up an unacceptable risk.  It would leave a local authority exposed to the risk of legal action for breaching its duty under a number of legislative provisions intended to protect human health and the environment.  For all the foregoing reasons, the Department has significant concerns about the Bill, but we would be happy to explore these in more detail with the committee.  In light of the conversations at the meeting last week, the positive attitude adopted by Leitrim County Council and the new guidelines being developed by the EPA, it seems there are opportunities to come at this issue and the particular problem facing County Leitrim in a different way that could help the situation without the need for the blunt instrument of legislation that could cause more problems than it would solve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.964" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#K00200"><p>My thanks to our three guests.  This committee takes its responsibilities seriously when it comes to issues of water quality.  The representatives from the EPA and the Department will know that we have spent considerable time scrutinising the important report on wastewater treatment, the risk arising from treatment plants and the risk on the private side which the agency publishes annually.  When we look at this legislation, we are looking at it through not only the lens of trying to facilitate people to live in the communities into which they were born but also to keep focus on maintaining high-quality water systems.  That is certainly my focus.</p><p>The challenge is to try to find a way of ensuring that, where in all other instances a planning applicant would otherwise get planning permission but for this issue, there is some way of solving this problem that does not in any way compromise the quality of our water system.  That is the challenge that Deputy Martin Kenny set himself and it is what we are discussing today.  I have three questions, one of each of our guests, that focus around this key challenge.  If we can fix that, then we have a solution that meets the interests of everyone here, guests and members alike.</p><p>My first question is for Dr. Ryan.  Deputy Martin Kenny made the case that it is possible to have a zero effect even if we have zero discharge.  I am interested in hearing the EPA's view on that.  To what extent is it possible?  To what extent does natural technology, such as that incorporating reed and willow beds and as outlined by Deputy Martin Kenny and Mr. Gilhooly, allow us to move towards that?  If we are not there 100%, can the EPA offer a view on how long it might take for such systems to achieve that?</p><p>I understand what Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh stated but section 4(13)(<i>b</i>) empowers the Minister to make regulations for the purposes of the granting of these licences.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh said that this is a blunt instrument.  Yet, even if the legislation were to pass, the ball would then fall into the court of the Department and Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh, who is the lead person to advise the Minister on how to draft such regulations.  I would never accuse Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh of being blunt in his work with the Department so I imagine he could find a way to craft the regulations in such a way as to meet our legal obligations and protect water resources.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh respond to that?  Surely regulations give the Minister a level of control and nuance for something important like this.</p><p> Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh mentioned two new technologies that are coming onstream that should allow the possibility of this problem being overcome in dense soil areas.  Can the witnesses tell me whether the two technologies would be much use in County Leitrim where a large section of the county has failed the percolation tests?  Please tell us a little more about the other work done to develop technologies that would meet planning and water quality requirements.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.967" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tom Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#L00300"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for his question.  I will refer to the current technologies for treating domestic wastewater and those that are incorporated into the revised code that we have just consulted on that allow greater flexibility in areas of low permeability soil.  Once one goes above a certain soil permeability level where the soil is compacted there is nowhere for effluent water to be discharged.  Therefore, dangerous pathogens and E. coli accumulate on the property in ponds and gives rise to significant health risks for the people in the dwelling, the children, the neighbours and water in wells.  That is the difficulty with low permeability soils.  The code extends flexibility because of the new technologies.  Therefore, we can push the limit somewhat and, as has been signalled, that may allow some permissions to be granted in the right circumstances.  Planners will consider that.</p> <p>  Looking to the future, the willow bed evapo-transpiration systems are promising.  We have been happy to support the research but more work needs to be done.  For certain elements of the discharge willow beds are quite effective but it does not allow for zero discharge.  That means there are some liquids.  More important, it also means that the system is not quite effective at removing the more hazardous pathogens, in particular E. coli.  It is not a case that there is no impact.  There could be a significant impact with the accumulation of residual waters with E. coli.  The technology looks promising because it is effective at removing some of the other elements but this is a stumbling block worthy of pursuing further research.  In terms of a timeframe for research, it could take a couple of seasons to establish but there are ideas being contemplated as to how these systems might be more effective.  It is an area that is well worth pursuing and the EPA would be happy to support such work. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.968" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#L00400"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin has put his finger on the nub of the Bill.  Section 2 is a very general provision and states that notwithstanding anything else in the law nothing shall prevent a local authority issuing a licence.  The provision opens the door very wide and poses a danger.  The provision is then pulled back when it is stipulated that the provision is controlled by regulation.</p> <p>  One could work with the Bill but as people are probably very much aware now in terms of the approach to legislation these days, following judgments by the Supreme Court, legislation must set out policies and principles.  We would need to do a lot of work on the Bill to set out the policies and principles around which the Minister would make regulations.  We are no longer allowed to legislate saying that the Minister can just go away and make regulations on anything.  That has been found out.  We need to be clear in this piece of legislation regarding what the regulations will cover and what is the framework within which the regulations operate.  That will then bring one to a simple premise that the regulations must ensure that people's health and the environment are protected.  That would be the context in which regulations are developed.  </p> <p>  The regulations would then bring us to a point where the Minister would probably pass the EPA without developing the relevant standards to ensure that discharges do not impact on our health and environment.  That brings us back to where we are now, which is codes of practice and regulatory regimes that are designed to ensure that health and the environment are not impacted.  I suspect we could do a huge amount of work and spend a huge amount of time on legislating but that would not actually bring us any further than what the current legal position is.  What we suggested when we met last week was to have greater technical discussions between the county council, ourselves and the EPA and see where that brings us.  If those discussions find that legislative or regulatory tweaks are required then that could inform how we would approach the matter in the future.  There could be tweaks within the existing code without the need for new legislation.  </p> <p>  Indeed, as we see, even within the current regime as Dr. Ryan outlined, the EPA is already, through the new guidelines that are being developed, allowing for new technologies that will give greater scope.  That is a slightly convoluted answer to say that by the time we go through a significant legislation process we may not actually progress the issue a huge amount whereas if we, the EPA and the county council work closely through guidelines we may help to resolve issues in some of these areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.969" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joseph Gilhooly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#L00500"><p>I am familiar with the amendments in the draft code of practice that was published and referred to earlier in terms of the technology around the drip dispersal system and the low pressure piping system.  The Deputy must take into account that there is an acute problem with soils in County Leitrim.  One does not have many borderline cases - one is either okay or far from okay.  Allowing for the new systems that have been suggested in the draft code, if it is approved, and the changes in the level of the T-test that would arise, because those systems would allow a higher T-test to be acceptable, we would be of the view that that would have a very limited positive impact on the county because of the soil types we have.   It does not really matter if one has a T-test of 90, 110, 120 or 130.  The new technologies are those that can handle the system and allow for a higher level of T-test.  As alluded to earlier, there are situations where one is successful and data shows we are granting one-off houses in a very limited number of areas.  We would welcome any positive adjustment to the code of practice.  It is not that we are negative towards it; we would welcome it and be delighted to see it coming.  However, it would not be a solution sufficient to the degree of need that exists in County Leitrim.</p> <p>  In terms of where we are at with our work at the moment and going forward, I am familiar with the space in so far as I was assigned to the planning department as director in September 2010 and this issue was the first thing on my desk when I arrived.  I had a period of learning and coming up to speed with what was happening and what options did and did not exist.  We worked our way through that from both official and political perspectives and reached a point in 2012 and 2013 where we started to consider piloting various options.  We considered what was out there that could work and then we piloted them in the context of County Leitrim and Ireland, if one considers this internationally.  That work has been ongoing and we have accumulated a certain level of knowledge and understanding.  I have been with this process since then and believe we are on the cusp of making some progress.  I am very much encouraged by the meeting that we had recently with my colleagues here from the Department and the EPA, all of whom have emphasised their willingness to work closely with us to assist in coming up with strategies to deploy the options.  Examining ways to work collaboratively is very important to us.</p><p>We have worked in isolation for a good while, and I do not mean this negatively, but we had a sense that we would go ahead, do some work, pilot something, get research, and then, when we had all our papers together, we would arrive at the door of the Department or the EPA with all this done, asking if we could try to find some way of implementing it on a more general application basis.  We have the opportunity here to cut that stage out, so that we might move forward collaboratively and collectively from next week when we intend to meet on this.  We would no longer be using a two-pronged approach, whereby, having done a certain level of research, we set about establishing something we think works, compile our reports, and then have to go into sales mode to get the success of the information and research we have done across to others.  If we do that together, we can save a lot of time.</p><p> We are encouraged by the work we have been doing with Trinity College on what the next phase of the willow system pilot would look like.  At this stage, we are 100% focused on the willow evapo-transpiration system as a solution worth pursuing.  We are encouraged by the existing research on how to strip out more of the rainfall impact on the system, which could be achievable, but its impact on the efficiency of the system has to be tested and that is why we need to pilot it.  Calculations from some previous reports, which were alluded to earlier, suggested a reduction of 60% in the rainfall hitting the system, which could make the difference in there being discharge or not.  We think that figure is achievable, provided the revised design process is still efficient and deals with the system properly.  We are encouraged, and are looking forward to proceeding along the lines that have been set out collectively and collaboratively with the EPA and the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.971" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#M00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  Dr. Ryan said the ET system does a very good job in general, but he has particular issues around E. coli and how it can be dealt with.  Are there possibilities there?  Many systems in the past have had a polishing element at the end which eliminates E.coli.  Does Dr. Ryan think it would be possible to add a polishing system to ET systems in order to do that, or does he believe further refinement and research on the ET system on its own may be able to achieve a reduction to negligible levels that will not have an impact?</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh mentioned that the Minister might regulate this when the doors are fully opened and pulled back a bit.  The intention is for the Minister to set out very strict regulations which would ensure the impact on the environment is eliminated.  The difficulty we have is with the zero discharge element.  Even with collaboration and the good work that has been done by Leitrim County Council, the EPA and others, we will come to a stage where, while the discharge will be extremely small, will have been reduced considerably and will be of a very high standard which will have zero impact in the future, we will still have discharge.  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh says there may be another way to deal with that discharge, other than putting a licence in place.  Can he explain to me where that may arise from, or if it is possible?</p> <p>  Mr. Gilhooly referred to the soil types in Leitrim, of which a large quantity are impermeable, and so we seldom have many areas there which are borderline.  Moving from a T 90 to a T 120 will make no difference in the vast majority of cases, and that is the reality because we have very few borderline cases.  In that context, if we are going to try to achieve as close to zero discharge as possible, with zero impact, how long will it take to finish that research?  Dr. Ryan mentioned that it might take a couple of seasons.  Considering the volume of work that has already been done, could we come to this quickly?  I am conscious of the sense of panic, and of real frustration, that exists both in Leitrim and in many rural communities, where people feel they are being shut down and that nobody cares about them.  We need to deal with this.  I feel frustrated that we have been looking for solutions for ten years, and people are saying it is a shame on our houses that we could not come up with a solution to this sooner.  We need to put an intense focus on this in order to get a solution in place as quickly as possible.  Perhaps Mr. Gilhooly could outline an appropriate timeframe to come to a solution here.  It is important that we have the technology right and we feel the solution can work, but we also need to ensure the legislation and regulations are in place in advance, so people can move on the solution as soon as it is reached.</p></speech>

We empathise with the challenges people, planners, and regulators are facing in the area, in the context of poor soil percolation and the social issues around it.  It is a challenging environment to work in.  A key aspect from our code of practice is protecting people in their homes to make sure the systems they have in place are not injurious to either their health or that of their neighbours and children.  Will willow evapo-transpiration systems, working in some combination with existing systems, provide zero-impact?  The current research shows they are very good, and are getting there, but are not there yet.  It does look promising and is worthy of support, and the EPA is working with colleagues to support that.</p></speech>

In other words, dirty water is being compared with dirty water rather than clean water.  Does Dr. Ryan get where I am coming from?  It seems the EPA is, in that sense, trying to achieve something that is not achievable, or is that an incorrect conclusion to draw?</p></speech>

Part of the study looked at where effluent, which is not raw effluent, is put into the system, and compared it, and while it does work very well, it does not work for E. coli.  This is the real problem.  These systems are not yet at a level of efficiency where they can remove E. coli, although they are getting there.  It may not have anything to do with a combination of polishing, but may be related to the design, or protecting the system from the ingress of rainwater.  Those are the kinds of issues future research would look at.  They are doing very well on some of the nutrients but are not doing as well on E. coli, which is the key one.  If a system like that is put in, there will be residual E. coli ponding and building in the locality, which will cause attendant health risks.</p></speech>

The regulations set out that type of heavy regime that was referenced.  There are always ways to adjust regulations within the existing statute.  We would suggest we would work with the revised Environmental Protection Agency, EPA guidelines and the dialogue process we have set up with Leitrim County Council, come to conclusions and give the rationale for adjusting the regulatory regime under the existing Act.  There is a process involved in that.  For example, in supporting ongoing pilot projects, on which the Department would be happy to work with the EPA and Leitrim County Council, if we put a credible project together, for a pilot phase we would still need a heavy regime of information gathering and monitoring to ensure the project can prove itself.  That would inform us in being able to say the system works well.  Under the existing Act, one could have a lighter form of licence but we would first need the evidence to support that.  We are happy to engage to see where that might bring us.  </p></speech>

We would hope we could bring forward considerable learning from the existing trials.  We would then have to examine trialling the systems that have a reform design based on what we are trying to achieve or the remaining elements that need to be addressed to ensure the system can work most effectively.  It will take time to trial a system.  Currently, there is no authorised development process to proceed with a trial in Leitrim.  One would be depending on the design of the system, getting planning approval for it and constructing it.  The system is a natural one.  It must be constructed and become established and that will take some time.  It could be done in conjunction with the construction of a property and the system ideally would be ready to receive effluent when the house is ready for occupation and from that point we would move to the monitoring stage.</p> <p>  We would work collectively and there would be an ongoing process of engagement.  We would take the information from the trials, reports and analysis.  After the system is established it would receive effluent and the system would have a chance to mature.  Early analysis could be informative in indicating if we would have turned a corner in dealing with issues such as the escape of effluent, the composition of the effluent and if success has been achieved in separating the rainfall element with it being repelled from rather than absorbed into and discharged out of the system.   We could assess if the rainfall element has been successfully dealt with, that the system is performing as well as previous systems, notwithstanding its new design and that it provides more of a cover.  We would be able to show what is within the system is pure effluent, that there would be the discharge of effluent and we would be able to measure the parameters and design changes to allow us to deal with some issues such as E.coli. </p> <p>  That is the path we are on and it is not a short one.  There is no magic formula.  We would like to think this year much of the ground work could be done through the meetings we expect to have and having sites at an approval stage that would be good to proceed by spring next year.  We would be looking at two years from then but that might be an early timeframe.  I might have caused people some concern as they might think that within a year of the system functioning we would have research on which we could depend.  We would certainly start to identify the steps being taken in the design that would have a meaningful impact.  We would develop competence quickly to show the outcome of the system after the first year of occupation in the house was moving in the right direction and addressing any of the remaining issues.  </p> <p>  There are a number of stakeholders involved other than those in this committee room.  Individuals are looking to their future in Leitrim or in other counties where this problem presents and there are other stakeholders who are concerned about environmental impacts.  It is important we would be able to show people we have quality assured each step as we go along so that we would not be raising any false expectations and that in setting out to achieve the best we can that we would not be generating concern about other issues within the big picture.</p></speech>

We must seriously consider all the information.   I hear what the witnesses are saying particularly about promoting public health and meeting our EU obligations.  I am not convinced this legislation would require complicated drafting to ensure that whatever licensing regime is in place would have to be compliant with both of those elements.  Deputy Kenny is very reasonable and I am sure a friendly amendment put forward to provide for working in those two elements would address some of the witnesses' concerns.  Ultimately, it is still a statutory instrument or a regulation that will be required and will have to be based on the evidence that everybody has outlined.  We have learned in the past two years that even imperfectly drafted legislation from the Opposition can put a little extra pressure on the Government and subsequently on the Department responsible to do something that probably would not have happened in that timescale if we had not been doing what we were doing.  Student accommodation is an obvious example of that.  Another is the microbeads legislation, Second Stage of which we will be debating later today.</p> <p>  Given that Mr. Gilhooley has spoken about being on the cusp of something, I would be of a mind to take on board what he has said but by way of sensible amendments to this legislation to keep the pressure on the officials so that the positive developments we have heard from everybody continue to be positive.  I  detect some frustration has been experienced by Mr. Gilhooly who diplomatically described having worked on this issue for nine or then years.  If we are now in a really good space, that is a positive development.  I would say Deputy Kenny would be of a mind, and I would support him, to apply some helpful pressure on the officials.  I urge members to work with us on the committee and rather than dismissing the expertise of the Department to work some of that into Committee Stage through sensible amendments to keep the process moving forward.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, as did Deputy Kenny, that it is not intention of this Bill or of the members of the committee to put public health at risk.  Equally, no individual living in a rural area would want to contaminate their neighbours' well that supplies their drinking water.  However, families are trying to build a home on their own land at a time when we have a housing crisis.  I have been dealing with the issue of one-off rural housing for 15 years and it has consumed most of my time.  Sometimes rural people get the feeling, as do I, that one off rural housing is looked on negatively all the way from Europe, down to national level, down to local level.  There is a sense that one off rural housing is not wanted.  That is the basis on which an applicant is starting and they have to convert a number of negatives to positives to build a home for their  family.</p> <p>  To put some matters in context, Mr. &Oacute; Cogligh said that we incurred financial penalties of &euro;2.76 million in respect of one-off 440 wastewater treatment facilities.  What other fines is our State incurring in respect of the discharges from our public wastewater facilities?</p><p>If we were to compare like with like, which is the lesser of the two evils?  I often wonder because there is a significant lack of investment in public wastewater infrastructure and we are being fined for that.  This is to put it into perspective that not just rural houses pollute our rivers and streams.  Our public wastewater treatment plants do the same.  The witnesses mentioned Wexford with regard to private housing developments.  I concur that we have one or two in Wicklow that have continued to cause problems where discharge licences were given and there were significant issues with ongoing maintenance of wastewater facilities.</p><p> Dr. Ryan made a point about water quality having decreased by 3%.  That would not all be related to septic tanks.  There are other factors at play, including agriculture and, in my constituency, former mining activity has had an effect on water quality.  When Dr. Ryan says that water quality has diminished by 3%, it is not just because of one-off rural housing.  There are other significant factors at play, including the public supply or public discharge.</p><p> I have a few points for Mr. Gilhooly.  He says that when considering a replacement house, there is a provision in the existing code of practice amounting to a relaxation of standards where an existing wastewater treatment system exists.  If someone has a house and is replacing it, even though the replacement house can increase the population, the same standards do not apply to that development.  I am not sure about the breakdown of village sizes in Leitrim.  How many villages in Leitrim are on a public mains supply for water and sewerage?  What level of investment is Irish Water making into small rural villages in Leitrim to improve the capacity of our villages to cater for rural housing?  This is a problem nationally.  Irish Water is not investing in any infrastructure for our rural villages in any form unless they are polluting and Irish Water has no choice but to intervene.</p></speech>

I am representing the water division here but I can say that the Department's policy has always facilitated one-off housing.  There are significant differences in Wicklow, with pressure from the Dublin metropolitan area, compared to an area such as Leitrim.  The planning policy has always recognised that and been supportive of housing in areas where there is depopulation.  The Vice Chairman mentioned urban wastewater treatment.  He is correct that there is sometimes a tendency to say not to blame us because there is another problem elsewhere.  We have no option but to tackle all the issues, whether it is urban wastewater treatment, the wider agricultural sector, forestry or individual septic tanks.  The EPA's reports will point to all those pressures and we have no choice but to address them.  We were found guilty in the European Court of Justice in March, two months ago, for failures relating to urban wastewater treatment.  Mr. Flynn and I met the Commission about that case on Tuesday this week.  It specifically raised the Arklow wastewater treatment plant because it has been such a saga.  We cannot avoid any of these issues.  Did Mr. Flynn wish to make any other point?</p></speech>

Water quality is a complex area and many pressures bear on quality.  I thought it was important to set out the overall context.  There is a decline there.  Septic tanks are part of the pressure.  We have a river basin management plan which states that domestic wastewater, including septic tank systems associated with one-off housing and unlicensed private urban wastewater treatment plants for small conurbations, is a substantial pressure on approximately 11% of water bodies which are identified as being at risk in the management plan.  It is not an insignificant pressure and we have to manage it.</p></speech>

If somebody is developing on an existing site that has the benefit of an existing wastewater treatment system, it can be expected that the best available technology will be used to protect human health and the environment as part of that upgrade.  One has to bear in mind that people in an existing property, or inheriting or buying a property with an existing wastewater treatment system, have an approved, authorised development that they can occupy.  They may become part of the national inspection plan, as was alluded to earlier.  That can arise depending on the risk analysis and what inspections are carried out annually in any local authority area.  That works on the basis that the property already has an authorised use and people can reoccupy it and operate the system there.  It is preferable to see the system improved and a higher standard system installed as part of a development, which would be required.  It gives a derogation such that one does not have to establish that one can achieve the "T > 90" if one is moving into a site with an existing system.  The priority is to improve the system with the best available technology and standards that one can achieve.</p> <p>  With regard to towns and villages, Leitrim is relatively fortunate in that most of the reasonably-sized settlements have public sewerage and wastewater treatment systems.  I do not have the exact figure but the county has approximately 27 towns and villages and I imagine that 20, if not more, of those are served by a public wastewater treatment system.</p> <p>  Irish Water's priority for current investment in Leitrim is as I assume it is in many areas, as mentioned in relation to areas at risk and under pressure as identified by the river basin management places, to improve and deal with deficiencies in the existing systems.  There is investment in that regard in Leitrim for water and wastewater but it is not to extend capacity of any existing system in County Leitrim.</p></speech>

In some places, one can go through 8 or 10 ft of daub before coming to a gravelly subsoil.  In other places, there is less of it.  It creates a very difficult environment in which to work.  This has an impact not just for one-off housing but a range of issues.  E. coli was mentioned.  The point has often been made to me by people in the planning department that they look at a two acre site and find there is nowhere on it to build a house but then the person will drive past it two months later and see that a farmer has spread several tanks of slurry on the same piece of land, which obviously has impermeable soil.  The question arises as to what is going on.  I imagine this issue will have an impact on E. coli and the agricultural sector.  We have a vast amount of forestry in Leitrim and there is the run-off from all of this.  What are the three main causes of pollution?  I imagine one-off rural housing is not in the top three in Leitrim.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the significant body of work done by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service in the briefing paper that accompanies the Bill.  It is a substantial and helpful piece of work.</p> <p>  The Bill is very simple and does three things.  It seeks to increase the Part V requirement for standard residential developments to 25% from the currently reduced 10%; it seeks to impose a larger Part V requirement of 30% in strategic development zones; and it also makes one significant wording change to the existing legislation.  Not only does it change the percentages but it also changes the wording surrounding them from "not more than" to "at least", which is a significant change for members to be aware of.</p> <p>  The arguments are very straightforward and the committee discusses them week in and week out.  We are not getting a sufficient supply of social housing, notwithstanding the increases taking place.  There are very few affordable housing schemes in the pipeline and most of them will not start delivering units until 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023.  While the Government previously stood down the affordable housing schemes, affordable housing is still on the Statute Book and if we increase the Part V requirement to 25%, it will allow local authorities to make decisions on the basis of an increased supply of affordable housing.</p><p>That, in turn, will allow local authorities to make decisions on the basis of an increased supply of affordable housing.  If combined with the serviced sites fund that is now available to local authorities, this could be used to deliver a much more significant increase in affordable rental or affordable purchase accommodation in these developments.</p><p> The Department has given a statement and I will comment on the concerns it has expressed.  It is concerned about the change of wording from "not more than" to "at least".  It is especially concerned that this could lead to local authorities which do not need more affordable and social housing having to agree to it.  I am not convinced that there are many such local authorities.  If, however, members are of the view that some flexibility needs to be introduced in order to ensure that local authorities will not be forced to take units they do not need, I would be happy to explore the matter on Committee Stage.  We hear from Deputies in almost every county and local authority area that there is an urgent need for more social and-or affordable housing.  In light of this, I am of the view that the change of wording is valid.</p><p> There is a concern that this will have an impact on the price of properties because developers will have less stock in each development to sell at open market prices.  The difficulty is, as the Goodbody report published earlier this week confirms, that we have much housing stock which is currently being built in the wrong place or at the wrong price.  It has shown that there is a reduction in the number of new purchased units at prices of less than &euro;250,000.  Rather than increasing prices, if the local authority chose the option of affordable housing as the increased portion, this would increase the volume of affordable housing for people who are currently priced out of the market, which would be an important change.</p><p> We do not have many strategic development zones, SDZs.  The two most recently designated are at Poolbeg and Clonburris, which is in my constituency.  Some 30% of the houses in the Clonburris zone will be Part Vs, or social and affordable houses, on lands that the local authority owns.  That is in the SDZ and has been approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Dublin City councillors approved a requirement for 30% in the Poolbeg SDZ in respect of land that is all private, albeit under the control of a NAMA-appointed receiver.  While An Bord Plean&aacute;la ruled that any such percentage would have to be voluntary because the law does not permit otherwise, it still demonstrates that SDZs are, by their nature, very strategic in key locations and the latter are precisely the locations in which a higher percentage of social and affordable housing is needed.  The idea that only 10% of the units in the Poolbeg zone would be social and affordable homes makes no sense, particularly in view of the nature of the area.  There needs to be separate treatment for SDZs above the standard requirement.</p><p> Different views were expressed by parties which allowed the Bill to pass Second Stage.  People stated hat they might like to see a slightly lower increase, perhaps to 20% rather than 25%, with a similar view about SDZs.  I am happy to work with any of the Deputies, those in parties or Independents, in order to reach a compromise position.  The objective is to get more than 10%.  While I have set out in the Bill what I would like to see at an optimum level, I am open to supporting friendly amendments in order to ensure that the Bill passes Committee and Report Stages.  I will work with Deputies in that regard.</p></speech>

I join him in acknowledging the substantial work that the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has done on the briefing paper.  It was circulated to all of us and is very comprehensive.  It is important that we acknowledge the enormous amount of work that the service does.  It is a wonderful resource for the committees, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  I have heard what Deputy &Oacute; Broin had to say and I read the submission from the Department that was circulated earlier.  We need to keep it simple.  I would not have supported the reduction in respect of Part Vs from 20% to 10%.  I prefer to use the broader term, "public housing", rather than social housing.  It is public housing, whether it is for an affordable purpose or some other purpose.  I like that concept.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about SDZs.  I am especially familiar with the zone in Cherrywood.  There is not much State land there, it is land that is held by private developers.  SDZs are different from each other depending on where they are located.  We would be doing very well if we could reverse the reduction and bring the figure back up to 20%.  That would be practical and reasonable.  We had it before.</p> <p>  I looked at an application for a development in south County Dublin recently that was approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We see the clustering of social or affordable housing.  The sites do not necessarily have the best aspects.  Many are single aspect sites, facing north, and I am concerned about that.  I would like to see stronger legislation for more equal and fair distribution of units across a complex.  I do not like the idea or suggestion that they are maybe slightly substandard, not the same quality of build, or that they are single aspect.  If we could get 10% social and 10% affordable housing, it would be a positive move.  What we do has to be incremental.  The Department raises many issues about stability in the market, how this is settling in and we are seeing these units come on stream.  They are standard sentences.  I do not want to rubbish the Department altogether.  It has legitimate concerns about stability in the market and an increased peak in outputs of the delivery of housing across all sectors by all different types of providers.  In general, I support this legislation and congratulate Deputy &Oacute; Broin and everybody involved in drafting it.  If we could reverse the reduction and get the figure back up to 20% from 10%, that would be a very good day's work.</p></speech>

We have supported it so far and we will continue to support it.  We have reservations about the percentage and Deputy Darragh O'Brien has outlined these to Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  We are concerned about trying to apply the legislation retrospectively to existing permissions.  We have just approved our regional and national plans and all our county development plans now have to fall into line with this.  It provides an opportunity in the review of all of our county development plans to take this type of legislation into account so that there can be no ambiguity about it.  It is clearly on the line there.  We have always supported the 20%.  We introduced it originally.  We stand over that and have been looking for it.  We are concerned about the percentages that Deputy &Oacute; Broin is looking for but we are willing to work with him on it.</p></speech>

The point that has come up for discussion is the question of whether one reverses and goes back from 10% to 20% or whether one goes beyond that, which this Bill proposes.  We need to go beyond it.  We had 20% when there was no housing crisis.  We now have the greatest housing crisis in the history of the State.  The figure should not be below 25%.</p></speech>

If a consensus position emerges for a particular percentage, notwithstanding the fact that, like Deputy Barry, I prefer the percentages that are listed in the Bill, I commit to working with that.  It is not legally possible to apply these retrospectively.  Developments for which planning permission has previously been granted will continue.  This is about future developments.  I emphasise the point about affordable housing.  On page 12 of the Library and Research Service's paper there is a good table of Part V developments and the breakdown of social and affordable housing from 2002 to 2018.  One can see that, from 2006 to 2008, affordable housing was the larger proportion of those.  We had a good meeting with officials from the Department, the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and two local authorities about affordable housing.  Members that were here will know that those projects will not deliver a significant yield of affordable units for some years.  We will get some in D&uacute;n Laoghaire next year but it will only be in the following years for Dublin city and elsewhere.  For those members who are really keen to see affordable rental or purchases come on-stream more quickly, this is the only route on the table.</p> <p>  The final point I will raise, which Senator Boyhan mentioned - and which brought a wry smile to my face - is one that I will also mention to Mr. Paul Hogan when he speaks later.  The final paragraph of the Department's presentation refers to fresh policy uncertainty.</p><p>One of the things the construction industry complains to the Government about is that it keeps changing the rules.  I am not saying the Department is necessarily wrong; some changes I agree with, some I do not.  If a policy change has a positive outcome, particularly for people who are unable to access social and affordable housing now, it is one that is worth making but when it is made the Government should stick to it for a period.  Most members of the committee are of the view that we will not seek to come back to this at a later stage if we pass it and proceed.  Industry will then know that is where it will stay for the future.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Paul Hogan, senior planning adviser, and Marian O'Driscoll, assistant principal in the housing policy unit.</p> <p>  The Bill as proposed intends to amend section 94 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 so that section 94 would essentially provide that at least 25% of land zoned for residential use or a mixture of residential and other uses would be reserved for the provision of social and affordable housing.  In addition, it proposes adding a new subsection which would increase the figure of 25% to at least 30% in a strategic development zone, SDZ.  This Bill was originally debated in the D&aacute;il in November 2018 and the position on it has not changed.  This is a time for stability and certainty in this policy area in order to foster housing supply and unnecessary change, which could affect supply and house prices, should be avoided. </p> <p>  There are a number of issues with this Bill, both substantive and technical, that deserve close consideration by the committee.  It should be noted that the Bill is not a straightforward return to the language of the original Planning and Development Act 2000.  The original Act referred to a percentage of "not more than 20 per cent", whereas the current Bill goes much further and proposes that "at least 25 per cent" or "at least 35 per cent" in a special development zone must be acquired by the local authority, thereby placing obligations on the local authority to acquire at least 25% or 35%.  This obligation would persist whether or not the local authority requires the land or the housing units in that given area, without further consideration of appropriateness from a financial or integration perspective and without any clear analysis of whether and how a sudden significant policy change such as this would affect housing supply or house prices in the short or medium term. </p> <p>  The committee has referred to the fact that this policy was previously comprehensively reviewed and that the review included a public consultation based on a report prepared by economic consultants.  In the context of this review, a detailed assessment of Part V requirements was undertaken, including the benefits that Part V had for social integration.  The review had regard to the changed economic circumstances and the changed circumstances in terms of housing supply.  It considered that the principle of integrated, mixed-tenure developments was positive from a housing policy perspective and therefore recommended the retention of Part V as a concept.  It urged that Part V be focused on the delivery of social housing and therefore recommended the lowering of the requirement from 20% to 10%. </p> <p>  Following this review, a number of amendments were made to Part V by way of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015.  While the developer's "contribution" was reduced from 20% to 10% of the "planning gain" - the amount by which the site increased in value as a result of having obtained planning permission - the previous provision which enabled the developer to make a financial contribution instead of selling land or units to local authorities was repealed.  Also, the developer was henceforth required to conclude a Part V agreement before commencing construction. </p> <p>  It was considered that this would copperfasten the original objective of Part V in the legislation, the delivery of social housing, combined with integration and sustainable mixed tenure communities across the country.  It should be noted that local authorities were informed, that they should seek to secure social housing units only, rather than affordable housing, under Part V.  It is considered that the amendments made to Part V in 2015 were fair and balanced.  It is also is a relatively short time since those amendments were made. </p> <p>  In relation to unintended consequences, it is entirely foreseeable that increasing the percentage to be set aside for social housing now would likely lead to an increase in private house prices as developers would likely seek to protect their overall profit margins.  Such an unintended consequence would be seriously problematic in the current housing climate where we are finally seeing a moderation in price increases. </p> <p>  It is also not considered appropriate to require a higher percentage in a strategic development zone, which would require a higher contribution from a developer carrying out residential development in an SDZ as opposed to a developer carrying out residential development elsewhere, with no underlying policy rationale.  Again, the local authorities should have the ability to make informed decisions based on the local need as to whether to acquire more housing in an SDZ without risking overall viability. </p> <p>  The supply of new housing in Ireland reached a nine year high in 2018, with more than 18,000 new units.  Indicators so far are positive that this figure will increase in 2019.  Having regard to the range of schemes and programmes that the Government has put in place to facilitate the accelerated delivery of social housing and affordable homes, including from State land, and mindful of the fact that the housing sector generally is still very much in a state of ongoing recovery, with a considerable journey yet to travel before a more balanced and stable housing market will be achieved, it is not considered appropriate to raise the current 10% Part V requirement to 25% at this time.  It is a time for stability in order to foster growth in supply and when supply has reached the required levels the policy can be appropriately reviewed again. </p> <p>  It should be noted of course that there is nothing to prevent local authorities acquiring further units in a development beyond those delivered under Part V, subject to being satisfied that this is appropriate in terms of sustainable communities' objectives and subject to funding being provided by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  This provides an appropriate level of flexibility whereby the local authority can acquire housing or indeed stimulate development in targeted areas. </p> <p>  While much has been achieved since 2015 in terms of recovery in the housing sector, there is still a considerable way to go, both in terms of achieving the level of supply that would better reflect a balanced housing supply and also in terms of achieving a recovery in supply that is more geographically spread.  Much of the recovery in scheme type home-building has been concentrated in Dublin, the greater Dublin area and Cork. </p> <p>  The policies put in place in recent years have played a major part in the recovery that has taken place and it is essential at this stage that there is policy stability and certainty if the recovery is to continue in the desired manner.  Now is not the time to introduce fresh policy uncertainty into this area by increasing or reintroducing costs and liabilities on the provision of housing, as to do so would foreseeably adversely impact the viability and therefore deliverability of housing in a market where viability, particularly in terms of housing at affordable price points, remains finely balanced in many areas and has yet to be restored in some parts of the country.</p></speech>

Local authorities are prevented from entering voluntary agreements in standard residential developments and SDZs because developers do not have to enter those agreements if they do not so wish.  The point of increasing that is to make it a viable option.  Dublin City Council voted to have a 29% social and affordable requirement in the Poolbeg SDZ but the receiver appealed it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and effectively won the core point of his appeal, that such an agreement would have to be voluntary.  That is now working itself out but it will cost the State a significant sum of money to purchase the land.  It would have been much better if An Bord Plean&aacute;la had the legislative foundation to uphold the original Dublin City Council decision.</p><p>That is why I think there is a need to have some increase whether it is 30% or 20%, as others have suggested, within the SDZs. </p><p> At present developers are entering into voluntary agreements, for example at Shackleton Park, as Mr. Hogan will know, from his former job with South Dublin County Council.  Due to the difficulty of accessing bank finance developers of very significant projects are quite open to voluntary agreements as it gives them a certain degree of additional security when they approach banks.  There is an argument for making this a more secure option that could assist some of those projects being developed at a faster level.  </p><p> One of the outcomes of the review in 2013-14 was a reduction to 10%.  There is a growing body of social policy evidence to say that 10% is too small for any possibility of integration of the very small number of lower income households in a larger private housing estate.  While nobody had the answer to what is the appropriate level to encourage the integration, which Government policy promotes, there is no evidence to suggest that 10% is high enough.  In fact, there are bodies of evidence from Britain, Australia and the US, and some research here, that shows 10% is too small and contributes to the isolation of lower income households within a larger housing development.</p><p> The witnesses are correct about the significant change in wording and that is a correct interpretation of my intention.  Do the witnesses know of local authorities that currently do not need an increase in social and affordable housing?  I ask because all of the local authorities we have talked to have housing lists and affordable housing needs greater than the level of supply available.</p><p> In terms of the potential increase in price for the remainder of the development, I made the remark before the witnesses came in that the Goodbody report was published earlier this week and highlights that too much of what has been built is above an affordable price point.  Therefore, surely if one has an increased Part V requirement it means there will be a greater level of affordability for those people who currently cannot buy in developments with only 10% provision.</p><p> In terms of policy uncertainty, we are going to have a series of other changes.  For example, the Joint Committee on Climate Action is going to have to consider changes in building regulations that the nearly zero energy building requirements, as Mr. Hogan and other witnesses rightly know, will create.  We are going to have a period of policy uncertainty.  We know for sure that we do not have enough social and affordable housing and this is one way of increasing that.  The Government cannot say we are going to have lots of uncertainty because of the initiatives that the Minister wants to introduce yet at the same time criticise the Opposition for creating alleged uncertainty because the Opposition wants to introduce those things.  There is going to be uncertainty over the next period but so as long as it is well flagged and is left at that level for a period then the industry will cope adequately. </p></speech>

The Deputy identified one way to increase the amount of social housing.  The flaw in his logic is that simply setting a percentage does not automatically increase the level of social housing.  One could set the percentage at 100% yet one will still not get social housing because simply no one would be able to supply it, instead one will affect development and choke supply.</p> <p>  The initiative does not address the impact on supply in the short to medium term.  There has been no such analysis.  Let us consider what was being developed during the years when the bust happened.  In 2008 and 2009, there were 4,518 Part V units, which was the height of the provision, yet the number plummeted to just 36 in 2016.  That shows the percentage does not automatically mean one will get more units.  A percentage represents what one wants but it does not mean developers will provide units or that there will be a supply.  What we are looking at here is increasing a percentage and effectively not knowing if the supply will be available.  People have bought the land at these prices, they are looking at building these houses in the next two years and we are saying that we absolutely want them to do so.  However, now we are saying we are going to change the rules so people must go back to their banks and say: "No, I am sorry but we will have to look at that again."  As a result there will definitely be a delay and we could negatively affect the supply.</p> <p>  The reference by the Deputy to the Goodbody report is very apt because it shows how finely balanced things are right now.  We are on the precipice and do not know whether we are going up or down.  The ESRI still says that we will hit about 25,000 units and it is important that we maintain the momentum.  I do not accept the point that there is instability in policy anyway and, therefore, we should have more, and it does not matter.  Of course it matters.  It matters that we do not have any more instability than we absolutely have to.  The Minister accepted in his Second Stage speech that once a supply reaches a level that is maintainable and sustainable - possibly the 35,000 units mark - he would look at that again.  That is a very fair and balanced position.  Once we see supply coming back to the level we really need then one would consider whether we are getting enough and if we could get more.  That is a really reasonable position.  In 2000, we were very reasonable when we said we wanted to get more units and more again during the boom.  However, we are not in that space now and have a very different economic reality in which to make decisions to change things; we said, in the review, that this is what we are going to do.  The last point made by the Deputy was precise because he said we should stick to it for a little while.  What we are doing is sticking to it for a little while, making sure we do not affect things and giving a little bit of stability but once we reach a position of stability we can make changes again.  The Deputy is right that this is about providing certainty to the market.  In other words, if one bought something at this price we are not going to change the game immediately and we will get= the supply, which is what we are asking for.</p> <p>  It is wrong to say that we are not going to get social and affordable housing any other way.  Of course local authorities need them but this is why we are considering other ways to provide such houses.  We are using public lands to do so, which the Deputy very much supports.  We are also considering measures like the serviced sites fund, the local infrastructure housing activation fund or LIHAF, affordable purchase homes and the rebuilding of home loans.  We know that all of these levers will accelerate and increase supply but this is a lever that manifestly could choke and decrease supply.  One has got to use the ones that are safe bets.  With this one there is a clear possible unintended consequence because at a minimum there will be a delay and, at a maximum, it could decrease supply.  Given how much that might affect rents in the market  we have to be very clear we have the evidence base to make a policy decision.  We do not have the evidence base before us to make that policy decision right now.  It would be something that we will consider again when the time is right, to check that this is something we would like to do.  </p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. Hogan, will comment on strategic development zones.  He is a planner and, therefore, has more expertise on them.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.1017" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019062000002#S00300"><p>The one-size-fits-all nature of the proposal is an issue.  A strategic development zone is a geographic planning designation, it is a spatially unique thing, applies to one place and is for a specified set of purposes.  Each one of those aspects need to be considered in a local context as opposed to being subjected to a very high-level of overall national provision.<br/><br/>Not all SDZs are for housing.  Again, this is a point that needs to be taken on board.  Some include some housing or could include some housing at the point of designation but it is always specified, such as the Grangegorman SDZ for the Technical University Dublin.  Waterford north quays is another current example of where the development could be entirely commercial but could also include some housing but we do not know for sure and depends on what comes forward.  We have a current draft for Knock Airport, for example, which probably will not have any and an emerging proposal for the University of Limerick that could include some but, again, that is down the line.  The real point is that there is no one-size-fits-all and the proposed threshold of 35% is very high.  Therefore, it would be inappropriate to single out and prejudge how an SDZ can be approached locally given the intended purpose of an SDZ.<br/><br/>Finally, SDZs are intended to be, particularly in the case of housing, a strategic approach to planning whereby the normal set of uncertainties and things in a system are set aside and there is a clearer or more certain route to the volume delivery of housing such as Adamstown, Clonburris and Cherrywood.  Applying this kind of differential standard, all of which would have to be negotiated in advance and prior to the commencement of construction, would for a variety of reasons, and viability comes into this as well, render SDZs unattractive <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other development routes where a lower figure would apply.  There is a concern that it would kill off any new SDZ proposals in the future.</p><p> On the first question about local authorities that do not need social and affordable housing, obviously, we know that an element of it is required everywhere.  The point is that it is simply not viable to build scheme housing in approximately half the counties in the country, or possibly more, although it is not entirely county-specific.  One of the reasons one-off housing is so popular in rural Ireland is because it is a possible route for people to house themselves.  The margins are very fine.  There is a lot of talk about county development plans and the need to be sustainable and provide an element of choice in terms of urban housing.  However, if it is simply not viable to do scheme housing, it is unlikely that we will achieve even the modest 10% target that we have.  That has to be seen as the baseline from which further units can be acquired in the future.  We will not see any of it if we make it even more difficult than it is to deliver housing by means of Part V developments.</p></speech>

It is a housing emergency, with more than 10,000 people officially homeless and a generation that has in large measure been locked out of the housing market.  Every serious analyst, think-tank and commentator, almost without exception, is now arguing that an increase in the supply of social housing is key to dealing with the crisis.</p> <p>  It has been suggested that we need to provide certainty to the market, and so on.  The starting point for me is that we need to provide certainty to people who are being locked out of the market and we need to provide certainty to people on housing waiting lists and who are in homeless emergency accommodation.  I have listened to the points that have been raised about unintended consequences but if we are talking about an evidence base, the first piece of evidence we should have put before the committee is not what might happen if we go down this road but what is happening.</p> <p>  I do not have the statistics to hand and I would like to have them for this discussion.  However, let us take the last three years, 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  What have local authorities and the State received in terms of social housing units on the basis of Part V?  Against the context of a massive housing crisis, what have we got, what is the evidence and what are the numbers?</p></speech>

While we have reservations about the percentages, we have spoken to Deputy &Oacute; Broin on that directly.  However, we are fully behind the thrust of changing Part V back to a minimum of 20%, which will include affordable homes.  We have not delivered on affordable homes for a long time and there is currently no affordable scheme.  Affordability is a key issue for us.</p> <p>  Ms Timmons stated that people bought the land and that they need certainty.  I do not buy that at all.  In the context of county development plans, the Department had no problem completely dezoning land that had been bought.  The Department has dezoned land wholesale and it did not cost it a thought to do so.  I do not think the fact that somebody has bought land should be a concern of the Department regarding Part V and I do not understand that logic.  In the context of Wicklow specifically, most developers are selling nearly 100% of their developments to the Department for social housing in any case.  Why is there suddenly an issue and why should increasing it by 10% or 15% be a concern to the developer, who has already bought the land, when it did not concern the Department in previous years, when it was dezoning land or changing the criteria for zoning?  That is still ongoing.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that this is an apt time to implement this measure.  We have the national planning framework and the regional plans.  Most counties will have a complete review of their county development plans on the basis of those regional plans.  With that in mind, this is the ideal opportunity.  I sometimes wonder whether we should look at all developments and state that a percentage should be build to rent, a percentage should be affordable, a percentage should be for first-time buyers and a percentage should be for social housing.  Is that something we need to do?  Should it be policy that all aspects of housing need are met with the planning application?  Those are a few points to consider.  On the question of unintended consequences for a developer, I do not buy that at all.  Ms Timmons stated that they bought land.  That is not a reason not to look at this as a logical policy.</p></speech>

To reassure them, I take all of the points very seriously and I appreciate the time they have taken to consider them.  I agree with them that we need an evidence base and we need to be mindful of unintended consequences, so I am not disregarding either of those points.  I have read the 2012 DMK report which underpinned the review of Part V in 2013 and 2014 and I did not see any evidence in that to support the reduction.  There were assumptions, assessments and opinions, and, obviously, in the following five years, it did not lead to any immediate response from the market.  Of course, it was never going to lead to any immediate response from the market in terms of increasing Part V because of where the construction sector was at that stage.  Nonetheless, given the fact the reduction was not evidence-based, it is reasonable for us to argue that whether it is returned to 20%, 25% or 30% is something that should be explored.</p> <p>  Some of the language used by Mr. Hogan and Ms Timmons is interesting.  For example, Ms Timmons stated that what is proposed would "choke supply".  That is a pretty significant statement.  What evidence does she have that makes her believe it would choke supply?  In what was probably an even more extreme comment, Mr. Hogan said it would "kill off" SDZs.  Obviously, I would like to believe that and, as that is what he said at the committee, I will take it at face value.  One of the big criticisms of the Docklands SDZ is that there was virtually no social or affordable housing in real terms.  One of the things we have seen with Poolbeg is a real desire on the part of residents and the vast majority of the elected members of Dublin City Council to have affordability.  In fact, even the Ministers - the previous incumbent, Deputy Coveney, and the current one, Deputy Eoghan Murphy - wanted to have that 30%.  SDZs are of such huge importance because they are always in key locations.  One of the constant challenges in those key locations is, of course, affordability, given their proximity to economic opportunities, public transport hubs and so on.  It is actually because of their strategic nature that a higher percentage is needed.  Again, I am willing to work with committee members to respond to that.</p> <p>  Our biggest challenge is the undersupply of affordable housing.  All of the information we have from the Department and the local authorities is that there is not going to be a significant supply of affordable housing through the serviced sites fund or LIHAF for four to five years, and they are asking us to wait until we reach 30,000 to 35,000 total completions, and then review it.  The difficulty is that, by that time, we will have produced so many unaffordable private sector units that the affordable housing crisis will have got worse or, at least, remained static.  There is still a compelling argument to do this.  Do I genuinely think that by introducing this we are going to delay output?  I genuinely do not, and I have yet to see any evidence for it.  However, if the witnesses have any evidence, I would be more than happy to consider it and to reconsider my position.</p></speech>

However, there is quite a circular argument going on in that, with regard to the proposals made, we are told we should provide the evidence that they are not true.</p><p>It is quite difficult for us to be asked to prove the negative.  We should be shown evidence that it would work, but none is being put before us and so we cannot consider it.  That is a difficulty.  It is also an issue to say that if there was no evidence to reduce it, which we did the last time, we do not therefore need evidence this time.  With the greatest respect, that is a difficult argument to accept.</p><p> We cannot say that we should just go back to the way we were without evidence to show that it will not have unintended consequences.  I am not saying that that would justify it, but it could; it is a foreseeable possibility and we should have evidence to show that we are reasonably certain it will not.  We need a decent economic analysis to show the reason it will not.  The man in the street will know that if the game changes, the financial model changes and one will have to go back to one's bank, or to one's financiers, to say that the land or units have to be sold back to the local authority at a particular price.  That is reasonable to assume.  To say that that is not reasonable to assume, it has to be demonstrated why that is not the case.</p><p> It has been said that local authorities are acquiring in some areas, and that is absolutely right.  Local authorities have the flexibility to do that.  In a given area, if they want to acquire units, they now have the flexibility to do that.  That is the beauty of the system.  However, if it is stated that they "must" acquire a given area, as this legislation does, all flexibility is removed from the local authority to decide that there is enough social housing in an area.</p><p> The Department has looked at the research that was raised which states that 10% is enough, but that 10% is not separate from everything else.  All these places are connected to other places.  Local authorities have to look at the percentage in the broader area.  Looking at one development is not a fine-grained assessment of the situation; the percentage around the development has to be looked at.  To simply say that we should not care about what is around it and have 25%, regardless of what is needed, means that local authorities will have to spend a significant amount of money, perhaps in areas where the units are quite expensive, where it might not agree that it should.  All flexibility to make the decision is removed.</p><p> It also means less flexibility in decision-making for a developer.  It is important that developers are able to say to local authorities what would assist them in their model.  If it works for everybody, that is wonderful, but developers should also be able to say that if they do this, they cannot supply the units because it does not work under their financial model.  That has to be taken into account.  We have to understand that it might not always work for a developer, but if it does, that is great.</p><p> I hope I have addressed logically the points being made.</p></speech>

However, there has to be an element of voluntary motivation to act here.  There is an assumption that developers and landowners will act rationally.  If there is a significant differential for those areas of land, there is a disincentive to act to secure the designation to develop such an area and pursue the objectives of an SDZ.  The likelihood is that this will eliminate one of the key advantages.</p></speech>

The information is available on the statistics page of the Department's website, which lists all the units delivered from 2002 to 2018.  In 2016, 36 units were acquired under Part 5; in 2017, it was 522 units; and in 2018, it was 841 units.  We can provide members of the committee with a copy of that information but it is available on the website, where it is broken down by levels of affordable housing and by local authority and by voluntary and co-operatives.  It goes into those numbers, which is useful.  It shows that the output went down severely over the years.  There was a total of about 9,000 since that provision came in.  The output went up significantly up to 2009 and then there was a severe drop off, right back to 36 units in 2016, which is the lowest we have had.  We have not seen Part 5 spike it up.  The 10% figure is there, but it has not got back to the level at which we need it to be.  I hope that those figures are useful.</p></speech>

We hope the committee's deliberations will result in long overdue action to tackle this pernicious problem, which has detrimental effects on the pilots themselves and wider Irish society.  In addition, reputational damage has been caused to Ireland in many European countries where pilots are based and are subject to bogus self-employment with Irish airlines, resulting in at least two European states initiating investigations on the effects of such types of employment.<br/><br/>I will begin by pointing out that approximately half of pilots operating in Irish-registered airlines are not employed directly by the airline for whom they fly.  That is an extraordinarily high level for such an important, skilled and safety-critical profession which bears little or no comparison to other similar professions.  It is worth pointing out that according to the Ricardo study on working conditions for aircrew which was completed for the European Commission, approximately 18% of European pilots have non-permanent indirect employment status.  In that context, Ireland's rate of contractor pilots is approximately three times that of the European average.  It is also worth mentioning that the Ricardo study found that 93% of self-employment in European aviation is fake.  A 2015 study by Ghent University, Atypical Employment in Aviation, which was also carried out for the EU Commission, showed that young pilots are particularly affected by precarious employment terms, with almost 40% of such young pilots having no direct employment relationship with the operator for whom they fly.  We know from our own experience in Ireland that the vast majority of contractor pilots in Ireland are also relatively young.  In fact, many new pilots entering our profession are effectively forced to become contractors out of necessity rather than choice if they want to become airline pilots.<br/><br/>It is important to point out that while the position of self-employed contractors appears to be legal under Irish law, different pieces of legislation may view the contracts in different ways.  That is a confusing situation that is mirrored in the UK.  The convoluted manner in which their services are contracted has been carefully crafted to appear to meet the requirements of Irish law, but should they prove not to comply with the law, then the pilot will be potentially subject to sanction for a contracting arrangement that was effectively foisted on him or her.<br/><br/>I will explain how the contractor model works.  Under the Irish version of this model, receiving a contract is subject to the pilot becoming a director and shareholder of a pre-existing limited company.  The company will typically have between three and eight other directors, but the pilot will not be told who those directors are even when that information is requested.  The company will not have normal employees other than the directors.  The accountant who manages the billing and expense claims for the contractor pilot is also a director.  The pilot will only be allowed to fly for one airline under this model and the whole arrangement is normally put in place by an intermediary agency.  Such a contracting arrangement can have several consequences: the airline does not have to pay the 10.85% employer PRSI contribution with all the long-term consequences of that for the contractor pilot; the pilot does not enjoy the benefits or protections of employment law rights, for example, access to unfair dismissal legislation, paid maternity and paternity leave and sick leave and other benefits <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the airline to which they supply services; and the pilot's rights to participate in any form of collective bargaining and industrial action are effectively neutralised.</p><p>In effect, the pilot&rsquo;s relationship with the airline whose aircraft she or he operates and whose uniform she or he wears is based solely on contract law.  However, the question as to whether a pilot is or is not a direct employee of the airline is an objective analysis based on a number of factors which will be explored.  <br/><br/>In their guidance on the subject, the Revenue Commissioners list a number of indicators of employee status and the situation regarding contractor pilots is assessed under those Revenue criteria.  As the members will note, all the employee indicators are listed as being true in the table presented.  The Revenue Commissioners also include a number of indicators of contract styles.  Of the 24 factors, 23 of them are listed as being false under the Revenue guidelines.Of the 24 criteria, Irish contractor pilots only meet one of the contractor criteria, and that is on a partial and qualified basis.  They meet 23 of the employee criteria.  Based on this assessment, it is IALPA&rsquo;s view that these contractor pilots are subjected to bogus self-employment and should be deemed to be employees and not self-employed contractors.<br/><br/>We are aware this Revenue guidance is not definitive and there are other factors which need to be taken into account in determining the status of the contractor pilots.  The following factors are important to note.  Mutuality of obligation exists between the pilot and the airline for which they work.  This means there is an expectation or understanding that the airline will provide work and the pilot will perform that work.  It should be noted that the contractor pilot is rostered for work a number of weeks in advance and there is no<b></b>casual element to the contractor pilot&rsquo;s obligation to operate their rostered flights.  The contractor pilots are performing identical work under the same administrative and operational requirements and the same workplace terms and conditions with other individuals who are categorised as employees by the airline.  The pilots are not engaged in independently marketing their services to a number of airlines.  Their companies have no independent public trading identity.  While agreements between the parties might label the pilot as an independent contractor, and whether they are an employee is a question of substance over form, easily tested by reference to the Revenue Commissioners guidelines, as previously outlined.  The contracts are for definite durations, normally three to five years, and are not short, <i>ad hoc</i>or project specific.  It is IALPA&rsquo;s view that any objective review of the contracts will show them to be unconscionable and one-sided. <br/><br/>It is conceivable that certain pilots may be properly considered contractors, for example, test or training pilots who sell their services to a number of airlines generally and operate on short-term or specific purpose contracts.  Experience indicates that the number of pilots operating in this way is very limited and is entirely out of the intention and design of these pilots in question.  However, based on the assessment of the Revenue criteria and the other factors that have to be taken into account, it may be generally said that ordinary pilots should be considered to be employees of the airline for which they work and not genuine contractors engaged as such on a voluntary basis.  The  working lives of contractor pilots subject to bogus self-employment arrangements do not vary in any meaningful detail from their employee pilot colleagues.<br/><br/><b></b>In terms of European interest, in 2011, a German prosecutor asked the British authorities to search the UK premises of a company that provides pilot services to an Irish airline.  The prosecutor alleged the company in question was in breach of tax and social security law.  The prosecutor pointed out that all work sequences for the pilot, including their uniforms, were specified by the airline.  The airline in question determines which flights the pilot has to make and when, scheduling those flights weeks in advance.  The contract concluded between the company in question and the pilots includes provisions that the pilots are bound to comply with specifications by the airline. <br/><br/>A pilot witness stated he was recruited by the airline and received an offer for employment from it once he had obtained the required aircraft type licences.  After obtaining this licence, the witness was further trained by the airline to comply with its procedures and standards.  Only afterwards was he referred to the agency in question by the airline and this agency finalised the contract formalities by email.  The pilot witness never saw any office of the agency that completed the contract formalities. <br/><br/>The German prosecutor stated that the agency in question was responsible for processing the monthly work performance for approximately 1,600 ostensibly self-employed pilots with the airline, through 300 Irish companies which had the legal form of a limited company.  These companies were administered by accountancy firms specified on a list of acceptable accountants that the pilots could engage with for the purpose of complying with the contract requirements.  According to the German prosecutor, these companies may only serve to conceal an employment relationship with the airline. <br/><br/>The UK&rsquo;s tax authorities, HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, HMRC, conducted a separate inquiry into the status of contractor pilots for tax purposes which led to a &pound;47 million protective assessment against a UK based agency engaging pilots.  However, individual pilots are also being subjected to HMRC scrutiny and find themselves having to explain a complex contrived structure which was not of their making.<br/><br/><b></b>In terms of the impact on pilots, for the pilots engaged as contractors, their status has a number of practical implications for them.  The airlines are not bound by all normal employer obligations to these pilots - for example, for paid maternity and paternity leave &ndash; through this mechanism.  The rights of contractor pilots to participate in any form of collective bargaining on pay and conditions, as well as their rights to take industrial action in the event of a dispute, are effectively neutralised. <br/><br/>From the pilot&rsquo;s perspective this device of being a contractor or an employee of his or her own company is a difficult place to be, as it flies in the face of accepted Revenue custom and practice in most other sectors of employment.  The arrangement causes difficulties for many pilots based outside Ireland as local revenue and social authorities have difficulties comprehending these intricate structures and there is no local equivalence of these types of arrangements.  In addition, we are aware of contractor pilots who experience great difficulties in getting mortgages to buy a house or secure bank loans because of the uncertainty of their positions.  As a final observation, the majority of the pilots subjected to these Irish arrangements are not Irish nationals, do not speak English as their native language and do not live or work in Ireland. <br/><br/><b></b>With respect to possible safety implications, the 2015 University of Ghent study on Atypical Employment in Aviation stated that such employment practices raise potentially serious concerns about the safety of the industry as the way that pilots are employed can have repercussions on safety decision making in the cockpit.  According to the University of Ghent, nearly half of self-employed pilots struggle to amend instructions of the airline based on their own safety or liability objections, so atypical employment can have an influence on the independent decision making process and safety choices made by crews during or before flights. <br/><br/>Similar conclusions were reached by a 2016 London School of Economics study on safety culture, involving 7,000 European pilots.  Its survey found that atypical employees are: less encouraged to voice safety concerns; feel more obliged to take uncomfortable risks; less confident on fair treatment of the safety reporter; less satisfied with the confidentiality of reporting and investigation; less involved in safety activities; feel more inclined to go to work when sick; more often tired at work; and less confident to file fatigue reports. <br/><br/>The safety culture that exists in any airline is moulded and sustained by a positive relationship between management and operational employees.  It is obvious that a normal direct employer-employee relationship is the most conducive relationship to the existence of a good safety culture. <br/><br/>With respect to losses to the State, in addition to the impact on the pilots and possible safety implications, the fact that in the region of 2,000 Irish registered pilots are working as contractors means that the State loses out on the 10.85% employers&rsquo; PRSI on those pilots&rsquo; salaries.  Based on data published by the Department of Finance and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in 2018, the use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements and implications for social insurance and tax revenues, IALPA conservatively estimates that this could cost the State around &euro;15 to &euro;16 million per year on an ongoing basis, a not insignificant sum. <br/><br/>In terms of more rigour from Revenue and social protection, the Revenue Commissioners are ordinarily extremely vigilant in policing the practice of a person acting as a contractor whereby they provide their entire services to a single client company-customer.  In all such cases this is deemed to be an employer-employee direct relationship, and as such, there must be a PAYE employee relationship established and sustained.  <br/><br/>It is IALPA&rsquo;s view that the Irish Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection need to approach their investigations into the status of Irish airlines&rsquo; contractor pilots with the same focus and intensity as the authorities in Germany and the UK.</p><p>As I pointed out earlier, the convoluted manner in which "contractor" pilots' services are availed of by Irish airlines has been designed in such a way as to appear to be in line with the requirements of Irish law.  IALPA questions that assumption.  We need legislative change to ensure that this practice cannot continue.  These changes should be based on a presumption that all workers are employees unless the opposite is proven; putting the burden of proof on the employer, not the employee; and ensuring that such arrangements are not imposed on any worker through duress or threat of contract refusal.  The status of the contracting arrangements should be analysed independently of the individual worker.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.1040" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019062000002#D00300"><p>On behalf of Unite the Union I thank the committee for the invitation to make a submission regarding bogus self-employment.  I am a regional officer with Unite with particular responsibility for construction.  I am accompanied today by Colette Godkin, secretary of Unite&rsquo;s English language teachers branch, and Rob Kelly, acting team leader in Unite&rsquo;s organising department, which has a role across all sectors of the economy.</p> <p>  It is by definition difficult to quantify the number of people who are falsely self-employed throughout the economy.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, some 224,100 people were classified as self-employed with no employees.  While many would be genuinely self-employed, it is Unite&rsquo;s view that many are not.  We believe, for example, that the high level of self-employment in construction actually reflects a high level of bogus self-employment.  This is borne out by Unite&rsquo;s experience on the ground in the construction sector.  In November of last year, the assistant secretary of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, when asked about the outcomes of employer reviews and inspections, told this committee that her Department does not keep an "absolute record" of bogus self-employment and has not kept such statistics.</p> <p>  Unite is a general workers' union representing members throughout the economy, including thousands of general operatives and craft grade members working in the construction sector where bogus self-employment is especially prevalent.  However, it should be noted that our officers, organisers and shop stewards also encounter bogus self-employment in areas as diverse as English language teaching and archaeology.  An archaeologist may, for example, be instructed to arrive at a site at a particular time; instructed what work must be carried out and the manner in which it must be carried out; instructed when they may take a break; instructed when work can finish; and provided with tools by the employer.  She or he may be working for an employer-defined hourly rate of pay, with an employer-defined timescale for how long that work will take.  To all intents and purposes she or he is employed, working under the control and direction of the employer, unable to dispose of his or her time and unable to take up other work.  However, unlike regular employees, they have no entitlement to sick pay, paid annual leave, parental or family leave.</p> <p>  Since the employer does not pay social insurance contributions, let alone occupational pension contributions, the impact of bogus self-employment follows a worker into retirement.  Nor do bogus self-employed workers enjoy a range of statutory protections, including but not limited to minimum wage laws, protections against unfair dismissal, and working time laws.  This is the experience of thousands of workers in all sectors of the Irish economy today.  Bogus self-employment is part of the larger phenomenon of precariousness, a phenomenon which will inevitably increase with the growth of the so-called gig economy or platform economy.  Bogus self-employment is not only about employers or contractors seeking to avoid social insurance payments, although that is a contributing factor.  It is also a tool used by employers to maximise flexibility in the utilisation of inputs, putting labour on a par with parts, tools, equipment and materials.  It also seeks to undermine solidarity, since the worker is no longer part of a workforce, but instead an atomised individual provider of labour, and is used as part of an aggressive union-avoidance policy.  Addressing this committee in February, Professor Michael Doherty of Maynooth University pointed out that, in the case of non-employees, "independent undertakings are generally forbidden from coming to mutual arrangements over basic terms such as minimum payments, as they would likely contravene competition laws", and he concluded that: "It is very difficult for non-employees to engage in effective collective bargaining."  This is bad for the economy as a whole, and for the construction sector in particular, since all the available evidence indicates strong links between collective bargaining rights and economic progress.</p> <p>  The highly fragmented nature of the Irish construction sector helps facilitate bogus self-employment.  This gives rise to tiers of sub-contracting, or a sub-contracting cascade, with the worker at the bottom of the cascade several removes away from the principal contractor.  This inevitably leads to an erosion of terms and conditions of employment, and means that statutory obligations relating to taxation and social insurance in particular are not met.  The CSO Labour Force Survey shows that in the fourth quarter of 2018 the percentage of people classified as self-employed with no employees in construction was just over 22%.  This compares to 7% in the rest of the market economy.  The number classified as self-employed without employees in construction registered a year-on-year increase of 600.  In 2018, there were 33,000 self-employed with no employees in the sector, an increase from 21,700 in 2012.</p> <p>  We may assume that the high level of self-employment in construction actually reflects a high level of bogus self-employment.  As a percentage of total sectoral employment, however, in 2018 the proportion of self-employed with no employees had fallen slightly since 2012.  This only reflects an increase in overall employment in the sector.  The 2016 Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, report on bogus self-employment in the Irish construction industry suggests that it may be appropriate to assume that 25% of all self-employed without employees in the construction industry are bogus self-employed.  It is Unite&rsquo;s view, based on experience, that this could be a conservative estimate.</p> <p>  In respect of English language teaching, ELT, Unite is currently aware of language schools in Dublin coercing workers into bogus self-employment contracts.  We are also aware that two of these schools are fully accredited and are on the interim list of education providers.  Unite believes that if not addressed, bogus self-employment will continue to spread more widely through the ELT sector and will be normalised.  We have come to this view based on the fact that, like construction, the English language teaching sector is characterised by its transient nature.  Bogus self-employment is just one aspect of precarious employment in the sector &ndash; a sector which the Government plans to grow to a value of &euro;2.1 billion by next year.  If teachers are to share in the benefits of that growth, precarious working practices in the sector must be addressed. </p> <p>  I spoke earlier about the impact of bogus self-employment on the individual worker, an impact that follows them throughout their working life and beyond into retirement.  There is also a significant cost to the Exchequer, which means a cost to us all.  By definition, it is as difficult to put definite figures on this cost as it is to definitively quantify the numbers who are falsely self-employed.  The loss to the Social Insurance Fund due to non-payment of employers PRSI is likely to run into the hundreds of millions of euro across all sectors.  This point was detailed and developed in a recent presentation made to this committee by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which referenced the joint report published by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Finance entitled The use of intermediary-type structures and self-employment arrangements: Implications for Social Insurance and Tax Revenues.  IALPA has already referred to the report this morning.  There is also a loss of spending power in the economy due to loss of benefits arising from self-employment.  While this will be marginally mitigated by the new regulations governing access by the self-employed to jobseeker's benefit, which are due to come into force in November, we believe the overall gain to workers will be negligible.</p> <p>  There is no single measure which will remedy either the wider issues regarding precariousness or the specific issue of bogus self-employment in construction and other sectors.  Unite argues that consideration should be given to a package of measures.  First and foremost, the burden of proof needs to be switched so that an employer can show that a worker is not in an employment relationship.  In respect of the construction sector, all contracts for labour should automatically be assumed to be a contract for employment under Schedule E, and the principal contractor should be responsible for the payment of social insurance and compliance with all relevant terms and conditions attached to Schedule E employment.  The first contractor must be made the agent of responsibility.  This would create a clear line of accountability in terms of social protection, health and safety and taxation.  At the same time, the Government must establish a uniform framework that defines the distinction between employment and self-employment.  Currently, there are different distinctions made by different agencies on the same case.  For instance, Revenue may determine someone as self-employed for tax purposes, while the Department of Social Protection can determine that the same person is employed for purposes of social protection.  It is Unite&rsquo;s view that legislation is required to remove this ambiguity and ensure clarity.</p> <p>  Unite also argues that the State should use its considerable purchasing power as the source of public procurement contracts to disincentivise bogus self-employment and other types of precarious working.  We need to strengthen the policing and contractual provisions of public procurement contracts to prevent abuses.  There must be provision for the contracting department or public agency to levy penalties on any contractor or company found to be engaged in bogus self-employment, with bond or retention moneys from projects exposed to such penalties and the contractor in question to be barred from bidding for future public procurement contracts.</p><p>In the case of any company operating subject to a licence, permit or similar approval, such approval must be contingent on not engaging in bogus self-employment or other precarious work practices.  This would mean that, in the case of English language schools, schools found to engage in such practices would be removed from the interim list of education providers, ILEP.<br/><br/>Unite argues that the above proposals constitute a win-win-win for workers, for the Exchequer and for compliant employers who may currently be at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>those who would use bogus self-employment and super-exploitation to give them a competitive edge in the market.  I would like to thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  We are happy to take any questions. </p></speech>

I will take questions from a number of colleagues, pool them and then revert to the witnesses who should feel free to respond to them.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify one point with Mr. Cullen before I hand over to members.  Mr. Cullen set out very clearly and in great detail the structure.  Has the issue been tested by Revenue or the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection?  Have they looked at the particular scenario that he has outlined, have they tested it and adjudicated on it?</p></speech>

I cannot remember exactly whether the pilot services company had five or eight pilot directors, but one of those directors has since left that company and is now directly employed by another airline.  That pilot has taken a case for his social welfare entitlements.  The other directors of that company do not even know that the company is participating in this legal process and has hired a senior counsel.  They do not know about the arguments that are being made and have no idea about the case that is ongoing.  They will not raise their heads because they will lose their jobs where they are operating at present.</p></speech>

A number of points that Captain Cullen made stick out.  In his presentation he states that only about half of pilots operating in Irish registered airlines are employed directly by those airlines and that the rate of so-called self-employment among pilots here is three times the European average.  Why is that the case?</p><p>In regard to safety, I am absolutely stunned by what he has said about safety implications.  I will keep to my usual practice and stay at home for my holidays this year again.  In his opening statement, he states:</p><blockquote>According to the University of Ghent, nearly half of self-employed pilots struggle to amend instructions of the airline based on their own safety or liability objections &ndash; so atypical employment can have an influence on the independent decision-making process and safety choices made by crews during or before flights. </blockquote> <p>Will he elaborate on that point?</p><p>The Chairman asked about IALPA's approach to the Revenue Commissioners and to the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  I think that what is happening in respect of the association's difficulties with scope raises questions as to whether there is any interest in enforcing what we all understand to be the law of the land?</p><p>In his opening statement Captain Cullen points out the criteria set out by the Revenue Commissioners and demonstrates very clearly that these criteria point almost exclusively in one direction, to employee rather than self-employed.  Has there been any discussion with the Revenue Commissioners about this?  How can the Revenue Commissioners stand over a situation whereby their criteria are being so clearly ignored?  </p><p>I want to raise the structure of these companies.  Apparently companies are set up, where the people who are being appointed as directors of the company do not know the other directors.  My understanding is that under company law there has to be a board meeting at least once a year, there has to be an AGM.  This seems to be driving a coach and four through company law.  Has anybody even attempted to enforce the law of the land in this regard?  It beggars belief.</p><p>I want to thank Unite the Union for its presentation.  Most of what the union is saying is not news to me because I have said it repeatedly.  I put forward legislation to deal with this situation which has disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle, like much of the legislation being put forward by the Opposition.</p><p>Unite the Union certainly justifies what I have been trying to argue on the figures.  The figures would strongly indicate that this is a growing phenomenon.  We have raised this and other issues with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and asked questions in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister is trying to argue that the phenomenon is reducing.  All the anecdotal evidence in my constituency and further afield is that it is a growing phenomenon and that as a result of the development of the gig economy, it will grow further.  I thank the union for producing the figures which will be useful ammunition when we get to debate this subject in the future.</p><p>I note also the State seems to be a willing participant in this scandal.  The State should use its purchasing power.  When the State employs a contractor to build an extension to a school, to repair a school or to build a school, a price is agreed and the State has no further involvement.  It does not care what the contractors are doing or how many are bogus self-employed.  The State acts as if it is a completely independent player and has no involvement whatsoever.</p><p>The witness has cited the case of the two accredited language schools in Dublin, which are forcing teachers who are employed by the schools to pretend for tax, social welfare and employment law purposes that they are self-employed.  That is outrageous.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations which have given us food for thought and extra ammunition in our campaign to do something about this.</p></speech>

This is a continuation of an ongoing process.  We have had witnesses from ICTU and other bodies appear before us.  We have gathered evidence already and the evidence provided by Unite the Union and IALPA backs up all the statistics and the evidence that has been presented.  I think people will be genuinely shocked and surprised by what is going on.</p> <p>  The officials in Revenue and in the Department have looked the other way and this has allowed the facilitation of massive tax fraud in the State.  </p> <p>  The work of this committee will shine a spotlight and bring forward solutions and proposals.  A number of Opposition parties, my own included, have brought forward legislation to deal with the massive issue of bogus self-employment and wholesale tax fraud.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for the representatives from Unite the Union.  The figures the union provided back up all of the statistics we have been given previously.  More than 224,000 people who are classed as self-employed have no employees.  I think it is a conservative estimate that 25% of those people are bogus self-employed.</p> <p>  When an issue is brought to the attention of Unite the Union, irrespective of the area of employment, what is the first course of action?  Has the union brought many cases or helped to bring cases to the scope section of the Department?  What has been the union's experience of that process?  Have many cases have been successful?</p><p>What difficulties for English language teachers have our guests encountered ?  They referred to a serious problem in Dublin.  In my constituency of Wicklow, there is a large number of English language schools, as there are in other major urban areas such as Galway and Cork.  Is it just a Dublin issue or has it raised its head in other areas?  With Brexit coming and plans to expand the area with more than &euro;2 billion, there are significant opportunities for us, notwithstanding the serious concerns that the problem will spread.  Will our guests comment on that?</p><p> On IALPA, Mr. Cullen's statement was alarming, dark and frightening because of the safety concerns.  When I hear the word "safety" used by pilots, it is enough to set off alarm bells.  Will Mr. Cullen elaborate on those safety concerns and on whether they have been raised with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport or the Irish Aviation Authority?  If so, what kind of response was given?  The issue has been investigated in Britain and Germany.  It appears that Irish law is being used by some airlines to set up systems of questionable and precarious self-employment to get around our weak system, despite their being investigated by other countries.  Do all Irish airlines use self-employment contracts?  I refer to the likes of Ryanair and Aer Lingus.  If they do, are breakdowns of the types of contracts available?  Do non-Irish airlines set up in Ireland and use our system as a base and, if so, are there statistics in that regard?  </p><p> Has IALPA spoken to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection about the state of affairs and, if so, what was the response?  Has it reported its concerns to all the relevant authorities?  Has it raised them with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport?  If so, what was the response?  Mr. Cullen referred to young pilots being forced into precarious positions of work.  Are there cases of young pilots leaving, or starting training, being forced out and not completing their course because of the arrangements?  Why is Ireland's rate of self-employment for pilots three times higher than the European average?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.1048" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1398" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019062000002#F00200"><p>It is startling, albeit not surprising for people such as me who have focused on the issue for some time, that there are such high numbers of contractor pilots in the country.  People might assume that most of the contractor pilots, who are engaged through arcane and Byzantine intermediary structures to conceal their employment status, are not necessarily from airlines that are household names in this country or those that are strongly associated with the country.  Will Mr. Cullen elaborate on why he believes that airlines globally use Ireland as a base for their registration?  Does he believe they do so to take advantage of the weakness of our employment protection and tax laws?  It is nothing short of an utter scandal.  It does not just deprive airline pilots and other individuals who should be deemed as direct employees.  As well as ripping them off, it rips off the taxpayer and the Social Insurance Fund.  Mr. Cullen cited a stark figure when he conservatively estimated a loss of between &euro;15 million and &euro;16 million per year to the Exchequer and the Social Insurance Fund arising from the misclassification of the employment status of airline pilots.  That sum would cover the pay claim of SIPTU-represented healthcare support staff.  Although a strike has been deferred today, the claim is for the same amount.  That puts the matter into a human context and allows one to understand the impact and consequences.  It is not a victimless crime.  The taxpayer and citizens are being ripped off by the enabling of such dodgy and dubious practices.</p> <p>  Contracted pilots display all the characteristics of an employee but have receive none of the benefits and are deprived of their employment rights, their employment status and all that flows from that.  Where any worker has a concern about his or her employment status, he or she should, as reflected under Irish law, bring that concern to the Revenue Commissioners and the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to have a determination on the insurability of his or her employment.  Mr. Cullen made very clear the difficulties that at least one Irish airline pilot has had in seeking a determination from the scope section and the battery of lawyers the pilot has faced in the pursuit of the vindication of his rights.  Deputy O'Dea referred to the arcane, complex structure, where pilots cannot identify the other directors of the company that has been foisted upon them to enable them to have a job with an airline.  It is bizarre and unacceptable and it is done purely to conceal someone's employment status and deprive the State of revenue, taxation and social insurance owed to it.</p> <p>  Have any Irish accountancy firms, or lawyers or legal firms, been held to account for such practices?  They are essentially tax avoidance schemes.  Have they been held to account by the Irish courts, the Revenue Commissioners or their own professional bodies?  I am concerned by the treatment of female pilots.  For the safety of expectant mothers and babies, there are periods when they are not permitted to fly.  I hope that directly employed female pilots are entitled to maternity leave for their own safety, that of their child and the vindication of their rights.  Self-employed pilots are in a different position.  Will Mr. Cullen outline the difficulties that some female pilots have faced, in his experience?  I refer to those who are indirectly employed and caught up in the arrangements that have been discussed.  What kind of experiences have they had?  I have been alerted by union activists to some horrific examples of the mistreatment of female pilots in pregnancy when they are caught up in indirect employment.  </p> <p>  I welcome our colleagues from Unite.  Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Kelly and Ms Godkin have vast experience dealing with the phenomenon of bogus self-employment in a number of sectors.</p><p>It is the most insidious form of precarious work because the workers are entitled to nothing.  They have no benefits or social protection and are deprived of other employment rights and the vindication thereof.</p><p> Mr. Fitzgerald made an interesting point regarding the urgent requirement to insert key definitions of what constitutes employment and self-employment into primary law.  I sought to do so through my Protection of Employment (Measures to Counter False Self-Employment) Bill 2018 which was frustrated and, ultimately, defeated on Committee Stage in the Seanad a few months ago.  We can do all of the tinkering we wish with codes of practice and regulations, but, ultimately, the future of this phenomenon and the thousands of Irish workers caught in bogus self-employment relationships turns on the need to introduce into law very clear definitions of what constitutes employment and self-employment.  If that is not done, this phenomenon will continue to grow and get out of hand.</p></speech>

I will be brief.</p> <p>  As was stated, the importance of definitions of what constitutes an employee and a self-employed person has become clear.  I wish to commend Senator Nash, who made a very good attempt to set those definitions.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to comment on what seems to be the inadequacy of the case-by-case approach.  Although it is important that test cases are being taken, we have seen that all that is needed for a case to be dropped is for the person involved to pull back or a new form of employment to be found for him or her.  The scope section and Revenue looking at this matter on a case-by-case basis does not deal with the sectoral issues.  I ask the delegates to address the sectoral investigations which they consider should appropriately be undertaken.  I note with interest the point made in one of the presentations regarding the extent to which the European Union and its institutions are interested in the failures of our system.  There is pressure from a European level regarding having a definition for an employee.</p> <p>  I am shocked that a person could be a director of a company and not aware of its other directors.  It is not just a question of flouting company law, as pointed out by Deputy O'Dea.  It seems to be an extraordinarily unusual situation.  Mr. Cullen mentioned that in the case of the contractor models to which he referred, the accountant is also a director and the company has a recommended list of acceptable accountants.  While I acknowledge that Mr. Cullen may not be privy to the interior workings of each company or pseudo-company, could it be the case that an accountant director would be in a completely different and privileged position compared with the other directors as he or she may be aware of them and is in a position whereby he or she benefits from a recommendation by the company?  That is an issue of potential concern in terms of from where the determinations come.</p> <p>  On safety implications, it is very alarming for anybody who flies to hear of safety concerns being flouted in this way.  Does it create any ambiguity in terms of liabilities?  If pilots are working for what are, effectively, pseudo-companies which are separate from the owner of the aeroplane, it seems to create a potentially ambiguous or dangerous situation which would be of significant concern to the wider public.</p> <p>  I wish to congratulate Mr. Fitzgerald and his colleagues from Unite on seeking to support the unionisation of sectors which have been very much neglected.  I spent three years working as an English language teacher before returning to college.  At the time, employment in the sector was insecure, but that insecurity now seems to have been systematised.  Although it is not always the case for those engaged in English language teaching, archaeology or project work, there are mechanisms whereby companies can offer quality short-term or part-time employment.  Although it may not be permanent employment, it allow companies to treat people as employees and recognise their rights pro rata and so forth.  It came across clearly from the testimony of Mr. Cullen and others that career development may be stymied in some cases such that people cannot get to the next rung on the ladder.</p> <p>  On procurement, I brought forward legislation pressing for a price and quality approach to procurement, rather than a price-only approach.  There are certain tools which may be used, such as the exclusion of those who breach laws.  On quality criteria, the party seeking a contractor should seek to be satisfied that the tendering company has permanent employees who will have a consistency of delivery.  That quality measure is of particular importance in State procurement.</p> <p>  The State is giving other benefits to companies which are flouting these laws, as was mentioned, such as recognition on the interim list of education providers and, presumably, in the trade missions undertaken by the State.  Have some of the companies employing these poor practices had the opportunity to participate in or benefit from Irish trade missions?  This is an area of expansion and it is crucial that it be an area of quality employment.</p></speech>

Members should feel free to refer me to any unanswered questions.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Dea, Ireland facilitates these self-employment arrangements to a greater extent than does any other state in western Europe.  It has reached the point that airlines from across Europe set up subsidiaries in Ireland in order to use Irish employment law to create what the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport refers to innovative employment models and which it supports.  In some airlines, less than 5% of pilots are engaged in this manner, whereas in others it is 100%.  Certain airlines employing pilots across Europe do not fly into or out of Ireland, but are Irish airlines subject to regulation under Irish company law and safety criteria.  These airlines are not household names in Ireland.</p> <p>  On how much Ministers and so on know, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, are former Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Taoiseach was also formerly Minister for Social Protection.  We have engaged with each of those Departments over many years and pointed out this situation to them.  I was dismayed to read the transcript of the committee's engagement with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the response of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to questions on bogus self-employment in the D&aacute;il on 4 April.</p><p>We have not engaged with the current Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection but have engaged with previous Ministers and we have had much engagement with officials from that Department.  I am incredibly dismayed by the statements they have made to this committee and the information they are giving to their Minister.  They were well briefed on all this for many years.  What they said was just extraordinary given what they were told.</p><p> On the obligations on these companies to hold AGMs, we know of one lady, who is a solicitor in north County Dublin, who is the company secretary for over 200 of these companies and that UK Revenue has been pursuing her for copies of the minutes of the AGMs of these 200 odd companies.  I note the Revenue Commissioners here do not care about what these companies are doing.  We estimate there are up to 800 of these companies, containing three to eight pilot directors.  As I said, in some of these companies, 100% of the pilots are in this kind of precarious employment.  The State is willing participant this practice.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has used the phrase "innovative employment models".</p><p> On the safety issue, the agencies that are used to direct the work towards these pilots are not covered by the Irish Aviation Authority.  The airline is registered and is in the jurisdiction of an aviation authority and the pilots, as licenceholders, are in the jurisdiction of an aviation authority but the agency, however, is outside any of the laws with regard to aviation regulation.  The airline would justifiably say it is not intimidating its pilots by threatening to cut their work if they do not toe the line on a safety issue as against a commercial issue.  The agency, which is not in the jurisdiction of the Irish Aviation Authority, is free to do what it likes, including disciplining pilots, cutting their hours and so on.</p><p> I briefed the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on the use of personalised fuel league tables.  This is where an airline would rate its pilots against one another on their fuel burn.  It is important to understand that the more fuel one carries, the more fuel one burns.  If an aircraft was to fly from Dublin to New York and was supposed to carry 40 tonnes for that trip, if there were thunderstorms in New York, a pilot might add five tonnes.  He or she will burn one of the five tonnes carrying the other four tonnes.  Fuel is 40% of the operating cost of an airline.  Pilots, in law, determine how much fuel goes on board.  The airlines always look at the fuel burns of pilots.  Some airlines have these personalised fuel league tables, where the pilots are rated against one another.  The pilots at the top would be in the green zone and they get a letter every month saying they are good boys and are in the green zone.  However, the pilots in the bottom 20% are in the red zone on the website and they get a letter saying they need to review their fuel management policy.  I have explained to the Minister in great detail that if one is in precarious employment and on a zero-hour contract and one's hours of work, which are directly related to one's income, are determined by one's employer, and one is in the red zone, what is the motivation for picking fuel up when one needs it?</p><p> Another example of this is that when one is on an approach to a runway in a storm, one should really throw away the approach - we call it doing a missed approach -  because one becomes destabilised by severe gusts of wind.  In such circumstances, one will burn a great amount of fuel.  A standard A320 or 737 will burn two and a half  tonnes of extra fuel just to perform that manoeuvre to come around and try again.  If one is on a fuel league table and a precarious contract, in the back of one's head one is thinking whether one will press ahead with this landing in these conditions, or will one burn the two and a half tonnes and put oneself at the bottom of the fuel league table.</p><p> Another example of where a safety decision comes up against the commercial one is in respect of EU 261, which is the compensation to passengers.  If I am a contractor and I find a defect on the aircraft and I want it fixed, the passengers will be delayed and will require compensation for lunch and possibly an overnight stay in a hotel.  All this is commercial pressure against the safety decision.  A contractor must make this decision.  He or she will get a phone call, and not a text or an email, asking why he or she is delaying the flight and whether he or she realises he or she is wiping out the entire profit for this flight, or for the day in this base, if he or she does not cop on and fly this airplane.  That is how it impacts safety.</p><p> Every EU-funded and commissioned study - the Ghent, the London School of Economics and the Ricardo studies - all said that pilots in these contracts are less likely to report safety concerns.  </p><p> The whole process of Scope is a joke.  It is nothing more than some kind of figleaf to satisfy social partners, or whatever.  It is designed to frustrate and to delay and it is a war of attrition on ordinary people, trying to establish and vindicate their rights.  Nobody in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seems to be interested in amending Scope or taking it seriously.  Our experience of Scope is extremely negative.</p><p> On the back of the German investigations, more than 100 pilots were arrested and charged with criminal prosecution for being in contracts like these Irish ones.  Vereinigung Cockpit, which is our brother airline pilot association in Germany, did a deal with German Revenue where each of these pilots turned state's evidence against these companies.  There was some kind of a settlement because it has all gone away now but the Germans did not let go of it and they are very pleased with the outcome.</p><p> Young pilots are led to believe they joining the airline and that they will participate in it but at the last minute, they are directed into a room where they sign up with the agency and end up being placed into these companies.  They can find out who their fellow directors are through the Companies Registration Office and they have done that.  That is how we have made contact with other directors.  I asked numerous contract pilots to attend here and I asked one to give evidence but, understandably, none has.  They said I must be joking and that they would not attend.</p></speech>

It was absolutely out of fear.</p> <p>  On the high number of contractors, as I said, it is between 5% and 100%.  Globally, Ireland is the base.  If one looks at the European figures, Ireland facilities most of the European figures, with our employment, commercial or company law.  We believe the &euro;15 million to &euro;16 million loss in employers' PRSI is extremely conservative.  What is remarkable is that these companies must use one of a shortlist of accountancy firms, which must be Irish.  The pilot companies must be Irish-registered as must the airline.  There is some arrangement between the shortlist of accountancy firms and the beneficiary of all these arrangements.</p> <p>  I said that I was dismayed by the submissions made to this committee by officials and by the view the Minister took in the D&aacute;il on 4 April.</p> <p>  I am sorry if I have missed a question.</p></speech>

Most of my experience is in the construction sector, so my colleagues will have more to say than I do on the English language teaching issue.  There is a clear overlap in the experience of workers in both those sectors.  In regard to the scope section of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, without meaning any disrespect to any individual, it has been our experience that it is not fit for purpose.  We were involved in a major industrial dispute in 2017 relating to State-funded projects where it was clear as day that a chain of contractors was engaging in bogus self-employment.  Exactly like the experience in the airline industry, we had individuals saying they were directors of a company who had been bounced into that position.  It is very difficult to unravel those types of situations, but we brought clear evidence to the scope section of such practices.  The dispute in which we were involved since 2017 is in the public domain and, almost two years later, the response we have received is that the officials in the section knew those workers were employed and were denied their rights.  The cynic in me finds it hard not to believe there is something at play that is delaying a resolution.  I do not see how difficult it can be to take a set of facts and benchmark them against an individual experience.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea asked about the extent of the problem.  Our experience is exactly the same as that of my colleagues in IALPA in this regard.  We can give numerous examples of such practices if members require them.  The difficulty is that the practice of bogus self-employment, particularly in construction, is a growing phenomenon rather than something that is going the opposite way.  Moreover, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a chain of causation between precariousness in general, precariousness in the construction sector in particular, and the ability of workers who are building homes to buy homes.  Housing affordability is a significant social issue of the day and certainly a link is there to the issue we are discussing.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea also asked about what is happening with schools building projects.  The initiative that was launched some years ago in that area involved a substantial investment of taxpayers' resources.  I visited one school where I met a young worker going onto the site in a pair of runners who told me he had never been on a building site before.  He had received a text asking him to come to fit gas pipes in the school.  Wearing runners on a building site was detrimental to his own safety, but there was the further concern that despite having no experience, he was fitting gas pipes in a primary school.  That is the type of thing we are hearing about on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>  Deputy Brady asked what we do when we learn about these sorts of practices.  We try, in the first instance, to resolve the situation.  That involves doing all sorts of stuff and trying to get over being demonised for doing so by various parties.  We only move to engaging with the State as a last resort, not the default position.  One is in the mire if one is relying on the State apparatus to advance these types of situations.</p> <p>  Senator Nash referred to the need for definitions.  The issues relating to bogus self-employment have been well ventilated in this committee, including in discussions with Professor Michael Doherty of NUI Maynooth and Ms Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We do need clear definitions, but we are often told by politicians that there is a difficulty in that regard.  What we really need at this stage is outcomes.  Any report or subsequent legislation that might flow from the work of this committee needs to be very clear in its capacity to arm the people who are trying to stop the practices described by Unite and by our colleagues in IALPA.  I am happy to hear that Deputy O'Dea feels armed with the information we are giving him to look to making real changes.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked about sectoral measures that might be adopted.  There certainly are tools that can be used in the case of procurement, for example.  This is taxpayers' money we are talking about, and we want a situation where workers are properly paid because that will give a dividend by way of taxes returned.  It is a positive circle that will also produce better outcomes for State-funded projects such as schools and hospitals.  We know that bogus self-employment is a feature of the national children's hospital construction project.  In fact, the Irish Congress of Trade Union's construction industry committee is being forced to stage a protest next week at the hospital site to register our concerns.  Migrant workers on that project are being forced into bogus self-employment, placed on C45 tax and coerced into being contractors and, in some instances, directors.  They do not speak the language, never mind anything else, and there is little they can do.  Our experience is that buildings sites can sometimes feel like a war zone for workers, with significant dangers, including the danger of death.  The State apparatus is not equipped to allow us to tackle that, despite the best efforts of many people within the political system.  We can give specific examples if it would help the committee.  The challenges are significant but given the purchasing power the State has, they are easily overcome.  To my mind, it is a question of there being the will to do so.</p></speech>

It is difficult for us to determine the extent, partly because it is a newly unionised sector, so we have to approach people individually and ask about the situation in their school.  One issue we keep encountering is the fear on the part of employees of speaking up.  It is a sector that has a long-standing culture of employment abuses and the position of workers is very precarious.  It is quite common, for instance, for people to be told on a Friday that there is no work for them the following Monday.  It is difficult for people to speak up for their rights because they are afraid of losing their job.  We have determined with certainty that there are two quite large language schools in Dublin engaging in bogus self-employment, and I heard this week of two more that are doing the same.  There is also a temping agency, which provides cover teachers, engaging in the practice.</p></speech>

First, we only received some of this information very recently and, second, it is difficult to get the teachers to put their names forward to challenge it.  As we see again and again in cases of employment abuse, workers in precarious employment are the most vulnerable.  If we say to people that what is being done to them is against the law and can be challenged, there is a genuine fear that if their employer finds out they are challenging it, they will not be there next week.</p></speech>

Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the situation at Kishoge community college.  It took two years to get a response in that case from the scope section, at which point the main contractor, who was deemed to be the employer of the workers concerned, challenged it in the High Court.  The matter is somewhere in abeyance and has not been resolved.  We would not recommend for English language teachers to take any case to the scope section because it is not fit for purpose.  There are more television licence inspectors in the country than there are officials working in the section, which is something that must be addressed.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullen spoke about cases in the airline industry where shelf companies have been set up and people are being forced into being directors of them.  That is something we are seeing spread into the construction sector.  For example, we have had many cases recently of crane operators who were coerced into becoming company directors.  It is a similar structure to that which is used where accountants are made to be directors.  My cynical assessment of the situation is that where there are ways and means of making more money and increasing profits, some companies will use them time and again, to the detriment of workers.</p><p>There was a very sad case recently on a building site just down the road from Leinster House, where one of our members had been working on PAYE on a contract for a major project in Cardiff Lane.  Only weeks before an accident on that site, which resulted in him losing his left leg from the knee down, he had been coerced into becoming self-employed through another shelf company.  Therefore, he lost out on a substantial amount of sick pay from the construction workers pension scheme, which is an entitlement under the sectoral employment order for employees.  This is having a massive effect on workers in the industry.  It is up to the committee members to influence that change, if they can.</p></speech>

An interesting point is that the German and British authorities are much keener to track down bogus self-employment and will do things like co-operate with each other, take people to court and so on.  This is because the social insurance contribution of an employer in Europe is much higher than it is in Ireland.  We have one of the lowest contributions and, therefore, our Government can turn a blind eye.  The former Minister for Social Protection, before he became Taoiseach on the back of his &ldquo;Welfare cheats cheat us all&rdquo; slogan, when he was going after the low hanging fruit, could have gone after companies that actually cheat us all and practices that actually do us down, given a huge amount of revenue is forgone through bogus self-employment practices.  The witnesses today have shown that very clearly and very well.</p> <p>  I would like the Unite representatives to tell us if they have the names of the contractors or providers of labour at both the national children's hospital and some of the schools they mentioned that were part of the expenditure of public money where these employment practices are happening.</p> <p>  I would also ask Ms Godkin about the English language teaching, ELT, situation.  All of us would be familiar with people in this position because we have met them and they have given presentations and have been outside the D&aacute;il.  There is an intention by the State to invest something like &euro;2 billion in students and language for the future.  This is very evident in my constituency, where something like 4,000 student accommodation rooms are being built against the will of the local population in Dublin 8, and this is repeated in Dublin 1.  The planning laws are being relaxed and money is being put into this.  Although Unite has referred to legislation, how can we, as a trade union movement, challenge this in some way, rather than it just being seen as a matter for legislation?  Do the witnesses agree that, at some point, either through ICTU or activity between teachers, builders and pilots, some form of action should be taken by those who are victims of these practices to try to put manners on these companies?</p> <p>  I want to go back to my line of questioning with Captain Cullen before the Chair interrupted me.  He said that something like 800 companies are involved in this bogus employment practice.  Are those 800 companies spread out through several airlines or is it all Ryanair?</p></speech>

I asked my colleagues when the current Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection took office, and I asked it for a reason.  I had some research done in May 2017, over two years ago, on bogus self-employment.  In that, the Oireachtas Research and Library Service quoted to me the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection from 27 April.  Was that the current Minister or the previous Minister?  I know the Taoiseach celebrated two years of being Taoiseach.</p></speech>

That was two years ago and two years is quite a long time.  I say that publicly because I want to draw the attention of the current Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the fact that, two years ago, her predecessor said they would not allow this to continue.</p> <p>  We have the case of Global Technical Services, which is public knowledge.  In February 2017, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection wrote to the workers concerned, telling them a decision was made in regard to this company and that it was guilty of bogus self-employment and needed to correct it.  The company never appealed that so the letter stated to the workers that the formal decisions referred should mean the company would engage with them and resolve the situation where they are owed money.  Last week, I got a letter from the employees stating that, over the recent period, Revenue has begun issuing threatening letters from bailiffs and the full weight of the law to recover the workers&rsquo; presumed debts arising from the period of bogus self-employment as certified by the Labour Relations Commission.  The letter states the workers have sought and are still seeking confirmation that their former employer assented to the judgments of the scope section of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, and legally changed their employment status.  It has not done so.  The workers find that Revenue is using threats and warnings against them and they are trying to find solutions to this issue.  They are suffering extreme stress and threats because they were in bogus self-employment and while the Labour Court found they were correct, the employer has done nothing about it.  That is exactly two years ago.</p> <p>  We are facing a disgraceful situation. The evidence today is hugely important and I want to thank those who gave it.</p><p>Beyond legislation, what do Unite and Mr. Cullen think can be done to stop this outrageous practice?</p></speech>

I thank our guests for attending.  Many Opposition Deputies have been raising this issue for a long time.  The shutter has been pulled down.  It is similar to what is done at The Ivy  - the curtains are pulled shut - every time people go in to protest tip theft.  I have met Mr. Cullen before and he said then what he has also explained here.  I felt that IALPA had to come to a public forum such as this in order to be able to make that known.  I hope what he stated will have a substantial impact in the media, especially the point about the position that women have found themselves in because of what is involved here and the way the association has been treated in recent years.  It has been stated that companies have been able to use Ireland as a tax haven.  Accountants here are facilitating such behaviour.  This is a serious matter.  I will not hesitate to push this issue as much as possible in order to try to deal with it.  We should work with our guests in respect of it, rather than having people running off and doing their own thing.</p> <p>  I have been in contact with Martin McMahon.  Many people know his name.  He has met the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss bogus self-employment and has explained what has happened over the past 20 years.  This committee is trying to raise that to a level where it is not all smoke and mirrors and it is not seen as the small figure that we are led to believe by the officials.  It is bigger than that and it is growing, especially among English language teachers.  I have been a trade union activist all my life.  I recall that teachers and pilots had well-paid jobs 20 years ago and that they were respected and had trade union rights.  Pilots were full-time and permanent employees.  Construction workers were directly employed and had reasonably good conditions and pay.  In the past 20 years, under social partnership and the Industrial Relations Act, we have seen a rowing back in respect of workers' rights to the point where it is nearly like 1916, with people going down to the docks to look for work and being afraid to say anything in case they do not get that work.</p> <p>  I hope that this report will have resonance in society and that it will encourage workers to organise and fight back because that is what will have to be done.  When I talked to workers in The Ivy, they were afraid to say anything.  There are frequent audiovisual checks on them.  The company has stooges come in to ask staff questions in order to try to catch them out.  Workers are operating in a very difficult environment.  In an international context, this is what has been happening to pilots in recent years but it has not received the attention it needs and neither has it been addressed.  This committee has to use its authority to try to expose this type of behaviour and, as the Chairman indicated, take action in respect of it prior to the summer recess.</p> <p>  In the context of the impact on pilots and the way in which some of these companies have been set up, how cunning are those involved in terms of how they have thought up ways to make workers vulnerable and deny them the decent pay, maternity rights and sick pay rights to which they are entitled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.1103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019062000002#L00300"><p>I thank our guests for their presentations and for the work that they are doing to tackle this serious and widespread problem.  As Deputy Joan  Collins stated, many questions have already been asked, so I will be brief.  The current line of the Minister when asked about this is to stated that she recognises it is an issue, that there needs to be a whole-of-Government response to it, that it is being worked on and that it should be left in the Government's hands.  How would our guests rate the response of the Government in respect of this issue?  Is it taking it seriously enough?  Has it acted fast enough?  Are the measures it is proposing going to be sufficient in terms of dealing with the issue?</p><p>When one raises this matter with the Government, one often gets an answer along the lines of that which I received from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in 2018 regarding a proposed amendment to the Finance Bill.  The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection gave a similar response in the Seanad at the time.  The Minister for Finance stated:</p><blockquote>If I could anchor the algebra in more prosaic words, it is the view of the Department that, at an aggregate level, the data are not indicative of a significant increase in the prevalence of self-employment in the economy over the past 16 years.</blockquote> <p>The Ministers emphasised that, on the whole, self-employment has not gone up.  Hidden behind that is the idea that bogus self-employment probably has not gone up.  Can our guests speak from what they have experienced on the front line over the past ten to 16 years or so?  Has the incidence of bogus self-employment in the various industries with which they are connected increased and, if so, by how much?  I presume this matter arises in their negotiations and discussions with individual employers and employer groups.  What is the attitude of individual airlines, IBEC and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, to it?</p><p>What Mr. Cullen said is striking and horrifying, particularly if it is accurate.  I take his word for its accuracy.  The idea that any woman would be forced to choose between employment and pregnancy and would be obliged to terminate her pregnancy in order to maintain her employment is horrifying.  Will Mr. Cullen confirm that he knows of cases where women who otherwise would not have had terminations felt that they had no choice but to do so?  I stress that I am pro-choice but, for me, that is both sides of pro-choice, namely, the ability of a woman to choose to have a child - and without this kind of incredible outside influence - or to choose not to do so.  If what Mr. Cullen outlined is accurate, then it is anathema to the concept of pro-choice.</p><p>Mr. Cullen was clear and blunt in stating that Revenue does not care about the situation.  That is probably accurate.  Will Mr. Cullen indicate the basis on which he can so confidently state that Revenue simply does not care?</p></speech>

The attitude of the Government is bizarre.  Some members of the Government state that there should not be bogus self-employment, yet others believe in "innovative employment models" in order to keep costs down and ensure that Ireland remains competitive.  Deputy Paul Murphy described the way that the Minister for Finance answered the question.  It is interesting that the latter is a former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, so while the totality of his answer is probably correct, he would know what is going on in aviation.</p><p>The airlines have told us privately that they are unhappy with this practice but they are being forced to engage in it because there is not a level playing field.  Airlines that carry the full social cost of direct employees will not be able to compete with airlines that engage substantially in this practice.</p><p> I will give a classic example of how the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport operates.  It recently granted a permit to Ethiopian Airlines to operate between Dublin and Madrid.  All of the people who are employed on that aircraft are based in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia with an Ethiopian labour cost base but they are competing directly with workers in Aer Lingus and Ryanair who are on an EU labour cost base.  That the Department has no difficulty with that illustrates its attitude.  There are currently 39 flights a week between Dublin and Madrid being operated by EU airlines.  I have no problem with Ethiopian Airlines flying from Addis Ababa into Dublin and returning to Ethiopia but I have a problem with the company competing with us by flying in the European Union because we have an EU cost base.</p><p> For many years we have brought these issues to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners but they have done nothing.  For this reason, I have concluded that they do not care. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-20a.1107" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019062000002#M00300"><p>I will address some of the specific issues Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith raised, being mindful of parliamentary procedure.  The contractor in Kishogue to whom Mr. Rob Kelly referred was JJ Rhatigan.  It is a matter of public record that the Labour Court awarded workers &euro;100,000 for the underpayment of wages.  It was established that they were employees and that their self-employed status was bogus.  The reason for the cynicism, which is not just related to the nature of our job, is that the former Taoiseach opened a building site for that contractor.  We have established definitively with the State agency for dispute resolution that these workers' self-employed status was bogus, notwithstanding the logjam, whether by accident or design, in the scope section of the Department.  Then we have the former Taoiseach opening a project for the company on the north side of Dublin.</p> <p>  The biggest example of bogus self-employment goes back more than a decade to Gama Construction.  Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas were highly exercised by the levels of exploitation of migrant workers in that company.  All sorts of things went on and at one point, a figure of &euro;100 million owing was exposed.  I do not believe that figure is exaggerated.  Despite this, within two years, the then T&aacute;naiste signed off on a decision to award the contract to build the Castleblayney bypass to Gama Construction.  That is the reason we are cynical, although we are generally positive.</p> <p>  We were asked what can be done.  I will outline what we do traditionally.  We organise and build strong movements to redress the power imbalance between employers and workers.  We do that every day but it should not preclude parliamentarians from taking action to aid and equip us to undertake our task of delivering for citizens in a society, as opposed to what often feels like taxpayers in an economy.  They are not mutually exclusive roles, as I am sure Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith understands.  We will not be found wanting.  It has been very difficult to organise in the English language teaching sector but it is testament to our organisers and, more important, our members that they have been able to weather the inevitable storms.  We have experience which we have shared with our members in order to protect them in those circumstances.</p> <p>  We appreciate the point made by Deputy Joan Collins that this is a serious and significant breach.  We can point to hundreds of millions of euro that are not being paid to the Exchequer.  There are decent contractors and employers who are trying to do the right thing but the structure does not allow for benevolence and decency.  This gives rise to a race to the bottom.  As I said, these practices are linked to workers' inability to secure the basics in life, including homes.</p> <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy directed his questions in the main to Captain Cullen but some of the points overlap.  He asked whether the Government will deal with the issue at this point.  I have just given examples from a period of more than 20 years during which the Government has not done so.  I am a bit pessimistic in that regard but I appreciate the opportunity to appear and listen to the contributions of members on what could be done.</p> <p>  I was asked about the attitude of the CIF and IBEC.  I think they find themselves in a conflict.  They will say a particular contractor is doing everything right and defend the indefensible, as was the case of JJ Rhatigan.  We are far better off having proper schools built by qualified workers who are properly employed.  That is obvious and it is logical but that rationale is undermined by the pursuit of profit.  That is the essence and the system lends itself to the view that profit will undermine what is rational, sensible and in the interests of workers.</p> <p>  From the point of view of Revenue, we specifically pointed out the contradictions between two Departments.  One Department is saying one thing about workers' status, while another is saying something else.  We said the scope section is not fit for purpose.  The reality is that when we interface with the system, things get worse rather than better.  That is an indictment of the system.  We are hopeful, however, that the committee will listen to the evidence we and others have presented and produce recommendations that will make enduring changes for the work we are trying to do on behalf of citizens.</p></speech>

The first is the fear that employees are facing and the second is that the scope section of the Department is not fit for purpose.  As the witnesses will be aware, the Minister has spoken of bringing a memo to Cabinet, increasing inspections and so on.  Without delaying the proceedings, is what the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection proposing to do sufficient to address these issues or is it just a continuation of the same old point?</p></speech>

There is an opportunity right now and the sense of urgency could not be more palpable.  Our group of unions has been forced to organise a protest at the biggest construction project in the State next week.  We would like the Minister to hear that message and ask what can be done to register the sense of urgency this issue needs.</p></speech>

The reason is that the few decent contractors who are trying to do things properly by paying workers' PAYE and pensions contributions, sick pay and so forth are at a distinct competitive disadvantage because other contractors do not pay social contributions, pensions, holiday pay, sick pay and so forth.  If they want to stay in business, decent contractors are being forced to go down that route.  It is a competitive nightmare.</p> <p>  On the attitude of employers, this has now become the structure of the industry.  As Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Joan Collins said, 20 years ago decent contractors employed workers directly and took on apprentices every year to give young workers a trade.  That is no longer the case.  A direct example of that is the national children's hospital.  A decent contractor which did substantial work on and built a new extension to the Mater Hospital was lined up for the children's hospital project.  It has the experience to do this work but because some other contractor came in and cut the legs from underneath it by using certain practices and engaging in tiers of subcontracting, the taxpayer is reaping the results of a project that has escalated into lottery figures.  That is the way the industry is going right now.  We need to close the loopholes that allow companies to engage in some of the practices to which we have referred.</p><p>If we close one legal loophole, employers will find other loopholes so we must close all of them.</p><p> It was extraordinary to hear some of the evidence of Captain Cullen.  Our members, individual workers, are facing the same situation.  A crane operator who sits in a tower crane for 12 hours a day was told by his employer that it would be good for him if the employer set up a company and made the crane operator a director of it.   We raised these issues with employers.  We had a worker who sat down with the Construction Industry Federation to try to negotiate better terms and conditions and health and safety.  Within 24 hours, the worker was blacklisted and ended up out of work for a substantial period.  I managed to find a contractor who was willing to employ him.  He started with the contractor on Monday and that contractor received five phone calls last week from people telling him not to employ this individual.  Two of them are major contractors.  JJ Rhatigan and Company was one of the companies that tried to influence other contractors not to employ workers who are willing to stand up and try to effect change in an industry.</p></speech>

This comes back to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's question on what we could do, as a trade union.  One of the issues in the English language training sector is lack of union recognition and victimisation of union members.  We need to gain union recognition in ELT schools and put an end to the victimisation of members for a couple of reasons.  We need to support our members if they should decide to take a case and pursue the question of whether they are bogus self-employed.  In addition, we have to educate our members because we have found a lack of awareness, particularly among younger teachers, as to how harmful bogus self-employment is to them.  They are not necessarily aware that they are losing out on social welfare, that their status will affect their pension in the future and that they are basically being excluded from unfair dismissals legislation and legislation that protects their parental rights.  As a union, we want to be able to educate our members about this and support them if they want to take cases and pursue the issue.  Union recognition is very important to us to be able to do that.</p> <p>  There is also a legislative avenue for us, specifically in English language teaching.  To be able to accept visa students, which is a significant part of the ELT business, schools need to be on a Department of Justice and Equality list known as the interim list of education providers.  There is a mechanism for the State to determine whether schools are engaging in bogus self-employment.  If a school is engaging in that or other abuses of Irish employment law, it should be removed from that list and lose its accreditation, which would mean it could no longer take in visa students.  That would act as an incentive to schools to stop engaging in this practice and treat their workers properly.</p></speech>

Their opening statements and responses to questions were very informative and helpful.  The committee has had a series of meetings on this topic and is in the process of concluding a report on it.  We hope to produce the report before the summer recess, which is a tight timeframe.  It will make some specific suggestions.  If, following the meeting, there is anything the witnesses feel might be useful to our deliberations, they should feel free to contact us by email or letter in the next week or thereabouts and it will be considered.  Sometimes things occur to witnesses after a meeting.  If there is anything of that nature the witnesses would like to bring to our attention, please do so.  I thank them for their attendance and for the direct manner in which they responded to the questions.</p></speech>
