I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  The proposed format of today's meeting is that the Minister of State will make an opening statement and we will deal with Vote 29 on a programme-by-programme basis.  There are three programmes.  We will consider each of them separately, with questions from members of the committee.</p> <p>  I will read out the note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call the Minister of State to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#C00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to meet with the select committee to discuss the 2022 Estimates for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am accompanied by officials from the Department.</p> <p>  The total provision for the Department in 2022 is &euro;858 million, comprising &euro;700 million of capital, excluding capital carryover of &euro;58 million, and &euro;168 million for current spending.  This represents a 19% increase over 2021 and reflects the significant scale of ambition in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate-neutral, circular and connected economy and society.  Before I begin, I would like to bring to the committee&rsquo;s attention the updated programme and subhead structure in the Revised Estimates.  These changes better reflect the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy, Le Ch&eacute;ile 23, which sets out our vision for the three-year period from 2021 to 2023.</p> <p>  I will now highlight some key initiatives across the environment and climate action, energy transformation, and circular economy programme areas.  The Estimates for programme D, the connectivity and communications programme, will be considered by the Select Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow.  Programme A covers climate action and environmental leadership, including licensing and enforcement; monitoring, analysis and reporting on the environment; research and development; and implementation of climate action measures.  Programme A provides &euro;41.6 million in operational and capital funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to deliver its range of functions to protect the environment.  The EPA&rsquo;s 2022 allocation includes funding for additional staff resources in the Climate Change Advisory Council secretariat.  Some &euro;16.8 million is being allocated for environmental and climate research, including &euro;10 million for the EPA&rsquo;s programme of research and &euro;3.2 million for the climate action and modelling group to provide technical support for wider climate and environment policy development, as well as the implementation of the climate action plan.</p> <p>  A further &euro;15 million is being allocated for contributions towards international climate commitments, which will contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s goal to more than double the annual funding for developing countries to tackle climate change to &euro;225 million by 2025.  Some &euro;11 million is being provided for the national just transition fund, as well as a further &euro;21 million for expenditure associated with the EU just transition fund, including programme design, establishment of the programme authorities and initial programme expenditure once the programme has been finalised and approved by the European Commission.</p> <p>  Programme B, the energy transformation programme, supports Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for a net-zero emissions future by delivering energy-efficient measures across the residential, public and business sectors and by enabling the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure.  Some &euro;21.47 million is being provided to cover the operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, including an extra &euro;3.1 million for additional staff resources required to deliver its programmes.  Some &euro;46 million is being provided for improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy in businesses and across the public sector.  Some &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue is being allocated to fund the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and &euro;109 million of that allocation will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty.</p> <p>  The 2021 climate action plan has set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 or carbon equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030.  The national retrofit plan sets out the policies and measures that will be implemented in order to deliver on these targets.  The plan indicates that new and improved SEAI grants will be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage homeowners to upgrade their homes.  In this regard, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is today bringing proposals to Cabinet that will represent the most significant reform of the SEAI support schemes since they were first put in place.  Subject to Government approval, the Minister will announce details of the changes later today.  A new low-cost loan scheme for residential retrofitting will also be announced in mid-2022.  This programme, funded in part by the Exchequer and in part by the EU, will enable credit institutions to offer loans at reduced interest rates, making energy upgrades more affordable.</p> <p>  In response to the exceptional rise in energy prices, the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, which is currently going through the Houses, aims to establish a scheme for a once-off &euro;100 electricity costs emergency benefit payment to each domestic electricity account.  The scheme will apply to all domestic electricity accounts, including pay-as-you-go customers.  Approximately 2.1 million domestic account holders will benefit from this exceptional payment.  The cost of the scheme will be funded by the Department, with additional Exchequer funds to be made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Work is under way between both Departments to ensure that the necessary funding will be available when the scheme becomes operational.</p> <p>  Programme C, circular economy development, supports the transition to a circular economy, protecting and restoring our environment through sustainable resource use.  Some &euro;98 million is being allocated to the programme in 2022 to tackle environmental damage, manage waste, safeguard our natural resources and support the move to a circular economy.  This includes &euro;26 million of funding for the remediation of environmentally-degraded landfill sites.  Within this allocation, &euro;14 million is being allocated for the final phase of the remediation of the landfill at Kerdiffstown in County Kildare.  The programme also includes expenditure of &euro;2.5 million to target waste prevention, segregation and recycling and &euro;7.7 million for waste enforcement activities by local authorities.  Some &euro;13 million is being provided for Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, services, including the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  Geological mapping data from the Tellus project inform land planning and usage while INFOMAR is Ireland&rsquo;s national seabed survey and provides data to underpin the Irish marine development plan, Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  Funding of &euro;33.5 million is being allocated to Inland Fisheries for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries resource.  This includes an allocation of &euro;2.9 million towards the Loughs Agency, a North-South body that is co-funded on a 50:50 basis by the Department and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>  Appropriations-in-aid are income receipts of the Department other than from the Exchequer and they total &euro;10.5 million.  Receipts mainly comprise mining and petroleum income of &euro;5 million and also include &euro;3 million in receipts from additional superannuation contributions on public service remuneration, and GSI income of &euro;300,000.</p> <p>  I am very happy to take questions from the committee members on any details relating to the Estimates for programmes A to C within my Department.</p></speech>

We will commence with questions from members on programme A.  When posing their questions I ask members to clearly indicate the subhead they are referring to within the programme.  I also ask that they limit their questions to one subhead at a time as this will allow other members with questions on that subhead to speak before moving on to another subhead.  The same procedure will apply for the remaining programmes.  I call Deputy Whitmore.</p></speech>

That strategy has been in place since 2021.  What elements of the work that has been undertaken so far were not reflective of that vision?  It was an interesting comment to make when that vision is near completion.</p> <p>  Some &euro;11 million is provided for the national just transition fund.  The just transition commissioner is no longer in place.  His role was to engage with stakeholders and to establish the manner in which that fund was allocated.</p><p>Is all the stakeholder engagement now complete?  Is it just a matter of the Department spending money on projects that have been determined?  Does the Minister of State anticipate that some consultation will still be required?  How will that be undertaken in the absence of the commissioner?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00200"><p>I will invite the Deputy back in, if she wants to ask more specific questions on the subheads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00300"><p>Our investment has to align with our strategy, which is rapidly changing.  We have a new climate action plan and rapid development of our policies.  We are constantly realigning our expenditure to meet our strategic goals.  The Deputy will see that the annexe to our climate action plan has very detailed items and, naturally, our expenditure has to align with those items.  Is the Deputy asking me to delineate the specific changes that were not there last year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00400"><p>I imagine that if a strategy was set up in 2021, all the actions of the Department would align with it and not that the strategy would be updated as the Department goes through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00500"><p>Work was under way, but there is a new layout in the revised Estimates that has to be aligned with the Le Ch&eacute;ile programmes.  There has been a change in some of the subheads in the categorisation of where expenditure goes.  In some cases, some subheads have been combined, while in others they have been split out.  For better transparency, we have tried to make sure that the correct amounts of money are going with the correct subheads, for example, under just transition and the climate plan.  Did the Deputy have another question?</p></speech>

Is that role required in order to continue to consult with stakeholders?  Have the programmes already been set in train as such and it is now just a matter of implementing them, which is what the &euro;11 million is for?  The Department has a programme that is continuing in the absence of a central figure, in the person of the just transition commissioner, to manage it.</p></speech>

I will be interested to hear his comment on the impact indicators he has shown relating to greenhouse gas emissions in the full Estimates statement.  We had a 4% decline in emissions in 2019 and a 3.5% decline in 2020.  Clearly, the Covid-19 pandemic influenced the 2020 returns, but even with that 3.5% is surprisingly low for that year.  While we have been going in the right direction in respect of emissions for the past number of years, to what extent are special, Covid-related conditions underpinning that?  To what extent are we seeing genuine progress in the various sectors?</p> <p>  On the just transition commissioner, am I right in recalling that the programme for Government commits to legislation to establish a just transition commission on a more permanent basis?  I had the privilege of setting up the arrangement on an interim basis in the wake of the crisis in the midlands, but where are the plans for a more permanent legislative underpinning?</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear when the next call for the climate action fund is anticipated.  The money for it is not significant, relatively speaking, but in terms of a demonstration effect, it has been an important element in sustaining interest and progress in doing things in different ways.  I do not recall the last time there was a call and I would be interested to hear when it will next occur.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D01300"><p>The Deputy's first question was about the reduction in emissions.  He is correct that there was a significant reduction in 2020 compared with 2019.  The question is to what extent that was caused by the pandemic and the obvious reduction in economic activity across sectors.  Clearly, there was a major drop in transport emissions during that year.  There was a reduction in 2021, but there was also a rebound.  We do not have figures yet for that.  We are trying to maintain economic growth to allow people to continue to enjoy their lives while their emissions are reducing.  The year, 2020, was an exceptional year and a lockdown is not the route to cutting emissions for the decade. </p> <p>  We know that our target is a 51% cut by 2030 and that we will not achieve it with an exact 7.5% cut from one year to the next.  That is not the nature of things.  We will have deeper cuts in the second half of the decade compared with the first half.  We had an exceptional cut in 2020, which will probably be followed by a rebound in 2021.  I expect emissions to be higher overall in 2021 compared with 2020; I think my officials will agree with me.  We do not yet have an estimate for that, but we will be back on a downward slope in 2022.</p> <p>  The next question related to the just transition commission and when it will be put on a statutory basis.  We will continue with the just transition commission.  We have to appoint somebody to be the permanent just transition commissioner.  I do not have a date for that, but I will come back to Deputy Bruton on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy's question on the climate action fund is about when the next call for expenditure under it will be.</p></speech>

Some of this may be related to the different way of presenting figures this year.  As I see it, there is a reduction in administration pay.  Does that relate to a staff reduction?  Why are we seeing that?  On A3, for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, we see a change in current versus capital expenditure.  Under the capital programme, was there a specific building project last year versus what is projected for the year ahead?  Under A8, the just transition fund, there is &euro;11 million versus &euro;34 million.</p><p>The reference is to the EU and Ireland.  Is this all Exchequer funding or will we earmark funds that will come through the EU just transition fund?  If that is the case, how is that divided?  Up to &euro;86.5 million is identified for the EU piece.  When will we see that?  Do we expect to see it?  How will it be spent?</p><p> How is the climate action fund referred to in subhead A10 budgeted for in the Revised Estimate?  I do not see a figure there.  Will there be an impact on the climate action fund on the basis of the biofuels obligation offset?</p></speech>

The fund is to address adverse affects of climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned and promote a balanced socio-economic condition.</p> <p>  Ireland will receive &euro;84.5 million from EU just transition funds over that period up to 2027.  That is the amount for this year.  The Government will complement this funding with Exchequer resources.  The governance and management of expenditure under this fund has to comply with just transition fund regulation from the EU and the EU's common provisions regulation.</p> <p>  The transition fund is Pillar 1 of the European Green Deal just transition mechanism and investments under the just transition fund may be complemented by a combination of grants and loans to private sector entities under a dedicated window of the EU's InvestEU instrument.  Ireland has to prepare a territorial just transition plan and accompanying operational programme for approval for the EU to secure access to EU just transition funds.</p> <p>  This plan will set out Ireland's proposed investment priorities, as well as targeted sectors and regions.

I welcome the Minister of State's note that the salaries have increased and there are 90 extra personnel in the EPA, which is very welcome.  I hear frequently from all sectors of society that there is a slowness in the process of the EPA in terms of issuing licences, decision making and so on.  We are in a situation in which we need to act very quickly to progress climate action and do what we need to do.</p> <p>  The Minister of State may not be able to answer my question today, but perhaps he will revert to us.  Has a needs analysis been done of the EPA?  Is it sufficiently funded to do what we need it to do, as quickly as we need it to do it?</p><p>I appreciate that it may not be a question the Minister of State can answer here and now but the committee would welcome that level of information from the Department.</p></speech>

Other Deputies have raised issues that companies were having with the EPA in obtaining determinations of licences.  I was keen to ensure that this was not due to a lack of resources and that the EPA was properly resourced so I made inquiries to ensure the agency had what it needed.  I understand progress has been made.  Deputy Whitmore raised the case of a particular company and I understand it obtained a determination in the end.  However, it should not take years to reach decisions.  Inquiries were made into why things were taking so long.  We made sure there was sufficient funding in place this year.  There should be better communication with those applying for determinations of licences and there should not be a situation where forms are not correctly filled in, information is not available and applicants need to go back and forth.</p> <p>  It is also important to say that we have to ensure the determinations are made carefully.  For example, a large number of houses will probably be demolished because they were defective or had mica blocks in them.  It is important that the waste material from that demolition does not re-enter the construction stream to be used a second time and that a determination is not made that this is a useful material for load-bearing walls or suchlike.  It is not just a case of rapidly agreeing that everything that needs to go back into recirculation should be licensed as such.  That said, the system needs to be sped up.  I believe the EPA has sufficient funding this time and its budget is not a constraint at this stage in that area.  I recognise, however, that there were problems.</p></speech>

When will the export tariff scheme be in place and operational?  On the same subhead, the targets for retrofits were 21,544 in 2021 and 19,400 in 2022.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to that, please.</p> <p>  On outputs, the target for the number of lower income households provided with energy efficiency upgrades is lower for this year than last.  In 2021, the target was 5,800 and in 2022 it is 4,500.  I know there is a note on that but I ask the Minister of State to speak on it.  It states that the number of homes is lower than target for the previous year but this is because of a shift to deeper energy efficiency measures resulting in more energy and carbon dioxide savings.  I raise that in the context of the national retrofitting plan that we will hopefully see later today.  Sinn F&eacute;in specifically asked questions around the options to achieve reductions in emissions.  For example, what is the difference between 20,000 houses moving to a BER C2 versus 20,000 houses moving to a BER B2?  Is a different approach by the Department planned for in these figures?  The headline figure is still to have 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps installed.  Is it planned to do this in a different way and, if so, are there cost implications from that?</p> <p>  Are there targets for the expansion of the sustainable energy community, SEC, programme?  I know there are targets for 2030.  How do they relate to 2022?  What kind of expansion do we hope or expect to see?  From meeting members of some of the sustainable energy communities, I know there was talk of a new funding model or type of grant or fund where sustainable energy communities would be rewarded for good progress and the amount of retrofits done in a community.  They referred to it as a LEAF or local energy assessment fund.  I do not know if that rings a bell with the Minister of State.  What are the plans with that?</p> <p>  The &euro;100 electricity rebate is coming from departmental energy efficiency funding and broadband funds.  From where exactly is that money coming?  What implications will that have for the roll-out of the affected schemes?  I am particularly interested in how those on long waiting lists for retrofitting works will be prioritised in year one.</p></speech>

This is one of those meetings where another meeting is taking place at the same time at which the numbers will be changed.  I think it will be a dramatic change.  I will not guess what the Cabinet will approve today but I understand it is possible the increase in those numbers will be significant and dramatic.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about deeper and more shallow retrofits and how one accounts for them.  That is a very good question.  To say we will retrofit 20,000 homes without saying if those will be deep or shallow retrofits is not clear.  We need a way to account for them.  As the information note puts it, a reduction in the number of homes retrofitted could still lead to an overall increase in the amount of carbon dioxide saved.  We need to be clear to each other in explaining what is being done.</p> <p>  I expect there will be increased funding for shallow retrofits this year.  This will be for people who are unwilling to embark on a whole deep retrofit, even with a large grant or loan, but are prepared to do it in steps.  They might be prepared to do their attic and walls and might be prepared to install a heat pump later.  That would be done step by step with a smaller total budget for each step of the way.  It is a matter of responding to that kind of demand from the public since not everyone is willing to take on a &euro;50,000 retrofit, even where &euro;25,000 of the cost is covered by a grant.  There are those for whom even &euro;3,000 would be a more reasonable amount.  This will result in a larger number of smaller steps to achieve an outcome.</p></speech>

A pensioner who had cavity wall insulation done ten years ago cannot go back to the SEAI now for a grant for attic insulation because of the one-visit rule.  Will that rule be removed?  Will such persons be able to avail of a further grant for, say, attic insulation?</p></speech>

I think that will form part of the national retrofit plan today.  That will depend on the decision taken by the Government today.</p><p>The right thing to do is to say to people that although they did an upgrade, they are still eligible to do the second stage.</p><p> To go back to the Deputy&rsquo;s other questions, he asked me about the SEAI target for 2022.  The number we have been discussing is the SEAI target for 2022 and that is the number that is likely to change as a result of the Government decision today on the number of homes.</p></speech>

It is in the legislation we were working on in the D&aacute;il last week.  The funding for it is to come 50% from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, so long as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agrees to that, and 50% from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  It is to be done through a reallocation from other divisions but I do not think those divisions have been decided yet, so it has not been allocated.  The Deputy suggested it would come from energy efficiency but I do not think that decision has been made.  In other words, &euro;107.5 million will have to be reallocated from other divisions within the Department.</p></speech>

I wonder about the low-cost loans scheme.  One of the risks is that there will be a significant number of people who will not be in a position to take out a loan upfront in order to do retrofitting and those people may not be eligible for something like the warmer homes scheme.  Has the Department done an analysis on the number of households that will fall into that financing gap and what will be available for them?</p> <p>  The next point follows on from Deputy O'Rourke&rsquo;s point on the figures.  If we look at the figure of 19,400, that is not necessarily to the rating of B2, and this is specified and brought out in more detail in the third point, which states that 8,640 will be to a B2 level.  The programme for Government and the Government commitment is for 500,000 at B2 level.  Is it the case that out of that 500,000, only 8,640 have actually been upgraded to B2 level so far?  That would leave 491,000 houses that still have to be brought up to that B2 level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#G01600"><p>The timeframe for this is the middle of this year.  The target interest rate is 3.5%.  It fits into the loan category of the available green loans, and there are green loans from the post office at 4.5%.  If people have a mortgage, which many do, they can refinance and probably get it at a lower rate than the 3.5%, perhaps at between 2% and 3%.  It is to fit into that category of loan.  The idea is that the loan will not be secured on people&rsquo;s property and it is a non-recourse loan.  The idea is that it covers the portion of the retrofit that people cannot afford or that is not covered by the grant, assuming people do not have their own resources to pay for it.  Not everybody is going to do a deep retrofit, so it is possible for people to do a much smaller retrofit starting from around &euro;3,000, where the person is only putting up &euro;600 of the capital themselves.  The loan could be as low as that and it is over a period of years and is a non-recourse loan.  The idea is that people are not frozen out because they have to take on some giant amount of money.  They can do it step by step.</p> <p>  It will be mid-2022 before that loan scheme is ready.   The idea is also that the loan is to some extent guaranteed by the State, so it is possible to lend to people who have poor credit to insulate their homes so they can save money and will be able to make the payments out of the reduced energy bills they will have in the future.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the accounting for shallow retrofits and deep retrofits, and how many of the 500,000 have to get to B2.  Last year, 2020 to 2021, some 4,600 B2s were achieved and 8,640 is the target for this year.  However, that does not take into account all of the people who have come some steps closer to B2 and who will take another step to move on.  There is also the fact that the funding for this is coming from the carbon tax.  As the decade moves on, more money will be available for more retrofits and given the scale-up of the available capacity in the labour market to deliver this, the amount of funding available increases each year, so it is going to be a programme that will have more going on in the second half of the decade than the first half.</p></speech>

They have been combined.  I guess the matter Deputy Whitmore was just asking about, that is, the &euro;26 million for landfill remediation, which is a very large amount of money, is being moved over, so that would explain that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be aware from our constituency of the issue of the north beach in Bray, as indeed will Deputy Whitmore, and the funding that has been required to maintain that particular former landfill site.  When she asked her question on landfill remediation it prompted a concern about the waste management programme and what that entailed when I saw an increase.  However, if it is a reallocation, that is fine.  Let us just hope the funding continues because it is much needed for those sites.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  I am grateful to my colleagues here for their assistance in compiling the detailed briefing for both myself and the committee.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022, including that of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  As members will have seen from the briefing material provided to them last week, my Department is projected to spend &euro;2.074 billion on current expenditure and &euro;33 million on capital expenditure during 2022.  This represents an increase of &euro;189 million or 10% over the 2021 Revised Estimate.  In addition, my Department has a further &euro;3.2 million allocation for capital carryover.</p> <p>  The 2022 allocation covers financial provision for a range of key services in respect of children and young people, such as Tusla, early years and youth services.  There are also allocations in other key work streams, which include provision of accommodation for international protection seekers and refugee resettlement and other services for international protection applicants.  Legacy issues in relation to mother and baby institutions, and birth information and tracing are also funded.  In addition, there are allocations towards the areas of equality, integration and inclusion.  This includes funding towards gender equality, human rights, LGBTI+ issues, Traveller and Roma issues, migrant integration and disability policy.  </p> <p>  In 2021, we again faced the challenge of Covid-19.  As with 2020, the last year again saw significant impact from the pandemic on the work of my Department and its agencies.  The early learning and care sector, Tusla, youth services, equality and international protection accommodation have been particularly affected.  However, it is important that I acknowledge the tremendous efforts which continue to be made across the whole of our sector in response to the pandemic.  It has been an extremely challenging time for us all and hopefully 2022 will see us start to normalise life with our focus moving from reactive towards more developmental in nature. </p> <p>  To outline my Department&rsquo;s Vote in more detail, I have provided the select committee with details of the funding allocations across the different programme areas, along with a summary by subhead, including details of changes over the 2021 figures.  In terms of Vote spending, three areas of the Vote represent 89% of the Department&rsquo;s allocation, namely Tusla, accounting for 43%, early years programmes and schemes, accounting for 34%, and international protection accommodation, accounting for 12% of the overall allocation.  I will now briefly address these areas in turn.   </p> <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Estimate includes provision of &euro;898 million for Tusla, an increase of &euro;40.5 million or 5% over the 2021 allocation.  This funding will allow Tusla to respond to a number of challenges such as addressing increasing demand for their services and developing their mainstream residential services for children.  The budget will allow for the improvement of ICT systems and data management processes, particularly in the aftermath of the HSE cyber attack in May of last year.  It will also allow for additional posts to be funded, including 100 front-line staff and 48 residential care workers, and to meet expected demand arising from forthcoming birth information and tracing legislation.</p><p>It will allow Tusla to support the community and voluntary sector, which delivers services on its behalf.  It will maintain support for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services and address recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s accommodation review of refuge provision.</p><p> Another significant portion of my Department&rsquo;s spending is on early learning and care, which has an overall allocation of &euro;716 million - a &euro;78 million increase on the 2021 allocation.  The funding requirements for this area have been significantly impacted by Covid.  Funding in 2022 allows my Department to continue to meet the costs of the two-year early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and the associated access and inclusion model, AIM, which supports children with additional needs to access the ECCE programme.  The allocation for the national childcare scheme, NCS, will meet the costs of delivering the scheme and support the sustainability and operation of the early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC, sector.  The funding provided in 2022 will also allow for the extension of the age of eligibility to access the NCS universal subsidy to 15 years, and this will be made available to all families. </p><p> Funding is also being allocated to introduce a new core funding model from the autumn.  Under the new scheme, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures.  The funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff and establish career structures.  We will introduce or improve other features of provision that contribute to quality, such as non-contact time, planning, training, and curriculum implementation.  The additional investment will also support the programme for Government commitment to support the drawing up of an employment regulation order.</p><p> The allocation for costs associated with the provision of accommodation for international protection seekers has seen an increase of &euro;41 million to &euro;259 million in 2022.  The allocation includes funding towards implementing the recommendations of the White Paper to end direct provision and to establish a new international protection support service.  For the first time, this allocation has a capital allocation, amounting to &euro;12.5 million, to progress this key priority.</p><p> International protection seekers&rsquo; accommodation is a demand-led service with requirements for accommodation and services increasing as numbers of new international protection applications increase.  In the latter half of 2021 there has been a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals seeking international protection accommodation in Ireland, with more than 2,260 new arrivals in the period from 1 November 2021 to 30 January 2022.  This funding will continue to provide accommodation to those seeking international protection and to cover the projected increase of costs.  This estimate is based on the likelihood that there will be pent-up demand for international protection accommodation in 2022, as previously closed off routes reopen.  A new procurement competition for accommodation is now under way to reduce reliance on short-term emergency accommodation and to ensure that the Department has sufficient accommodation capacity.</p><p> As well as providing for increased demand, I am progressing my pledge to replace the current system with one that respects the dignity of those seeking international protection.  I established a transition team in my Department last year to drive the implementation of this new model on a phased basis to 2024.  This year, the initial capital allocation of &euro;12.5 million will be used for the acquisition of accommodation with a focus on acquiring turnkey properties and properties that require upgrading or renovations.  Current funding will provide for the roll-out of an approved housing body scheme so that they can begin to bring properties on stream and develop a pipeline for accommodation.  It will also be used to roll out a rent-a-room scheme and source private tenancies to increase the availability of accommodation.  I have a commitment from within the national development plan that as capital requirements in this area increase, additional funding will be provided to progress this important priority action area.</p><p> With the rest of the Vote, there are of course other policy areas that will be progressed in 2022.  The 2022 Estimates contain provisions to support overall management of the Government&rsquo;s action plan for responding to the needs of former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This includes certain key actions, including at the Tuam site on foot of the proposed certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) legislation, research and commemoration initiatives.  My Department is working on information and tracing legislation to allow access to birth information for adopted persons and additional funding has been provided in the Estimates to Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to support the implementation of this legislation.</p><p> The 2022 Estimates will allow me to continue to provide funding in the important areas of equality, disability, inclusion and integration.  These are very significant and challenging areas and the Vote includes funding streams for areas such as the National Disability Authority, refugee and migrant integration, gender equality, LGBTI+ and Traveller and Roma initiatives.  As I mentioned earlier, these areas are in receipt of additional funding in 2022.</p><p> The 2022 Estimates have seen an increase of &euro;3.5 million for youth services to more than &euro;73 million.  This level of funding will support the delivery by the voluntary youth work sector of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities.  I believe that the youth sector is essential to reach and address the most marginalised and vulnerable young people.</p><p> In conclusion, the significant increase in resources under my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2022 allows for the continuation of vital services to some of our most disadvantaged communities while providing for a number of important opportunities for a targeted development and improvement of services.  Deputies may be assured that I will continue to work closely with all sectors and stakeholders, as we strive to maximise outcomes from the resources being considered today.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention and I will be pleased to respond to questions. </p></speech>

I thank the Minister for that outline of the revised Estimates.  There is much to welcome, particularly the increases as outlined by the Minister.  The capital allocation for international protection seekers is very welcome also.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions related to adequacy of funding, and whether the increases the Minister has described are sufficient to meet the greatly enhanced commitments for his Department.</p> <p>  The increase under the Tusla section is welcome but I am conscious that the Minister has said he will need to fund quite a significant number of additional posts arising from the expected increased demand due to the forthcoming birth information and tracing legislation.  This committee was very actively engaged in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022.  I believe I can say that it is a matter of disappointment for us as members of the committee that the recommendation we made as to the mode of communication with adopted persons where a birth parent has expressed a no-contact preference.  That recommendation was not taken up by the Minister's Department in the shape of the legislation.  That is disappointing to us.  It is relevant in the Estimates because we had recommended the communication would be by way of registered post.  I am conscious there would be a significantly increased cost with regard to staff time in the alternative method of communication by phone or by meeting, which is provided for in the Bill.  Will the Minister say whether there is sufficient funding here?  The Minister is saying 100 additional front-line staff, but will that be enough to meet the demands coming from the new legislation?</p> <p>  On the early years funding allocations the Minister has spoken about the new core funding model.  Clearly, huge expectation has built up among parents, providers and staff on that, and that it will be in place from the autumn so we would actually see significant reductions in childcare fees for parents.  It is a huge issue across my constituency in Dublin Bay South.  The cost of childcare is a huge issue for everyone.  The Minister has described an increase of just over 10%.  Will this be an adequate allocation to really create that radical change in the core funding model that parents, providers and staff are all expecting in the childcare and early years education sector in the autumn?  Perhaps the Minister will say more on that.</p> <p>  On the mother and baby homes, the Minister does not refer in his speech to the amount that will be needed for setting up the redress scheme.  Again, we are expecting to see that redress scheme for survivors in place by the autumn.  I am aware that at page 31 there is a more detailed document where the set-up costs are described as being provided for within the funding that the Minister has outlined.  I believe that the Minister's document says that the financial payments will be allocated separately, which is the actual payment of redress to survivors of mother and baby homes.  Will the Minister expand on where that is going to come from, whether it will be within this year's allocation, or will it be pushed forward into the budget for 2023?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#C00400"><p>A significant additional investment overall in Tusla this year of more than &euro;41 million extra follows on from the largest ever increase Tusla received last year of &euro;66 million.</p><p>Much of that focused on the recruitment of additional staff.  As the Deputy said, there will be more than 280 new staff recruited to Tusla in 2022, with 100 of them front-line staff and 48 of them related to residential placements, with which we know there is a significant issue.<br/><br/>In terms of how that breaks down to resourcing the information and tracing legislation, 30 of those staff will be allocated to the implementation of the information and tracing legislation.  A genealogist is included in that group thus recognising that a wider range of skills and expertise are needed within Tusla to fully implement the range of tasks and responsibilities that it will have.  Tusla will be better empowered to undertake tracing with the statutory basis that it will be given under the information and tracing legislation.  I know from my engagement with groups who represent adopted people, they felt that the genealogist skills was one that the organisation lacked, and that is something which is recognised by myself and the chief executive.<br/><br/>Please note that we have provided an extra allocation to the Adoption Authority of Ireland of &euro;1.3 million to allow it to undertake its functions under the information and tracing legislation.  That will allow for the hiring of additional staff, a new head of records, a new archivist, and new administrative staff to provide support.  The money allocated to AAI and Tusla will support both organisations with the information campaign that will be rolled out, once the legislation is passed, to inform parents, adopted people and people who have questions about their birth and origin, and about their rights under the provision of the new legislation.<br/><br/>On the provision of core funding under the early years allocation, the allocation has been significantly increased and the central part of that is core funding.  A sum of &euro;16 million has been provided this year and that will equate in a full year, in 2023, to &euro;207 million.<br/><br/>In terms of adequacy, core funding supports services because we recognise that many services struggle in terms of their own sustainability.  We want to enable the payment of better wages for staff.  We want to be able to deliver on the pay scales that we believe will be provided by the Joint Labour Committee and the employment regulation order, which I hope will be agreed soon between employer and employee representatives but that requires the State stepping up with this very significant additional investment.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>for that, with services, is the agreement to freeze fees.  For the first time in the history of the State, we now have a mechanism to stop the increase in fees that we had seen, particularly dramatically prior to Covid.  If one considers the level of fee increases in the last two years, they have actually been quite small.  In 2021, it was only about a 1% fee increase on average.  That is primarily because of the very significant State support that was provided through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which meant that services were sustainable and did not have to increase their fees.  The EWSS will be withdrawn by the end of April.  The new core funding will kick in from September of next year.  The allocation also contains a bridging or transition fund of &euro;37 million, which will continue to support the sustainability of services in May to August of this year.<br/><br/>We are very clear that this is not the end of our investment in this area because, as the Deputy rightly said, we need to ensure we can cut the cost and enhance affordability for parents.  The first step towards that is a fee freeze and the next stop is increased investment in the national childcare scheme, NCS, that directs subventions parents receive.  I have been very clear, and I think that all three parties in government are very clear, that in the next budget and in following budgets we want to see significant additional investment in the NCS.  We saw the beginning of that this year in terms of the removal of the wraparound hours, which will kick in spring and benefit about 5,000 children from disadvantaged families.  We will see the next part of that in September of this year when the increase of the universal subvention from three up to 15 years kicks in, which will benefit thousands of families.  We are very clear that more money will continue to go into the NCS and because we will now have a fee freeze, parents will see the difference.  I say that because, as we saw in previous years, when the Government put more money into the NCS it was immediately eroded by fee increases that service providers implemented.<br/><br/>Finally, in terms of redress, the allocation for redress is not contained in these Estimates.  It will be the subject of a Revised Estimate, I imagine, for 2022 and then, I suppose, the subhead will be built in from budget 2023 onwards.  The final package on redress was not agreed at the time of the budget.  As members will know, we announced it in November of this year following the budget.  We hope to be in a position to enable people to start to draw down payments in 2022 about which I am absolutely determined.  I will work with the committee and everyone else to make sure the legislation gets through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible but at that point, it will be the subject, I imagine, of a supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

In these revised Estimates, does the Minister believe there is enough in terms of safety to deal with the challenge that private services pose to Tusla?  Over recent years there has been a significant growth in the private services used by Tusla in residential and foster care.  These are more expensive services than we get from Tusla units and foster carers.  They are more vulnerable to price increases and shocks.  Also, private residential units are not covered by HIQA so we do not have the same level of oversight.  There is general inflation and I am concerned that it will be used as an opportunity to increase prices.  That means one will be left with young people in a private care that, realistically, Tusla can no longer afford.  However, it would be devastating to that young person's care plan and placement to move him or her out.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the private foster care issue.  Private foster care placements cost between three and three and a half times as much as a Tusla placement.  That drains the budget for Tusla and makes its recruitment and service development harder to achieve within budget.  Ultimately, that creates a situation where there is going to be greater demand for the private placements to fill even bigger gaps in Tusla and so on.  In addition, this becomes self-fulfilling and self-replicating.  Can the Minister tell us what he is doing to limit the amount that Tusla spends on private services that are a structural weakness within Tusla's current arrangements?</p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme of Government to provide inhouse therapeutic services within Tusla.  Is there sufficient room in these Estimates to develop the services in the coming months?</p> <p>  The failings of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have become very public.  They are well known and have been well discussed but they are certainly becoming very public.  I think that inhouse therapeutic services are an essential element to provide very deeply traumatised and hurt young people in care with the appropriate services that they need.</p></speech>

I am seeking to ensure that there is a budget for that commitment in the programme for Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#E00200"><p>I share the Deputy's concern about the very significant reliance by Tusla on private services, both for private residential and foster services.  I think there is a role for them, but it should be to deal with sudden spikes in demand rather than being a central element of provision.  Over the years, the private sector has had to become too great an element of the central provision of Tusla services.  I think that is something Tusla recognises.  One of the things I have been able to do this year, with the extra &euro;41 million that is being invested in Tusla, is ensure that &euro;3 million of that goes to Tusla residential care for the enhancement of mainstream residential care provision.  As I noted, that will include the hiring of 48 additional staff for mainstream residential care.  That is an important enhanced investment in Tusla's own capacity to provide residential care placements.</p> <p>  As we know, Tusla also significantly relies on the community and voluntary sector for residential care placements.  Some of the additional &euro;6 million that is being provided under these Estimates to the community and voluntary sector, for which Tusla provides finance, will also no doubt support enhanced provision of residential care in the community and voluntary sector.  We identified this as an issue and it is one we are seeking to address.  However, it will not be solved in one budget. as I am sure the Deputy will understand.  The enhancement of Tusla's own ability to provide residential care placements is very important.  We are definitively investing in that in this year's budget.</p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop in-house therapeutic services.  I visited the Dublin north central therapeutic hub before Christmas.  I met with the team there, both in its headquarters and its community building on Manor Street.  I saw the benefit of such intensive supports for young people who have come to Tusla's attention.  I am pleased we have been able to dedicate part of the &euro;41 million to supporting that service.  Some &euro;700,000 is being provided under Tusla's business plan this year for the enhancement of therapeutic services for children in care.  The pay element of that will cover the cost of hiring eight whole-time equivalent staff specifically in that area.</p> <p>  There are also a number of other mandates for Tusla under its business plan this year.  The mapping of all existing Tusla and Tusla-commissioned therapeutic services has been revised into a great framework for therapeutic services for children.  There is a requirement for a multidisciplinary assessment and care plan for children who require therapeutic services as well.  To be able to provide a similar hub in all Tusla regions will require sustained investment but we are making a start on that.  It is an enhancement of Tusla services, to which I am committed.</p></speech>

I will start with the cost of childcare.  I think everyone recognises that parents pay far too much for the service they get.  I commend the Minister and his officials on their efforts to reduce costs substantially in a way that will be impactful for all parents.  When he was before this committee previously, the Minister mentioned that an expert group was reviewing the funding model and specifically looking at targeted areas in which additional funding could be put to use for those who are at a disadvantage compared with others who can afford the cost of childcare.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the options the expert group is working on and proposing to address the issue and alleviate some of the burden on parents.</p> <p>  I welcome the provision of an additional &euro;40.5 million for Tusla.  Will a proportion of that be allocated to the family resource programme or any capital projects?  I note that in 2021 there was an underspend of &euro;3.5 million in the Department's capital allocation.  I would like to understand how that happened.  Was it due to delays to some projects?</p> <p>  The third issue I raise relates to the international protection accommodation services support.  I welcome the establishment of the service and the capital support in the region of &euro;12.5 million that was announced.  For what specifically will this fund be used?  What types of accommodation is the Department looking at in terms of build or modular examples?  I would like to get an understanding of that on the basis that we are in a housing crisis and there are constraints, including skills shortages.</p> <p>  I know the mental health youth task force, the Pathfinder project, is a cross-departmental project led by the Department of Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  There has been a lack of action on the project since its establishment in 2016.  As a member of the Cabinet, I ask the Minister to ensure some focus is placed on this issue in 2022 and that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth forms part of the overall cross-departmental approach in order to implement long-lasting change around youth mental health.  I know the Minister is passionate about this issue and we all want to make an important contribution in this area.  I ask for support for it, including through the Minister's Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#E00700"><p>On the cost of childcare, the Deputy is absolutely right that childcare is too expensive in this country.  Parents pay too much and staff in childcare are not paid enough.  That is something we are seeking to resolve.  We are taking a step-by-step approach to the issue.  We made the call that this year we would focus on supporting services to better pay their staff because we are seeing a huge turnover in staff at the moment.  Young people - let us be honest, it is young women - who study for three or four years to get a level 7 or level 8 qualification start in childcare and find they are being paid less than they were in the temporary or part-time jobs they were doing to support themselves at university.  That is not sustainable and it is the reason we are looking at the issue.  We have established a joint labour committee for the sector and we are seeking an employment regulation order to set a payscale for the different levels, such as entry level, room leader level and manager level, and to have those implemented.</p> <p>  Many service providers are just breaking even and some are not even breaking even.  They need additional support.  That is why we have provided the core funding.  That was one of the recommendations of the expert group.  We engaged with the group while it was doing its work and actually brought in core funding before the group reported because we knew it would be central to the report.  Rather than waiting for budget 2023, which would have meant waiting for another year, we brought in core funding this year before the expert group reported.</p> <p>  Core funding is about providing sustainability to the services and better pay for staff.  In exchange for that, providers must provide a fee freeze so that we do not see continued increases in fees for parents.  That is only step one.  Step two is the extra investment in the NCS.  That was also advised by the expert group, which made a number of suggestions on what we can do with the NCS.  One of these was to get rid of the wraparound hours.  We are doing that in this year's budget.  A second recommendation was to extend the universality of the NCS from the age of three up to the age of 15.  Again, we did that in this year's budget.  Another recommendation was the introduction of an additional premium for families with multiple children in childcare.  We will look at that for next year's budget.</p><p>The other step is to broaden the universal subvention, which is 50 cent per year at the moment, and look at what will happen if it is increased.  There are a range of options.  As I have stated, the work we have to do to make childcare more affordable is not just in the budget this year; it is a continued piece of work.  What I have heard clearly from all three party leaders is that there is full commitment across the Government to this investment.  We have to make childcare more affordable for parents.</p><p> Another key element of the recommendations of the expert group was the idea of a DEIS model for childcare.  That would provide the ability to put in enhanced supports for children from disadvantaged communities.  That can take several forms, such as the access and inclusion model, AIM, approach, which supports children with disabilities.  That comes in seven different levels.  Some of them are universal, while others are more targeted to a particular service.  We might design something like that in the context of our DEIS approach.  Again, I hope to begin work in the budget next year.  It will take several years before it is fully rolled out but it is a really positive step, recognising that the education of children does not begin in junior infants any more; it begins in the ECCE programme and we have to support that.  Certainly, I am aware in my role as Minister with responsibility for equality that, for example, 10% fewer Traveller children undertake the free two-year pre-school ECCE programme compared with children from the settled community.  Education disadvantage is being built in there from day one.  That is something we have to combat and I am considering it in the context of the Traveller and Roma education strategy.</p><p> In the context of family resource centres, the capital budget this year for Tusla is not huge.  It is mainly focused on the maintenance and upgrading of its existing centres.  Tusla is currently doing a big piece of work looking at family supports that it provides throughout the country.  I know calls for family resource centres have come from the constituency of the Deputy and other constituencies throughout the country.  One of the issues we are considering is what additional family support services, rather than centres, can be provided and whether that can address some of the needs in some of these communities.  That work is being done at the moment between Tusla and my Department.  When it is complete, we can take a step back and look at where or if we are putting in additional family resource centres or perhaps just providing additional services in a particular community.</p><p> Finally, in terms of the international protection support service, IPSS, we are creating to help end direct provision, the capital spend is &euro;12.5 million.  This year, that will primarily be used for purchasing existing units.  We are looking at several larger units, that is, seven, eight, nine or ten bedroom units, that will be used for the accommodation of single persons, but we will also be purchasing several two or three bedroom units.  As regards where we are, part of the significant current investment that is provided for the IPSS under this budget will be used to create new funding streams for approved housing bodies, AHBs, for which they can bid, as they can at the moment, and use to start to construct units.  We are taking a multipronged approach to this.  We are doing some purchase right now, but we are also providing money for AHBs to build units themselves for community-based accommodation, that is, phase 2 accommodation.  It is to be hoped that later this year we can start to move towards the planning of phase 1 accommodation, which is the reception and integration centres.  It is important to note there is a strong commitment in the national development plan to increasing and providing additional capital funding as we need it in order to end direct provision by the end of 2024.</p><p> The pathfinder project is primarily led through the Department of Health.  I am happy to engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on whether there is anything my Department can do to assist in that, but it is primarily led through health.  I am acutely aware of the importance of supporting all measures to enhance the mental health of young people.  Obviously, the youth services that are funded by my Department - we have a significant &euro;5 million increase in investment this year - are very important to supporting universal service but, in particular, targeted services, such as UBU Your Place Your Space, in areas of high disadvantage.  We will get eight new services opened this year, which is really positive, but we are looking at ways of better linking in youth services with wider mental health services.  In particular the early intervention part is so important before reaching a situation where CAMHS or other higher degree interventions are needed.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman to bear with me if I have to leave.  I thank the Minister for taking the time to meet the committee.</p> <p>  I refer to the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill on which the committee will be carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny.  Key to this is the establishment of the decision support service, DSS.  I know &euro;5.8 million was allocated in the budget for this service.  It is not due to be established until the middle of the year.  Is it on course to be established in mid-2022?  Has work been done to see whether the original budget allocation of &euro;5.8 million is still adequate for the service?</p> <p>  I do not know whether the Minister can hear me.  I have another couple of questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#F00400"><p>I will ask all my questions now.  I was not sure whether I could be heard; I was getting feedback over the system.  I refer to the Minister's remarks in respect of 100 new front-line staff for Tusla.  In that context, what will be the allocation towards domestic violence?  As the Minister is aware, it has been well-documented, sadly, that there has been an increase in demand for domestic violence services.  I note that his opening statement basically stated support for these services will be maintained.  It is okay to maintain support, but will the additional demand for these services be met?</p> <p>  I refer to the 48 residential care workers in Tusla.  I got an answer on this only last week, it having been raised with me.  Will the provision of 48 new residential care workers stop vulnerable children being placed into apartments, hotel rooms and holiday chalets?  Currently, between nine and 11 vulnerable children are placed into these facilities each month.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The ability for the decision support service to be up and running in June is partly reliant on the committee and its good work in terms of getting pre-legislative scrutiny done quickly.  I appreciate its support in that regard.  I am absolutely committed to getting it up and running for June.  The Deputy cited the 2021 figure for 2022.  We have significantly increased that.  We actually have &euro;7.3 million in the DSS, an increase of &euro;1.5 million.  That is a recognition that once June comes, the service will be extremely busy.  It will be providing a range of skills and advice to people who require assistance with the important life decisions they have to make.  It is central to our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to have the DSS established.  It is also very important in terms of getting rid of the whole idea of wardship, which is the incredibly outdated system that operates now and is being challenged in the courts at the moment.  Significant additional budget has been provided, staff are in place and it is working as kind of a subset of the Mental Health Commission but in terms of having the legislative power to start to be in a position to provide people with this advice, I am really hoping to get that done by June.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are committed to getting it through the Houses as quickly as possible once pre-legislative scrutiny is completed.</p> <p>  As regards the additional staff for domestic, sexual and gender-base violence, DSGBV, as the Deputy is aware, this area is in significant flux because it will move out of my Department and Tusla into the Department of Justice.  That follows on from the audit that was done and it is a request made by a significant number of NGOs working in the sector.  We have listened to them and are making that change on foot of those requests.  As the Deputy is aware, an extra &euro;3 million has been provided by my Department for Tusla for DSGBV this year.</p><p>That will bring it from &euro;28 million in budget 2021 to &euro;31 million in budget 2022.  That was on foot of an increase of &euro;2.7 million last year.  There has been sustained investment in current spending in domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence services since I became Minister.<br/><br/>On the question of staff, Tusla has made the decision to hire a number of specialists in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for its child protection units in each region in the country.  That is because Tusla recognises that where there is a case of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence, I suppose, the immediate risk of abuse is to the mother.  There must be recognition that such action could have major long-term consequences for the children in that relationship as well.  That additional investment will not move out of Tusla when the change happens.  Even when responsibility for the provision of the refuges and the like move to the new entity under the Department of Justice, Tusla will still have a strong domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence specialism within it, recognising that Tusla will continue to engage, unfortunately, with hundreds or perhaps thousands of families with experience of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence.  It will continue to need expertise in that area, even if it is not in charge of the provision of refuges and rape crisis centres etc.  It is a move with some foresight by Tusla and one I really welcome.<br/><br/>There is the question of whether the additional 48 front-line staff in residential care will end the practice mentioned by the Deputy.  I am not going to be bold enough to say that will end the practice, although I hope it can see it reduced.  We need to reduce that practice and ensure that where a child needs residential care, it is provided in a proper and long-term residential care placement.  The Deputy knows that cases are sometimes so urgent that these <i>ad hoc</i>solutions or locations for placement are used but it is not the practice we would like to see continue.  It is important that in those cases we at least have the staff to support the young person wherever they are placed.  We absolutely want to see permanent residential care run by either Tusla or the community and voluntary sector.  I remind the Deputy of what I said to Deputy Costello earlier, which is that there is an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla to enhance its residential care placement capacity this year.  That is a positive step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#G00200"><p>I thank the Minister and the rest of the delegation for joining us today.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister in securing additional funding and his Department has a really broad remit that provides essential services, all of which need more resources.</p> <p>  I have several points to raise.  Under the subhead relating to mother and baby institutions, the increase in allocations for this area are especially welcome.  However, the briefing document only mentions Tuam as a site to be examined under the burials Bill, implying that only Tuam is budgeted for when there are, of course, many other known locations of potential mass graves.  Will the Minister comment on that or does the budget allow for more sites to be examined?  There is also reference to an enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.  Given the reported unsatisfactory nature of engagement so far, will the Minister outline what the new model will look like and who is conducting the research and commemoration initiatives referred to?</p> <p>  Many other Deputies have raised the question of early learning and care, and there is again a welcome increase in funding for the area.  The committee has discussed child poverty and there has been criticism of the national childcare scheme because it does not account for additional needs faced by disadvantaged families.  One of the surprising points to learn was that the single biggest contributing factor to children being in poverty is being part of a lone-parent family.  Will there be targeted supports in that regard or will there be an opportunity to address the matter?  There are cases where children are not guaranteed access to proper meals and there is a pressing need for targeted programmes in that area.</p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement asserts that funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff in an established career structure.  Will the Minister elaborate on how that would happen in practice?</p> <p>  The Minister referenced the funding towards implementing the White Paper to end direct provision.  It is almost a year since the White Paper was published.  What has been the progress in moving forward on ending direct provision since and how will the allocation of &euro;12.5 million help achieve this?</p> <p>  We all expected to see more reference to dealing with gender-based violence in the statement and the documents.  It is mentioned under Tusla's budget but given the necessary focus on the area since Christmas, and with the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" documentary this week, I would have hoped for stronger prioritisation.  In response to a parliamentary question last year, the Minister informed me the cost of maintaining a single refuge space is in the region of &euro;100,000 annually.  Of course we know that to meet the targets under the Istanbul Convention we would need a huge amount of funding to make a provision for that.  Where is the allocation to increase the number of refuge spaces that are very desperately needed, especially in large areas of the country with absolutely no spaces whatever?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#G00300"><p>With regard to the allocation for actions under the institutional burials Bill, that legislation is clear in setting up a format of how to identify an area that will be subject to an agency created under the Bill to undertake the recovery and identification of remains.  It is accepted by everybody that Tuam will be the first site where such an agency will investigate and the budget exists to start the work on the Tuam site.  The Bill is also clear that should other sites meet the requirements of the legislation, an agency could be established for those sites as well.  Our Department's primary focus is on advancing the work towards Tuam and the funding to start the work on the agency.  It is quite a significant amount of funding of approximately &euro;4 million that is in the budget to start the agency once we get that legislation passed.  I hope to publish the new draft of the legislation by the end of this month and introduce it to the Oireachtas shortly afterwards.</p> <p>  On the question of the enhanced model of stakeholder engagement, work is ongoing for a long-term mechanism where the views of the survivor community can be conveyed to the Government.  As we know there are a very significant number of groups in the sector, some representing specific issues and others specific areas of the areas of the country.  Some may represent survivors of particular institutions.  In order for a clear line of communication to be established with a clear understanding of the diverse range of needs that survivors have, we are looking at a range of measures.</p> <p>  The previous Minister had established a collaborative forum that brought together approximately 18 former survivors or family members of former residents of these institutions.  We have put forward some proposals to that group on the idea of a survivor advocate or perhaps even considering an advocate model, which would engage with the Government in ascertaining the views of survivors.  We hope later this year to bring a final proposal to the Government on this enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>  There are a number of initiatives in this area.  There is a commemoration initiative grant whereby groups around the country may apply for a grant for a commemoration initiative they want to undertake with respect to a mother and baby or county institution in an area.  My Department does an annual call for those and it can support a range of initiatives.  We try very much to be guided by what survivors are looking for and what they think is appropriate with regard to the institution under which they have grouped.  There is also a cross-department group between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage looking at some of the considerations around commemoration, particularly the protection of sites of former institutions.</p><p>Work is ongoing between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  </p><p> On early learning and care and school-age childcare, the Deputy raised the issue of child poverty.  The national childcare scheme, NCS, is a really good scheme.  It is a massively enhanced ability of the State to provide financial support.  However, as it is operated, and it is only really operating since 2019, issues have arisen.  I have engaged with the Chair on this in the Chamber.  Most importantly, I have met with many community childcare providers from various parts of the country and listened to the difficulties they are having with certain elements of the NCS.  In this year's budget we have removed that provision whereby hours spent in school or in the ECCE programme were deducted from a child's free allocation.  The 20-hour allocation for children whose parents were not in education or employment meant they had their school time or ECCE time deducted from their 20 hours a week. Particularly in term time for children attending school-age child care, that was seeing the removal of their entire free allocation.  From this spring, that practice will cease, which will be of great advantage.  We estimate about 5,000 will be able to benefit from their full 20-hour allocation of free early learning and care or school-age childcare.  That is a really important immediate step in terms of addressing issues to do with poverty.</p><p> There is a wider measure we can take.  I referred to it when I was talking to Deputy Dillon in terms of this idea of a DEIS approach to early learning and care and school-age childcare.  It is recommended within the expert group.  We are starting work on the design of it now.  I would hope in this year's budget to be able to take some initial steps towards provision there.  On the provision of hot school meals, the Deputy is right that they are absolutely essential.  It does not fall directly within my Department.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, has increased the number of schools where that is provided.  I am aware of the work the Minister, Deputy Foley, is doing in terms of the very significant increase in the number of DEIS schools for which she has got the investment this year.  That is going to help.</p><p> In terms of quality, the workforce development plan sets out how we make childcare an attractive career option for individuals.  That was launched in December at the same time as the expert group.  We will be working to implement that.  The key thing is that if we are not paying childcare professionals enough they are not going to join or they are going to leave the sector.  That is why we have done core funding and why it is so important.</p><p> On the White Paper, the implementation of the vulnerability assessment was really important and something Ireland had been failing to do for years.  Some 650 have been undertaken this year and another 900 are in place at the moment.  On the establishment of the programme board and the expert advisory group, I met last week with Catherine Day, Lorcan Sirr and David Donoghue.  The group will be overseeing my Department, holding our feet to the fire to make sure we are implementing the White Paper.  In March of this year I hope to provide a detailed one-year update on the successes we have had in the implementation of the White Paper.  We will be able to give some detail on accommodation that we have provided.  In 2022 we plan that the first people will start to move out of direct provision centres and into accommodation in the community.  It will not be a huge number.  It will probably be just in the early 100s this year, but it is that first really important step.  To have people living independently in the community is absolutely central to the White Paper model.</p></speech>

On the implementation of the action plan in response to the recommendations from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, I want to ask about fast-tracking the medical cards.  I have been speaking to survivors.  Good quality healthcare is so important here.  Maybe the Minister could come back to me on that.</p> <p>  We spoke a lot today about Tusla and funding.  Is there going to be any help through Tusla for women and children trying to flee domestic violence?  The Minister is launching the public consultation on the Government strategy to combat gender-based violence next week and is committed to providing refuges in the nine counties that do not have one.  Carlow is one of them.  I have spoken to the Minister about it and have had several meetings with the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  When we speak about refuges and wrap-around services, there are significant issues when we come to safe accommodation across the country, including in Carlow and my own area.  We need to have proper supports in place working through the local authorities, like education and counselling services.  As provision of women's refuges falls under so many different Departments, it is becoming a big issue and so are the services.  I am aware that it is under the remit of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I refer to all the other services involved, such as children's services and local authorities for a mother who needs to be housed.  If we do not get all the services right we are going to fall down.  Do we need to set up a group or what do we need to do to make sure that all the different Departments are involved?  It is not just one are; it is a lot of areas.  </p> <p>  I have spoken to the Minister several times about the cost of childcare.  I welcome that he is fully understanding of it and knows how much it is costing people.  He is addressing the issue of pay for childcare professionals with the funding.  These are issues that we really need to look at.</p> <p>  Child poverty has been mentioned.  In my own area of Carlow, families and schools have contacted me where children have left school because the mothers had to send them to a school with DEIS status to get the hot meals programme.  We have schools that do not quality for DEIS or are trying to get DEIS status.  That is another area.  We have seen so many cases recently.  The cost of living is another area that has really been affected here.  Parents have so many bills to pay with the cost of living, whether it is ESB, trying to put petrol in their car, trying to feed children or trying to pay the mortgage.  There are huge issues and they are all starting to come together.  We need to make sure that we address all areas.  </p> <p>  I want to ask about education.  It has come to my attention that the education and training board, ETB, and the back to education initiative, BTEI, are not accepting new learners from the Carlow early years training scheme for childcare modules.  This means any new participant who is starting on the childcare scheme will not be able to start their level 5 or level 6 childcare module until after September 2022.  They used to be able to do it in stages but this is not the case now.  The new curriculum participants are not being given the opportunity-----</p></speech>

On the medical card, the key issue with the enhanced medical card we will provide to 19,000 former residents is that it requires a legislative basis.  That has been the case in terms of survivors of the Magdalen institutions and survivors of the industrial schools as well.  We need a legislative basis for the provision of a large volume of medical cards.  That is why we are looking to move the legislation underpinning the institutions payment scheme as quickly as possible.  My official are working on the heads right now and we hope to have them to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On the issue of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, apologies to Deputy Cairns that I did not get to answer her question on that.  I might cover some of that as well.  I will be speaking about in the D&aacute;il later this evening also.  The consultation phase of the third national strategy on DSGBV will be launched soon.  That is being led by the Department of Justice.  Government has taken a strategic approach in that the issue and the Government's response to DSGBV will now be led by the Department of Justice.</p><p>The Deputy summarised the reason for that very well when she spoke about many Departments, agencies, local authorities and health services all doing little bits, which reflects fragmentation.  We recognised that in the programme for Government.  That is why we set up an audit to identify where everything is being done right now and how we can bring it together.  The Government has now taken that decision.  We will bring it together under the Department of Justice under a new entity that will be operated by that Department.  That will mean responsibility for the provision of refuge and those services to which the Deputy referred will not be overseen by my Department or by Tusla.  Responsibility for that will be transferred to the Department of Justice.  That is a strategic decision the Government has taken, recognising the major challenge we have with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in this country.  Centralising everything under that Department will allow for the delivery of the refuge spaces we need.  Everybody recognises we do not have enough refuges or refuge spaces.  There are significant parts of the country where counties like the Deputy's do not have such coverage and where in physical areas in larger counties it would take a hour and a half to drive to a refuge, which is an immediate disincentive to someone who might feel in real and desperate need.  There is a commitment under the capital allocation scheme, CAS, from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to finance refuge spaces but there is also a recognition that the CAS process is lengthy.  That is one of the problems we identified, namely, that it takes such a long time to build a new refuge, as well as there being a lack of spaces.  In our response to the accommodation review, which we hope to publish next week, again led by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, through the third national strategy, we will outline how we will address those particular issues.</p><p> The Deputy might drop me a note on the details of the child care education issue she highlighted in Carlow, which I will be happy to follow up with my officials.  </p><p> On child poverty, a key measure being taken is that we are investing in the EU child guarantee, an EU mandated approach to supporting free access to childcare, education and health for children in need.  The Government will be submitting its action plan to respond to the EU child guarantee by the end of March.  Our response to the EU child guarantee will be located within our wider successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, our all-of-government approach to children and young people.  That strategy ended in 2020.  We are designing the successor strategy now, addressing child poverty.  Making sure again that we have a co-ordinated all-of-government approach to addressing child poverty will be central to the BOBF successor strategy.  I will be working with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, in the Department of Rural and Community Development on the designation of a new child poverty reduction target that the country needs to adopt.  That is all those elements covered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#B00600"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  Since 2016, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, has made it a strategic priority to promote the rights and welfare of children in direct provision and those in the Traveller and Roma communities, and we believe they are only some of the children who are impacted by the past pupil criteria.  As members of the committee will be aware, the OCO has previously expressed concerns about the impact the past pupil criteria can have on children whose mother or father did not attend secondary school or who did not attend a particular secondary school.  We, therefore, welcome the provision contained in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020 which, if enacted, would remove the ability of schools to allocate 25% of places for the children, or grandchildren, of past pupils if they are oversubscribed.<br/><br/>It is important to recognise that the 25% allowance can possibly affect the ability of any child whose mother, father or grandparent did not attend a particular school to get a place in that school.  However, there are groups of children who can be particularly disadvantaged.  These include Traveller children whose mother or father may not have attended any second level education; children of immigrant parents who would not have attended secondary school in Ireland; children of parents with disabilities who may not have attended a mainstream secondary school; and children of families who have had to move to a different area to find accommodation due to a number of valid reasons, including the housing crisis, returning from abroad, promotion prospects and change in family circumstances.  They are all currently at a disadvantage because of the current wording.<br/><br/>Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, in 1992 and has an obligation under international law to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of all children living in Ireland.  Under the convention, a child has a right to an education and secondary education should be available and accessible to every child.  Article 2 of the UNCRC, which protects children from discrimination, is one of four general principles considered integral to the rights granted to children under the convention.  Article 2 protects children from discrimination in their own right and also protects them from discrimination they may suffer as a result of their connection to their parents.<br/><br/>While the UNCRC itself does not define discrimination, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, has found that while treating people differently does not always amount to discrimination, a difference in treatment will be discriminatory if it &ldquo;has no objective and reasonable justification&rdquo;, that is, if it does not pursue a &ldquo;legitimate aim&rdquo;.  From a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, children have a right to be protected from discrimination and harm and should only experience differential treatment if there is a reasonable or objective basis for this and if it is consistent with children&rsquo;s rights and their best interests.  The priority given to children or grandchildren of past pupils of schools cannot be seen to be a reasonable or objective basis for treating children differently.<br/><br/>We believe that schools should be fully inclusive and promote equality.  Education can be a way out of disadvantage for many students yet this provision seems to say that children who had parents and grandparents who went to a particular school can get priority in obtaining a school place.  This is undoubtedly leading to a continuing cycle of disadvantage for some children.<br/><br/>Goal 2 of the Department of Education&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 is to ensure equity of opportunity in education and that all students are supported to fulfil their potential.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	[E]quity of opportunity and inclusivity must be fundamental principles in our education system.  Our aim is to develop a system that welcomes and meaningfully engages all students, including those with special educational needs and students at risk of educational disadvantage. </blockquote> <p>By allowing preferential access to schools for one group of children over others, the State is failing in its own strategic aim to provide an education system which promotes equity of opportunity and inclusivity.<br/><br/>From a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, children have a right to be protected from discrimination.  Putting children without an intergenerational connection with a school at a disadvantage to those with such a link is discrimination by treating children differently when they are trying to access their education.<br/><br/>I am grateful for the invitation to meet today and I am happy to take any questions that the members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#C00100"><p>The National Parents Council Primary, NPC, welcomes the opportunity to submit its views to the joint committee.  At the core of all the work of the NPC primary and especially its advocacy and representation role is its vision statement, which states that the NPC wants to see an Ireland where every child has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  This vision statement speaks to equality and equity and lies at the heart of the discussion regarding the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2020.  Although it could be argued the current provision that allows schools to include admission criteria regarding family members having previously attended the school is implemented rarely, we must look to our legislation to set the tone for what we value in society.  It could also be argued that the legislation sets the tone to the effect that your history can define your future.</p> <p>  In recent years we have seen a dramatic change in communities, increased new housing developments, diversity in our populations and an increase in population mobility, all of which mean that our children are growing up in vastly different local communities from those in which their parents and grandparents grew up.  Any legislation that allows for possible discrimination within communities must be amended.  At the core of these communities are our schools and what happens within a school shapes the communities around them.  Who gets and does not access to a school something to the community around it.  Ensuring that a school&rsquo;s admission policy provides and is seen to provide equity of access for local children to their local school must be a priority.</p> <p>  The paramount right of parental choice regarding education is enshrined in our Constitution and is an important right for parents.  When oversubscription occurs in an individual school, however, that choice cannot always be accommodated.  It is the NPC&rsquo;s view that in choosing which parents' choice is accommodated and which choice is not, the school board of management&rsquo;s decision must be underpinned by fairness and equity.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to present to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss our research findings at this meeting.  The research, funded by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, focused on the discriminatory practices faced by children in accessing education in Ireland.  It was based on 30 semi-structured interviews with politicians, educators and representatives of various relevant interest groups.  These interviews were conducted prior to the commencement of Education (Admissions to School) Act 2018, but a common theme running through the research was that the Act, although undoubtedly a significant step in the right direction, did not go far enough in ensuring accessibility without discrimination to Irish schools.  As one participant put it, the law is &quot;inherently discriminatory and the law should be changed&quot;.<br/><br/>The discriminatory impact of section 62(10)(b) of the 2018 Act can be demonstrated by applying the provision to the facts of the well documented case of Stokes <i>v</i>. Christian Brothers High School Clonmel.  John Stokes, a child from the Traveller community, had applied for a place in the school, which was oversubscribed - the school had received 174 applications for 140 places - due to its strong academic reputation.  John Stokes met two out of the three criteria set out in the admissions policy in the event of oversubscription, but he did not meet the third because he did not have a family connection with the school.  His father, like most Traveller men of his generation, had not attended secondary school and he was the eldest child in the family.  Of those who satisfied the three criteria, 57 applicants were allocated a place on the sibling ground and 36 boys secured a place by virtue of the parental rule.  This meant there were 47 places left for the remaining 84 applicants.  A lottery was subsequently held and John Stokes, like 37 other boys, failed to secure a place.  Crucially, if the so-called parental rule had not been included in the admissions policy, there would have been 83 places available for 120 students.  In other words, John Stokes's odds of success in the lottery would have increased from 56% to 69%.  Importantly, for the purposes of our discussion here today, the subsequent decision to limit the number of places that could be reserved for the children of former pupils to 25% in the 2018 legislation would have made absolutely no difference whatsoever to John Stokes.  After all, 36 out of 140 places equates to 25.7%.<br/><br/>My view is that any admissions criteria in oversubscribed schools will result in discommoding certain students and families but it should not automatically discommode Traveller or Roma children, the children of minority ethnic groups, the children of same-sex or single parents, whose fathers might not necessarily be identifiable, or of those who are forced to move county or country for employment reasons.  I am very happy to discuss any of the issues raised in our research.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Barnardos here today to provide evidence on this important issue.  In 2020 Barnardos supported almost 18,000 children and their families.  We deliver evidence-informed outcome-focused services for children and their parents and careers in family homes, in schools and in our 45 centres throughout Ireland.  Our services are trauma-informed focusing on the impact of adverse childhood experiences on the lives of children and parents with whom we work.  We work with families to help them address issues affecting their children&rsquo;s development and well-being.  The children to whom we offer support are often living in complex and frequently chaotic circumstances, affected by traumatic life situations such as poverty, abuse, parental poor mental health, neglect, separation and parental addiction.  Education is often a primary route out of disadvantage for many of these children.</p> <p>  We support amending the existing legislation, section 62 of the Education Act 2018, which allows schools to adopt admission policies that reserve 25% of places for children of parents or grandparents who went to that particular school.  It goes against the spirit of Article 28 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognises children&rsquo;s right to education and provides that states must achieve this right on the basis of equal opportunity.  Section 62 also allows schools to introduce admission policies which could unjustifiably disadvantage many of the children we support.  For example, many of the children we support have parents and grandparents who struggled to engage with the education system themselves when they were children.  Some of the children with whom we work have parents who were not educated in this country.  It is inappropriate and unjust that these children should have less of a chance of attending a school that adopts section 62(10)(b).</p> <p>  The existing legislation sends out the wrong message to children, parents, grandparents and society as a whole.  It tells children that where their parents and grandparents did or did not go to school determines their future opportunities.  We know at a population level parental educational attainment affects children&rsquo;s future outcomes.  We should be adopting measures to address, not reinforce, this fact further.  Section 62 reminds parents and grandparents that their educational history may influence or restrict their children's and grandchildren&rsquo;s opportunities.  Limiting a child&rsquo;s educational options due to having parents or grandparents who they themselves had limited options is the epitome of promoting intergenerational disadvantage and discrimination.  A child&rsquo;s educational options should never be negatively affected by the education of their parents and grandparents.</p> <p>  Barnardos believes in children&rsquo;s rights and promoting policies that protect and enforce these rights.  All educational policies should seek to promote equality of opportunity and combat disadvantage, particularly given the lifelong impact educational attainment can have on the life of a child.  Maintaining section 62(10)(b) would be the wrong decision for children, regardless of how widespread its adoption is across schools.Giving consideration to the voice of children, we believe no child would want their opportunities limited by the where their parents and grandparents went to school.</p> <p>  The current section should be repealed in order to ensure equal opportunity for all children and avoid the discrimination of certain groups of children, potentially those who are experiencing vulnerabilities or facing disadvantage.</p></speech>

A common thread runs through them all.  I have a few questions.  Perhaps we could get from the witnesses a sense of how prevalent this problem is, not that the scale of the issue is the only reason to legislate, because one child in a family being discriminated against is one too many.  Could the witnesses give us a sense of how common this is?  Today we are discussing a codified selection criteria and how it can discriminate against some people.  That relates to my first question.  How pervasive is this in the form of discrimination where no formal criteria is in place?</p><p>Do schools need these formal criteria in order for them to make selections on the basis of family backgrounds?</p><p> Dr. Doyle stated that his view was that any admissions criterion in oversubscribed schools will result in discommoding certain students and families.  Which criteria are the most legitimate on which to make these difficult decisions?  What policies would result in the least discriminatory practices?</p><p> Can the witnesses think of any circumstances in which the current legislation is justified, or is it fundamentally unjustifiable and should be removed?  Is there an issue with gentrification where, due to the housing crisis, people cannot afford to live in communities in which they grew up?</p><p> How can the admissions process be simplified to ensure the filling in of forms is not off-putting for parents, especially with low literacy levels?</p></speech>

That has been well documented.  What is problematic about this provision, however, is that it is virtually impossible for certain minority groups to meet the criteria.  My argument is that any criterion that is virtually impossible to meet is fundamentally discriminatory and should be removed.  If everybody has an equal opportunity of gaining a place in a lottery, at least it is fair.  Somebody will obviously fall the wrong side of it, but a submission to this committee in 2019 stated that 57% of boys from the Traveller community have not completed primary school or entered secondary school.  Even in ten years' time, the effect of that will still be palpable.</p></speech>

I think we are right to say we have two admissions cycles done since it came in to being.  We should have it.  I had hoped that last week, the joint managerial board might have some figures, but it just said limited or small number.  That is crucial.  We should have those figures to hand to try to make a decision.</p> <p>  At the same time, one child discriminated against on this basis is too many.  Dr. Doyle outlined very well that we are in situations where this will be perpetuated.  The parents of children who come from direct provision and abroad will not have reached the criteria and the families will be disadvantaged for the next two generations.  We need to make sure we stamp it out and move it to a situation in which it is much more available to all children.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the form of the criteria.  A number of criteria are already there that do not need this one.  One can get two, three or four criteria that are in the locality.  The idea of education is to be local and available to those who live here and various other criteria.  If one moves to a lottery, everybody is equal.  It is never ideal.  A lottery is far from ideal.  However, if that is what one is left with, then it is equally available to all children.  That is the key to the future, as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

I would like to see all schools have availability for special needs children and all teachers rotate around special needs classes and all children get a chance to move around situations.  We could create a properly inclusive and engaged population of children.  The children who do not have special needs will recognise and understand engagement with children who do and <i>vice versa</i>.  They would become friends, know each other and see each other around the town.  The children with special needs would not be farmed away to somewhere else and know nobody when they came back to their home town.  That is what we need to move to as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Every year, we are inundated with distraught parents who have not got a place for their child for various reasons.  We see the most support from our cohort of parents for a place in a school to be given preference, if one has a sibling in that school.  Sometimes there may be six or seven years between siblings and one has had the experience of a school and it is important that one's next child has access to that school as well.  For the same reasons that have been spoken about before, we do not hold that because you has had a parent or grandparent in a school, preferential treatment should be given.  The movement of people for employment purposes or in other circumstances, for example, or even in the context of those returning to the country, it happens time and again that families cannot get children into schools.</p> <p>  One of the main things that crops up every year is that you will be offered a place in November, you do not get the school you was looking for, you may end up getting nowhere and you may find out the following June, July or August that you got a place.  From speaking to schools, it is all down to the fact that parents will enrol their children in as many schools as they can.  Parents will pay the fee to keep their children on the books and then decide at the end of the year to which school they want to send them.</p> <p>  All of those places are locked up within schools.  In terms of giving everybody an equal shot at places that are out there, we will hit peak numbers in 2023 to 2024.  They will start to decline slightly after that.  In terms of giving everybody absolutely equal access, we have to look at how school places are allocated and what happens when schools are oversubscribed.  That may be because a parent has accepted three or four different schools.</p> <p>  We should focus on a system whereby if you accept a school place, you are taken off the other lists.  That offers a free space at a time in the year where it does not become a crisis point and this is all dealt with in the same month or two, such as between the middle of October and the middle of November.  Schools would have some sort of a link that one could not have a child on the roll and accepted in two or three different schools.</p></speech>

I know from speaking to parliamentary colleagues that schools in other counties do not have that relationship.  I have spoken to the Department of Education about this issue.  Schools should be sharing information.  I know that there are issues regarding the GDPR, but my understanding is that was cleared up by the Department in order that schools would be able to communicate to see whose names were on various lists.</p><p>In Wexford, specifically in Wexford town, it is a huge issue.  Children could be on multiple lists not only in their respective towns but outside of them, in other areas such as New Ross or Enniscorthy.  I apologise to the Deputy for cutting in.</p></speech>

It works but that concept needs to be standardised.  We all appreciate the autonomy of each school but admissions need to be governed.  There needs to be more stable guidelines for schools where schools can have that communication or it can be centralised or they can have some sort of process.  Taking the area I know, a child can be on the lists of two or three schools in Wexford, on the lists of another two schools in Waterford and, more than likely, on the lists of another couple schools between Enniscorthy and Gorey.  They are not only staying within the county but they are going outside of the county as well.</p></speech>

Ms Fanning alluded to the complications that arise.  However, we cannot lose sight of what we are talking about in terms of what is permissible in an admissions policy.  They are two very different things.  While we might need to do much work around admissions and that issue of multiple applying, and why that even happens, the important point is that we need to make sure that what we allow in admissions policy is equal and fair.  Before we even get into who is going to what school and what lists they are on, we have a criteria for people being able to apply for admissions to a school.  I refer to the idea that we would have something within that admission policy that sets a tone for our society that allows for some children to have an unfair advantage in terms of getting into some schools over other children who will never reach those criteria.  The tone that we set, as a society, and the communication to children and families within communities that they are not allowed into this level of school is a dangerous one for us to continue to set.  Admissions administration is a difficult thing that we try to grapple with all the time and we need to continue to make that better but before we get there, we need to ensure we have an admissions policy that is equal and fair to all applying.  That is all I wanted to add.</p></speech>

It is about all children having equal aspirations.  We do not know how pervasive this issue is but we all share this idea that any child should know that if he or she does not get into a school, it is because he or she has lost a lottery, not because of his or her background.</p></speech>

This is an interesting topic and it benefits from having this lengthy deliberative assessment of it as opposed to just a quick debate in the D&aacute;il where a debate can sometimes be a bit superficial.  I have questions for Dr. Muldoon based on what he said.  Obviously, there are many parents who want their children to go to the school they went to and, in fairness, there is nothing necessarily wrong with that.  Some of the reasons are benign; it can be out of sentiment, affection or nostalgia.  However, Dr. Muldoon's point is that he does not look at this from the point of view of that child, parent or grandparent and that he must look at it from the point of view of the abstract child, a child who has been excluded as a result of the rule.  Do I take it from what Dr. Muldoon said that he believes there is no legitimate aim for the continuation of this statutory provision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#E00800"><p>That is probably the essence of it.  There is no difficulty with a child going to the school their parent went to if he or she lives in the community and fits all the other criteria but just because the parent went to that school does not give any pre-emptive advantage.  From our point of view, that is an automatic disadvantage which Dr. Doyle set out very well.  Many groups of children are two steps back because of it, and will be two steps back for the next two generations.  Again, it continues.  It is very clearly set out.  If your parent or grandparent today has not gone to that school, then you will not get into that school, so your child and your grandchild will not get into that school.  Straight away four generations are being affected and that is discrimination by its very essence.</p></speech>

Would Dr. Muldoon agree with that?</p></speech>

Based on everything I have said, it is the reason if there is a particular admissions criteria.  At the end of the day there are always going to be children and parents who, in an over-subscribed school, will not be happy with the result.  We have to make that unhappiness "fair", for want of a better word, so that everybody going into that process has an equal chance of being unhappy and an equal chance of being happy in terms of the selection.</p></speech>

It puts huge stress on those parents.  Invariably, once September comes, it seems to be sorted out.  It seems to put parents through an unnecessary amount of stress.  Does Ms Fanning think there is some centralised system that should apply in order to resolve that?</p></speech>

It is still going to involve choice.  On what basis does Dr. Doyle think schools should be required to choose their students?  Should it be principally on the basis of locality?  As Deputy Conway-Walsh said, I am conscious that in England house prices shoot up because houses are adjacent to schools that are much sought after by parents.  By what route do we go?  Every avenue seems to have potential problems.</p></speech>

From my point of view, what is really problematic with this provision is that while on the face of it, it is a neutral provision but it has a particularly discriminatory impact on certain people who are never going to meet the criteria.  To contrast it with the other type of criteria the Deputy mentioned, at least there is some possibility that the criteria may be met.  Obviously, geography and locality can give rise to situations where somebody might miss out because the cut-off point might be half-way through an estate.  That seems unbelievably harsh but at least there is some possibility of meeting the criteria whereas with this provision, it is virtually impossible for this cohort of children.</p></speech>

Most of it was welcomed.  Even the sibling rule did not provoke any opposition among the interviewees but it is important to remember that just because this provision is removed, it is not going to exclude every child who had a parent or grandparent in that school.  There will still be a large cohort of children there whose parent or grandparent went to that school, by virtue of the sibling rule or the various different criteria in regard to feeder schools, geography and so on.  It is a fact that this seems neutral on the face of it but in practice, and especially in particular areas where there is over-subscription, it is in effect blatantly discriminatory.</p></speech>

If the provision is removed, there will still be children whose parents went there going to a school.  There is nothing wrong with that <i>per se</i>.  What is wrong is if there is a statutory provision which excludes certain children because of the connection that another child has.</p></speech>

To put it a different way, many parents who were previously pupils also contribute to the school community, perhaps sponsoring teams, taking kids on placements during transition year and so forth.  Many other parents and grandparents have contributed nothing to the school community since leaving and their grandchildren and children benefit from this rule by virtue of that family connection, even though they have not contributed in any way.  I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question reminds me of a little ten-year-old girl I met whose mother attends Barnardos services.  She says that she wants to be a doctor.  I told her we will do everything we can to support her.  However, the odds are against her given her circumstances and because her mother depends so much on her and all those sort of things.  In the context of this discussion, I would like to be able to say to her, as I do, that all of us around her will do our best and that she can aspire to that.  That is what this is really about.  It is about aspiration, equality of opportunity and recognising that some children are just born into circumstances where the odds are against them unless we support them and there are possibilities for them to do well.</p></speech>

It is heartwarming to hear the support for the Bill, which I drafted.  What has been interesting this and last week is that this has opened up a wider discussion on the nature of Irish education and who it serves.  It is beginning to become clear that, effectively, it serves the patron.  What happens every year is that parents and children are at the heart of this scramble for what is perceived to be the better or best school in their area.  It is depressing that we have come to assume there has to be such a suggestion that one school is better than another and that not every school could be of a similar standard and have similar outcomes and resources.</p> <p>  I believe fundamentally that we need a Finnish revolution in Irish education.  We have 4,000 schools in a country that has the same population as Manchester.  We have schools competing against each other.  When there is that level of competition it leads to inequality.  This debate comes down to a scenario where some children are struggling to get into a school, and that should not be a reality.  I think all members of this committee, regardless of our background, agree that we do not want a scenario in which children are turned away from a school, for whatever reason.  If the State was front and centre in the provision of school places, there would be a school in each individual school district that could accommodate every child in the area, not the current multiplicity of schools that separate children on the basis of religion, gender and sometimes income.</p> <p>  With that in mind, what we have been doing in the past two weeks, unbeknownst to ourselves almost, is having a wider conversation about school provision, the patronage model and the lack of involvement by the Department of Education.  Within all that, I believe a certain sector that wants us to keep the generational bloodline of succession within its schools exercised a disproportionate influence over the Education (Admission to Schools) Act.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said last week, the relevant section in the Act is completely contradictory because another section in the same Act states there should not be familial advantage for any particular family.  Despite that, this provision, which does not read with the rest of the Bill, was wedged in at the behest of a certain strong lobby group.</p> <p>  I agree with everything the witnesses have said.  I do not have too many questions.  The only defence for this provision last week was along the lines, "Ah sure, it is never really used."  That is a pathetic excuse because even if one child in this Republic was on the rough end of this provision because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not attend the school, that knowledge would probably sit with that child for life.  It would make that child feel for life that they were just was not the same because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not have the same opportunities.  </p> <p>  It is funny because - my mother would probably kill me for saying this in public session but I will say it anyway - I am reluctant to ask in my own family whether all of my grandparents went to secondary school because I am pretty sure not all of them did.  I am still reluctant to ask that question because there is a level of shame attached to that.  Last week, Senator Eileen Flynn, who cannot be here today, gave very powerful testimony about how nobody in her family had been to secondary school - neither her father or grandfather - and how emotional she felt that this could potentially be a disadvantage to her.</p> <p>  Education is so personal and emotive.  It says everything, too much, about us.  For those trying to break through poverty, education is their only chance.  Family will provide help and support but for people who do not have education in their family background, education is their only chance of breaking through intergenerational poverty.  That is why a provision such as this is so wrong and elitist.  It goes against anything that education is supposed to achieve that because someone's father went to a certain school, that person has a better chance of attending it.</p> <p>  For someone who is not from this country or from a particular area and does not come from a tradition of school attendance, having any of these factors as a reason for not being able to attend a certain school would, as I said, have a lifelong effect.  It would also make that person feel that regardless of any genuine efforts to try to row in or to move into the mainstream, for example, by changing their accent or pretending to live somewhere else, changing the way they dress or cut their hair, they will never be let into the club because their father did not go to a certain school.  I imagine that would make some young people pretty angry, even if that is only one person.  </p> <p>  I saw some heads nodding when I brought up the contradiction within the Bill.  Does anyone wish to speak to that?  Apart from the emotional argument I made, there is also the legislative argument that it is legislative nonsense to have two provisions in the same Bill aspiring to two different things.  I appreciate the witnesses' support for what the committee is collectively trying to do.</p></speech>

However, when we talk to parents we find that choosing the schools they want their child to go to or not go to is a complex issue for parents.  The majority of parents will tell us it is a reputational thing and they want their child to go to the best school, as seen academically.  However, we also have parents who have other reasons for choosing a particular school.  The school may do a lot of sport or look after their child better because it seems to be a caring school or whatever else.  We need to make sure, when we are looking at the types of schools that parents are choosing for their children, that all schools can provide all of those things, rather than just looking at an educational reputation piece.  When we listen to parents' reasons for choosing a school, they are very complex.  In addition, for different children in the same family, there can be different reasons.  I just wanted to add that point.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions but I have some observations.  My degree was in law and I learned some of the rules of interpretation.  One of them is called the mischief rule of interpretation, which is the idea that one is trying to interpret something on the basis of the mischief it is trying to achieve or the problem it is trying to resolve.</p><p> I have heard of the Stokes case.  The objective of this legislation is to try to address that type of mischief.  Some of the discussion last week was around how frequently the issue in question arises.  In many respects, it does not arise very frequently, but the existence of the Stokes alone case justifies a response.  We do not know whether John Stokes would have got access to the Christian Brothers High School Clonmel if this rule had not been in place.  It has been clearly demonstrated that his chance of accessing the school was significantly diminished.  The existence of that case alone justifies the legislation.</p><p> In many parts of the country, enrolment policies are not a problem because schools are not oversubscribed.  That is how we would want it to be.  I have some sympathy with the argument made by some of the speakers last week that what we need to do ultimately is resolve the issue of inadequate supply of school places, which is a particular problem in the greater Dublin area, Wicklow, Kildare, Cork city, Limerick city and many of the big urban centres.  That is probably going to get worse before it gets better because there is a demographic bulge at primary level that is going to transition into second level.  Subsequently, it might, perhaps, be alleviated.  Ultimately, if there is going to be pressure on places, we need to resolve that issue, but there has to be equality in terms of how a limited number of places are going to be allocated.</p><p> I reiterate my support the legislation.  In terms of additional issues related to admissions, a good point was made last week by the Joint Managerial Body in regard to a potential two-year admissions process for children with special educational needs in light of some of the documentation and so on that is needed.  In terms of managing the transition, that is a fair point if any of the witnesses would like to offer observations on it.  There is an issue.  If people are living in an area where places are in short supply it is reasonable for them to try as many options as possible.  What is not reasonable is that once they are offered a number of places they are holding on that number of places.  There needs to be a cut-off in that regard.</p><p> I have a specific question for Ms Lynch of National Parents Council Primary in regard to an issue that I raised last week as well.  School planning areas are quite often large.  They can take in several towns.  A school can be located at one end of the school planning area.  This is mostly an issue for new schools.  This can mean that a child who is living within 2 km or 3 km of a school could be of a lower priority than a child who lives 15 miles down the road but who is still within the school planning area.  Dr. Muldoon may have come across this as well.  We need to figure out a more flexible approach in that regard such as, perhaps, a school that is on the edge of school planning area being able apply to the Department for a derogation and being able to identify its correct catchment area.  For me, the priority in terms of access needs to be the local child.  It has been well articulated that the children who could lose out in respect of this issue are those whose parents did not attend secondary school in Ireland and the children of Travellers and migrants who did not attend secondary school.  The local child needs to be at the heart of it.</p><p> I reiterate my support for the legislation.  I would welcome a response from the witnesses on the points I have raised.</p></speech>

A great deal can happen within families in two years.  We need to make sure there are no unintended consequences of any decisions.  It would be better for applications to be processed with more resources, better planning and earlier planning with regard to the child's needs.</p> <p>  On the school planning, I know of a lot of areas where this issue arises.  In one case, a new housing development is across the road from a school but it is not in the catchment area of that school.  It is exactly as described by the Deputy.  It is similar to the situation described by Ms Fanning in regard to Wexford where the local principals have come together to work that through.  I agree with the Deputy that we need a better process in place for schools to manage that such that local principals do not have to organise it themselves.  I agree that we need to look at that specific issue because it clearly is disadvantaging children who live across the road from a school if all of a sudden that school is not their local school.</p></speech>

These sorts of issues are foreseeable.  We just need the Department of Education to be proactive around rights and so on.  Planning permissions for the building of housing estates take to two to three years.  We need to identify the role for education there in terms of whether it has been planned for as part of that development.  Those things can be done.</p> <p>  On the issue of the child with special educational needs, I have no problem with forward planning for two years, but one cannot create a situation wherein children are disadvantaged through that forward planning.  We need to get our system working much more smoothly so that we can identify those children early, as well as their special needs and how they need to be met, so that the primary school is able to pass on that information quickly.  Improving all of the areas will make a difference in that regard.</p></speech>

It is arises particularly where a child with special needs is transitioning from primary to post-primary level.  That year is sometimes not enough.  It puts an awful lot of pressure on a parent to approach a school and to have those discussions in regard to supports for the child and whether or not it is possible for the child to go to a particular school or the child needs to go to a different school or a special school.  We have seen this occur a couple of times in terms of that transition.  Often, all of the supports that are in place at primary level do not necessarily transition to post-primary level or the particular school the child is to go to.  Parents often find that they have to condense all of their decisions and they have to do a great deal of footwork themselves to ascertain whether those supports can be put in place in the school in which the child has been enrolled or in the school into which he or she has been accepted.  The decisions could be made within the year but if the process around what might be available for that transition could be started earlier that would possibly alleviate much of the stress.</p></speech>

I listened remotely to what were very convincing arguments and all of the witnesses put fairness and equity at the centre of all they said.  I was struck by one particular comment, I think from Dr. Doyle, that no child's education should be impacted negatively because of his or her parents.  That is 100% correct.  The onus is on all of us to ensure that every child has an opportunity to excel in education in their own community.</p> <p>  From from my own experience of as a former teacher I know how important it is for all children that in every school, fee-paying or otherwise, we have a multicultural environment and a diverse classroom in terms of learning how we all deal with the world and our mixed society.  Dr. Muldoon made the point that we do not have the correct data.</p><p>Obviously, the real issue is that 20% of our schools are over-subscribed.  We should not have such a situation but we do and that is where is it at.  <br/><br/>We must deal with that 20%, no matter who the cohort is that will not have the opportunity to go their local school.  Last week it was suggested, and I agree, that we need to look at the timelines in relation to how parents and young people apply to schools.  It was suggested that it needs to be brought forward by at least 12 months so that people are not in a highly pressurised situation 12 months before school starts.  I also believe there must be some type of centralised system.  Many primary schools work together with a central admissions policy group but that is not happening at second level.  It can happen in an <i>ad hoc</i>or informal way but it is not happening in a formal way.  It is my belief that the Department of Education has a role to play in that and should be doing that.<br/><br/>In Newbridge, where I live, we have a huge problem with over-subscription that has been going on for about three years.  It is expected to continue for at least another two years until a new school is built.  Following a lot of pressure, agreement has been reached that somebody within the Department will work with the schools on the ground and with public representatives to make sure that every student has a place in secondary school next September.  The stress that it is causing for young people and their families is enormous.  It is not right and it absolutely should not be happening.  We had to push hard to get that from the Department but it is something that should be in place as a matter of course.<br/><br/>If there is over-subscription, what is the fairest way of dealing with it within a school or school community?  How should the Department deal with over-subscription to schools in a community?  How does it make sure that fairness and equity are at the centre of any solution, but with the understanding that some children are going to lose out somewhere along the line, unfortunately?  </p></speech>

At present people are applying to schools they do not live near and that changes the demographic of people who are applying.  It creates an opportunity for those schools so we will change things that way.  One assumes that the people who stop applying or who are not allowed to apply outside their area will then be available to other schools.  That changes things.<br/><br/>In terms of avoiding over-subscription <i>per se</i>, we have argued for many years that it requires forward planning and population planning.  That is something that every other country in Europe is well able to do.  They plan ahead, recognise where the population growth is going to be and allow for that.  We need to put a better system in place in that regard.  We need to develop the resources that will allow that to happen.<br/><br/>In terms of the subscription piece, there are criteria out there.  I was looking at the submissions that were made last week.  There are 220 post-primary schools in the ETB network and 27 community national school.  Only eight of those use the past pupil condition and only two had to invoke it.  There are criteria out there that people are using all of the time that are suitable and appropriate.  I am not going to name them all but I think most people are comfortable with the idea of a sibling so that families are not split up.  There are also discussions about mixed gender as opposed to single gender schools which might change the way families are allowed to enter schools and where they look for schools.  Those sorts of things need to be considered.  The discussion is well on its way here but I am not going to lay down criteria.  Discussions with the educators who are currently involved, with the principals and the groups who appeared before the committee last week on the criteria are necessary.  There are four or five clear criteria, including locality and other areas can be looked at and clearly moved forward but the idea of past pupil just does not ring true.  The Department of Education stated in its strategy that admissions policies must be equal and fair and it does not ring true to have a past pupil element.</p></speech>

That has to be the starting point for whatever we do.  The Senator is right about over-subscription.  We have been saying for so long that it is at 20% but I am not sure that is still the case.  When we talk to parents about this, locality and children mixing in their local community is hugely important.  That moves beyond the school and it means that the children they know in their local community are the ones with whom they go to school and the families know each other.  That is of central importance to families.  Again, there are lots of admissions policies that do not have a discriminatory path and we should look to those for how we go forward.</p></speech>

The choice is made under different criteria.  Parents ask what the post-primary school can offer their child, whether it is focused on particular things like sport, whether it is more academic or practical and so on.  Choices are made under different criteria and the geographic location of the school is not always a consideration.  Another issue that would have to be considered is the ethos of the school.  For many parents, the ethos is a very important and controlling factor in the choice they make.  It would even impact on schools that are primarily boarding schools.  Regardless of the reason it is considered appropriate for a child to attend a boarding school, that school would in most cases be outside of their community.  The criteria that would be used at primary level differs from the criteria applied at post-primary level and that must be acknowledged in any legislation.</p></speech>

The problem with this particular legislative provision is that it may discommode a Traveller child or a child who is in direct provision whose parent could not possibly have attended the school in question and that is just fundamentally unjust.</p></speech>
