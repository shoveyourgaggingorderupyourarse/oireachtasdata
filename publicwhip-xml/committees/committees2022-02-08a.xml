I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth.  The proposed format of today's meeting is that the Minister of State will make an opening statement and we will deal with Vote 29 on a programme-by-programme basis.  There are three programmes.  We will consider each of them separately, with questions from members of the committee.</p> <p>  I will read out the note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call the Minister of State to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#C00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to meet with the select committee to discuss the 2022 Estimates for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  I am accompanied by officials from the Department.</p> <p>  The total provision for the Department in 2022 is &euro;858 million, comprising &euro;700 million of capital, excluding capital carryover of &euro;58 million, and &euro;168 million for current spending.  This represents a 19% increase over 2021 and reflects the significant scale of ambition in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a climate-neutral, circular and connected economy and society.  Before I begin, I would like to bring to the committee&rsquo;s attention the updated programme and subhead structure in the Revised Estimates.  These changes better reflect the Department&rsquo;s statement of strategy, Le Ch&eacute;ile 23, which sets out our vision for the three-year period from 2021 to 2023.</p> <p>  I will now highlight some key initiatives across the environment and climate action, energy transformation, and circular economy programme areas.  The Estimates for programme D, the connectivity and communications programme, will be considered by the Select Committee on Transport and Communications tomorrow.  Programme A covers climate action and environmental leadership, including licensing and enforcement; monitoring, analysis and reporting on the environment; research and development; and implementation of climate action measures.  Programme A provides &euro;41.6 million in operational and capital funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to deliver its range of functions to protect the environment.  The EPA&rsquo;s 2022 allocation includes funding for additional staff resources in the Climate Change Advisory Council secretariat.  Some &euro;16.8 million is being allocated for environmental and climate research, including &euro;10 million for the EPA&rsquo;s programme of research and &euro;3.2 million for the climate action and modelling group to provide technical support for wider climate and environment policy development, as well as the implementation of the climate action plan.</p> <p>  A further &euro;15 million is being allocated for contributions towards international climate commitments, which will contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s goal to more than double the annual funding for developing countries to tackle climate change to &euro;225 million by 2025.  Some &euro;11 million is being provided for the national just transition fund, as well as a further &euro;21 million for expenditure associated with the EU just transition fund, including programme design, establishment of the programme authorities and initial programme expenditure once the programme has been finalised and approved by the European Commission.</p> <p>  Programme B, the energy transformation programme, supports Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for a net-zero emissions future by delivering energy-efficient measures across the residential, public and business sectors and by enabling the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure.  Some &euro;21.47 million is being provided to cover the operational costs of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, including an extra &euro;3.1 million for additional staff resources required to deliver its programmes.  Some &euro;46 million is being provided for improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewable energy in businesses and across the public sector.  Some &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue is being allocated to fund the SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes and &euro;109 million of that allocation will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in, or at risk of, energy poverty.</p> <p>  The 2021 climate action plan has set ambitious targets to retrofit 500,000 homes to a building energy rating of B2 or carbon equivalent and to install 400,000 heat pumps in existing buildings by the end of 2030.  The national retrofit plan sets out the policies and measures that will be implemented in order to deliver on these targets.  The plan indicates that new and improved SEAI grants will be a central element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to encourage homeowners to upgrade their homes.  In this regard, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is today bringing proposals to Cabinet that will represent the most significant reform of the SEAI support schemes since they were first put in place.  Subject to Government approval, the Minister will announce details of the changes later today.  A new low-cost loan scheme for residential retrofitting will also be announced in mid-2022.  This programme, funded in part by the Exchequer and in part by the EU, will enable credit institutions to offer loans at reduced interest rates, making energy upgrades more affordable.</p> <p>  In response to the exceptional rise in energy prices, the Electricity Costs (Domestic Electricity Accounts) Emergency Measures Bill 2022, which is currently going through the Houses, aims to establish a scheme for a once-off &euro;100 electricity costs emergency benefit payment to each domestic electricity account.  The scheme will apply to all domestic electricity accounts, including pay-as-you-go customers.  Approximately 2.1 million domestic account holders will benefit from this exceptional payment.  The cost of the scheme will be funded by the Department, with additional Exchequer funds to be made available by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Work is under way between both Departments to ensure that the necessary funding will be available when the scheme becomes operational.</p> <p>  Programme C, circular economy development, supports the transition to a circular economy, protecting and restoring our environment through sustainable resource use.  Some &euro;98 million is being allocated to the programme in 2022 to tackle environmental damage, manage waste, safeguard our natural resources and support the move to a circular economy.  This includes &euro;26 million of funding for the remediation of environmentally-degraded landfill sites.  Within this allocation, &euro;14 million is being allocated for the final phase of the remediation of the landfill at Kerdiffstown in County Kildare.  The programme also includes expenditure of &euro;2.5 million to target waste prevention, segregation and recycling and &euro;7.7 million for waste enforcement activities by local authorities.  Some &euro;13 million is being provided for Geological Survey Ireland, GSI, services, including the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  Geological mapping data from the Tellus project inform land planning and usage while INFOMAR is Ireland&rsquo;s national seabed survey and provides data to underpin the Irish marine development plan, Harnessing our Ocean Wealth.  Funding of &euro;33.5 million is being allocated to Inland Fisheries for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland&rsquo;s inland fisheries resource.  This includes an allocation of &euro;2.9 million towards the Loughs Agency, a North-South body that is co-funded on a 50:50 basis by the Department and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>  Appropriations-in-aid are income receipts of the Department other than from the Exchequer and they total &euro;10.5 million.  Receipts mainly comprise mining and petroleum income of &euro;5 million and also include &euro;3 million in receipts from additional superannuation contributions on public service remuneration, and GSI income of &euro;300,000.</p> <p>  I am very happy to take questions from the committee members on any details relating to the Estimates for programmes A to C within my Department.</p></speech>

We will commence with questions from members on programme A.  When posing their questions I ask members to clearly indicate the subhead they are referring to within the programme.  I also ask that they limit their questions to one subhead at a time as this will allow other members with questions on that subhead to speak before moving on to another subhead.  The same procedure will apply for the remaining programmes.  I call Deputy Whitmore.</p></speech>

That strategy has been in place since 2021.  What elements of the work that has been undertaken so far were not reflective of that vision?  It was an interesting comment to make when that vision is near completion.</p> <p>  Some &euro;11 million is provided for the national just transition fund.  The just transition commissioner is no longer in place.  His role was to engage with stakeholders and to establish the manner in which that fund was allocated.</p><p>Is all the stakeholder engagement now complete?  Is it just a matter of the Department spending money on projects that have been determined?  Does the Minister of State anticipate that some consultation will still be required?  How will that be undertaken in the absence of the commissioner?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00200"><p>I will invite the Deputy back in, if she wants to ask more specific questions on the subheads.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00300"><p>Our investment has to align with our strategy, which is rapidly changing.  We have a new climate action plan and rapid development of our policies.  We are constantly realigning our expenditure to meet our strategic goals.  The Deputy will see that the annexe to our climate action plan has very detailed items and, naturally, our expenditure has to align with those items.  Is the Deputy asking me to delineate the specific changes that were not there last year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00400"><p>I imagine that if a strategy was set up in 2021, all the actions of the Department would align with it and not that the strategy would be updated as the Department goes through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D00500"><p>Work was under way, but there is a new layout in the revised Estimates that has to be aligned with the Le Ch&eacute;ile programmes.  There has been a change in some of the subheads in the categorisation of where expenditure goes.  In some cases, some subheads have been combined, while in others they have been split out.  For better transparency, we have tried to make sure that the correct amounts of money are going with the correct subheads, for example, under just transition and the climate plan.  Did the Deputy have another question?</p></speech>

Is that role required in order to continue to consult with stakeholders?  Have the programmes already been set in train as such and it is now just a matter of implementing them, which is what the &euro;11 million is for?  The Department has a programme that is continuing in the absence of a central figure, in the person of the just transition commissioner, to manage it.</p></speech>

I will be interested to hear his comment on the impact indicators he has shown relating to greenhouse gas emissions in the full Estimates statement.  We had a 4% decline in emissions in 2019 and a 3.5% decline in 2020.  Clearly, the Covid-19 pandemic influenced the 2020 returns, but even with that 3.5% is surprisingly low for that year.  While we have been going in the right direction in respect of emissions for the past number of years, to what extent are special, Covid-related conditions underpinning that?  To what extent are we seeing genuine progress in the various sectors?</p> <p>  On the just transition commissioner, am I right in recalling that the programme for Government commits to legislation to establish a just transition commission on a more permanent basis?  I had the privilege of setting up the arrangement on an interim basis in the wake of the crisis in the midlands, but where are the plans for a more permanent legislative underpinning?</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear when the next call for the climate action fund is anticipated.  The money for it is not significant, relatively speaking, but in terms of a demonstration effect, it has been an important element in sustaining interest and progress in doing things in different ways.  I do not recall the last time there was a call and I would be interested to hear when it will next occur.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#D01300"><p>The Deputy's first question was about the reduction in emissions.  He is correct that there was a significant reduction in 2020 compared with 2019.  The question is to what extent that was caused by the pandemic and the obvious reduction in economic activity across sectors.  Clearly, there was a major drop in transport emissions during that year.  There was a reduction in 2021, but there was also a rebound.  We do not have figures yet for that.  We are trying to maintain economic growth to allow people to continue to enjoy their lives while their emissions are reducing.  The year, 2020, was an exceptional year and a lockdown is not the route to cutting emissions for the decade. </p> <p>  We know that our target is a 51% cut by 2030 and that we will not achieve it with an exact 7.5% cut from one year to the next.  That is not the nature of things.  We will have deeper cuts in the second half of the decade compared with the first half.  We had an exceptional cut in 2020, which will probably be followed by a rebound in 2021.  I expect emissions to be higher overall in 2021 compared with 2020; I think my officials will agree with me.  We do not yet have an estimate for that, but we will be back on a downward slope in 2022.</p> <p>  The next question related to the just transition commission and when it will be put on a statutory basis.  We will continue with the just transition commission.  We have to appoint somebody to be the permanent just transition commissioner.  I do not have a date for that, but I will come back to Deputy Bruton on it.</p> <p>  The Deputy's question on the climate action fund is about when the next call for expenditure under it will be.</p></speech>

Some of this may be related to the different way of presenting figures this year.  As I see it, there is a reduction in administration pay.  Does that relate to a staff reduction?  Why are we seeing that?  On A3, for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, we see a change in current versus capital expenditure.  Under the capital programme, was there a specific building project last year versus what is projected for the year ahead?  Under A8, the just transition fund, there is &euro;11 million versus &euro;34 million.</p><p>The reference is to the EU and Ireland.  Is this all Exchequer funding or will we earmark funds that will come through the EU just transition fund?  If that is the case, how is that divided?  Up to &euro;86.5 million is identified for the EU piece.  When will we see that?  Do we expect to see it?  How will it be spent?</p><p> How is the climate action fund referred to in subhead A10 budgeted for in the Revised Estimate?  I do not see a figure there.  Will there be an impact on the climate action fund on the basis of the biofuels obligation offset?</p></speech>

The fund is to address adverse affects of climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned and promote a balanced socio-economic condition.</p> <p>  Ireland will receive &euro;84.5 million from EU just transition funds over that period up to 2027.  That is the amount for this year.  The Government will complement this funding with Exchequer resources.  The governance and management of expenditure under this fund has to comply with just transition fund regulation from the EU and the EU's common provisions regulation.</p> <p>  The transition fund is Pillar 1 of the European Green Deal just transition mechanism and investments under the just transition fund may be complemented by a combination of grants and loans to private sector entities under a dedicated window of the EU's InvestEU instrument.  Ireland has to prepare a territorial just transition plan and accompanying operational programme for approval for the EU to secure access to EU just transition funds.</p> <p>  This plan will set out Ireland's proposed investment priorities, as well as targeted sectors and regions.

I welcome the Minister of State's note that the salaries have increased and there are 90 extra personnel in the EPA, which is very welcome.  I hear frequently from all sectors of society that there is a slowness in the process of the EPA in terms of issuing licences, decision making and so on.  We are in a situation in which we need to act very quickly to progress climate action and do what we need to do.</p> <p>  The Minister of State may not be able to answer my question today, but perhaps he will revert to us.  Has a needs analysis been done of the EPA?  Is it sufficiently funded to do what we need it to do, as quickly as we need it to do it?</p><p>I appreciate that it may not be a question the Minister of State can answer here and now but the committee would welcome that level of information from the Department.</p></speech>

Other Deputies have raised issues that companies were having with the EPA in obtaining determinations of licences.  I was keen to ensure that this was not due to a lack of resources and that the EPA was properly resourced so I made inquiries to ensure the agency had what it needed.  I understand progress has been made.  Deputy Whitmore raised the case of a particular company and I understand it obtained a determination in the end.  However, it should not take years to reach decisions.  Inquiries were made into why things were taking so long.  We made sure there was sufficient funding in place this year.  There should be better communication with those applying for determinations of licences and there should not be a situation where forms are not correctly filled in, information is not available and applicants need to go back and forth.</p> <p>  It is also important to say that we have to ensure the determinations are made carefully.  For example, a large number of houses will probably be demolished because they were defective or had mica blocks in them.  It is important that the waste material from that demolition does not re-enter the construction stream to be used a second time and that a determination is not made that this is a useful material for load-bearing walls or suchlike.  It is not just a case of rapidly agreeing that everything that needs to go back into recirculation should be licensed as such.  That said, the system needs to be sped up.  I believe the EPA has sufficient funding this time and its budget is not a constraint at this stage in that area.  I recognise, however, that there were problems.</p></speech>

When will the export tariff scheme be in place and operational?  On the same subhead, the targets for retrofits were 21,544 in 2021 and 19,400 in 2022.  I ask the Minister of State to speak to that, please.</p> <p>  On outputs, the target for the number of lower income households provided with energy efficiency upgrades is lower for this year than last.  In 2021, the target was 5,800 and in 2022 it is 4,500.  I know there is a note on that but I ask the Minister of State to speak on it.  It states that the number of homes is lower than target for the previous year but this is because of a shift to deeper energy efficiency measures resulting in more energy and carbon dioxide savings.  I raise that in the context of the national retrofitting plan that we will hopefully see later today.  Sinn F&eacute;in specifically asked questions around the options to achieve reductions in emissions.  For example, what is the difference between 20,000 houses moving to a BER C2 versus 20,000 houses moving to a BER B2?  Is a different approach by the Department planned for in these figures?  The headline figure is still to have 500,000 deep retrofits and 400,000 heat pumps installed.  Is it planned to do this in a different way and, if so, are there cost implications from that?</p> <p>  Are there targets for the expansion of the sustainable energy community, SEC, programme?  I know there are targets for 2030.  How do they relate to 2022?  What kind of expansion do we hope or expect to see?  From meeting members of some of the sustainable energy communities, I know there was talk of a new funding model or type of grant or fund where sustainable energy communities would be rewarded for good progress and the amount of retrofits done in a community.  They referred to it as a LEAF or local energy assessment fund.  I do not know if that rings a bell with the Minister of State.  What are the plans with that?</p> <p>  The &euro;100 electricity rebate is coming from departmental energy efficiency funding and broadband funds.  From where exactly is that money coming?  What implications will that have for the roll-out of the affected schemes?  I am particularly interested in how those on long waiting lists for retrofitting works will be prioritised in year one.</p></speech>

This is one of those meetings where another meeting is taking place at the same time at which the numbers will be changed.  I think it will be a dramatic change.  I will not guess what the Cabinet will approve today but I understand it is possible the increase in those numbers will be significant and dramatic.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about deeper and more shallow retrofits and how one accounts for them.  That is a very good question.  To say we will retrofit 20,000 homes without saying if those will be deep or shallow retrofits is not clear.  We need a way to account for them.  As the information note puts it, a reduction in the number of homes retrofitted could still lead to an overall increase in the amount of carbon dioxide saved.  We need to be clear to each other in explaining what is being done.</p> <p>  I expect there will be increased funding for shallow retrofits this year.  This will be for people who are unwilling to embark on a whole deep retrofit, even with a large grant or loan, but are prepared to do it in steps.  They might be prepared to do their attic and walls and might be prepared to install a heat pump later.  That would be done step by step with a smaller total budget for each step of the way.  It is a matter of responding to that kind of demand from the public since not everyone is willing to take on a &euro;50,000 retrofit, even where &euro;25,000 of the cost is covered by a grant.  There are those for whom even &euro;3,000 would be a more reasonable amount.  This will result in a larger number of smaller steps to achieve an outcome.</p></speech>

A pensioner who had cavity wall insulation done ten years ago cannot go back to the SEAI now for a grant for attic insulation because of the one-visit rule.  Will that rule be removed?  Will such persons be able to avail of a further grant for, say, attic insulation?</p></speech>

I think that will form part of the national retrofit plan today.  That will depend on the decision taken by the Government today.</p><p>The right thing to do is to say to people that although they did an upgrade, they are still eligible to do the second stage.</p><p> To go back to the Deputy&rsquo;s other questions, he asked me about the SEAI target for 2022.  The number we have been discussing is the SEAI target for 2022 and that is the number that is likely to change as a result of the Government decision today on the number of homes.</p></speech>

It is in the legislation we were working on in the D&aacute;il last week.  The funding for it is to come 50% from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, so long as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform agrees to that, and 50% from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  It is to be done through a reallocation from other divisions but I do not think those divisions have been decided yet, so it has not been allocated.  The Deputy suggested it would come from energy efficiency but I do not think that decision has been made.  In other words, &euro;107.5 million will have to be reallocated from other divisions within the Department.</p></speech>

I wonder about the low-cost loans scheme.  One of the risks is that there will be a significant number of people who will not be in a position to take out a loan upfront in order to do retrofitting and those people may not be eligible for something like the warmer homes scheme.  Has the Department done an analysis on the number of households that will fall into that financing gap and what will be available for them?</p> <p>  The next point follows on from Deputy O'Rourke&rsquo;s point on the figures.  If we look at the figure of 19,400, that is not necessarily to the rating of B2, and this is specified and brought out in more detail in the third point, which states that 8,640 will be to a B2 level.  The programme for Government and the Government commitment is for 500,000 at B2 level.  Is it the case that out of that 500,000, only 8,640 have actually been upgraded to B2 level so far?  That would leave 491,000 houses that still have to be brought up to that B2 level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.90" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12022020800002#G01600"><p>The timeframe for this is the middle of this year.  The target interest rate is 3.5%.  It fits into the loan category of the available green loans, and there are green loans from the post office at 4.5%.  If people have a mortgage, which many do, they can refinance and probably get it at a lower rate than the 3.5%, perhaps at between 2% and 3%.  It is to fit into that category of loan.  The idea is that the loan will not be secured on people&rsquo;s property and it is a non-recourse loan.  The idea is that it covers the portion of the retrofit that people cannot afford or that is not covered by the grant, assuming people do not have their own resources to pay for it.  Not everybody is going to do a deep retrofit, so it is possible for people to do a much smaller retrofit starting from around &euro;3,000, where the person is only putting up &euro;600 of the capital themselves.  The loan could be as low as that and it is over a period of years and is a non-recourse loan.  The idea is that people are not frozen out because they have to take on some giant amount of money.  They can do it step by step.</p> <p>  It will be mid-2022 before that loan scheme is ready.   The idea is also that the loan is to some extent guaranteed by the State, so it is possible to lend to people who have poor credit to insulate their homes so they can save money and will be able to make the payments out of the reduced energy bills they will have in the future.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the accounting for shallow retrofits and deep retrofits, and how many of the 500,000 have to get to B2.  Last year, 2020 to 2021, some 4,600 B2s were achieved and 8,640 is the target for this year.  However, that does not take into account all of the people who have come some steps closer to B2 and who will take another step to move on.  There is also the fact that the funding for this is coming from the carbon tax.  As the decade moves on, more money will be available for more retrofits and given the scale-up of the available capacity in the labour market to deliver this, the amount of funding available increases each year, so it is going to be a programme that will have more going on in the second half of the decade than the first half.</p></speech>

They have been combined.  I guess the matter Deputy Whitmore was just asking about, that is, the &euro;26 million for landfill remediation, which is a very large amount of money, is being moved over, so that would explain that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be aware from our constituency of the issue of the north beach in Bray, as indeed will Deputy Whitmore, and the funding that has been required to maintain that particular former landfill site.  When she asked her question on landfill remediation it prompted a concern about the waste management programme and what that entailed when I saw an increase.  However, if it is a reallocation, that is fine.  Let us just hope the funding continues because it is much needed for those sites.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#B00500"><p>I thank the Chair.  I am grateful to my colleagues here for their assistance in compiling the detailed briefing for both myself and the committee.  I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Revised Estimates for my Department for 2022, including that of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  As members will have seen from the briefing material provided to them last week, my Department is projected to spend &euro;2.074 billion on current expenditure and &euro;33 million on capital expenditure during 2022.  This represents an increase of &euro;189 million or 10% over the 2021 Revised Estimate.  In addition, my Department has a further &euro;3.2 million allocation for capital carryover.</p> <p>  The 2022 allocation covers financial provision for a range of key services in respect of children and young people, such as Tusla, early years and youth services.  There are also allocations in other key work streams, which include provision of accommodation for international protection seekers and refugee resettlement and other services for international protection applicants.  Legacy issues in relation to mother and baby institutions, and birth information and tracing are also funded.  In addition, there are allocations towards the areas of equality, integration and inclusion.  This includes funding towards gender equality, human rights, LGBTI+ issues, Traveller and Roma issues, migrant integration and disability policy.  </p> <p>  In 2021, we again faced the challenge of Covid-19.  As with 2020, the last year again saw significant impact from the pandemic on the work of my Department and its agencies.  The early learning and care sector, Tusla, youth services, equality and international protection accommodation have been particularly affected.  However, it is important that I acknowledge the tremendous efforts which continue to be made across the whole of our sector in response to the pandemic.  It has been an extremely challenging time for us all and hopefully 2022 will see us start to normalise life with our focus moving from reactive towards more developmental in nature. </p> <p>  To outline my Department&rsquo;s Vote in more detail, I have provided the select committee with details of the funding allocations across the different programme areas, along with a summary by subhead, including details of changes over the 2021 figures.  In terms of Vote spending, three areas of the Vote represent 89% of the Department&rsquo;s allocation, namely Tusla, accounting for 43%, early years programmes and schemes, accounting for 34%, and international protection accommodation, accounting for 12% of the overall allocation.  I will now briefly address these areas in turn.   </p> <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Estimate includes provision of &euro;898 million for Tusla, an increase of &euro;40.5 million or 5% over the 2021 allocation.  This funding will allow Tusla to respond to a number of challenges such as addressing increasing demand for their services and developing their mainstream residential services for children.  The budget will allow for the improvement of ICT systems and data management processes, particularly in the aftermath of the HSE cyber attack in May of last year.  It will also allow for additional posts to be funded, including 100 front-line staff and 48 residential care workers, and to meet expected demand arising from forthcoming birth information and tracing legislation.</p><p>It will allow Tusla to support the community and voluntary sector, which delivers services on its behalf.  It will maintain support for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services and address recommendations arising from Tusla&rsquo;s accommodation review of refuge provision.</p><p> Another significant portion of my Department&rsquo;s spending is on early learning and care, which has an overall allocation of &euro;716 million - a &euro;78 million increase on the 2021 allocation.  The funding requirements for this area have been significantly impacted by Covid.  Funding in 2022 allows my Department to continue to meet the costs of the two-year early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and the associated access and inclusion model, AIM, which supports children with additional needs to access the ECCE programme.  The allocation for the national childcare scheme, NCS, will meet the costs of delivering the scheme and support the sustainability and operation of the early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC, sector.  The funding provided in 2022 will also allow for the extension of the age of eligibility to access the NCS universal subsidy to 15 years, and this will be made available to all families. </p><p> Funding is also being allocated to introduce a new core funding model from the autumn.  Under the new scheme, in return for a commitment that fees to parents will not increase, providers will be supported in meeting their operating costs, including increased costs related to improved quality measures.  The funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff and establish career structures.  We will introduce or improve other features of provision that contribute to quality, such as non-contact time, planning, training, and curriculum implementation.  The additional investment will also support the programme for Government commitment to support the drawing up of an employment regulation order.</p><p> The allocation for costs associated with the provision of accommodation for international protection seekers has seen an increase of &euro;41 million to &euro;259 million in 2022.  The allocation includes funding towards implementing the recommendations of the White Paper to end direct provision and to establish a new international protection support service.  For the first time, this allocation has a capital allocation, amounting to &euro;12.5 million, to progress this key priority.</p><p> International protection seekers&rsquo; accommodation is a demand-led service with requirements for accommodation and services increasing as numbers of new international protection applications increase.  In the latter half of 2021 there has been a sharp increase in the number of new arrivals seeking international protection accommodation in Ireland, with more than 2,260 new arrivals in the period from 1 November 2021 to 30 January 2022.  This funding will continue to provide accommodation to those seeking international protection and to cover the projected increase of costs.  This estimate is based on the likelihood that there will be pent-up demand for international protection accommodation in 2022, as previously closed off routes reopen.  A new procurement competition for accommodation is now under way to reduce reliance on short-term emergency accommodation and to ensure that the Department has sufficient accommodation capacity.</p><p> As well as providing for increased demand, I am progressing my pledge to replace the current system with one that respects the dignity of those seeking international protection.  I established a transition team in my Department last year to drive the implementation of this new model on a phased basis to 2024.  This year, the initial capital allocation of &euro;12.5 million will be used for the acquisition of accommodation with a focus on acquiring turnkey properties and properties that require upgrading or renovations.  Current funding will provide for the roll-out of an approved housing body scheme so that they can begin to bring properties on stream and develop a pipeline for accommodation.  It will also be used to roll out a rent-a-room scheme and source private tenancies to increase the availability of accommodation.  I have a commitment from within the national development plan that as capital requirements in this area increase, additional funding will be provided to progress this important priority action area.</p><p> With the rest of the Vote, there are of course other policy areas that will be progressed in 2022.  The 2022 Estimates contain provisions to support overall management of the Government&rsquo;s action plan for responding to the needs of former residents of mother and baby and county home institutions.  This includes certain key actions, including at the Tuam site on foot of the proposed certain institutional burials (authorised interventions) legislation, research and commemoration initiatives.  My Department is working on information and tracing legislation to allow access to birth information for adopted persons and additional funding has been provided in the Estimates to Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland to support the implementation of this legislation.</p><p> The 2022 Estimates will allow me to continue to provide funding in the important areas of equality, disability, inclusion and integration.  These are very significant and challenging areas and the Vote includes funding streams for areas such as the National Disability Authority, refugee and migrant integration, gender equality, LGBTI+ and Traveller and Roma initiatives.  As I mentioned earlier, these areas are in receipt of additional funding in 2022.</p><p> The 2022 Estimates have seen an increase of &euro;3.5 million for youth services to more than &euro;73 million.  This level of funding will support the delivery by the voluntary youth work sector of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities.  I believe that the youth sector is essential to reach and address the most marginalised and vulnerable young people.</p><p> In conclusion, the significant increase in resources under my Department&rsquo;s Vote for 2022 allows for the continuation of vital services to some of our most disadvantaged communities while providing for a number of important opportunities for a targeted development and improvement of services.  Deputies may be assured that I will continue to work closely with all sectors and stakeholders, as we strive to maximise outcomes from the resources being considered today.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention and I will be pleased to respond to questions. </p></speech>

I thank the Minister for that outline of the revised Estimates.  There is much to welcome, particularly the increases as outlined by the Minister.  The capital allocation for international protection seekers is very welcome also.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions related to adequacy of funding, and whether the increases the Minister has described are sufficient to meet the greatly enhanced commitments for his Department.</p> <p>  The increase under the Tusla section is welcome but I am conscious that the Minister has said he will need to fund quite a significant number of additional posts arising from the expected increased demand due to the forthcoming birth information and tracing legislation.  This committee was very actively engaged in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022.  I believe I can say that it is a matter of disappointment for us as members of the committee that the recommendation we made as to the mode of communication with adopted persons where a birth parent has expressed a no-contact preference.  That recommendation was not taken up by the Minister's Department in the shape of the legislation.  That is disappointing to us.  It is relevant in the Estimates because we had recommended the communication would be by way of registered post.  I am conscious there would be a significantly increased cost with regard to staff time in the alternative method of communication by phone or by meeting, which is provided for in the Bill.  Will the Minister say whether there is sufficient funding here?  The Minister is saying 100 additional front-line staff, but will that be enough to meet the demands coming from the new legislation?</p> <p>  On the early years funding allocations the Minister has spoken about the new core funding model.  Clearly, huge expectation has built up among parents, providers and staff on that, and that it will be in place from the autumn so we would actually see significant reductions in childcare fees for parents.  It is a huge issue across my constituency in Dublin Bay South.  The cost of childcare is a huge issue for everyone.  The Minister has described an increase of just over 10%.  Will this be an adequate allocation to really create that radical change in the core funding model that parents, providers and staff are all expecting in the childcare and early years education sector in the autumn?  Perhaps the Minister will say more on that.</p> <p>  On the mother and baby homes, the Minister does not refer in his speech to the amount that will be needed for setting up the redress scheme.  Again, we are expecting to see that redress scheme for survivors in place by the autumn.  I am aware that at page 31 there is a more detailed document where the set-up costs are described as being provided for within the funding that the Minister has outlined.  I believe that the Minister's document says that the financial payments will be allocated separately, which is the actual payment of redress to survivors of mother and baby homes.  Will the Minister expand on where that is going to come from, whether it will be within this year's allocation, or will it be pushed forward into the budget for 2023?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#C00400"><p>A significant additional investment overall in Tusla this year of more than &euro;41 million extra follows on from the largest ever increase Tusla received last year of &euro;66 million.</p><p>Much of that focused on the recruitment of additional staff.  As the Deputy said, there will be more than 280 new staff recruited to Tusla in 2022, with 100 of them front-line staff and 48 of them related to residential placements, with which we know there is a significant issue.<br/><br/>In terms of how that breaks down to resourcing the information and tracing legislation, 30 of those staff will be allocated to the implementation of the information and tracing legislation.  A genealogist is included in that group thus recognising that a wider range of skills and expertise are needed within Tusla to fully implement the range of tasks and responsibilities that it will have.  Tusla will be better empowered to undertake tracing with the statutory basis that it will be given under the information and tracing legislation.  I know from my engagement with groups who represent adopted people, they felt that the genealogist skills was one that the organisation lacked, and that is something which is recognised by myself and the chief executive.<br/><br/>Please note that we have provided an extra allocation to the Adoption Authority of Ireland of &euro;1.3 million to allow it to undertake its functions under the information and tracing legislation.  That will allow for the hiring of additional staff, a new head of records, a new archivist, and new administrative staff to provide support.  The money allocated to AAI and Tusla will support both organisations with the information campaign that will be rolled out, once the legislation is passed, to inform parents, adopted people and people who have questions about their birth and origin, and about their rights under the provision of the new legislation.<br/><br/>On the provision of core funding under the early years allocation, the allocation has been significantly increased and the central part of that is core funding.  A sum of &euro;16 million has been provided this year and that will equate in a full year, in 2023, to &euro;207 million.<br/><br/>In terms of adequacy, core funding supports services because we recognise that many services struggle in terms of their own sustainability.  We want to enable the payment of better wages for staff.  We want to be able to deliver on the pay scales that we believe will be provided by the Joint Labour Committee and the employment regulation order, which I hope will be agreed soon between employer and employee representatives but that requires the State stepping up with this very significant additional investment.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>for that, with services, is the agreement to freeze fees.  For the first time in the history of the State, we now have a mechanism to stop the increase in fees that we had seen, particularly dramatically prior to Covid.  If one considers the level of fee increases in the last two years, they have actually been quite small.  In 2021, it was only about a 1% fee increase on average.  That is primarily because of the very significant State support that was provided through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, which meant that services were sustainable and did not have to increase their fees.  The EWSS will be withdrawn by the end of April.  The new core funding will kick in from September of next year.  The allocation also contains a bridging or transition fund of &euro;37 million, which will continue to support the sustainability of services in May to August of this year.<br/><br/>We are very clear that this is not the end of our investment in this area because, as the Deputy rightly said, we need to ensure we can cut the cost and enhance affordability for parents.  The first step towards that is a fee freeze and the next stop is increased investment in the national childcare scheme, NCS, that directs subventions parents receive.  I have been very clear, and I think that all three parties in government are very clear, that in the next budget and in following budgets we want to see significant additional investment in the NCS.  We saw the beginning of that this year in terms of the removal of the wraparound hours, which will kick in spring and benefit about 5,000 children from disadvantaged families.  We will see the next part of that in September of this year when the increase of the universal subvention from three up to 15 years kicks in, which will benefit thousands of families.  We are very clear that more money will continue to go into the NCS and because we will now have a fee freeze, parents will see the difference.  I say that because, as we saw in previous years, when the Government put more money into the NCS it was immediately eroded by fee increases that service providers implemented.<br/><br/>Finally, in terms of redress, the allocation for redress is not contained in these Estimates.  It will be the subject of a Revised Estimate, I imagine, for 2022 and then, I suppose, the subhead will be built in from budget 2023 onwards.  The final package on redress was not agreed at the time of the budget.  As members will know, we announced it in November of this year following the budget.  We hope to be in a position to enable people to start to draw down payments in 2022 about which I am absolutely determined.  I will work with the committee and everyone else to make sure the legislation gets through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible but at that point, it will be the subject, I imagine, of a supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

In these revised Estimates, does the Minister believe there is enough in terms of safety to deal with the challenge that private services pose to Tusla?  Over recent years there has been a significant growth in the private services used by Tusla in residential and foster care.  These are more expensive services than we get from Tusla units and foster carers.  They are more vulnerable to price increases and shocks.  Also, private residential units are not covered by HIQA so we do not have the same level of oversight.  There is general inflation and I am concerned that it will be used as an opportunity to increase prices.  That means one will be left with young people in a private care that, realistically, Tusla can no longer afford.  However, it would be devastating to that young person's care plan and placement to move him or her out.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the private foster care issue.  Private foster care placements cost between three and three and a half times as much as a Tusla placement.  That drains the budget for Tusla and makes its recruitment and service development harder to achieve within budget.  Ultimately, that creates a situation where there is going to be greater demand for the private placements to fill even bigger gaps in Tusla and so on.  In addition, this becomes self-fulfilling and self-replicating.  Can the Minister tell us what he is doing to limit the amount that Tusla spends on private services that are a structural weakness within Tusla's current arrangements?</p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme of Government to provide inhouse therapeutic services within Tusla.  Is there sufficient room in these Estimates to develop the services in the coming months?</p> <p>  The failings of the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, have become very public.  They are well known and have been well discussed but they are certainly becoming very public.  I think that inhouse therapeutic services are an essential element to provide very deeply traumatised and hurt young people in care with the appropriate services that they need.</p></speech>

I am seeking to ensure that there is a budget for that commitment in the programme for Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#E00200"><p>I share the Deputy's concern about the very significant reliance by Tusla on private services, both for private residential and foster services.  I think there is a role for them, but it should be to deal with sudden spikes in demand rather than being a central element of provision.  Over the years, the private sector has had to become too great an element of the central provision of Tusla services.  I think that is something Tusla recognises.  One of the things I have been able to do this year, with the extra &euro;41 million that is being invested in Tusla, is ensure that &euro;3 million of that goes to Tusla residential care for the enhancement of mainstream residential care provision.  As I noted, that will include the hiring of 48 additional staff for mainstream residential care.  That is an important enhanced investment in Tusla's own capacity to provide residential care placements.</p> <p>  As we know, Tusla also significantly relies on the community and voluntary sector for residential care placements.  Some of the additional &euro;6 million that is being provided under these Estimates to the community and voluntary sector, for which Tusla provides finance, will also no doubt support enhanced provision of residential care in the community and voluntary sector.  We identified this as an issue and it is one we are seeking to address.  However, it will not be solved in one budget. as I am sure the Deputy will understand.  The enhancement of Tusla's own ability to provide residential care placements is very important.  We are definitively investing in that in this year's budget.</p> <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop in-house therapeutic services.  I visited the Dublin north central therapeutic hub before Christmas.  I met with the team there, both in its headquarters and its community building on Manor Street.  I saw the benefit of such intensive supports for young people who have come to Tusla's attention.  I am pleased we have been able to dedicate part of the &euro;41 million to supporting that service.  Some &euro;700,000 is being provided under Tusla's business plan this year for the enhancement of therapeutic services for children in care.  The pay element of that will cover the cost of hiring eight whole-time equivalent staff specifically in that area.</p> <p>  There are also a number of other mandates for Tusla under its business plan this year.  The mapping of all existing Tusla and Tusla-commissioned therapeutic services has been revised into a great framework for therapeutic services for children.  There is a requirement for a multidisciplinary assessment and care plan for children who require therapeutic services as well.  To be able to provide a similar hub in all Tusla regions will require sustained investment but we are making a start on that.  It is an enhancement of Tusla services, to which I am committed.</p></speech>

I will start with the cost of childcare.  I think everyone recognises that parents pay far too much for the service they get.  I commend the Minister and his officials on their efforts to reduce costs substantially in a way that will be impactful for all parents.  When he was before this committee previously, the Minister mentioned that an expert group was reviewing the funding model and specifically looking at targeted areas in which additional funding could be put to use for those who are at a disadvantage compared with others who can afford the cost of childcare.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the options the expert group is working on and proposing to address the issue and alleviate some of the burden on parents.</p> <p>  I welcome the provision of an additional &euro;40.5 million for Tusla.  Will a proportion of that be allocated to the family resource programme or any capital projects?  I note that in 2021 there was an underspend of &euro;3.5 million in the Department's capital allocation.  I would like to understand how that happened.  Was it due to delays to some projects?</p> <p>  The third issue I raise relates to the international protection accommodation services support.  I welcome the establishment of the service and the capital support in the region of &euro;12.5 million that was announced.  For what specifically will this fund be used?  What types of accommodation is the Department looking at in terms of build or modular examples?  I would like to get an understanding of that on the basis that we are in a housing crisis and there are constraints, including skills shortages.</p> <p>  I know the mental health youth task force, the Pathfinder project, is a cross-departmental project led by the Department of Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  There has been a lack of action on the project since its establishment in 2016.  As a member of the Cabinet, I ask the Minister to ensure some focus is placed on this issue in 2022 and that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth forms part of the overall cross-departmental approach in order to implement long-lasting change around youth mental health.  I know the Minister is passionate about this issue and we all want to make an important contribution in this area.  I ask for support for it, including through the Minister's Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#E00700"><p>On the cost of childcare, the Deputy is absolutely right that childcare is too expensive in this country.  Parents pay too much and staff in childcare are not paid enough.  That is something we are seeking to resolve.  We are taking a step-by-step approach to the issue.  We made the call that this year we would focus on supporting services to better pay their staff because we are seeing a huge turnover in staff at the moment.  Young people - let us be honest, it is young women - who study for three or four years to get a level 7 or level 8 qualification start in childcare and find they are being paid less than they were in the temporary or part-time jobs they were doing to support themselves at university.  That is not sustainable and it is the reason we are looking at the issue.  We have established a joint labour committee for the sector and we are seeking an employment regulation order to set a payscale for the different levels, such as entry level, room leader level and manager level, and to have those implemented.</p> <p>  Many service providers are just breaking even and some are not even breaking even.  They need additional support.  That is why we have provided the core funding.  That was one of the recommendations of the expert group.  We engaged with the group while it was doing its work and actually brought in core funding before the group reported because we knew it would be central to the report.  Rather than waiting for budget 2023, which would have meant waiting for another year, we brought in core funding this year before the expert group reported.</p> <p>  Core funding is about providing sustainability to the services and better pay for staff.  In exchange for that, providers must provide a fee freeze so that we do not see continued increases in fees for parents.  That is only step one.  Step two is the extra investment in the NCS.  That was also advised by the expert group, which made a number of suggestions on what we can do with the NCS.  One of these was to get rid of the wraparound hours.  We are doing that in this year's budget.  A second recommendation was to extend the universality of the NCS from the age of three up to the age of 15.  Again, we did that in this year's budget.  Another recommendation was the introduction of an additional premium for families with multiple children in childcare.  We will look at that for next year's budget.</p><p>The other step is to broaden the universal subvention, which is 50 cent per year at the moment, and look at what will happen if it is increased.  There are a range of options.  As I have stated, the work we have to do to make childcare more affordable is not just in the budget this year; it is a continued piece of work.  What I have heard clearly from all three party leaders is that there is full commitment across the Government to this investment.  We have to make childcare more affordable for parents.</p><p> Another key element of the recommendations of the expert group was the idea of a DEIS model for childcare.  That would provide the ability to put in enhanced supports for children from disadvantaged communities.  That can take several forms, such as the access and inclusion model, AIM, approach, which supports children with disabilities.  That comes in seven different levels.  Some of them are universal, while others are more targeted to a particular service.  We might design something like that in the context of our DEIS approach.  Again, I hope to begin work in the budget next year.  It will take several years before it is fully rolled out but it is a really positive step, recognising that the education of children does not begin in junior infants any more; it begins in the ECCE programme and we have to support that.  Certainly, I am aware in my role as Minister with responsibility for equality that, for example, 10% fewer Traveller children undertake the free two-year pre-school ECCE programme compared with children from the settled community.  Education disadvantage is being built in there from day one.  That is something we have to combat and I am considering it in the context of the Traveller and Roma education strategy.</p><p> In the context of family resource centres, the capital budget this year for Tusla is not huge.  It is mainly focused on the maintenance and upgrading of its existing centres.  Tusla is currently doing a big piece of work looking at family supports that it provides throughout the country.  I know calls for family resource centres have come from the constituency of the Deputy and other constituencies throughout the country.  One of the issues we are considering is what additional family support services, rather than centres, can be provided and whether that can address some of the needs in some of these communities.  That work is being done at the moment between Tusla and my Department.  When it is complete, we can take a step back and look at where or if we are putting in additional family resource centres or perhaps just providing additional services in a particular community.</p><p> Finally, in terms of the international protection support service, IPSS, we are creating to help end direct provision, the capital spend is &euro;12.5 million.  This year, that will primarily be used for purchasing existing units.  We are looking at several larger units, that is, seven, eight, nine or ten bedroom units, that will be used for the accommodation of single persons, but we will also be purchasing several two or three bedroom units.  As regards where we are, part of the significant current investment that is provided for the IPSS under this budget will be used to create new funding streams for approved housing bodies, AHBs, for which they can bid, as they can at the moment, and use to start to construct units.  We are taking a multipronged approach to this.  We are doing some purchase right now, but we are also providing money for AHBs to build units themselves for community-based accommodation, that is, phase 2 accommodation.  It is to be hoped that later this year we can start to move towards the planning of phase 1 accommodation, which is the reception and integration centres.  It is important to note there is a strong commitment in the national development plan to increasing and providing additional capital funding as we need it in order to end direct provision by the end of 2024.</p><p> The pathfinder project is primarily led through the Department of Health.  I am happy to engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on whether there is anything my Department can do to assist in that, but it is primarily led through health.  I am acutely aware of the importance of supporting all measures to enhance the mental health of young people.  Obviously, the youth services that are funded by my Department - we have a significant &euro;5 million increase in investment this year - are very important to supporting universal service but, in particular, targeted services, such as UBU Your Place Your Space, in areas of high disadvantage.  We will get eight new services opened this year, which is really positive, but we are looking at ways of better linking in youth services with wider mental health services.  In particular the early intervention part is so important before reaching a situation where CAMHS or other higher degree interventions are needed.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman to bear with me if I have to leave.  I thank the Minister for taking the time to meet the committee.</p> <p>  I refer to the assisted decision-making (capacity) (amendment) Bill on which the committee will be carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny.  Key to this is the establishment of the decision support service, DSS.  I know &euro;5.8 million was allocated in the budget for this service.  It is not due to be established until the middle of the year.  Is it on course to be established in mid-2022?  Has work been done to see whether the original budget allocation of &euro;5.8 million is still adequate for the service?</p> <p>  I do not know whether the Minister can hear me.  I have another couple of questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#F00400"><p>I will ask all my questions now.  I was not sure whether I could be heard; I was getting feedback over the system.  I refer to the Minister's remarks in respect of 100 new front-line staff for Tusla.  In that context, what will be the allocation towards domestic violence?  As the Minister is aware, it has been well-documented, sadly, that there has been an increase in demand for domestic violence services.  I note that his opening statement basically stated support for these services will be maintained.  It is okay to maintain support, but will the additional demand for these services be met?</p> <p>  I refer to the 48 residential care workers in Tusla.  I got an answer on this only last week, it having been raised with me.  Will the provision of 48 new residential care workers stop vulnerable children being placed into apartments, hotel rooms and holiday chalets?  Currently, between nine and 11 vulnerable children are placed into these facilities each month.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The ability for the decision support service to be up and running in June is partly reliant on the committee and its good work in terms of getting pre-legislative scrutiny done quickly.  I appreciate its support in that regard.  I am absolutely committed to getting it up and running for June.  The Deputy cited the 2021 figure for 2022.  We have significantly increased that.  We actually have &euro;7.3 million in the DSS, an increase of &euro;1.5 million.  That is a recognition that once June comes, the service will be extremely busy.  It will be providing a range of skills and advice to people who require assistance with the important life decisions they have to make.  It is central to our commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to have the DSS established.  It is also very important in terms of getting rid of the whole idea of wardship, which is the incredibly outdated system that operates now and is being challenged in the courts at the moment.  Significant additional budget has been provided, staff are in place and it is working as kind of a subset of the Mental Health Commission but in terms of having the legislative power to start to be in a position to provide people with this advice, I am really hoping to get that done by June.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are committed to getting it through the Houses as quickly as possible once pre-legislative scrutiny is completed.</p> <p>  As regards the additional staff for domestic, sexual and gender-base violence, DSGBV, as the Deputy is aware, this area is in significant flux because it will move out of my Department and Tusla into the Department of Justice.  That follows on from the audit that was done and it is a request made by a significant number of NGOs working in the sector.  We have listened to them and are making that change on foot of those requests.  As the Deputy is aware, an extra &euro;3 million has been provided by my Department for Tusla for DSGBV this year.</p><p>That will bring it from &euro;28 million in budget 2021 to &euro;31 million in budget 2022.  That was on foot of an increase of &euro;2.7 million last year.  There has been sustained investment in current spending in domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence services since I became Minister.<br/><br/>On the question of staff, Tusla has made the decision to hire a number of specialists in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence for its child protection units in each region in the country.  That is because Tusla recognises that where there is a case of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence, I suppose, the immediate risk of abuse is to the mother.  There must be recognition that such action could have major long-term consequences for the children in that relationship as well.  That additional investment will not move out of Tusla when the change happens.  Even when responsibility for the provision of the refuges and the like move to the new entity under the Department of Justice, Tusla will still have a strong domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence specialism within it, recognising that Tusla will continue to engage, unfortunately, with hundreds or perhaps thousands of families with experience of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence.  It will continue to need expertise in that area, even if it is not in charge of the provision of refuges and rape crisis centres etc.  It is a move with some foresight by Tusla and one I really welcome.<br/><br/>There is the question of whether the additional 48 front-line staff in residential care will end the practice mentioned by the Deputy.  I am not going to be bold enough to say that will end the practice, although I hope it can see it reduced.  We need to reduce that practice and ensure that where a child needs residential care, it is provided in a proper and long-term residential care placement.  The Deputy knows that cases are sometimes so urgent that these <i>ad hoc</i>solutions or locations for placement are used but it is not the practice we would like to see continue.  It is important that in those cases we at least have the staff to support the young person wherever they are placed.  We absolutely want to see permanent residential care run by either Tusla or the community and voluntary sector.  I remind the Deputy of what I said to Deputy Costello earlier, which is that there is an extra &euro;3 million for Tusla to enhance its residential care placement capacity this year.  That is a positive step.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.140" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#G00200"><p>I thank the Minister and the rest of the delegation for joining us today.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister in securing additional funding and his Department has a really broad remit that provides essential services, all of which need more resources.</p> <p>  I have several points to raise.  Under the subhead relating to mother and baby institutions, the increase in allocations for this area are especially welcome.  However, the briefing document only mentions Tuam as a site to be examined under the burials Bill, implying that only Tuam is budgeted for when there are, of course, many other known locations of potential mass graves.  Will the Minister comment on that or does the budget allow for more sites to be examined?  There is also reference to an enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.  Given the reported unsatisfactory nature of engagement so far, will the Minister outline what the new model will look like and who is conducting the research and commemoration initiatives referred to?</p> <p>  Many other Deputies have raised the question of early learning and care, and there is again a welcome increase in funding for the area.  The committee has discussed child poverty and there has been criticism of the national childcare scheme because it does not account for additional needs faced by disadvantaged families.  One of the surprising points to learn was that the single biggest contributing factor to children being in poverty is being part of a lone-parent family.  Will there be targeted supports in that regard or will there be an opportunity to address the matter?  There are cases where children are not guaranteed access to proper meals and there is a pressing need for targeted programmes in that area.</p> <p>  The Minister's opening statement asserts that funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain qualified staff in an established career structure.  Will the Minister elaborate on how that would happen in practice?</p> <p>  The Minister referenced the funding towards implementing the White Paper to end direct provision.  It is almost a year since the White Paper was published.  What has been the progress in moving forward on ending direct provision since and how will the allocation of &euro;12.5 million help achieve this?</p> <p>  We all expected to see more reference to dealing with gender-based violence in the statement and the documents.  It is mentioned under Tusla's budget but given the necessary focus on the area since Christmas, and with the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" documentary this week, I would have hoped for stronger prioritisation.  In response to a parliamentary question last year, the Minister informed me the cost of maintaining a single refuge space is in the region of &euro;100,000 annually.  Of course we know that to meet the targets under the Istanbul Convention we would need a huge amount of funding to make a provision for that.  Where is the allocation to increase the number of refuge spaces that are very desperately needed, especially in large areas of the country with absolutely no spaces whatever?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022020800002#G00300"><p>With regard to the allocation for actions under the institutional burials Bill, that legislation is clear in setting up a format of how to identify an area that will be subject to an agency created under the Bill to undertake the recovery and identification of remains.  It is accepted by everybody that Tuam will be the first site where such an agency will investigate and the budget exists to start the work on the Tuam site.  The Bill is also clear that should other sites meet the requirements of the legislation, an agency could be established for those sites as well.  Our Department's primary focus is on advancing the work towards Tuam and the funding to start the work on the agency.  It is quite a significant amount of funding of approximately &euro;4 million that is in the budget to start the agency once we get that legislation passed.  I hope to publish the new draft of the legislation by the end of this month and introduce it to the Oireachtas shortly afterwards.</p> <p>  On the question of the enhanced model of stakeholder engagement, work is ongoing for a long-term mechanism where the views of the survivor community can be conveyed to the Government.  As we know there are a very significant number of groups in the sector, some representing specific issues and others specific areas of the areas of the country.  Some may represent survivors of particular institutions.  In order for a clear line of communication to be established with a clear understanding of the diverse range of needs that survivors have, we are looking at a range of measures.</p> <p>  The previous Minister had established a collaborative forum that brought together approximately 18 former survivors or family members of former residents of these institutions.  We have put forward some proposals to that group on the idea of a survivor advocate or perhaps even considering an advocate model, which would engage with the Government in ascertaining the views of survivors.  We hope later this year to bring a final proposal to the Government on this enhanced model of stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>  There are a number of initiatives in this area.  There is a commemoration initiative grant whereby groups around the country may apply for a grant for a commemoration initiative they want to undertake with respect to a mother and baby or county institution in an area.  My Department does an annual call for those and it can support a range of initiatives.  We try very much to be guided by what survivors are looking for and what they think is appropriate with regard to the institution under which they have grouped.  There is also a cross-department group between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage looking at some of the considerations around commemoration, particularly the protection of sites of former institutions.</p><p>Work is ongoing between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  </p><p> On early learning and care and school-age childcare, the Deputy raised the issue of child poverty.  The national childcare scheme, NCS, is a really good scheme.  It is a massively enhanced ability of the State to provide financial support.  However, as it is operated, and it is only really operating since 2019, issues have arisen.  I have engaged with the Chair on this in the Chamber.  Most importantly, I have met with many community childcare providers from various parts of the country and listened to the difficulties they are having with certain elements of the NCS.  In this year's budget we have removed that provision whereby hours spent in school or in the ECCE programme were deducted from a child's free allocation.  The 20-hour allocation for children whose parents were not in education or employment meant they had their school time or ECCE time deducted from their 20 hours a week. Particularly in term time for children attending school-age child care, that was seeing the removal of their entire free allocation.  From this spring, that practice will cease, which will be of great advantage.  We estimate about 5,000 will be able to benefit from their full 20-hour allocation of free early learning and care or school-age childcare.  That is a really important immediate step in terms of addressing issues to do with poverty.</p><p> There is a wider measure we can take.  I referred to it when I was talking to Deputy Dillon in terms of this idea of a DEIS approach to early learning and care and school-age childcare.  It is recommended within the expert group.  We are starting work on the design of it now.  I would hope in this year's budget to be able to take some initial steps towards provision there.  On the provision of hot school meals, the Deputy is right that they are absolutely essential.  It does not fall directly within my Department.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, has increased the number of schools where that is provided.  I am aware of the work the Minister, Deputy Foley, is doing in terms of the very significant increase in the number of DEIS schools for which she has got the investment this year.  That is going to help.</p><p> In terms of quality, the workforce development plan sets out how we make childcare an attractive career option for individuals.  That was launched in December at the same time as the expert group.  We will be working to implement that.  The key thing is that if we are not paying childcare professionals enough they are not going to join or they are going to leave the sector.  That is why we have done core funding and why it is so important.</p><p> On the White Paper, the implementation of the vulnerability assessment was really important and something Ireland had been failing to do for years.  Some 650 have been undertaken this year and another 900 are in place at the moment.  On the establishment of the programme board and the expert advisory group, I met last week with Catherine Day, Lorcan Sirr and David Donoghue.  The group will be overseeing my Department, holding our feet to the fire to make sure we are implementing the White Paper.  In March of this year I hope to provide a detailed one-year update on the successes we have had in the implementation of the White Paper.  We will be able to give some detail on accommodation that we have provided.  In 2022 we plan that the first people will start to move out of direct provision centres and into accommodation in the community.  It will not be a huge number.  It will probably be just in the early 100s this year, but it is that first really important step.  To have people living independently in the community is absolutely central to the White Paper model.</p></speech>

On the implementation of the action plan in response to the recommendations from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes, I want to ask about fast-tracking the medical cards.  I have been speaking to survivors.  Good quality healthcare is so important here.  Maybe the Minister could come back to me on that.</p> <p>  We spoke a lot today about Tusla and funding.  Is there going to be any help through Tusla for women and children trying to flee domestic violence?  The Minister is launching the public consultation on the Government strategy to combat gender-based violence next week and is committed to providing refuges in the nine counties that do not have one.  Carlow is one of them.  I have spoken to the Minister about it and have had several meetings with the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  When we speak about refuges and wrap-around services, there are significant issues when we come to safe accommodation across the country, including in Carlow and my own area.  We need to have proper supports in place working through the local authorities, like education and counselling services.  As provision of women's refuges falls under so many different Departments, it is becoming a big issue and so are the services.  I am aware that it is under the remit of the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  I refer to all the other services involved, such as children's services and local authorities for a mother who needs to be housed.  If we do not get all the services right we are going to fall down.  Do we need to set up a group or what do we need to do to make sure that all the different Departments are involved?  It is not just one are; it is a lot of areas.  </p> <p>  I have spoken to the Minister several times about the cost of childcare.  I welcome that he is fully understanding of it and knows how much it is costing people.  He is addressing the issue of pay for childcare professionals with the funding.  These are issues that we really need to look at.</p> <p>  Child poverty has been mentioned.  In my own area of Carlow, families and schools have contacted me where children have left school because the mothers had to send them to a school with DEIS status to get the hot meals programme.  We have schools that do not quality for DEIS or are trying to get DEIS status.  That is another area.  We have seen so many cases recently.  The cost of living is another area that has really been affected here.  Parents have so many bills to pay with the cost of living, whether it is ESB, trying to put petrol in their car, trying to feed children or trying to pay the mortgage.  There are huge issues and they are all starting to come together.  We need to make sure that we address all areas.  </p> <p>  I want to ask about education.  It has come to my attention that the education and training board, ETB, and the back to education initiative, BTEI, are not accepting new learners from the Carlow early years training scheme for childcare modules.  This means any new participant who is starting on the childcare scheme will not be able to start their level 5 or level 6 childcare module until after September 2022.  They used to be able to do it in stages but this is not the case now.  The new curriculum participants are not being given the opportunity-----</p></speech>

On the medical card, the key issue with the enhanced medical card we will provide to 19,000 former residents is that it requires a legislative basis.  That has been the case in terms of survivors of the Magdalen institutions and survivors of the industrial schools as well.  We need a legislative basis for the provision of a large volume of medical cards.  That is why we are looking to move the legislation underpinning the institutions payment scheme as quickly as possible.  My official are working on the heads right now and we hope to have them to the committee for pre-legislative scrutiny as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On the issue of domestic, sexual and gender based violence, DSGBV, apologies to Deputy Cairns that I did not get to answer her question on that.  I might cover some of that as well.  I will be speaking about in the D&aacute;il later this evening also.  The consultation phase of the third national strategy on DSGBV will be launched soon.  That is being led by the Department of Justice.  Government has taken a strategic approach in that the issue and the Government's response to DSGBV will now be led by the Department of Justice.</p><p>The Deputy summarised the reason for that very well when she spoke about many Departments, agencies, local authorities and health services all doing little bits, which reflects fragmentation.  We recognised that in the programme for Government.  That is why we set up an audit to identify where everything is being done right now and how we can bring it together.  The Government has now taken that decision.  We will bring it together under the Department of Justice under a new entity that will be operated by that Department.  That will mean responsibility for the provision of refuge and those services to which the Deputy referred will not be overseen by my Department or by Tusla.  Responsibility for that will be transferred to the Department of Justice.  That is a strategic decision the Government has taken, recognising the major challenge we have with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in this country.  Centralising everything under that Department will allow for the delivery of the refuge spaces we need.  Everybody recognises we do not have enough refuges or refuge spaces.  There are significant parts of the country where counties like the Deputy's do not have such coverage and where in physical areas in larger counties it would take a hour and a half to drive to a refuge, which is an immediate disincentive to someone who might feel in real and desperate need.  There is a commitment under the capital allocation scheme, CAS, from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to finance refuge spaces but there is also a recognition that the CAS process is lengthy.  That is one of the problems we identified, namely, that it takes such a long time to build a new refuge, as well as there being a lack of spaces.  In our response to the accommodation review, which we hope to publish next week, again led by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, through the third national strategy, we will outline how we will address those particular issues.</p><p> The Deputy might drop me a note on the details of the child care education issue she highlighted in Carlow, which I will be happy to follow up with my officials.  </p><p> On child poverty, a key measure being taken is that we are investing in the EU child guarantee, an EU mandated approach to supporting free access to childcare, education and health for children in need.  The Government will be submitting its action plan to respond to the EU child guarantee by the end of March.  Our response to the EU child guarantee will be located within our wider successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, BOBF, our all-of-government approach to children and young people.  That strategy ended in 2020.  We are designing the successor strategy now, addressing child poverty.  Making sure again that we have a co-ordinated all-of-government approach to addressing child poverty will be central to the BOBF successor strategy.  I will be working with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, in the Department of Rural and Community Development on the designation of a new child poverty reduction target that the country needs to adopt.  That is all those elements covered.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.161" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#B00600"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  Since 2016, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, has made it a strategic priority to promote the rights and welfare of children in direct provision and those in the Traveller and Roma communities, and we believe they are only some of the children who are impacted by the past pupil criteria.  As members of the committee will be aware, the OCO has previously expressed concerns about the impact the past pupil criteria can have on children whose mother or father did not attend secondary school or who did not attend a particular secondary school.  We, therefore, welcome the provision contained in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2020 which, if enacted, would remove the ability of schools to allocate 25% of places for the children, or grandchildren, of past pupils if they are oversubscribed.<br/><br/>It is important to recognise that the 25% allowance can possibly affect the ability of any child whose mother, father or grandparent did not attend a particular school to get a place in that school.  However, there are groups of children who can be particularly disadvantaged.  These include Traveller children whose mother or father may not have attended any second level education; children of immigrant parents who would not have attended secondary school in Ireland; children of parents with disabilities who may not have attended a mainstream secondary school; and children of families who have had to move to a different area to find accommodation due to a number of valid reasons, including the housing crisis, returning from abroad, promotion prospects and change in family circumstances.  They are all currently at a disadvantage because of the current wording.<br/><br/>Ireland ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC, in 1992 and has an obligation under international law to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of all children living in Ireland.  Under the convention, a child has a right to an education and secondary education should be available and accessible to every child.  Article 2 of the UNCRC, which protects children from discrimination, is one of four general principles considered integral to the rights granted to children under the convention.  Article 2 protects children from discrimination in their own right and also protects them from discrimination they may suffer as a result of their connection to their parents.<br/><br/>While the UNCRC itself does not define discrimination, the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, has found that while treating people differently does not always amount to discrimination, a difference in treatment will be discriminatory if it &ldquo;has no objective and reasonable justification&rdquo;, that is, if it does not pursue a &ldquo;legitimate aim&rdquo;.  From a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, children have a right to be protected from discrimination and harm and should only experience differential treatment if there is a reasonable or objective basis for this and if it is consistent with children&rsquo;s rights and their best interests.  The priority given to children or grandchildren of past pupils of schools cannot be seen to be a reasonable or objective basis for treating children differently.<br/><br/>We believe that schools should be fully inclusive and promote equality.  Education can be a way out of disadvantage for many students yet this provision seems to say that children who had parents and grandparents who went to a particular school can get priority in obtaining a school place.  This is undoubtedly leading to a continuing cycle of disadvantage for some children.<br/><br/>Goal 2 of the Department of Education&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 is to ensure equity of opportunity in education and that all students are supported to fulfil their potential.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	[E]quity of opportunity and inclusivity must be fundamental principles in our education system.  Our aim is to develop a system that welcomes and meaningfully engages all students, including those with special educational needs and students at risk of educational disadvantage. </blockquote> <p>By allowing preferential access to schools for one group of children over others, the State is failing in its own strategic aim to provide an education system which promotes equity of opportunity and inclusivity.<br/><br/>From a children&rsquo;s rights perspective, children have a right to be protected from discrimination.  Putting children without an intergenerational connection with a school at a disadvantage to those with such a link is discrimination by treating children differently when they are trying to access their education.<br/><br/>I am grateful for the invitation to meet today and I am happy to take any questions that the members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#C00100"><p>The National Parents Council Primary, NPC, welcomes the opportunity to submit its views to the joint committee.  At the core of all the work of the NPC primary and especially its advocacy and representation role is its vision statement, which states that the NPC wants to see an Ireland where every child has the opportunity to reach his or her full potential.  This vision statement speaks to equality and equity and lies at the heart of the discussion regarding the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2020.  Although it could be argued the current provision that allows schools to include admission criteria regarding family members having previously attended the school is implemented rarely, we must look to our legislation to set the tone for what we value in society.  It could also be argued that the legislation sets the tone to the effect that your history can define your future.</p> <p>  In recent years we have seen a dramatic change in communities, increased new housing developments, diversity in our populations and an increase in population mobility, all of which mean that our children are growing up in vastly different local communities from those in which their parents and grandparents grew up.  Any legislation that allows for possible discrimination within communities must be amended.  At the core of these communities are our schools and what happens within a school shapes the communities around them.  Who gets and does not access to a school something to the community around it.  Ensuring that a school&rsquo;s admission policy provides and is seen to provide equity of access for local children to their local school must be a priority.</p> <p>  The paramount right of parental choice regarding education is enshrined in our Constitution and is an important right for parents.  When oversubscription occurs in an individual school, however, that choice cannot always be accommodated.  It is the NPC&rsquo;s view that in choosing which parents' choice is accommodated and which choice is not, the school board of management&rsquo;s decision must be underpinned by fairness and equity.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to present to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss our research findings at this meeting.  The research, funded by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, focused on the discriminatory practices faced by children in accessing education in Ireland.  It was based on 30 semi-structured interviews with politicians, educators and representatives of various relevant interest groups.  These interviews were conducted prior to the commencement of Education (Admissions to School) Act 2018, but a common theme running through the research was that the Act, although undoubtedly a significant step in the right direction, did not go far enough in ensuring accessibility without discrimination to Irish schools.  As one participant put it, the law is &quot;inherently discriminatory and the law should be changed&quot;.<br/><br/>The discriminatory impact of section 62(10)(b) of the 2018 Act can be demonstrated by applying the provision to the facts of the well documented case of Stokes <i>v</i>. Christian Brothers High School Clonmel.  John Stokes, a child from the Traveller community, had applied for a place in the school, which was oversubscribed - the school had received 174 applications for 140 places - due to its strong academic reputation.  John Stokes met two out of the three criteria set out in the admissions policy in the event of oversubscription, but he did not meet the third because he did not have a family connection with the school.  His father, like most Traveller men of his generation, had not attended secondary school and he was the eldest child in the family.  Of those who satisfied the three criteria, 57 applicants were allocated a place on the sibling ground and 36 boys secured a place by virtue of the parental rule.  This meant there were 47 places left for the remaining 84 applicants.  A lottery was subsequently held and John Stokes, like 37 other boys, failed to secure a place.  Crucially, if the so-called parental rule had not been included in the admissions policy, there would have been 83 places available for 120 students.  In other words, John Stokes's odds of success in the lottery would have increased from 56% to 69%.  Importantly, for the purposes of our discussion here today, the subsequent decision to limit the number of places that could be reserved for the children of former pupils to 25% in the 2018 legislation would have made absolutely no difference whatsoever to John Stokes.  After all, 36 out of 140 places equates to 25.7%.<br/><br/>My view is that any admissions criteria in oversubscribed schools will result in discommoding certain students and families but it should not automatically discommode Traveller or Roma children, the children of minority ethnic groups, the children of same-sex or single parents, whose fathers might not necessarily be identifiable, or of those who are forced to move county or country for employment reasons.  I am very happy to discuss any of the issues raised in our research.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.164" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Connolly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Barnardos here today to provide evidence on this important issue.  In 2020 Barnardos supported almost 18,000 children and their families.  We deliver evidence-informed outcome-focused services for children and their parents and careers in family homes, in schools and in our 45 centres throughout Ireland.  Our services are trauma-informed focusing on the impact of adverse childhood experiences on the lives of children and parents with whom we work.  We work with families to help them address issues affecting their children&rsquo;s development and well-being.  The children to whom we offer support are often living in complex and frequently chaotic circumstances, affected by traumatic life situations such as poverty, abuse, parental poor mental health, neglect, separation and parental addiction.  Education is often a primary route out of disadvantage for many of these children.</p> <p>  We support amending the existing legislation, section 62 of the Education Act 2018, which allows schools to adopt admission policies that reserve 25% of places for children of parents or grandparents who went to that particular school.  It goes against the spirit of Article 28 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognises children&rsquo;s right to education and provides that states must achieve this right on the basis of equal opportunity.  Section 62 also allows schools to introduce admission policies which could unjustifiably disadvantage many of the children we support.  For example, many of the children we support have parents and grandparents who struggled to engage with the education system themselves when they were children.  Some of the children with whom we work have parents who were not educated in this country.  It is inappropriate and unjust that these children should have less of a chance of attending a school that adopts section 62(10)(b).</p> <p>  The existing legislation sends out the wrong message to children, parents, grandparents and society as a whole.  It tells children that where their parents and grandparents did or did not go to school determines their future opportunities.  We know at a population level parental educational attainment affects children&rsquo;s future outcomes.  We should be adopting measures to address, not reinforce, this fact further.  Section 62 reminds parents and grandparents that their educational history may influence or restrict their children's and grandchildren&rsquo;s opportunities.  Limiting a child&rsquo;s educational options due to having parents or grandparents who they themselves had limited options is the epitome of promoting intergenerational disadvantage and discrimination.  A child&rsquo;s educational options should never be negatively affected by the education of their parents and grandparents.</p> <p>  Barnardos believes in children&rsquo;s rights and promoting policies that protect and enforce these rights.  All educational policies should seek to promote equality of opportunity and combat disadvantage, particularly given the lifelong impact educational attainment can have on the life of a child.  Maintaining section 62(10)(b) would be the wrong decision for children, regardless of how widespread its adoption is across schools.Giving consideration to the voice of children, we believe no child would want their opportunities limited by the where their parents and grandparents went to school.</p> <p>  The current section should be repealed in order to ensure equal opportunity for all children and avoid the discrimination of certain groups of children, potentially those who are experiencing vulnerabilities or facing disadvantage.</p></speech>

A common thread runs through them all.  I have a few questions.  Perhaps we could get from the witnesses a sense of how prevalent this problem is, not that the scale of the issue is the only reason to legislate, because one child in a family being discriminated against is one too many.  Could the witnesses give us a sense of how common this is?  Today we are discussing a codified selection criteria and how it can discriminate against some people.  That relates to my first question.  How pervasive is this in the form of discrimination where no formal criteria is in place?</p><p>Do schools need these formal criteria in order for them to make selections on the basis of family backgrounds?</p><p> Dr. Doyle stated that his view was that any admissions criterion in oversubscribed schools will result in discommoding certain students and families.  Which criteria are the most legitimate on which to make these difficult decisions?  What policies would result in the least discriminatory practices?</p><p> Can the witnesses think of any circumstances in which the current legislation is justified, or is it fundamentally unjustifiable and should be removed?  Is there an issue with gentrification where, due to the housing crisis, people cannot afford to live in communities in which they grew up?</p><p> How can the admissions process be simplified to ensure the filling in of forms is not off-putting for parents, especially with low literacy levels?</p></speech>

That has been well documented.  What is problematic about this provision, however, is that it is virtually impossible for certain minority groups to meet the criteria.  My argument is that any criterion that is virtually impossible to meet is fundamentally discriminatory and should be removed.  If everybody has an equal opportunity of gaining a place in a lottery, at least it is fair.  Somebody will obviously fall the wrong side of it, but a submission to this committee in 2019 stated that 57% of boys from the Traveller community have not completed primary school or entered secondary school.  Even in ten years' time, the effect of that will still be palpable.</p></speech>

I think we are right to say we have two admissions cycles done since it came in to being.  We should have it.  I had hoped that last week, the joint managerial board might have some figures, but it just said limited or small number.  That is crucial.  We should have those figures to hand to try to make a decision.</p> <p>  At the same time, one child discriminated against on this basis is too many.  Dr. Doyle outlined very well that we are in situations where this will be perpetuated.  The parents of children who come from direct provision and abroad will not have reached the criteria and the families will be disadvantaged for the next two generations.  We need to make sure we stamp it out and move it to a situation in which it is much more available to all children.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the form of the criteria.  A number of criteria are already there that do not need this one.  One can get two, three or four criteria that are in the locality.  The idea of education is to be local and available to those who live here and various other criteria.  If one moves to a lottery, everybody is equal.  It is never ideal.  A lottery is far from ideal.  However, if that is what one is left with, then it is equally available to all children.  That is the key to the future, as far as I am concerned.</p></speech>

I would like to see all schools have availability for special needs children and all teachers rotate around special needs classes and all children get a chance to move around situations.  We could create a properly inclusive and engaged population of children.  The children who do not have special needs will recognise and understand engagement with children who do and <i>vice versa</i>.  They would become friends, know each other and see each other around the town.  The children with special needs would not be farmed away to somewhere else and know nobody when they came back to their home town.  That is what we need to move to as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Every year, we are inundated with distraught parents who have not got a place for their child for various reasons.  We see the most support from our cohort of parents for a place in a school to be given preference, if one has a sibling in that school.  Sometimes there may be six or seven years between siblings and one has had the experience of a school and it is important that one's next child has access to that school as well.  For the same reasons that have been spoken about before, we do not hold that because you has had a parent or grandparent in a school, preferential treatment should be given.  The movement of people for employment purposes or in other circumstances, for example, or even in the context of those returning to the country, it happens time and again that families cannot get children into schools.</p> <p>  One of the main things that crops up every year is that you will be offered a place in November, you do not get the school you was looking for, you may end up getting nowhere and you may find out the following June, July or August that you got a place.  From speaking to schools, it is all down to the fact that parents will enrol their children in as many schools as they can.  Parents will pay the fee to keep their children on the books and then decide at the end of the year to which school they want to send them.</p> <p>  All of those places are locked up within schools.  In terms of giving everybody an equal shot at places that are out there, we will hit peak numbers in 2023 to 2024.  They will start to decline slightly after that.  In terms of giving everybody absolutely equal access, we have to look at how school places are allocated and what happens when schools are oversubscribed.  That may be because a parent has accepted three or four different schools.</p> <p>  We should focus on a system whereby if you accept a school place, you are taken off the other lists.  That offers a free space at a time in the year where it does not become a crisis point and this is all dealt with in the same month or two, such as between the middle of October and the middle of November.  Schools would have some sort of a link that one could not have a child on the roll and accepted in two or three different schools.</p></speech>

I know from speaking to parliamentary colleagues that schools in other counties do not have that relationship.  I have spoken to the Department of Education about this issue.  Schools should be sharing information.  I know that there are issues regarding the GDPR, but my understanding is that was cleared up by the Department in order that schools would be able to communicate to see whose names were on various lists.</p><p>In Wexford, specifically in Wexford town, it is a huge issue.  Children could be on multiple lists not only in their respective towns but outside of them, in other areas such as New Ross or Enniscorthy.  I apologise to the Deputy for cutting in.</p></speech>

It works but that concept needs to be standardised.  We all appreciate the autonomy of each school but admissions need to be governed.  There needs to be more stable guidelines for schools where schools can have that communication or it can be centralised or they can have some sort of process.  Taking the area I know, a child can be on the lists of two or three schools in Wexford, on the lists of another two schools in Waterford and, more than likely, on the lists of another couple schools between Enniscorthy and Gorey.  They are not only staying within the county but they are going outside of the county as well.</p></speech>

Ms Fanning alluded to the complications that arise.  However, we cannot lose sight of what we are talking about in terms of what is permissible in an admissions policy.  They are two very different things.  While we might need to do much work around admissions and that issue of multiple applying, and why that even happens, the important point is that we need to make sure that what we allow in admissions policy is equal and fair.  Before we even get into who is going to what school and what lists they are on, we have a criteria for people being able to apply for admissions to a school.  I refer to the idea that we would have something within that admission policy that sets a tone for our society that allows for some children to have an unfair advantage in terms of getting into some schools over other children who will never reach those criteria.  The tone that we set, as a society, and the communication to children and families within communities that they are not allowed into this level of school is a dangerous one for us to continue to set.  Admissions administration is a difficult thing that we try to grapple with all the time and we need to continue to make that better but before we get there, we need to ensure we have an admissions policy that is equal and fair to all applying.  That is all I wanted to add.</p></speech>

It is about all children having equal aspirations.  We do not know how pervasive this issue is but we all share this idea that any child should know that if he or she does not get into a school, it is because he or she has lost a lottery, not because of his or her background.</p></speech>

This is an interesting topic and it benefits from having this lengthy deliberative assessment of it as opposed to just a quick debate in the D&aacute;il where a debate can sometimes be a bit superficial.  I have questions for Dr. Muldoon based on what he said.  Obviously, there are many parents who want their children to go to the school they went to and, in fairness, there is nothing necessarily wrong with that.  Some of the reasons are benign; it can be out of sentiment, affection or nostalgia.  However, Dr. Muldoon's point is that he does not look at this from the point of view of that child, parent or grandparent and that he must look at it from the point of view of the abstract child, a child who has been excluded as a result of the rule.  Do I take it from what Dr. Muldoon said that he believes there is no legitimate aim for the continuation of this statutory provision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.184" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#E00800"><p>That is probably the essence of it.  There is no difficulty with a child going to the school their parent went to if he or she lives in the community and fits all the other criteria but just because the parent went to that school does not give any pre-emptive advantage.  From our point of view, that is an automatic disadvantage which Dr. Doyle set out very well.  Many groups of children are two steps back because of it, and will be two steps back for the next two generations.  Again, it continues.  It is very clearly set out.  If your parent or grandparent today has not gone to that school, then you will not get into that school, so your child and your grandchild will not get into that school.  Straight away four generations are being affected and that is discrimination by its very essence.</p></speech>

Would Dr. Muldoon agree with that?</p></speech>

Based on everything I have said, it is the reason if there is a particular admissions criteria.  At the end of the day there are always going to be children and parents who, in an over-subscribed school, will not be happy with the result.  We have to make that unhappiness "fair", for want of a better word, so that everybody going into that process has an equal chance of being unhappy and an equal chance of being happy in terms of the selection.</p></speech>

It puts huge stress on those parents.  Invariably, once September comes, it seems to be sorted out.  It seems to put parents through an unnecessary amount of stress.  Does Ms Fanning think there is some centralised system that should apply in order to resolve that?</p></speech>

It is still going to involve choice.  On what basis does Dr. Doyle think schools should be required to choose their students?  Should it be principally on the basis of locality?  As Deputy Conway-Walsh said, I am conscious that in England house prices shoot up because houses are adjacent to schools that are much sought after by parents.  By what route do we go?  Every avenue seems to have potential problems.</p></speech>

From my point of view, what is really problematic with this provision is that while on the face of it, it is a neutral provision but it has a particularly discriminatory impact on certain people who are never going to meet the criteria.  To contrast it with the other type of criteria the Deputy mentioned, at least there is some possibility that the criteria may be met.  Obviously, geography and locality can give rise to situations where somebody might miss out because the cut-off point might be half-way through an estate.  That seems unbelievably harsh but at least there is some possibility of meeting the criteria whereas with this provision, it is virtually impossible for this cohort of children.</p></speech>

Most of it was welcomed.  Even the sibling rule did not provoke any opposition among the interviewees but it is important to remember that just because this provision is removed, it is not going to exclude every child who had a parent or grandparent in that school.  There will still be a large cohort of children there whose parent or grandparent went to that school, by virtue of the sibling rule or the various different criteria in regard to feeder schools, geography and so on.  It is a fact that this seems neutral on the face of it but in practice, and especially in particular areas where there is over-subscription, it is in effect blatantly discriminatory.</p></speech>

If the provision is removed, there will still be children whose parents went there going to a school.  There is nothing wrong with that <i>per se</i>.  What is wrong is if there is a statutory provision which excludes certain children because of the connection that another child has.</p></speech>

To put it a different way, many parents who were previously pupils also contribute to the school community, perhaps sponsoring teams, taking kids on placements during transition year and so forth.  Many other parents and grandparents have contributed nothing to the school community since leaving and their grandchildren and children benefit from this rule by virtue of that family connection, even though they have not contributed in any way.  I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question reminds me of a little ten-year-old girl I met whose mother attends Barnardos services.  She says that she wants to be a doctor.  I told her we will do everything we can to support her.  However, the odds are against her given her circumstances and because her mother depends so much on her and all those sort of things.  In the context of this discussion, I would like to be able to say to her, as I do, that all of us around her will do our best and that she can aspire to that.  That is what this is really about.  It is about aspiration, equality of opportunity and recognising that some children are just born into circumstances where the odds are against them unless we support them and there are possibilities for them to do well.</p></speech>

It is heartwarming to hear the support for the Bill, which I drafted.  What has been interesting this and last week is that this has opened up a wider discussion on the nature of Irish education and who it serves.  It is beginning to become clear that, effectively, it serves the patron.  What happens every year is that parents and children are at the heart of this scramble for what is perceived to be the better or best school in their area.  It is depressing that we have come to assume there has to be such a suggestion that one school is better than another and that not every school could be of a similar standard and have similar outcomes and resources.</p> <p>  I believe fundamentally that we need a Finnish revolution in Irish education.  We have 4,000 schools in a country that has the same population as Manchester.  We have schools competing against each other.  When there is that level of competition it leads to inequality.  This debate comes down to a scenario where some children are struggling to get into a school, and that should not be a reality.  I think all members of this committee, regardless of our background, agree that we do not want a scenario in which children are turned away from a school, for whatever reason.  If the State was front and centre in the provision of school places, there would be a school in each individual school district that could accommodate every child in the area, not the current multiplicity of schools that separate children on the basis of religion, gender and sometimes income.</p> <p>  With that in mind, what we have been doing in the past two weeks, unbeknownst to ourselves almost, is having a wider conversation about school provision, the patronage model and the lack of involvement by the Department of Education.  Within all that, I believe a certain sector that wants us to keep the generational bloodline of succession within its schools exercised a disproportionate influence over the Education (Admission to Schools) Act.  As Deputy O'Callaghan said last week, the relevant section in the Act is completely contradictory because another section in the same Act states there should not be familial advantage for any particular family.  Despite that, this provision, which does not read with the rest of the Bill, was wedged in at the behest of a certain strong lobby group.</p> <p>  I agree with everything the witnesses have said.  I do not have too many questions.  The only defence for this provision last week was along the lines, "Ah sure, it is never really used."  That is a pathetic excuse because even if one child in this Republic was on the rough end of this provision because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not attend the school, that knowledge would probably sit with that child for life.  It would make that child feel for life that they were just was not the same because their father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not have the same opportunities.  </p> <p>  It is funny because - my mother would probably kill me for saying this in public session but I will say it anyway - I am reluctant to ask in my own family whether all of my grandparents went to secondary school because I am pretty sure not all of them did.  I am still reluctant to ask that question because there is a level of shame attached to that.  Last week, Senator Eileen Flynn, who cannot be here today, gave very powerful testimony about how nobody in her family had been to secondary school - neither her father or grandfather - and how emotional she felt that this could potentially be a disadvantage to her.</p> <p>  Education is so personal and emotive.  It says everything, too much, about us.  For those trying to break through poverty, education is their only chance.  Family will provide help and support but for people who do not have education in their family background, education is their only chance of breaking through intergenerational poverty.  That is why a provision such as this is so wrong and elitist.  It goes against anything that education is supposed to achieve that because someone's father went to a certain school, that person has a better chance of attending it.</p> <p>  For someone who is not from this country or from a particular area and does not come from a tradition of school attendance, having any of these factors as a reason for not being able to attend a certain school would, as I said, have a lifelong effect.  It would also make that person feel that regardless of any genuine efforts to try to row in or to move into the mainstream, for example, by changing their accent or pretending to live somewhere else, changing the way they dress or cut their hair, they will never be let into the club because their father did not go to a certain school.  I imagine that would make some young people pretty angry, even if that is only one person.  </p> <p>  I saw some heads nodding when I brought up the contradiction within the Bill.  Does anyone wish to speak to that?  Apart from the emotional argument I made, there is also the legislative argument that it is legislative nonsense to have two provisions in the same Bill aspiring to two different things.  I appreciate the witnesses' support for what the committee is collectively trying to do.</p></speech>

However, when we talk to parents we find that choosing the schools they want their child to go to or not go to is a complex issue for parents.  The majority of parents will tell us it is a reputational thing and they want their child to go to the best school, as seen academically.  However, we also have parents who have other reasons for choosing a particular school.  The school may do a lot of sport or look after their child better because it seems to be a caring school or whatever else.  We need to make sure, when we are looking at the types of schools that parents are choosing for their children, that all schools can provide all of those things, rather than just looking at an educational reputation piece.  When we listen to parents' reasons for choosing a school, they are very complex.  In addition, for different children in the same family, there can be different reasons.  I just wanted to add that point.</p></speech>

I do not have many questions but I have some observations.  My degree was in law and I learned some of the rules of interpretation.  One of them is called the mischief rule of interpretation, which is the idea that one is trying to interpret something on the basis of the mischief it is trying to achieve or the problem it is trying to resolve.</p><p> I have heard of the Stokes case.  The objective of this legislation is to try to address that type of mischief.  Some of the discussion last week was around how frequently the issue in question arises.  In many respects, it does not arise very frequently, but the existence of the Stokes alone case justifies a response.  We do not know whether John Stokes would have got access to the Christian Brothers High School Clonmel if this rule had not been in place.  It has been clearly demonstrated that his chance of accessing the school was significantly diminished.  The existence of that case alone justifies the legislation.</p><p> In many parts of the country, enrolment policies are not a problem because schools are not oversubscribed.  That is how we would want it to be.  I have some sympathy with the argument made by some of the speakers last week that what we need to do ultimately is resolve the issue of inadequate supply of school places, which is a particular problem in the greater Dublin area, Wicklow, Kildare, Cork city, Limerick city and many of the big urban centres.  That is probably going to get worse before it gets better because there is a demographic bulge at primary level that is going to transition into second level.  Subsequently, it might, perhaps, be alleviated.  Ultimately, if there is going to be pressure on places, we need to resolve that issue, but there has to be equality in terms of how a limited number of places are going to be allocated.</p><p> I reiterate my support the legislation.  In terms of additional issues related to admissions, a good point was made last week by the Joint Managerial Body in regard to a potential two-year admissions process for children with special educational needs in light of some of the documentation and so on that is needed.  In terms of managing the transition, that is a fair point if any of the witnesses would like to offer observations on it.  There is an issue.  If people are living in an area where places are in short supply it is reasonable for them to try as many options as possible.  What is not reasonable is that once they are offered a number of places they are holding on that number of places.  There needs to be a cut-off in that regard.</p><p> I have a specific question for Ms Lynch of National Parents Council Primary in regard to an issue that I raised last week as well.  School planning areas are quite often large.  They can take in several towns.  A school can be located at one end of the school planning area.  This is mostly an issue for new schools.  This can mean that a child who is living within 2 km or 3 km of a school could be of a lower priority than a child who lives 15 miles down the road but who is still within the school planning area.  Dr. Muldoon may have come across this as well.  We need to figure out a more flexible approach in that regard such as, perhaps, a school that is on the edge of school planning area being able apply to the Department for a derogation and being able to identify its correct catchment area.  For me, the priority in terms of access needs to be the local child.  It has been well articulated that the children who could lose out in respect of this issue are those whose parents did not attend secondary school in Ireland and the children of Travellers and migrants who did not attend secondary school.  The local child needs to be at the heart of it.</p><p> I reiterate my support for the legislation.  I would welcome a response from the witnesses on the points I have raised.</p></speech>

A great deal can happen within families in two years.  We need to make sure there are no unintended consequences of any decisions.  It would be better for applications to be processed with more resources, better planning and earlier planning with regard to the child's needs.</p> <p>  On the school planning, I know of a lot of areas where this issue arises.  In one case, a new housing development is across the road from a school but it is not in the catchment area of that school.  It is exactly as described by the Deputy.  It is similar to the situation described by Ms Fanning in regard to Wexford where the local principals have come together to work that through.  I agree with the Deputy that we need a better process in place for schools to manage that such that local principals do not have to organise it themselves.  I agree that we need to look at that specific issue because it clearly is disadvantaging children who live across the road from a school if all of a sudden that school is not their local school.</p></speech>

These sorts of issues are foreseeable.  We just need the Department of Education to be proactive around rights and so on.  Planning permissions for the building of housing estates take to two to three years.  We need to identify the role for education there in terms of whether it has been planned for as part of that development.  Those things can be done.</p> <p>  On the issue of the child with special educational needs, I have no problem with forward planning for two years, but one cannot create a situation wherein children are disadvantaged through that forward planning.  We need to get our system working much more smoothly so that we can identify those children early, as well as their special needs and how they need to be met, so that the primary school is able to pass on that information quickly.  Improving all of the areas will make a difference in that regard.</p></speech>

It is arises particularly where a child with special needs is transitioning from primary to post-primary level.  That year is sometimes not enough.  It puts an awful lot of pressure on a parent to approach a school and to have those discussions in regard to supports for the child and whether or not it is possible for the child to go to a particular school or the child needs to go to a different school or a special school.  We have seen this occur a couple of times in terms of that transition.  Often, all of the supports that are in place at primary level do not necessarily transition to post-primary level or the particular school the child is to go to.  Parents often find that they have to condense all of their decisions and they have to do a great deal of footwork themselves to ascertain whether those supports can be put in place in the school in which the child has been enrolled or in the school into which he or she has been accepted.  The decisions could be made within the year but if the process around what might be available for that transition could be started earlier that would possibly alleviate much of the stress.</p></speech>

I listened remotely to what were very convincing arguments and all of the witnesses put fairness and equity at the centre of all they said.  I was struck by one particular comment, I think from Dr. Doyle, that no child's education should be impacted negatively because of his or her parents.  That is 100% correct.  The onus is on all of us to ensure that every child has an opportunity to excel in education in their own community.</p> <p>  From from my own experience of as a former teacher I know how important it is for all children that in every school, fee-paying or otherwise, we have a multicultural environment and a diverse classroom in terms of learning how we all deal with the world and our mixed society.  Dr. Muldoon made the point that we do not have the correct data.</p><p>Obviously, the real issue is that 20% of our schools are over-subscribed.  We should not have such a situation but we do and that is where is it at.  <br/><br/>We must deal with that 20%, no matter who the cohort is that will not have the opportunity to go their local school.  Last week it was suggested, and I agree, that we need to look at the timelines in relation to how parents and young people apply to schools.  It was suggested that it needs to be brought forward by at least 12 months so that people are not in a highly pressurised situation 12 months before school starts.  I also believe there must be some type of centralised system.  Many primary schools work together with a central admissions policy group but that is not happening at second level.  It can happen in an <i>ad hoc</i>or informal way but it is not happening in a formal way.  It is my belief that the Department of Education has a role to play in that and should be doing that.<br/><br/>In Newbridge, where I live, we have a huge problem with over-subscription that has been going on for about three years.  It is expected to continue for at least another two years until a new school is built.  Following a lot of pressure, agreement has been reached that somebody within the Department will work with the schools on the ground and with public representatives to make sure that every student has a place in secondary school next September.  The stress that it is causing for young people and their families is enormous.  It is not right and it absolutely should not be happening.  We had to push hard to get that from the Department but it is something that should be in place as a matter of course.<br/><br/>If there is over-subscription, what is the fairest way of dealing with it within a school or school community?  How should the Department deal with over-subscription to schools in a community?  How does it make sure that fairness and equity are at the centre of any solution, but with the understanding that some children are going to lose out somewhere along the line, unfortunately?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Niall Muldoon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022020800002#H00200"><p>One of the things we need to remember here is that if we take away this piece, we will reduce the level of over-subscription.  At present people are applying to schools they do not live near and that changes the demographic of people who are applying.  It creates an opportunity for those schools so we will change things that way.  One assumes that the people who stop applying or who are not allowed to apply outside their area will then be available to other schools.  That changes things.<br/><br/>In terms of avoiding over-subscription <i>per se</i>, we have argued for many years that it requires forward planning and population planning.  That is something that every other country in Europe is well able to do.  They plan ahead, recognise where the population growth is going to be and allow for that.  We need to put a better system in place in that regard.  We need to develop the resources that will allow that to happen.<br/><br/>In terms of the subscription piece, there are criteria out there.  I was looking at the submissions that were made last week.  There are 220 post-primary schools in the ETB network and 27 community national school.  Only eight of those use the past pupil condition and only two had to invoke it.  There are criteria out there that people are using all of the time that are suitable and appropriate.  I am not going to name them all but I think most people are comfortable with the idea of a sibling so that families are not split up.  There are also discussions about mixed gender as opposed to single gender schools which might change the way families are allowed to enter schools and where they look for schools.  Those sorts of things need to be considered.  The discussion is well on its way here but I am not going to lay down criteria.  Discussions with the educators who are currently involved, with the principals and the groups who appeared before the committee last week on the criteria are necessary.  There are four or five clear criteria, including locality and other areas can be looked at and clearly moved forward but the idea of past pupil just does not ring true.  The Department of Education stated in its strategy that admissions policies must be equal and fair and it does not ring true to have a past pupil element.</p></speech>

That has to be the starting point for whatever we do.  The Senator is right about over-subscription.  We have been saying for so long that it is at 20% but I am not sure that is still the case.  When we talk to parents about this, locality and children mixing in their local community is hugely important.  That moves beyond the school and it means that the children they know in their local community are the ones with whom they go to school and the families know each other.  That is of central importance to families.  Again, there are lots of admissions policies that do not have a discriminatory path and we should look to those for how we go forward.</p></speech>

The choice is made under different criteria.  Parents ask what the post-primary school can offer their child, whether it is focused on particular things like sport, whether it is more academic or practical and so on.  Choices are made under different criteria and the geographic location of the school is not always a consideration.  Another issue that would have to be considered is the ethos of the school.  For many parents, the ethos is a very important and controlling factor in the choice they make.  It would even impact on schools that are primarily boarding schools.  Regardless of the reason it is considered appropriate for a child to attend a boarding school, that school would in most cases be outside of their community.  The criteria that would be used at primary level differs from the criteria applied at post-primary level and that must be acknowledged in any legislation.</p></speech>

The problem with this particular legislative provision is that it may discommode a Traveller child or a child who is in direct provision whose parent could not possibly have attended the school in question and that is just fundamentally unjust.</p></speech>

We had a vote in a plenary session of the D&aacute;il which resulted in our meeting starting somewhat later than scheduled.</p> <p>  I note that due to the easing of Covid restrictions, we have something of a hybrid meeting, with some members in the room.  I see Deputies Stanton and Gannon and Senator Wilson online.  Most importantly, I welcome, in person, Ms Jane-Ann McKenna, CEO of D&oacute;chas; Eamonn Casey, policy officer of Misean Cara; Ms Lorenza Quadrini, programmes lead, EU unit, Plan International Ireland; and Ms Brid Kennedy, regional programmes director, Concern Worldwide.  They are all welcome.  Joining us remotely, I welcome Fr. Frank Bird, director of Marist Asia Foundation, supported by Misean Cara, who joins us from New Zealand at an ungodly hour of the morning.  I offer a similar warm welcome to Mr. Laban Onisimus, education lead, acting head of social development programmes, Plan International, who joins us from Nigeria.  I welcome Mr. Ahmed Ali Dirshe of Concern Worldwide, who joins us from Somalia.  I thank everybody for assembling with us this afternoon in Ireland and our witnesses from around the world for joining us at most different times of the day and night.  I welcome members who are present and members who are attending remotely from their offices.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting will include opening statements followed by a discussion with questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow all members the opportunity to participate.  Hopefully, we will have a second round for members to come back if they so wish.</p> <p>  Education in the developing world is an important topic.  It is one of the issues that our members chose as something of a specialist topic for 2022, so we are grateful that the witnesses have joined us so early in the year.  We hope that, during the course of our year, this is an area that we would revert to, because it is an issue that we feel is of great importance as far as Irish policy, strategy and interests are concerned.  I thank the witnesses for being with us.</p> <p>  I remind our witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that we should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person, speakers will be directed to discontinue their remarks, and it is imperative that such a direction be complied with.</p><p>There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  I do not expect this will arise in the context of our discussions this afternoon.</p><p> I remind members present in the committee room, and those attending remotely from their offices, of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable.  I remind members they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located within the Leinster House complex, which, from their backdrops, I can see they are.</p><p> I am very pleased to call Ms McKenna from D&oacute;chas to introduce the speakers and to make her opening statement.  I congratulate her on her appointment as chief executive officer of D&oacute;chas.  I look forward to working closely with her and her members over the coming years.  I again thank all the representatives for joining our meeting.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to meet with the committee in person.  On behalf of D&oacute;chas and our members, I warmly welcome the committee's engagement with us on the issue of education in international development.  I also thank all committee members for their engagement with my colleagues on the Conference of the Parties, COP26, and the need to shift from commitment to action.  We welcome the fact that the Oireachtas has moved to approve the climate budget framework, which will allow for greater monitoring of Ireland&rsquo;s actions to reduce emissions and contribute to a more sustainable world for current and future generations.</p> <p>  Today, D&oacute;chas members would like to speak to the committee about their role in supporting the provision of quality education for children and young people living in marginalised communities around the world.  We know that for many of these children, conflict, poverty and the real impact of climate change on their livelihoods has been compounded by the devastating impact of Covid-19.  This pandemic has caused the largest disruption to education in history.  Since April 2020, global school closures have impacted over 90% of the world&rsquo;s student population in more than 200 countries.  It is the most marginalised - girls, children with disabilities, those in conflict-affected regions and those living in poverty - who are bearing the brunt of school closures.  For example, according to recent research from the Brookings Institution, published last year, when schools reopened after six months of closure in Uganda and Kenya, up to 20% of girls failed to return.  Similarly, a study of nearly 400 of the hardest to reach rural adolescent girls in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda found that 34% had lost a parent or guardian to Covid-19.  Of that number, 70% had to pursue income-generating activities and 86% could not afford to return to school.</p> <p>  This unprecedented disruption to education has rolled back substantial gains made as part of sustainable development goal 4 on education.  In fact, as recently as two years ago, it was predicted that getting children into primary schools was one of only two goals that were likely to be achieved within the timeframe.  It goes without saying that this is perhaps now no longer the case.  It is imperative that we act now to prevent the exit from education of millions of children, especially girls, from being a permanent one.  Building back stronger, more gender-responsive and resilient education systems that are prepared for future shocks, stresses and school closures requires a multipronged approach.  Underlying causes, including vaccine equity, conflict resolution and equality, must be addressed to ensure that children can fulfil their right to education, health and protection.</p> <p>  I will introduce my colleagues who will speak to the committee virtually today.  Fr. Frank Bird will be first to speak.  He is the director for the Marist Asia Foundation, which has been supported by Misean Cara to carry out a Burmese migrant secondary education programme on the Thailand-Burma border.  We will then cross continents to speak to Laban Onisimus, education lead with Plan International in Nigeria.  Finally, we will cross to the Horn of Africa to speak with Mr. Ali Dirshe who is working with Concern Worldwide in Somalia.</p> <p>  Here in Ireland, we recognise the importance of investing in education.  We have seen the real societal and economic impact this investment brings.  Today, the committee will hear how, against many odds, communities around the globe, supported by D&oacute;chas members, are doing all they can to ensure thousands of children receive a quality education.  We ask that members of this committee support our aim of ensuring that all children can access safe, quality education, no matter where they live.  We ask the committee to support the right to a free education for all children, especially those in marginalised and forgotten communities, and to ensure it stresses the importance of dedicated and flexible funding for children in emergency and conflict settings, particularly those who are refugees or are displaced.  Finally, we ask that as part of Ireland's commitment to achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030, the committee monitors and interrogates Ireland's approach to how we can reach the furthest behind first, when it comes to sustainable development goal 4 on quality education.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Fr. Bird, who is joining us from New Zealand.</p></speech>

Frank Bird" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#C00300"><p>I am a Marist priest of the Society of Mary and my congregation is a member of Misean Cara.  I have been director of the Marist Asia Foundation for the past few years.  We are extremely grateful to Irish Aid, through Misean Cara, for supporting our Burmese migrant secondary education programme in southern Thailand on the Thailand-Myanmar border.</p> <p>  I will give some context.  In the south of Thailand, we are in what is called a migrant corridor.  From the bottom of Myanmar, we take a boat for 20 minutes and then travel into Ranong, a fishing town.  We have the highest density of Burmese migrants in Thailand.  Many migrants and their children work in fish factories, charcoal factories and construction, which are typically the dirty, dangerous and difficult jobs of migrants.  To give some context with numbers, an estimated 80% of migrant children do not go to school.  Of the 20% that do, 80% leave at age 12.  This simply continues the cycle of poverty, oppression and desperation for Myanmar migrant families in Thailand.</p> <p>  Many migrant children do not have documents.  Poor Burmese migrant families are desperate to survive and make their children go to work as soon as their bodies are big enough, which is often around the age of 12.  Discrimination between Thai and Burmese causes many restrictions to entry into the Thai Government school system.  Myanmar migrant children lack the Thai language, which means if they do get into Thai schools many of them drop out.  We identified five significant problems.  We recognise the need for access to inclusive, quality, accredited and sustainable education.  With the help of Misean Cara, we were able to develop a Burmese language, Thai language and English language pathway, creating access to a secondary education and creating a quality and recognized curriculum, and we promoted teacher education pathways so that migrants can become teachers and leaders for their own community.</p> <p>  We have built a centre with the support of Misean Cara, which now has 250 students and, amazingly, a retention rate for migrant children of more than 85% each year.  We now have graduates working in the United Nations, World Vision, Save the Children, the International Organization for Migration, the Fishers Rights Network and other civil society organisations.  We recognised that primary education is not enough; it does not solve enough problems.  Migrants need secondary education so they can become leaders and teachers and can access higher education.</p><p>We have what we call a fragile learning context on the border between Myanmar and Thailand and their two systems.  We have developed a three-language programme and we are now integrated into the Thailand Ministry of Education's non-formal education programme.  Our goal is not just education, but also leadership and development of the local community.  We are not in an emergency problem or a migrant problem.  We are in the midst of a community with great needs.  As missionaries, we can walk in different worlds and different cultures.  We are seen as bridge-builders and problem-solvers.  By living among the people in the long term, we have developed trust and collaboration.</p><p> We recognise that we cannot solve all the problems of international migration, or the migrant problems for the Burmese, but we can offer them an education so that they can solve their problems.  We recognise that education is the greatest gift we can give to migrants, refugees and displaced peoples.  I thank the members of the committee for their time and support.</p></speech>

I lead the education teams in conflict-affected regions of Nigeria focusing on child protection and education in emergencies.  My key responsibilities involve influencing states&rsquo; commitment to ensuring access to education and gender-responsive education, with an emphasis on the nexus of development and humanitarian intervention.</p> <p>  The protracted crisis in the Lake Chad region remains one of the most severe humanitarian emergencies in the world, affecting the north-east of Nigeria and the far north of Cameroon.  More than 17 million people have been affected across the four countries of the Lake Chad Basin.  Approximately 10.7 million of them are in dire need of humanitarian assistance to survive and more than 6 million of them are children.</p> <p>  The following are the key issues affecting us: abduction of children; sexual violence against girls; attacks on schools; and recruitment and use of girls for attacks.  On 14 and 15 April 2014, 276 female students aged between 16 and 18 were abducted in Chibok in Borno State.  This was the first major case of abduction that received global attention.  As I address the committee today, some of those girls have yet to return home.  Some parents have died waiting for those children.  Thousands of adolescent girls have been denied the right to education and a dignified life because of the 11 years of crisis in that region.  This has led to mental, emotional and health-related issues.  In some cases, the lack of access to healthcare facilities has resulted in people dying.</p> <p>  The root cause of this crisis is the hostility to secular education.  Because of this, we have repeated attacks on schools, universities, teachers, administrators and students, wreaking havoc on the existing fragile education system in the country.  Children are being abandoned and have been displaced from their communities.  Many teachers are being forced to flee to other states.</p> <p>  I will now digress a little bit to highlight the use of girls in armed conflict, including those used as suicide bombers.  Girls are normally viewed as less of a threat than their male counterparts.  From June 2014, when the insurgent groups reportedly deployed their first female suicide bomber, to date, approximately 468 women and girls have been deployed for suicide attacks.  This is the most by any terrorist movement in the world so far.</p> <p>  What are we doing to respond to these challenges?  Plan International has been supporting the increased access to safe inclusive and quality primary and secondary education for both boys and girls, especially in areas of displacement and resettlement.  We have gone a step further by providing credible alternatives for relevant and flexible accelerated basic education as well as non-formal education opportunities for out-of-school children.  Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children in the world with about 10.5 million children out of school.  We are also strengthening the capacities of public administration and community engagement through school-based management committees to help with the delivery of safe and inclusive education services.</p> <p>  We recommend the following: improve the security conditions for adolescent girls: advocate for comprehensive and sustained measures to protect education from attack; take measures to mitigate the security threats faced by adolescent girls as a result of the economic and associated food and water crises; recognise that girls have their own specific rights, needs, and agency in humanitarian settings and require age-appropriate policy responses; facilitate access to education, which responds to the specific needs of adolescent girls, particularly at secondary school level; and increase funding for development and humanitarian aid to the north-east of Nigeria.</p></speech>

I will now hand over to Mr. Ahmed Ali Dirshe, of Concern Worldwide who is joining us from Somalia.</p></speech>

My name is Ahmed Ali Dirshe and I joined Concern&rsquo;s Somalia office in 1994, one year after our education programme was established.  We have been providing education in Somalia, almost without interruption, since 1993.</p> <p>  &ldquo;I am among the fruits of the tree that Concern planted,&rdquo; said one of our former beneficiaries, a Member of Parliament in the south-west state.  In the video we shared before this meeting, members will also have seen the testimony of Ubah Mohamed, a young woman from Mogadishu who studied in one of the schools Concern supports and went on to become the deputy head teacher.  These are just two of thousands of students Concern has supported through famine, drought, flooding, and conflict, with support from Irish Aid, the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, ECHO, Education Cannot Wait, the Global Partnership for Education, and others.</p><p>We rehabilitate damaged classrooms and provide food, water, and sanitation and health facilities.  We have seen significant improvements in learning outcomes by training teachers, reviewing school curricula, providing textbooks, and tackling gender-based violence and corporal punishment.  From 2004 to 2020, we supported 42 schools.  In 2021 alone, we enrolled more than 10,000 children, 47% girls, and supported almost 400 teachers, one third of them women.  Our retention rate of 85% was almost evenly spread across boys and girls.  Generations of professionals have emerged, among them nurses, teachers, politicians, and engineers.</p><p> Our approach is centred on partnership with learners, parents, elders, local institutions, and communities.  By establishing community education committees and ensuring that members of the community are involved in the design, construction, and management of schools, we have increased community ownership and school enrolment.</p><p> In providing education in emergencies, our focus is on access, quality, well-being, and continuity.  To ensure that our investment in education is sustainable, we advocate for the Government to engage.  The Government has now taken over management of seven Concern-supported schools in Mogadishu, in partnership with communities, and the work to ensure ownership is continuing.  A key aspect of our work with the Government has been to develop the community education committees policy framework and training manual, both of which were endorsed by the Ministry of Education.  To roll this out, we have trained dozens of facilitators who gave training in no fewer than 651 schools, reaching 4,557 committee members.  I am sure this committee will agree that this is an excellent start but more must be done to further institutionalise the policy framework.</p><p> One of the lessons we have learned is the need to plan for unforeseen costs and be ready to adapt to crises, such as flooding and pandemics.  To be able to respond and adjust quickly to new realities, we also need flexibility from our donors.  The generous support of Irish Aid and the Irish public has enabled generations of young Somalis to receive an education.</p><p> I take this opportunity to call for strengthened support for peace-building and conflict-resolution efforts to address the root causes that threaten education, students, and teachers, and investments made to date.  I also call for continued funding for education in humanitarian and development assistance, which is an investment in the youth and future of our country.</p></speech>

While they were about different parts of the world and different circumstances, they dealt with similar issues and challenges.  We are very grateful for their contributions.  We will now move to questions and statements from members.  Senator Ardagh is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1630" speakername="Catherine Ardagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#E00400"><p>I thank Ms McKenna and her team for coming here today to give their really insightful presentations.  It is super how, with the advent of Covid, we have been able to meet people from all over the world and get their perspectives.  That is one positive effect of Covid.</p> <p>  All of the speakers referred to violence against women and the failure of girls to access education, which still goes on.  Women in Ireland have always known that in order to protect themselves they have to act in a certain way.  Our male colleagues and friends are starting to realise that life is a little different for women.  We are having a conversation about that in Ireland now but obviously things are a lot worse for girls living in war-torn countries.</p> <p>  The statistic indicating that 20% of girls did not return to education after Covid is shocking.  Disadvantaged communities in Ireland were also adversely affected by education going online, especially communities that did not have access to broadband but I can see how that would be a whole lot worse in developing and war-torn regions.  The statistics relating to migrant children are even worse.  While we did not get a breakdown in relation to males and females, I imagine the pattern is the same in terms of girls getting left behind.</p> <p>  The kidnapping of Chibok schoolgirls by Boko Haram happened in 2014.  Since then, it has largely been forgotten about, although mass kidnappings do occasionally pop up in the media.  What could we do, perhaps in the context of our seat on the UN Security Council, to help the situation?</p></speech>

I do not have a question on the presentations as such, which were very clear, but I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation and admiration for the work our guests do, both collectively and individually.</p> <p>  It is a valid point to make that while there is an absence of opportunity generally, it is a particular problem for young women.  It would seem that Covid has represented a big setback and I ask our guests to comment on how that might be overcome.  Reference was made to vaccine equity which is an important staging point.  It is classically the case that all of the marginalised areas suffer the most.</p> <p>  I was very interested in the school described by Father Bird and the great success there.  Perhaps he could tell us a bit more about that.  What was interesting about Mr. Onisimus's presentation on Nigeria were the security issues it highlighted.</p><p>It is a horrendous situation with the security issue.  I do not know how that can be addressed.</p><p> The question we all want to ask is in what way can we do something that we are not now doing?  What should we, as a committee, recommend doing?</p></speech>

Our guests are in far flung places across the world.  One of the major benefits, if anything has come from the Covid world, is how the ability to meet online has made the world a bit smaller.  Another challenge that Covid threw up was in education.  In Ireland when the schools had to close, I, as a parent, saw the challenges, particularly as my wife tried to educate our children who were home from school and who were depending on the Internet.  I can only imagine the challenges in many of the places we are discussing where online education simply did not exist as an option.</p> <p>  I am truly shocked at the figures.  I thank the witnesses for presenting them.  It is only when we see the harsh realities, we see how seriously and negatively impacted communities have been across the globe.  I am looking at the figures for Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda where 34% have lost a parent.  That is absolutely heartbreaking.  In Uganda and Kenya 20% of girls have not returned to school.  That is frightening.  Some of the reasons for this were outlined.  We see that in areas of conflict.  This committee has heard before how getting women's input into any peace process is invaluable.  Women can be kingpins in many of these communities and are the first to fall out of those processes to go back to hold the family together and keep food on the table and provide for the family.  It is having a really negative impact.</p> <p>  Vaccine equity was touched on.  We were one of the first committees to hold hearings on vaccine inequity and we made specific asks.  Unfortunately, we remain in a situation where we do not have vaccine equity.  What is the real impact of this?   We talk about the 20% of the girls who have failed to return to school for various reasons.  How much of that is due to their not being vaccinated and the fear of spreading Covid?</p> <p>  I agree with the three primary requests outlined by Ms McKenna.  This committee should seriously look at these.  I would support them fully as a very basic and essential tool to make inroads into the areas needed.  </p> <p>  Irish Aid is a key tool for exerting our influence and for us to make an input to address a very serious challenge.  How much of the funds are going to these areas, including education?</p> <p>  It is probably different across the countries but is there a rough figure for how many children, a percentage of the population, were in the education system prior to Covid and how do the figures compare now?  What is a reduction of 20% in real terms mean?</p> <p>  I commend all the organisations here and particularly those who have been on the ground during very challenging times who have kept the show on the road.  I commend the teams of people and the volunteers who undertake the invaluable work.  On my own behalf, I thank everyone from the bottom of my heart.</p></speech>

It is great to have such an engaged discussion on this.  I will ask Mr. Onisimus in Nigeria who is probably the expert on this to respond to Senator Ardagh.  Under Irish Aid's policy for a better world, gender is a key area.  Ireland has shown great leadership at UN level on promoting the inclusion of girls particularly on education and in other areas.  Will Mr. Onisimus outline what he thinks Ireland can do on the direct attack on schools or to ensure that the safety of schools is protected?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Laban Onisimus" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#F00500"><p>Prior to 2021 the country had no policy on school safety and security.  I am sure members will know that in October last year, we hosted an international conference on the safe school declaration.  Nigeria is a member country having signed the declaration which means that we have a policy in place.  It is one thing to have a policy and another for us to really popularise it and know what it entails and thereby implement it.  It is a question of our popularising the safe school declaration policy and continuous sensitisation to the community on school safety because the solution lies in the community in terms of early-warning signals for schools.  The attacks, not just the Chibok, have happened in so many areas of the country.  In May around 300 or 400 children were abducted at the same time.  These terrorists do not come unnoticed.  There are key areas in the community and we will have to sensitise each and every member of the community on early warning signals.</p> <p>  Then there is the need for strong political will to stop this.  We know it is a security issue but there is a political aspect to it too.  There is a need for the government to ensure that it deploys a strong political commitment to stopping abduction in schools.  The list of abductions in Nigeria goes on and on.  I believe that once the safe school declaration is popularised and that the community is sensitised and you train teachers and children on early warning signals, it would be one way to prevent cases of abduction and attacks on schools in Nigeria. </p></speech>

I know the committee has discussed this.  Members might be familiar with the People's Vaccine Alliance here in Ireland which is championing the issue.</p><p>I believe we can agree on the impact of vaccines in Ireland in allowing us to return to a sense of normality and children to return to school.  That is critical worldwide.</p><p> My colleague Ms Kennedy will go through some of the actions we could take to overcome some of the challenges associated with building back better, ensuring the exit of girls from education does not become more permanent and determining how we can include them in the next few years.</p></speech>

Both issues are inextricably linked.  Children are ending up in more child-labour circumstances because, as we have heard, one or both parents of a child may be dying.  Some parents who are not employed find it easier to get the children employed, with girls in one role and boys in another.  It is important to address the economic situation, support good governance and support governments to be accountable and deliver on their own plans for their countries.</p> <p>  On the question of what we can do, we should support the right to free education, be it through NGOs or through supporting governments in providing good-quality education systems that allow children to go to school such that they do not have to do child labour to support their families to survive.  Also, we could interrogate how we can reach the furthest behind, especially regarding sustainable development goal 4, which is all about quality education.  Children often drop out of school because the system in school is not favourable.  It may not be safe to go to school and there may be corporal punishment.  The physical shapes of schools may not be good, and there are rainy seasons and very hot seasons.  Therefore, it is a matter of determining how we can support quality education.</p> <p>  The funding word was mentioned but it is a matter of increasing funding.  We really commend the Irish Government on how it has been continually increasing funding for education in recent years.  That is making a difference.  The statistics in general show more children have been getting educated over the past two decades than before that.  The pandemic has resulted in a bit of a setback so it is a question of getting the figures back up again.  Education in development and emergency contexts must be considered.  Only in the past few years has ECHO, the humanitarian organisation of the EU, started funding education in emergencies.  Education needs to be prioritised almost as much as the provision of food, water and shelter in emergency contexts so children will not fall back into dreadful coping strategies required by their parents.</p></speech>

We have committed over &euro;250 million to be spent over the next five years on quality education.  How we can target those who are furthest behind is yet to be seen.  I will hand over to Mr. Casey to address the issue of progress made prior to Covid-19, particularly with regard to the strategic development goals and what catching up we must do now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#G00400"><p>As Ms Kennedy pointed out, there was solid progress on access before the Covid-19 pandemic.  Unfortunately, owing to the pandemic's health implications and the social restrictions introduced by governments across the world, 1.5 billion children were put out of school across the world.  When we hear about the percentage who will not be able to go back to school, we understand that as many as 20 million may not be able to do so, on top of hundreds of millions who were not able to go to school before the pandemic.  Therefore, there are genuine problems with access.  When children and youths get into a school, an important issue arises over quality.  Certainly for girls, there is the core issue of getting into school.  It is a matter of protection as much as education.  The two really go hand in hand.  Protection is to avoid early marriage, trafficking and child labour.  Once the girls are in school, there is a genuine chance of quality education that will improve their circumstances.</p> <p>  Our faith-based organisations working in education are trying to tackle the supply-side barriers to access, especially girls' access &mdash; for instance, through improving schooling, improving sanitary supplies and facilities, tackling unsafe environments, as Ms Kennedy mentioned, and addressing the issue of distance to school, sometimes by providing bicycles or safe transport.  Also, there are sometimes genuine challenges associated with persuading people of the value of going to school when their households are poor or when it is a challenge.  It is therefore a matter of addressing attitudes to schooling, especially girls' schooling, and of ensuring a value is attached to it.  Much of the time, there is a genuine outreach issue in persuading parents, communities, community elders and local politicians to support girls' education and in raising awareness of rights concerning sexual health and avoiding unplanned pregnancy.   It is a question of holistic approaches to increasing household income so households do not regard the cost of educating people, especially girls, as insurmountable.</p> <p>  Despite the scale of the challenge, there really are positive stories of success &mdash; for instance, in northern Nigeria.  Even in South Sudan and Somalia and in situations of conflict and fragility, there still can be stories of success if you stick at it for the long term and especially if you reach out to the furthest behind.  In addition to NGOs and missionary organisations strengthening access and quality and supporting systems, they tend to have a particular focus on reaching out to the furthest behind.  I am conscious that I may have used more than my share of time.  One of the ways we have done what I am talking about in Misean Cara has been by focusing education efforts on post-conflict environments, slum environments and isolated rural areas, in particular, and also by exercising positive discrimination in how we support projects that offer educational supports to people with disability, girls, migrants, and internally and forcibly displaced people.  These are some of the ways in which we are responding to strategic development goal 4.</p></speech>

On reading one of the submissions, I was struck by the fact that teachers had to flee into the jungle because they were afraid.  A couple of hundred years ago, we had hedge schools in Ireland because education was not allowed in certain circumstances.  People were taught in fields, hedges and so on.  What has been described today is so much worse because Covid, climate change, conflict, corruption and extreme poverty are all rolled into one in many areas, yet there are people putting their own lives at risk to deliver education.</p><p>I am struck as well by the human potential where you have girls and boys saying they want to be doctors and teachers.  If the help is given they can achieve those ambitions, which is fantastic.</p><p> I am struck also by the issue of the use of sexual violence, rape, etc., and how awful that is.  We had that debate last night on our national broadcaster, but I refer to the scale and extent of it there.  It is used as a weapon of war.  It is horrific.  I am not sure what we can do about that.</p><p> Irish Aid and the NGOs are doing tremendous work.  There is a lot of money being spent and we are a very small country.  For many years, Irish missionaries and Irish NGOs have been respected and have been working across the world.  I met many ministers from different countries in the UN a number of years ago who acknowledged that.  Is there any other country out there that is doing good work that could be shown as an example of best practice so that we could look at it as well?  How is the First World generally responding to the challenges and can we, in our role in the United Nations, do more to highlight what is going on?</p><p> Many people in Ireland do not realise what has been described today or do not know about it because it is not something that is highlighted here.  My God, I think we live in an oasis here in Ireland compared to what was described, which, in many instances, one could say was hell on earth, and yet we have stories of success which are great to hear.</p><p> It is something that we need to do more on.  Our place in the United Nations may be something we could use more to highlight this and maybe our own broadcasters here could do what they can to highlight what is going on there.  I am shocked at what I have heard.  I cannot even begin to imagine what some people are having to go through.</p><p> I thank our guests for being here today and say "Well done" for the work they are doing.  They certainly made an impact, on me and on my colleagues as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#H00200"><p>I thank our guests for being with us today.</p> <p>  Looking at the presentations that were made and the written work that was sent in, I have to say it is utterly depressing.  As the brother of eight sisters, the father of a daughter and the grandfather of two beautiful granddaughters, it is utterly depressing to think that sexual violence is the way we fight wars and the way we deal with these things.</p> <p>  On the positive side, as a teacher I engaged with many Nigerian students in particular, and the work ethic that I saw from them was way above the average.  That is great.  It strikes me, when we are talking about funding, that the days of funding education alone are over as that is no longer a solution to the problem because there is personal security involved.  One has an image of young women travelling to and from school and constantly in danger of being assaulted or kidnapped.  There were 276 girls taken from a school.  It strikes me that not only do we need to fund the teachers, we need also to fund secure environments and secure transport.  I am not even sure if they should travel home.  Perhaps we should be looking at some form of boarding school for safe education.  That is something I would like them to address.</p> <p>  Do they have any evidence today of the take up between male and female students?  I am aware, for example, here in Ireland among certain ethnic groups that there is male engagement in the education system up to approximately the age of 16 at which stage they withdraw totally, but the females continue on.  I have seen some wonderful work among some of the ethnic groups, but mainly from females.  The males seem to have departed by 16.  I wonder does that follow through when we are talking about Somalia, Nigeria and other such countries.</p> <p>  The speaker from Somalia spoke about outcomes.  Every time I hear the word "outcomes" the hair on the back of my neck stands up.  As a former teacher, something that really bothered me about the way EU funding in education in Ireland was going was it was based on outcomes.  Funding would follow based on how many students did you take, how many modules did they study and how many they pass whereas for some of us to survive a year attending school, maybe three days a week rather than five, would be a massive achievement.  Over a period of time, it might take a student three years to achieve what another student could achieve in one academic year.  With all due respect to the presenter from Somalia who I fully understand, I worry when I hear statistics on outcomes and that sort of thing.  For me, it is far more important that a student would attend and start to develop an educational programme which might take longer than one year or two.  Going back to my own education days, it was my experience that some of the worst students I had in first year in further education turned out to be the most dedicated students by third year.</p> <p>  Our guests mentioned the vaccine programme.  They will be aware that we had a fairly significant debate in the Seanad on the issue of vaccine equality throughout the world.  I am still horrified, and it still bothers me every day, that one of the major drug companies is making $65,000 a minute on the vaccine while we have tens of millions of people in the world who cannot be vaccinated.  I say that because I think our guests need to say that all day, every day.  They need to get that out there.  The animal instincts of capitalism in the case of vaccine are utterly sickening.</p> <p>  On the issue of Afghanistan, when we took over the UN Security Council seat our ambassador made a statement about how we stand with the women and girls of Afghanistan.  I was quite critical of that at the time because words are easy to say.  I wonder have our guests any knowledge as to what is happening in that part of the world.  Where are we with girls, particularly girls' education?  I stated here previously that I cannot imagine what it must be like to be 17 years of age, having been through the education system in Afghanistan and suddenly have it all taken away from you.  I cannot begin to understand it.</p> <p>  My final question is about multinationals which have, for the want of a better description, raped these countries of their resources.  How much funding is coming from multinationals?  Does anything come the way of our guests from multinationals that are involved in these areas?</p> <p>  I thank our guests very much for the work they do.</p></speech>

Deputy Gannon has left for the Chamber where there are statements.</p> <p>  Before bringing matters to a formal conclusion, I will add to the questions of the members who spoke most recently.  I refer to Ms McKenna's opening statement.  With particular reference to the sustainable development goals, SDGs, in particular, goal 4, Ms McKenna states, and we have heard this previously in the context of Covid, that the pandemic itself and the consequent social restrictions, and the economic consequences of such social restrictions, have blown the SDG targets off course.  It seems from Ms McKenna's statement that with the last two SDGs, one of which we are dealing with today, namely, goal 4 on education, whatever chance we had of reaching that target is blown off course now with Covid.  That means that none of the goals will have their targets reached by 2030.</p><p>With specific reference to education, I note that SDG 4 deals not only with education but "quality" education.  That word is used.  Before we conclude, I ask some of our guests at the coalface to deal with the issue of quality.  For me, quality education means attaining a certain standard, having quality teaching, having a reasonable type of infrastructure and having a class size that might be considered appropriate for the delivery of quality education.  It appears that in some countries, particularly some African countries, class sizes could be off the Richter scale as far as we are concerned in Ireland, with 100, 120 or 130 people, perhaps no formal hours and perhaps competing interests of a type Mr. Casey mentioned.  My question is a difficult one but how do our guests see SDG 4 on the matter of quality education coming back to some type of realisable target for 2030, and that the developed world does not just engage in some hand-wringing and say it is not going to reach this goal because of the Covid-19 pandemic?  What can we do to catch up, as it were?</p></speech>

I will start with your question with regard to quality, Chairman, because it touches on Senator Craughwell's comment regarding outcomes and what we are measuring in the context of quality education, and that it is not just about access but about the long-term impact we are having.  I will hand over to Fr. Bird to comment on how we are measuring or able to measure quality education and what it looks like in practice with regard to SDG 4.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Fr. Frank Bird" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#J00300"><p>We found access was important with free education.  As more and more students began to join the education programme we hit the quality issue.  The quality education programme is based on a quality teacher.  How can we get quality teaching in fragile contexts?  Misean Cara supported us in adopting an integrated model.  After a secondary education, we had an online university programme which trained teachers.  It is not a scholarship model that sends a person away out of his or her community, which is very expensive.  We train locally, using online university programmes for training teachers.  They taught and they were learning and becoming educated teachers in their community, not sent away for four years and possibly never to return.</p> <p>  Quality education can be accessed through online university systems and it builds hope, especially for the teenage girls, that they can become teachers.  With girls, parents want them to be safe, and they are safe at home, sometimes at school.  Teaching is a very well-regarded role in the community and it provides very positive role models.  There are university online systems that are providing teacher education.  We have benefited from that and it has grown the quality of our education programme because we are not just asking for volunteers or having a secondary graduate, but having someone who is trained.  Online university has been a very significant part for us to bring quality education to our migrant education programmes.</p></speech>

Bird.  Another question initially was about where there are examples of other countries that are doing well in this regard or where we can learn from, perhaps, the different initiatives that have been introduced that have been quite successful.  I will ask Ms Quadrini to address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorenza Quadrini" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#J00500"><p>I do not want to talk about other countries as I would like to stay focused on Nigeria.  The picture from Nigeria is very grim but we are working to improve the situation with Plan International.  We are especially targeting out-of-school children.  Globally, 20% of the out-of-school children of the world are in Nigeria.  We are targeting those children through EU funding.  We have developed an accelerated education curriculum that has been approved by the ministry of Nigeria and has been approved for roll-out countrywide.  We are hoping to bring back as many children as possible to school - children who were not in school before Covid and children who are not coming back to school after Covid.</p> <p>  We are piloting the curriculum in a programme that is ongoing and we have found that we actually can gather all the children who want to go back to school.  In organising the courses, training the teachers and organising the courses in facilities that are safe, with the number of students per teacher at no more than 45 children per teacher, as the guidelines say is best practice, we have seen not only that the children learn but also that they do not want to go back to primary school when they have learned enough to be reintegrated.  Unfortunately, primary school does not allow them to have the same level of protection and the same level of quality of education that we are providing to them in those courses.  That is a new challenge that we are trying to solve now.</p> <p>  That links to the issue of quality education, but it also shows that there is still hope, even in countries and in contexts that are getting worse by the year.  When we started the programme in north-east Nigeria the security was not good but definitely was not as bad as it is now.  However, we are still managing to get success.  We are working with 123 primary schools and we are managing to get the children back to school and managing to teach them as best as we can with the infrastructure we have.  We have great teachers in Nigeria because they are qualified and good teachers.  I do not know if this answers the question, but I hope it brings some hope.</p></speech>

Where do we see that drop off happening and what are some of the measures that have been taken, from his example in Somalia which has been quite successful in retaining girls in school in those challenging circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ahmed Ali Dirshe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#J00900"><p>We have come a long way in getting that number of girls into school.  Initially, when we started the programme in 1993, we had a very small percentage of girls attending school.  Mostly, it was that the civil war was at the peak at the time.  The understanding of the people of sending girls to school was very low at the time.  Also, people in our culture were not used to sending girls into school.  From there we have tried our best to encourage parents onto CECs.  Initially we built the community education committees who were managing, because at the time there was no government at all in Somalia.  We were dealing directly with the community.  We established community education committees.  We gave them training and then we also gave them awareness so that they encouraged parents to send their girls.</p><p>There is still a long way to go but we have reached the point that some 40% of girls are now attending the schools supported by Concern.  One of the approaches we used was to recruit female teachers, which was not done at the time.  When we were recruiting the teachers, I remember we advocated that a proportion of female contenders apply.  We set the number at 50% of the school teachers.  That is how these teachers became models for the girls and parents started sending their girls to school.</p></speech>

That reiterates Mr. Onisimus's point that female educators are one of the key areas we need to address in terms of driving girls' education.  I will hand over to Ms Kennedy to respond to the question for Afghanistan.  Concern is working in Afghanistan at the moment and probably has a good perspective on the situation there.</p></speech>

Concern's approach to education has evolved over the years and has become much more community focused.  As Senator Craughwell said, we used to look only at numbers of children rather than quality.  Over the years, we have developed an approach of working with the community, parents, caregivers, girls and boys, and working with teacher training right up to national level where we can.  We are trying to use that model in Afghanistan with the support of Irish Aid.  In the areas where we are working in Afghanistan we are able to access our education programme and deliver it in that manner.  There are other areas in Afghanistan where this permission has not been given.  We are maximising on the permissions we have.  Irish Aid is very flexible and we welcome that but a number of donors have sanctions against the current government in Afghanistan in the areas of education and health.  We encourage the Irish Government to use whatever leverage it has to lift those sanctions because we are denying fundamental basic human rights to children who have no responsibility for contributing to this war.  They should not be denied their basic rights.</p></speech>

I will hand over to Mr. Casey to address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#K00800"><p>We have looked at this, particularly in regard to girls.  Safety in schools is a particular problem.  In one respect, much of it comes down to teachers.  Much of the time, there has been a culture where corporal punishment is accepted and acceptable.  A big part of the challenge is to change this cultural attitude.  While the laws or policies may change, the culture does not necessarily change.  It is often about trying to bring the teachers and school leaders with us.  That starts outside the school because the teachers are not going to change their cultural attitudes if they are in a community, district or region where the prevailing attitude is that it is okay to inflict corporal punishment on students.</p> <p>  A particular emphasis on safe schools would be tackling gender-based violence in schools.  Other measures include addressing student-on-student violence, which can occur, engaging family support and communities, improving sanitary infrastructure for girls, which is often a flashpoint of difficulty that causes girls to leave school, and improving school infrastructure.  There are times - this came up in a briefing we had with the committee in 2019 - where dormitories are necessary.  While they bring their own challenges, both in terms of cost and protection, sometimes in the wider chaotic environment they are the only option.  Much of the time, it depends on the context and changing attitudes, behaviours and policies with school leadership.</p> <p>  Misean Cara has a flagship programme in South Africa where we support a project through some of our members.  It seeks to improve school behaviours and address violence across all the Catholic schools in South Africa and learn from each other about what works.  Crucially, it does not stick only to Catholic schools but is also linked in with the ministry and its strategic leadership unit to see what kind of practices work best and in what kinds of locations in order that they can be brought in across the state system.  That is the kind of strengthening of the educational system the project is trying to model in Catholic schools and then expand to all the schools.</p></speech>

Violence seems to be the name of the game for them.  Does Mr. Casey envisage the possibility of needing to have armed guards around the school to allow for a safe environment?  I know the two things are mutually repugnant but the important thing is to get quality education in a safe environment.  Does he see any need for that?</p></speech>

It has to be tailored to the cultural context.  Sometimes we may want to challenge or change the cultural context but I cannot imagine a situation where there would be a securitised approach.  It would be about building trust and relationships and maybe bringing in measures like safe cycling and walking routes to school or negotiating with local elders and tribal leaders to create community approaches to tackle community problems, rather than a securitised approach.</p></speech>

I express the appreciation of the committee members to Fr. Frank Bird in New Zealand, Mr. Onisimus in Nigeria and Mr. Ahmed in Somalia.  Oftentimes we look on technology from a negative perspective but this afternoon we have seen its joys.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge what Deputy Brady said earlier when he indicated a proposal that we would accept the recommendations as put forward and we should do that.  We can include reference to what Senator Craughwell said, albeit that is a difficult political issue.  I agree we should look at options when it comes to Afghanistan but there are real and serious political concerns about any form of recognition of the regime there.  I do not see any options on the table and if members agree with that we can urge the Government to look at a suite of options that do not appear to be present in Afghanistan at the moment.</p> <p>  I notice members of the media present this afternoon.  We were previously restricted in that regard due to Covid.  I would remind them, as I remind our guests, that this time last year the committee produced an important and comprehensive report on Covid-19, vaccine equality and COVAX, which Deputy Brady referred to.  We should reiterate and reaffirm our support for the contents of that report, which might not have found favour in the greater political debate, as they did within the confines of this room.  I acknowledge Deputy Brady&rsquo;s reminder of that and I agree with him.  I acknowledge the important work of Irish Aid and Misean Cara, as has been mentioned.  I will leave the final word to Ms McKenna and I thank her for being with us.</p></speech>

It is obvious from many of the contributions today &ndash; and I particularly thank those who joined us from Somalia, Nigeria and New Zealand &ndash; that regardless of where we are in the world there are some common approaches that work in progressing education for those who are marginalised and for girls.  In particular, I mention having a community-based approach and targeted programmes that are addressed and tailored towards girls to ensure their participation.  There are a number of groups that fall outside educational systems, including migrants and refugees.  We need to ensure they are brought in and that those who are the furthest behind get access to education and fulfil their right to quality education.</p></speech>

I understand the Minister and the Secretary General will be making opening statements and following this we will move to questions and answers with members of the committee.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in a way that makes that person identifiable.  I remind members that they may only participate in the meeting by remote means if they are physically present in offices or rooms on the Leinster House complex.  I note that some members are joining us from their offices in accordance with the hybrid arrangements following Covid.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister.  I understand there is a parallel debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber, which may impact our proceedings, but I call on the Minister to make his opening statement, followed by the Secretary General.  I thank the Minister again for meeting us today.</p></speech>

I know a lot is happening today.  On 17 June 2020, Ireland was elected to a seat on the UN Security Council.  This was a massive achievement.</p><p>It was the successful culmination of a 15-year effort and an intense two-year global campaign by Ministers and Irish officials, showcasing Ireland's values of empathy, partnership and independence, and convincing members of the UN that Ireland would be a voice for good on international peace and security issues, representing the perspectives of small countries.</p><p> On 17 June, as planned and approved in advance, a team of officials were carrying out essential duties in the workplace in Iveagh House ahead of an announcement of the first round election voting that evening.  Those officials were ready to work through the night to conduct a full campaign in the 17 hours or so ahead of a possible second round of voting scheduled to begin on the morning of 18 June, in New York, to secure a seat for Ireland.</p><p> On that evening there was a breach of social distancing guidance that has caused genuine and understandable concern to members of the committee and to the broader Irish public.  This involved the publication of a photograph from the offices of Iveagh House showing some of the very same dedicated team I have just spoken of.  In response to the concerns expressed, and to establish the facts of the matter, on 13 January I asked the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joe Hackett, who is here with me, for a report by the end of January into the circumstances leading up to this workplace incident.  I received the report, Review of Workplace Arrangements in Iveagh House on 17 June 2020, on 31 January and sent it to the committee.  It was also published that day.  The Secretary General, Mr. Hackett, is here today to outline for the committee the contents of the report and its findings and to take any questions members might have.</p><p> For my part, I am satisfied that the review, drawing on extensive oral and written evidence as set out in the report, provides a fair, balanced and, where appropriate, critical account of the events of 17 June 2020.  I support the conclusions of the review as well as the actions taken by the Secretary General in response.  The Secretary General, on behalf of the Department, has clearly acknowledged that valid public concerns were raised by the photograph and the breach of Covid guidelines and that a mistake was made, and a sincere apology was given.</p><p> I wish to take this opportunity to provide an account of my movements over the course of the day in question, as far as I can recall them over 19 months later.  On 17 June 2020 I had a busy workday.  I spent part of the day in Iveagh House and part of it in Government Buildings.  For context, we were about a week out from forming a Government.  I was involved in negotiating the programme for Government and at the time my party was considering the proposed document.  I was heavily involved in those briefings too.  Early on the evening of 17 June 2020 I was in Iveagh House before I moved to Government Buildings to watch the outcome of the Security Council vote with the Taoiseach.  I passed through the open plan UN policy unit office space in Iveagh House on my way out.  This would have been well before 8 p.m., which was the original time at which the announcement of the results had been expected.  The UN team was busy working away in the various parts of the office.  I recall there being a build-up and lots of expectation in advance of the vote.  There was lots of nervousness too.  In the previous few weeks we had had to change our campaign planning because of the pandemic.  I had cancelled all travel and in-person meetings and had spoken on the phone to more than 80 foreign ministers to ask them to support Ireland's bid.  Ireland was up against formidable opponents in Norway and Canada.</p><p> When we took the seat in the first round vote I was relieved and delighted with the result.  I took it as an endorsement of all the campaign efforts of the Government.  It was and still is an acknowledgement by other countries, big and small, that Ireland has an important contribution to make on the crucial matters of international peace and security that are central to the discussions on the UN Security Council.</p><p> After the vote, which finally came in at about 9.10 p.m., a lot later than expected, I prepared for and then attended a press conference in Government Buildings to welcome the result.  The press conference was live-streamed beginning at around 9.25 p.m. and concluding at around 9.55 p.m.  Following the press conference, I made my way back to work in Iveagh House and went through the open plan office to congratulate the UN policy unit team.  I stayed there for about ten to 15 minutes.  I saw a happy but tired group of staff after a long day.  Some were packing up to go home, some had already gone home and some were on phones and computers continuing their work.  After I spoke and said "thank you" to the team who had worked so hard that day, I went to my office to prepare for a call with the Norwegian foreign minister and to meet with members of my team to discuss the next morning, which included a number of requests for media interviews.  We decided which ones I would do.</p><p> I was told by a member of my team that a group photograph had been tweeted.  The tweet was later taken down and the mistake acknowledged by the then Secretary General, Niall Burgess.  At the time, I saw this as a mistake by the then Secretary General.  With the benefit of hindsight, however, I accept I should have raised the matter with him formally.  I did not at the time.  This was a breach of Covid guidelines in the workplace and should not have happened.  The report before the committee outlines the details of what has flowed from that.</p><p> I wish to note that this mistake made by the former Secretary General was highly uncharacteristic of him.  Niall Burgess is a very dedicated public servant who, during the pandemic, made a significant contribution by overseeing our response to the biggest consular emergency in the history of the State, with tens of thousands of citizens trapped or in difficulty overseas.  The Department of Foreign Affairs I know is the one that had to get trapped Irish citizens off cruise ships all over the world when the pandemic was first declared.  The Department I know during Covid organised charter flights from India and South America and block-booked dozens of scheduled flights with airlines to bring our people home.  This is what I saw day in and day out until and beyond 17 June 2020.  The team working in Iveagh House that day are those committed, hard-working and diligent civil servants.  The photograph and the breach of Covid guidelines, which I am not excusing at all, do not do justice to the integrity and dedication of that group of people.</p><p> The photograph was public at the time, in June 2020, but the controversy and public anger surrounding it surfaced later, in December 2021.  I asked my Secretary General, Mr. Hackett, to undertake this review and he set the terms of reference.  The review focused on the breach of Covid guidelines in the workplace captured in the photograph that was tweeted that evening as well as the events leading up to it, which are detailed in hundreds of pages of emails and planning documents in the annexe to the report that was produced.  I was not present for the photograph, and my interaction with the staff involved took place after the photograph had been taken.  As Accounting Officer for the Department, it is the role of the Secretary General to review perceived breaches of conduct by staff in the workplace.  It was right that the Secretary General was supported by senior officials in the human resources division, who are responsible for setting and monitoring standards and behaviours for staff.</p><p> This is a matter of deep regret for all involved.  I hope the report, the appearance of both me and the Secretary General before the committee today, the establishment of the facts of the matter, the acknowledgement that mistakes were made and the sincere apologies of the various people involved can help us to achieve a sense of perspective on this matter and to allow us to refocus on continuing with the work the Department is carrying out, including on the UN Security Council.  Ireland's winning of a seat on the UN Security Council on the evening of 17 June was the result of many years of dedication by so many and an endorsement of the values the people of Ireland uphold.</p><p> Ireland continues to play an important role in the Security Council.  Last week, during a visit to Ireland, it was heartening to hear the praise for Ireland's role on the Security Council by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Amina Mohammed, with particular emphasis on our leadership on advancing women's leadership, peace and security, climate action, and security and peacekeeping.  This reflects the excellent work by staff in the Department and at the UN in New York as well as those in the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  We will continue these efforts over the next ten and half months or so, our remaining time on the Security Council.</p><p> I totally understand that people would look at the photograph tweeted that night and rightly have questions about what was going on.</p><p>I can understand why people would be annoyed, angry and upset, given the sacrifices they and their families have made through this Covid period.  This incident should not have happened.  The former Secretary General has acknowledged this, and the current Secretary General has apologised again on behalf of the Department.  I look forward to members' questions and thank them for this opportunity.</p></speech>

On 13 January, I commenced a review of adherence to public health advice, workplace protocols and arrangements in place in Iveagh House on 17 June 2020.  I undertook to provide a report on the matter to the Minister by the end of January.  As Accounting Officer with responsibility for the proper administration of the Department, I appointed two senior officials from the human resources division to a review team to conduct meetings with staff, gather clear accounts of what happened that day and examine all relevant departmental records.  I delivered the report to the Minister on 31 January and he directed that it be published that day.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the concern expressed by members of this committee and the wider public about the incident that occurred in the workplace shortly after Ireland was elected to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council.  As Secretary General, I would like to say sorry to this committee and to the public, and to acknowledge the offence caused.  In doing so, I am particularly mindful of the enormous sacrifices made by our fellow citizens over the past two years.  The image of staff within the Department celebrating has caused confusion and anger among our population, who consistently abided by extensive public health rules over a prolonged period.  In the review, I acknowledge the hurt caused and reputational damage done.  I assure the committee that the Department deeply regrets the incident.</p> <p>  The review outlines the workplace arrangements, public health advice and statutory rules in place on the day of 17 June 2020; the circumstances under which staff were present in Iveagh House; the nature of the work that required on-site presence; the circumstances whereby staff gathered in the UN unit of Iveagh House following the result of the vote; and relevant timelines.  The relevant statutory regulations in place at the time were examined, as were public health and internal guidance.</p> <p>  Members will be aware of the detailed description contained in the review of events leading up to the result of the vote, including the efforts made to ensure that staff complied with public health guidance throughout the day.  Staff watched the announcement in a large open plan office space in Iveagh House.  The result came through at 9.10 p.m. and staff came together briefly to celebrate the outcome.  The incident was captured in the photograph taken by the then Secretary General.  Thereafter, the group dispersed.  Some returned to their desks to continue work, some watched a press conference from Government Buildings, some stood in small groups discussing the outcome and others prepared to leave.  The Minister has provided the committee with a detailed account of his attendance in Iveagh House on that date.  The review team received no evidence that public health guidance was breached during his presence in the UN policy unit to thank staff for their work.</p> <p>  Based on meetings with staff, and an examination of substantial amounts of documentary evidence annexed, six conclusions were reached.  First, staff working in Iveagh House on 17 June 2020, many of whom had come to the office prepared to work through that night, were conducting essential business on behalf of the Department relating to Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a seat on the UN Security Council.  Second, no event was planned to celebrate the success of Ireland&rsquo;s election.  Rather, planning was focused on the work that would have been required that evening, overnight and the next day if Ireland had not been successful in the first round of voting.  Third, extensive measures were taken to facilitate compliance with Covid guidance in advance of 17 June.  Fourth, in the hours leading up to the announcement of the vote result, public health guidance was observed.  Fifth, there was a serious breach of social distancing guidance in the period immediately following the outcome of the vote, lasting approximately one minute, when staff came together, many with glasses of alcohol in their hands, for a photograph.  Sixth, in the period following the photograph, those present dispersed into a range of activities, during which some minor breaches of guidance may have occurred.</p> <p>  I concluded that the then Secretary General was largely responsible for facilitating the social distancing breach and I requested that he make a donation to charity in the amount of &euro;2,000.  I also asked the three other management board level officers present in the photograph to make a similar donation in the amount of &euro;1,000.  They did not actively facilitate the breach of guidance but could, as senior managers, have tried to prevent its occurrence.  Each of the officials concerned agreed make the donation as requested.</p> <p>  In preparing this review, I was conscious of the need for care in making judgments on the behaviour of others with the hindsight of 19 months.  I am conscious that sometimes, in public controversies, assumptions can be made without due regard to the full facts.  I am satisfied that the review provides an accurate account of what happened on 17 June.</p> <p>  My predecessor as Secretary General has been the subject of considerable public attention over the past month.  I assure the committee that he sincerely regrets his actions.  The incident, as captured in the photograph, should not detract from the sustained service he has provided to the country and the positive contribution he made as Secretary General.  Under his direction, the Department became more open, inclusive and responsive to the needs of our citizens.  Through a wide range of assignments, notably on Northern Ireland, he made an important contribution to peace and well-being on this island.  I do not believe that the incident covered by the review devalues the achievement of our election to the Security Council.  That remains a remarkable accomplishment by a small group of dedicated public servants.</p> <p>  I can understand how the photograph from that night could suggest that the Department was tone deaf to the difficulties facing a public doing their level best to comply with official guidance.  However, I assure the committee that the image certainly does not reflect the values and commitment of those pictured or of the wider Department.  The staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs are fully committed to delivering the best possible service to this country and its people and we have a strong track record of doing so.  Our people are today serving in more dangerous and challenging locations than ever before.  Whether we serve at home or abroad, our teams will continue to advance Irish interests and values, deal with the impact of Brexit and uncertainty in Northern Ireland, provide the best possible passport and consular service and manage one of the most effective development assistance programmes in the world.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

As our time is limited, I ask members to confine their remarks, where possible, to questions.  There has been significant public and media commentary on this issue over the last couple of months.  Many issues are not in dispute.  We have a report from the Secretary General that has established the facts.  We are dealing with facts rather than speculation.

Is the Secretary General of the Department allowing gifts like this to be handed out willy-nilly without any records being kept as to whom they are given to and what perceived preferential treatment is being given?

I know we requested the meeting.  We thought it would be the end of February by the time we got to meet the witnesses and get to discuss the report.  The co-operation shown to the committee should be acknowledged.</p> <p>  Winning a seat on the UN Security Council was clearly amazing, and I would hate to see any deflection from that achievement.  The Department has done an amazing job in that respect and put some serious work into winning that seat by putting time into building relations.  We should not take away from that.  As a committee we are always very proud to say we have a seat on the UN Security Council and when we meet any group before us, we acknowledge that we have the seat.  If there is anything the committee can do to liaise with our representative, we want to do that and we use that line and link with our representative on a daily basis.</p> <p>  One aspect of the report shocked me, specifically that a person could donate &euro;2,000 and receive absolution.  Many people during the Covid-19 pandemic had loved ones pass away and they did not have people at the funerals.  Loved ones sat outside churches because they could not go inside because of restrictions.  If any of those people could have paid &euro;2,000 to have a normal funeral, they would have done so.  That sticks in the craw of many people.  I do not know how the figure came to pass and whether it was a contribution or fine.  If senior managers had refused to pay it would there have been a sanction?  That is a question for the current Secretary General.  Is there precedent in the Department to fine or sanction senior members of the Department for breaches of internal employment regulations?</p> <p>  I do not mean to sound glib but when the Minister addressed the group, was anybody drinking alcohol?  The report indicates that the people grouped together for a moment for the picture and then dispersed immediately.  When the Minister addressed them, were the people in a group?  Did he address a dispersed group?  I do not want to put words in the Minister's mouth.  Did he have a drink to celebrate?</p></speech>

There is much in the report so will he give us an overview?  How long did the group stay together for the photograph?  Has Mr. Hackett ascertained that?  I know he has said that some small numbers of people may have stayed together for short periods afterwards.  How long was the group together in order for the photograph to be taken?  Will Mr. Hackett talk us through the evidence in the report for a few minutes in order to give us an overview of what he found?</p></speech>

On 24 August, it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>that the Minister, in an interview with 96FM in Cork, said that it does not matter if one is a Commissioner, a President, a Taoiseach, a Minister or anybody else for that matter, and the same rules should apply to everybody in Ireland.</p><p>The Minister went on to say, "The idea that certain politicians see themselves as different or that the rules don't apply to them...".  I will not continue reading it but, clearly, by August, the Minister saw any breach of Covid as a most serious breach and that nobody was above the law.  Does the Minister agree with that?</p></speech>

That is the context in which I made those comments.  This report says very clearly that there was no breach of the law or regulations, or certainly no evidence to suggest that.  There was a breach of social distancing guidelines which was not acceptable, should not have happened and has been acknowledged and apologised for.</p> <p>  With regard to Senator Ardagh's question, I did not take a drink on the night.  When I came back to the Department, I called through the big open plan area one comes in the back of Department and walks through.  That is where the UN team were.  I called in.  Some people were packing up to go home.  It was quite late at that stage.  It was approximately 10.15 p.m.  Some people had gone home and others were at their desks tidying up.  Some people were on the phone and others were on computers.  It was a work space.  That is what I saw when I came in.</p> <p>  Those are the two questions I was asked.  I will leave the &euro;2,000 issue to the Secretary General.</p></speech>

Will the Minister accept we have had the United Nations Security Council every 20 years since 1960?  The mathematics suggest we would have had it anyway, if not this year, then next year.</p></speech>

We were competing for two places in a group of three countries.  The other two countries against which we were competing were Norway and Canada, two of the most popular countries in the UN.  Certainly, Ireland getting through on the first round, just, was not expected by most people.  It is true we have been on the Security Council before.  Every 20 years, as it happens, we have successfully managed to get on the Security Council but this was seen as one of the most difficult votes Ireland has every faced in a UN vote.  It is not an exaggeration to say that.</p> <p>  We had been successful against Italy, previously, which was a difficult contest.  We have been elected uncontested at different times, as well, but this was certainly seen as a significant task to be in the top 2 in that group of three.  That is why people were so up for it in the Department.  That is why they were there expecting to work through the night.  That is also why, even though it is not a justification, of course, people celebrated in the way they did.  They were both relieved and extremely happy about what had happened and, unfortunately, let their guard down in that space.</p></speech>

By the way, it was unfair to ask the Secretary General to investigate his own staff and compile a report, having just taken over the Department.  One of the staff had a child with them.  Is it normal for staff to bring a child with them for essential work?</p></speech>

Both of them were essential members of the UN policy team and essential to our ultimate success.  One of them had just gone on maternity leave and had the baby three days afterwards.  One of them had recently had a baby and was nursing.  That is why the baby was there.  Both of them were essential members of that team.  They came in of their own volition.  They were not asked to come in.</p> <p>  However, it is an important part of our maternity policy in the Department that women on maternity leave can remain connected with the workplace.  That, in turn, is an essential part of our gender equality strategy.  As we acknowledge in the report, I cannot sit here and say that their presence there that evening was for an essential purpose.  I acknowledge that but, equally, I was not prepared to make a negative finding about them.  It would have been detrimental to what we are trying to do in gender equality in the Department and a disservice to two outstanding people who were vital to our success.</p></speech>

It is also to ensure that all civil servants are aware that if there is [any] failure to adhere to the required standards of conduct, work performance and attendance, the disciplinary procedure [of] this Circular will apply. </blockquote> <p>Clearly, the breach that took place was detrimental to the Civil Service code.  It brought the Department into disrepute.  It brought several members of the Department into disrepute yet the Secretary General did not invoke the disciplinary procedure.  Why?</p></speech>

I thought quite a lot about that during the process.  I decided not to go down that route for a variety of reasons.  Had we done so, it would have been, necessarily, entirely confidential.  We would not have been able to disclose the outcome of that.  We would not have been able to respond to the public concern that had been created.  We would not have been able, on legal advice, to publish the report we published because it could have been prejudicial.  I made a judgment call that, given the level of attention this had got, there was a need to address that public concern quickly in an open way.  I felt that going down the route of the disciplinary code would not have achieved that.  That was my call and that is the reason.</p></speech>

It was not a fine.  I do not have the statutory authority to impose fines but it was a request to make a charitable donation as a reflection of the damage done and concern raised.  In coming to that figure, I was very mindful of the range of fines that were being paid, albeit for statutory offences rather than breaches of guidance.  For illustrative purposes, according to the latest figures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Justice, 57 fines were issued in 2020, the maximum of which was for &euro;500.  Some people may think that &euro;2,000 was too much and some may think it was too little but it was my judgement call that this figure was commensurate and that was the reason I went down that route.</p></speech>

That would be a matter for law enforcement authorities.  I am not aware of a precedent in this situation.  The level of scrutiny in response to this has been somewhat unprecedented so I believe it was legitimate to take measures like this in response to an unusual situation.</p> <p>  The Senator had two questions there, one of which was how long was the breach.  As we indicated in the review, from all accounts of people who were there, it lasted approximately one minute.  The Senator&rsquo;s first question was on the outline of the report and the review.  The structure of it was focused around four pillars: the workplace arrangements; public health advice and rules in place at the time; the circumstances whereby staff were present that day, and the nature of the work that was being done and was anticipated would be done; and finally, the circumstances in which the staff gathered following the result.  There were then six conclusions and I have gone into some detail on these in the review but also in the opening statement.</p></speech>

The Secretary General said that in this incident people came together for one minute.  How did he ascertain that?  Did he get this from a number of people independently or how did he come up with that figure?</p></speech>

When I say one minute, it is the breach of social distancing guidance that occurred from the time that people came together to the time that they dispersed again out of that photograph.  Some had that figure at much less than one minute and some had it at slightly more.  It seemed reasonable to us that if we think of our own daily lives, in how long it takes to take a picture, that was the nature of the breach and that is the figure we agreed on.  There was a great deal of consensus among those interviewed that this was the time limit.</p></speech>

Why were only four of the officials who were present asked to make a donation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#R02200"><p>This was for a number of reasons.  In the first instance, the former Secretary General was asked to make a donation of &euro;2,000, as outlined in the report, as he was largely responsible.  The other three individuals were at management board level and were, therefore, senior managers, and I took a decision that they had broad management responsibility for the failure that happened.  This is again directly related to the breach that occurred.  The other staff, who are largely more junior, were in a situation where the then Secretary General asked them to come together and I did not think that it would be proportionate to ask them to make a donation.</p></speech>

That included the particular sanction on them.  I also thought that one of the first questions we would be asked would be had they agreed to make the donation.  I felt it was, therefore, better to include an answer to that question in the review itself so the answer to that question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</p></speech>

Why did the review not include details of what occurred during that advance planning prior to 17 June 2020?</p></speech>

Records Nos. 8, 28, 40, 37, 39, 53 and 57 were all released as part of the freedom of information requests that were annexed to the review and contain some elements of the advanced planning and some of the efforts that were made to comply with social distance guidance.  All the meetings we had said that the director of the team and the deputy Secretary General at the time, on a series of videoconferences in the days leading up to it, discussed coming in, who would come in and when they would come in.  That is touched upon in the review but perhaps we could have gone into it in more detail.</p></speech>

Keep in mind that the Covid-19 safe working group had only been established on 2 June and, in fact, the first communication from it out to divisions was on 16 June, literally, the day before the event.  It had been established but there was not a high level of awareness of it and, crucially, the measures that were taken and that were in place from a safe working arrangement point of view would have been ones that the Covid-19 safe working group would have recommended.  We, and I certainly felt that it was more an administrative mistake than a serious error.</p></speech>

What are the rules in respect of public servants drinking while on campus or in Iveagh House?  Are there rules in advance of such activity?  I would find it very strange if I walked into my office and some of my staff were sitting there drinking wine?  What are the rules in that regard?</p></speech>

That does not include guidance or rules on the storage and consumption of alcohol on premises and the same applies to all Departments.  This is certainly an area that we could look at but it is not there.</p> <p>  I would stress that there is no culture of widespread consumption of alcohol for personal use in the Department.  That is just not my experience and there is quite a different culture in place in the Department.  When I think of the culture that is in place in the Department of Foreign Affairs, I think about the people that we have sitting in Kyiv at the moment waiting with Russians on the border, people who face death threats in Ethiopia, or the people who helped with the consular case in Shanghai.  There is all this talk about the culture in the Department-----</p></speech>

I understand the great work that is done but we would not be given the courtesy to depart from the topic.   We do not doubt for a second the great work the Department does.  I did not question whether there is a culture of drinking in the Department but Mr. Hackett did evoke the image of champagne sitting in a fridge for a retirement party.  Given that this was a review limited to 17 June, is he aware of any other occasions during the period of lockdown when that champagne was removed from the fridge for a retirement party or for any other occasion and does he think that would be an omission from the report that will, again, raise questions?</p></speech>

As is well known since it is in the public domain, there was an official event on 15 July to mark the election to the Security Council.  That was held in full compliance with the Covid guidance at the time.  That was an official event, however, so the answer to the Deputy's specific question is that I am not aware of any such occasions.</p></speech>

The deletion of the tweet certainly did not arise from an instruction from me or anybody on my team.  Having looked at the tweet afterwards because of the public interest in it, it looks to me that somebody raised the issue with Mr. Burgess on social media and pointed out that the people in the photograph were bunched tightly together and that he responded by accepting that they had let their guard down and that it should not have happened.  I think the tweet was deleted after that.  That is my understanding.  Nobody was leaning on Mr. Burgess, as far as I am aware, to delete the tweet.  I presume he realised that a mistake had been made, acknowledged it and took the photograph down.</p> <p>  It is important to try to get some perspective on this.  We are looking at this after 19 months of Covid restrictions, sacrifice and the things Senator Ardagh rightly outlined such as the struggles many families have faced.  I can understand why people would look at the photograph and ask how the incident happened and be angered by it.  All I can say, however, is what happened insofar as my involvement that night was concerned.  The incident was mentioned to me not as a major issue but as a stupid mistake.  The then Secretary General acknowledged it and the agenda moved on.  When the matter was raised again, 18 months later, in the media, legitimately, and there was concern about it, I had to respond to that, obviously.  That is why I asked the Secretary General to undertake the report.  Senator Craughwell said he did not think it was appropriate for a new Secretary General to be asked to do the report.  If, however, the Senator asks the Secretary General, I think he will say he felt he had an obligation to take it on, given the fact that this had happened in the Department, that there was reputational damage associated with it and that we needed to address that collectively, as a Department, which is what we have tried to do in this report.</p></speech>

The question has been asked, but will the Secretary General restate that all the social distancing issues arose during a few minutes surrounding the taking of a photograph?  Is that what he is suggesting?</p> <p>  Because the Minister is sometimes wrongly implicated in this case, will Mr. Hackett or the Minister explain to the committee the control structures in the Department, that is, the HR and supervision structures?  Where does the Minister's responsibility for internal staffing matters begin and end?  As for the contribution and the mistake, are there any further steps?  There is reasonable public anger about this.  There has been admission of an error.  Is there anything further the Secretary General or the Minister thinks could be done to give people confidence that this is being taken seriously?</p> <p>  I have one final question.  Beyond this mistake, I ask the Secretary General for an update on the major areas Ireland has been focusing on during our term on the Security Council.  There is less than a year left in our term.  The question of what we have been doing since is relevant in the context of a celebration.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#S00900"><p>The open-plan office is the area where most of the UN policy team was normally based.  It was also used because it is a large space.  In non-Covid times it had potentially 152 office spaces, with six further offices along its side.  It was decided, therefore, that that was where people should concentrate because of the space it provided specifically to comply with social distancing.  As the review makes clear, the serious social distancing breach to which we referred was the one minute surrounding the taking of the photograph.  The review also points out, however, that after the photograph was taken and as people dispersed, we could not rule out the possibility that there were minor breaches of the 2 m rule as people moved around, given the nature of the events involved.</p> <p>  As for major policy areas the Department is focused on in a UN context, does the Minister wish to comment?</p></speech>

Will the Minister or Mr. Hackett explain the Minister's authority in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#S01100"><p>As for the behaviour of staff, the discipline of staff internally, the way the Department is administered and organised under the Public Service Management Act is a matter for the Secretary General, not the Minister.  That is why the review focused on the behaviour of staff of the Department and why I led on the report and its terms of reference.</p></speech>

I do.  This is a political issue as well as a momentary failing in the form of a breach of guidelines.  That is why I felt it was important to have this report and to bring it to the committee.  It is also important to recognise that it certainly would have been helpful if I had raised the matter directly with the Secretary General at the time.  I did not and I allowed the agenda to move on.  That is what happened.  There was no issue.  Nobody raised the matter either inside or outside the Department in the time following that evening.  I think it would have been helpful if I had addressed the matter directly with the Secretary General at the time but I did not do so.  When the matter became one of public concern, however, we responded by trying to produce a comprehensive and truthful account of what happened.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Mr. Hackett to the meeting.  During a private meeting at which we discussed this matter, I expressed my belief that the investigation should have been carried out by an independent person.  However, I accept Mr. Hackett's report and his findings.</p> <p>  I have just one question.  Deputy Gannon asked a similar question but I wish to address mine directly to both Mr. Hackett and the Minister.  Are they aware of any other social gatherings having taken place within the Department of Foreign Affairs during lockdown?</p></speech>

These were people at work in their workplace who then breached guidelines for about a minute because they posed for a photograph celebrating a big event in the Department that evening.  It is important to make the distinction between a social gathering and a workplace incident.  The answer to the Senator's question is that I am not aware of any social gathering that took place in the Department and that was contrary to restrictions through the Covid period.</p></speech>

I thank the officials for coming before the committee.  I read the review with interest.  The essential findings are that the regulations relating to the organising of social gatherings were not breached but that social distance guidelines were breached for a minute.   Will Mr. Hackett outline what precisely was the breach of the social distancing guidelines?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Hackett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022020800002#T00300"><p>The guidance specifically was around the need to maintain 2 m social distancing.  The serious breach that we identified was the failure to do that particularly around the time that the photograph was being taken.</p></speech>

They were standing within 2 m, they were drinking alcohol, there was a photograph and the photograph was tweeted.  All of those things were wrong.</p></speech>

Let us move on.  The report puts a lot of weight on the idea that this was not an organised social gathering because if it was it would have been a breach of the regulations and a criminal matter.  Was it a spontaneous event?</p></speech>

It was people at work, doing work and in response to work they were clearly happy and pleased when the outcome occurred; the decision to convene a photograph and bunch people up together was spontaneous in my opinion, yes.</p></speech>

Mr. Hackett referred earlier to two people who were present.  To be clear, certainly from me, there is no criticism of those people whatever.  However, how did they know to be present?  I think Mr. Hackett has accepted that they were not working on that day.  How did they know to be present at the moment when the champagne corks popped and the picture was taken?</p></speech>

One had just gone on maternity leave relatively recently.  They were clearly aware of what time the result was expected to come through because it was public knowledge.  They had a lot of information and expertise that they wanted to share - I think that they are to be admired for that - therefore they made a decision to come in themselves around that time.</p></speech>

They will brief the committee on the general scheme of the mental health (amendment) Bill.  I welcome, from the IMO, Dr. Aideen Brides, IMO GP committee, Professor Matthew Sadlier, IMO consultant committee, Ms Susan Clyne, CEO, and Ms Vanessa Hetherington, assistant director, policy and international affairs.  From the IHCA, I welcome Ms Alice McGarvey, assistant secretary, Dr. Anne Doherty, consultant liaison psychiatrist from the Mater Hospital, Dr. Brendan Doody, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, Linn Dara CAMHS, Dr. Donal O'Hanlon, consultant adult psychiatrist, Naas General Hospital and Kildare-west Wicklow mental health services, and Mr. Martin Varley, secretary general.</p> <p>  Before we hear opening statements, I need to point out to witnesses that there is uncertainty about whether parliamentary privilege will apply to evidence given from a location outside the parliamentary precincts of Leinster House.  Therefore, if they are directed by me to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.  All members and witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Susan Clyne to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

The provisions of the Bill will impact on the delivery of care for patients across both acute and community settings.  That care is already compromised in a service that is inadequately staffed and has significant structural and system issues, some of which have been highlighted in recent weeks by the review of the Kerry child and adolescent mental health service, CAHMS.  Those issues are the inevitable result of years of inattention and underfunding of critical health and mental health services across the State and the introduction of unsupported structures to deliver optimum care.  In the context of the Bill and our views on the provisions of the Bill, it is also critical for this committee to understand that to enable any legislation and to provide safe care to patients, we must address the ongoing problems within the service itself.  We have known for many years of the unmet needs of patients and we also know that this will continue to grow significantly as a direct result of the pandemic, yet we are still woefully unprepared.</p> <p>  Funding for mental health now stands at just 5.5% of healthcare funding compared with 10% in the UK and Canada, 13.5% in Norway and 15% in France.  It is not that Ireland has less need than those countries.  The mismatch between the allocation of funding and the needs of specific catchment areas combined with the sectoralised multi-disciplinary teams approach has created postcode lotteries and difficulties for patients in accessing essential services.  We have a consultant recruitment and retention crisis.  It is the worst in the State's history.  The Kerry CAMHS review highlighted the key role of the consultant clinical lead in ensuring quality of care, providing clinical governance, leadership and expertise to the multi-disciplinary team.  However, as a direct result of the 2012 pay cuts to consultants, 136 out of 485 consultant psychiatry posts are unfilled or are filled on a temporary locum basis.  That is almost one third of posts in the whole country.  It is impossible to expect that we will deliver a proper service with that level of vacancies.  Additionally, the working environment for consultants and the lack of streamlined and workable structures between community and acute makes the role difficult and, in some cases, unmanageable.</p> <p>  Particular difficulties arise in our CAMHS, where more than 3,300 children are waiting for a consultant appointment.  Some 6% of these have been waiting for more than a year while many others are not deemed ill enough to even qualify to go onto the waiting list.  Even when they are referred, their referral is sent back, and there is nowhere else for them to go, because within general practice, there is not a service resourced for them.  We have an over-reliance on non-training non-consultant hospital doctors to deliver services when services should be delivered by consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors in training with the support of the multi-disciplinary team.  National Doctors Training and Planning estimates that 628 additional consultants are required over the next ten years to cope with additional demand and to replace those retiring or leaving the service.</p> <p>  There are also significant shortages of psychiatric nurses, counsellors, psychotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, with staffing levels up to 40% below recommended levels.  Sometimes we say that we have a team, but it is a notional team, because the full team is not there to deliver the service which the patient requires.  Ireland has only 33.5 inpatient psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, which is less than half the EU average of 68 inpatient psychiatric beds.  In addition, acute adult psychiatric units operate at almost 90% occupancy, well above the 85% safe occupancy levels.  There is no dedicated resource within general practice to deal with mental health issues and in many cases the only option is to refer.  This again brings back the issue of postcode lotteries or teams that are insufficiently staffed.</p> <p>  It is right that legislation should be subject to regular review, but we have to bear in mind that we have failed to adequately resource mental health care in Ireland.  We must ensure that when amending our legislation, we are not further lowering the standard of care and services provided or creating additional barriers to access.  Today, we would like to hone in on the areas that cause us the most concern in the Bill.  The committee has received a copy of our detailed submission to the Department of Health&rsquo;s review of the Act, which contains our full list of concerns.</p> <p>  Regarding the interdisciplinary approach to care and treatment, a multi-disciplinary team approach underpins the model of mental health services in Ireland as per A Vision For Change from 2006 and the new mental health strategy, Sharing the Vision, from 2020.  Sections of the draft Bill seek to legislate for an interdisciplinary approach whereby the consultant must consult with at least one other mental health professional before certifying an admission order, renewal order or before recommending or administering treatment or medicine to a detained patient who lacks capacity.  This provision does not have sufficient evidence to support its effectiveness and does not refer to existing clinical and legal governance, under which the consultant must operate.</p> <p>  The IMO recognises the value of multidisciplinary care.  This is happening across all disciplines, including psychiatry, whereby teams of healthcare professionals, non-consultant hospital doctors, nurses, counsellors, therapists and social workers work together in a team under the clinical leadership of the consultant psychiatrist in the best interest of the patient.  Each member of the team is trained in their own discipline, brings their own unique skills and strengths to the team and the care of patients with severe mental illness.  However, to suggest that the roles and skills of each team member are interchangeable, or that teams are even homogenous, represents a significant misunderstanding of the different education, training and roles of each health care professional within a team.  After receiving their medical degree, doctors must undergo between seven and ten years of specialist training in psychiatry, before they can enter the specialist register and qualify to apply for a consultant post.  Consultants in psychiatry are uniquely qualified in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with psychiatric illness.</p><p>Under the current contract, a consultant is clinically independent and retains overall responsibility for the care of the patient.  Whereas the consultant psychiatrist may, and in most cases does, confer with other members of the team with regard to aspects of patients' treatment, any legal requirement to do so poses a risk to the patient's safety, undermines the contractual responsibility of the consultant and blurs the line of accountability and clinical responsibility.</p><p> In respect of authorised officers, when a person is in crisis and requires admission for inpatient care, whether voluntary or involuntary, we must ensure the legislation supports their access and does not create further barriers to care.  Authorised officers have a very useful and valuable role to play in making an application for involuntary detention where a patient has no family or where there is a dispute among the family members.  However, we have concerns that the requirement that the authorised officer be the only person allowed to make an application to a medical practitioner for involuntary detention will bring an additional layer of bureaucracy and potentially lead to delays in treatment for patients.</p><p> In advance of any implementation of this measure, there would need to be a significant increase in the number of authorised officers in place across all healthcare settings in the State and to ensure 24-7 availability at a maximum of one hour's notice.  We can talk to the committee later about some real and practical examples of how this affects both GPs and consultant psychiatrists.</p><p> The other area where we have significant concerns is around the definition of a child.  We must address the loopholes in care for vulnerable teenagers.  There are over 12,000 presentations to accident and emergency departments annually following an episode of self-harm, with the highest rates among young people aged between 15 and 24.  However, discrepancies in the definition of a child have led to gaps in the service for some young people.  Under the Mental Health Act 2001 and for the purposes of admission to CAMHS, a child is defined as a young person under the age of 18, unless married.  On the other hand, paediatric emergency departments, including the new children's hospital, are only accessible to children under the age of 16.  As a result, emergency presentations of young people between the ages of 16 and 17 years occurs at adult general hospitals, most, if not all, of which have no child psychiatry cover.  Admission of this age category to adult psychiatric units remains a cause for concern and is a national scandal.</p><p> The IMO recommends that in order to have a Bill that safely and properly provides for patients and a service behind the Bill that enables the legislation to be enacted, serious action must be taken by the Government and the HSE to address the recruitment and retention crisis affecting consultants across our health services, including psychiatry, where, as I mentioned, a third of posts are vacant.  The 30% pay cut imposed unilaterally on consultants in 2012 - in addition to the cuts generally applied during austerity to public servants - has had the inevitable devastating effect on recruitment, especially in psychiatry.  The reversal of this cut has been promised by successive Ministers for Health, including the current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and his successors, Deputies Harris and Stephen Donnelly, yet to date there has been no attempt by the Government to resolve the matter.  There has been plenty of acknowledgement that this has caused a crisis in manpower and consultants in psychiatry services.</p><p> The current consultant contract talks are delayed as we await the appointment of a new chairperson.  These talks must recommence as a matter of urgency and address all the matters that currently make Ireland unattractive for consultants to practice in.  We must expand the number of psychiatry training places across our health services.  Half of our consultant psychiatrists are over the age of 50 and between 276 and 350 will retire from the service over the next ten years.  Whereas ten years or a decade might seem like a long time, in the context of medical manpower and training planning, it is the blink of an eye.</p><p> An urgent review is required as to how care can be provided to patients in the community while ensuring the governance issues, clinical pathways and ongoing systems are supported within the acute sector and enhanced.  There are issues and we would like to discuss with the committee questions relating to consultants in isolation in the community.</p><p> Dedicated support for mental health services must be directed towards general practice so they can work more effectively with local specialist services.  GPs do not wish to burden the acute services with over-referral but they operate in an environment where they have no resourced time to see these patients.  What these patients need most is time, and their issues are not solved with going in and out from a ten-minute consultation.  We have been appealing to the HSE for some time now to look at where we treat chronic disease, such as diabetes, in a structured way and realise that we must treat mental health in a structured way and offer those presenting the time they need.  It is not always about choosing the referral option because we can now see that referrals, particularly for young people, are coming back because the service is overly burdened and the children are not deemed ill enough.</p><p> On the proposed legislation, the IMO recommends the role of the consultant in providing clinical governance, leadership and expertise to the multidisciplinary team be valued and respected.  This is of paramount importance if we are to provide safe, quality care and attract highly qualified psychiatrists to our mental health services.  Unless we can guarantee that authorised officers will be available nationwide on a 24-7 basis, we should not introduce a requirement that they be the only category of persons allowed to make an application for an involuntary detention.</p><p> We need clear and unambiguous definition of what constitutes a child that is consistent across all healthcare services so that those aged 16 and 17 can receive care appropriate to their needs and they do not fall between two stools.  The IMO welcomes amendments to the legislation to expand the role of the Mental Health Commission but believes that does not go far enough.  In the first instance we call on the Mental Health Commission to engage an independent body to carry out an in-depth analysis of the role of community multidisciplinary teams and to assess whether the current model of community-based mental health teams is the best model for the provision of mental health services to patients.</p><p> When inspecting mental health services, the Mental Health Commission should assess the budget allocation received by that service to ensure it has the correct staffing levels and is capable of meeting the needs of patients within their catchment area, as well as identifying areas of national policy where the recommended services have not yet been delivered.</p><p> In light of the proliferation of private and voluntary organisations providing mental health services to the public, the IMO is of the view that all agencies providing mental health care in Ireland should be required to achieve accreditation to international standards.  The IMO is calling for the remit of the Mental Health Commission to be expanded to allow for the inspection of all agencies, public, voluntary and private, which provide mental health care, including those providing psychotherapy and counselling services.  Our belief is that patients need safe care everywhere.  I thank the committee for its time and we look forward to answering any questions members have.</p></speech>

The association represents around 95% of hospital consultants working in Ireland&rsquo;s acute hospitals and mental health services, including psychiatrists.</p> <p>  The pandemic has exposed the cracks in the public hospital and mental health services.  Our mental health services are at breaking point due to existing large capacity deficits, combined with significantly increased demand for treatment impacted by Covid-19.  This has rightly brought a renewed focus on the urgent need to dedicate increased funding and resources for the provision of more timely, safe and quality mental health services.  Consultant psychiatrists are committed to the provision of expert medical care to patients with moderate to severe mental illness.  We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our views on some of the proposed changes in the Bill and wish to ensure that the proposed legislation will be in patients' best interest.  We are concerned that some of the proposed changes, if included in the legislation, would give rise to unintended negative consequences for patients, their families and the overall provision of care.</p> <p>  The first concern relates to involuntary admissions.  Involuntary detention in an approved centre is a very difficult experience and can be a distressing and vulnerable time for both patients and their loved ones.  The Mental Health Act 2001 currently permits members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a family member, an authorised officer or another person to arrange admission for people presenting with an apparent risk to self or others owing to a mental disorder or a perceived need for treatment.  Head 9 proposes that family members will no longer be able to apply to have their loved one admitted to a psychiatric hospital when they believe that this is necessary for their care and treatment.</p> <p>  Waiting for an authorised officer to arrange an admission, as proposed, would present significant problems for the timely assessment and provision of care to patients.  First, the general scheme provides that authorised officers should be available on a 24-7 basis, these positions are not widely filled within the health service and recruitment is a challenge.  In the United Kingdom's National Health Service, NHS, approved mental health professionals, AMHP, the equivalent of authorised officers, undergo extensive training for the role.</p><p>The NHS is also experiencing challenges in recruiting and retaining AMHPs and there are reports of significant stress and burnout in this group.  </p><p> Second, it is unclear from the Bill where clinical responsibility lies if an authorised officer decides not to complete an application, and if the patient comes to significant harm because of having been denied admission to hospital.  Consultants have a continuing clinical and professional responsibility for the diagnosis, treatment and care of their patients and an ethical duty to protect vulnerable people who are at risk or who may suffer harm. </p><p> Third, removing the role from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in such admissions, made in consultation with a Garda GP, may have the unintended consequence of leading to prolonged detention in Garda stations for those who are in need of timely specialist psychiatric care.  Other patients who require admission may also have to wait for lengthy periods in emergency departments, EDs, for an authorised officer to attend.  Emergency departments are often chaotic environments and are not an appropriate setting for treating patients with acute mental illnesses.  This in turn may adversely affect ED services for other patients. </p><p> On admission orders and renewal orders, consultant psychiatrists are compelled to advocate on behalf of patients to ensure the provision of timely and appropriate care.  We believe that the proposal to shorten the period of review for admission and renewal orders from 21 days to 14 days, as per section 18(3), while perhaps well intentioned, may in fact cause increased distress for patients and provide inadequate time to evaluate those patients who have complex presentations.  In addition, the inevitable associated increase in costs has not been quantified. </p><p> Shortening the period would also result in a reduction in the time available to consultant psychiatrists for the direct provision of patient care, adding to the existing overstretched mental health service situation.  Over the past decade, we have been trying to manage a growing and serious consultant recruitment and retention crisis.  Of the 485 approved consultant psychiatrist posts, as of 1 February 2021, approximately one in four were vacant or were filled on a temporary or agency basis only.  It is understood this figure has since increased to closer to one in three.</p><p> On restraint and seclusion, patients have a right to be safe when they are in hospital.  Staff members, including doctors, nurses and other staff have the right to work in a safe place.  While the vast majority of violence in society is unrelated to mental illness, we must acknowledge that aggression may indicate an unmet treatment need, for example, an untreated psychotic illness.  The purpose of seclusion on psychiatric wards is to prevent serious violence to other patients and to staff members.  Seclusion should only ever be used for the minimum time possible and to prevent serious violence.  Section 69 states that the rules on seclusion and restrictive practice shall be made by the Mental Health Commission, without further input from the Oireachtas.  This is a clear democratic deficit.  The Bill also states that failure to comply with the rules or breaches of these rules are punishable with summary convictions and fines, meaning that consultant psychiatrists can receive criminal convictions for matters that may include errors on seclusion forms and paperwork.  We do not think it is appropriate that criminal convictions apply to staff who are acting to prevent violence on wards.  This will likely have a detrimental effect on recruitment into psychiatry, further exacerbating existing recruitment challenges. </p><p> Rapid titration of medication is referred to as &ldquo;chemical restraint&rdquo; in the Bill.  This is not an appropriate term, and we consider it to be misleading, stigmatising and it could be frightening to patients and their families.  Rapid titration of medication is often necessary when very unwell patients are admitted to hospital.  It is a means of ensuring that they are stabilised as quickly as possible to minimise the need for seclusion and to reduce the length of stay in hospital.  The prescription of all medication is already under the legal provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act and is subject to review, if needed, by the Medical Council of Ireland. </p><p> The IHCA respectfully asks this committee that the rules pertaining to seclusion, restraint and restrictive practice be set out clearly in the Bill, and that the power to change these rules rests with the Oireachtas alone.  We ask that the term &ldquo;chemical restraint&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;rapid titration of medication&rdquo;.  We ask for removal of the clause permitting the criminalisation of doctors.  </p><p>  On the admission of children to approved inpatient facilities, the proposed timeline of 21 days to review the admission of a child aged 16 years or older as an intermediate person in section 87 is appropriate, given that court proceedings can be stressful and that overly frequent reviews, for example when treating a patient suffering from an eating disorder, could be unnecessary and counterproductive.  It is not necessary for a child to be brought to an approved centre by garda&iacute; without the necessary safeguards, as is proposed in section 90.  Children presenting in crisis do not necessarily have a mental illness and they require appropriate assessment, including medical assessment, in an appropriate setting.  The Bill is silent on section 25 applications made under the current Mental Health Act regarding children in care and subject to court orders.  This is a critical protection that should not be removed, as the courts can ensure a child does not remain inappropriately in the approved centre.</p><p> In conclusion, our mental health services are facing huge challenges.  The decisions taken by this committee and the Oireachtas on the proposed legislation may profoundly affect some of the most vulnerable members of our society.  It is imperative that we address the concerns for patients, families and those who are responsible for their care.  I thank the committee for its invitation to its discussions on these important matters.  We are available to address its questions on these issues.</p></speech>

One of the areas on which I would like to touch relates to, as the witnesses also mentioned, the chronically underfunded and understaffed mental health services.  These are impacting the care the people receive.  It was mentioned that Ireland's percentage of the budget is almost half of the international best practice.  I have been trying to change the postcode lottery of treatment for a long time and I have highlighted this for a long time.  Treatment should be based on need and not where someone lives.</p> <p>  I want to mention CAMHS in Kerry, because it was brought up.  I travelled down to Tralee at the weekend, where I met parents and children who are directly impacted by the situation in CAMHS.  It was heart-breaking.  As a parent, I could see the devastation and the look in the parents&rsquo; eyes.  They trusted medical professionals to give the best care possible to their children and they did not receive that.  As the report said, children were misdiagnosed, they were over-medicated, and they were also offered little or no supplementary therapy.  I heard directly from the children's mouths how their lives were affected and how they have lost so many opportunities because they were basically sedated.</p> <p>  I know that there were some objections in Professor Doherty's opening statement to the term "chemical restraints".  However, in my opinion and from listening to these parents at the weekend speaking about CAMHS, this is exactly what happened to these children.  One of the most common themes that came up was that children had been instantly medicated after their first consultation.  They were not offered complementary treatments, such as psychology, occupational therapy or speech and language therapy.  There are currently 71,000 children waiting for these life-changing therapies.  Therefore, my first question to both groups, is that in their own professional opinions, do they believe that other therapies, such as talk therapies, are important?  Do they feel that these can aid or replace the medical model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#C00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for those important points.  Talk therapies are essential.  However, the Deputy's last sentence is the one that I would rile up on.  He said "replace the medical model".  I think they work in conjunction with each other.  Mental health services throughout this country and internationally have had an ongoing battle between two ideologies that are actually not in opposition with each other but are complementary.  If one looks at all the evidence towards mental health, it is a combination of medicine and therapy that works best.  Neither one should be alone.  Too many different services either go down one road or the other, largely due to ideology, without accepting that there is a middle road.  That would be like asking that if people broke their leg, should they go to a physiotherapist, or should they have their leg in a cast?  The answer is that they have to have both.  That is the way I always try to look at it.  Yes, talk therapies are important.</p> <p>  We have in our submission, as the Deputy knows, asked about how community mental health services are structured.  This is because, as they are currently done with strict sectorisations, postcode lotteries do arise.  We can talk about that in more detail if the Deputy wishes.  We have asked for an independent review of that.  Ultimately, the services are under-resourced.  This is core problem.  However, we also know that they are poorly structured.  We know that posts are vacant all over the country.  There are posts that the HSE is very happy to fund.  It is very happy to pay salaries for them.  However, it cannot recruit people into those posts.  Therefore, just throwing money at the problem to an extent is not helpful.</p><p>There is a deficit of funding so we need to increase the funding but we also need to look, in a structured way, at how we recruit and retain staff.  The fact that we increase a budget in an area often does not result in any improved service because people cannot be got to work in those services.  We need to look in-depth, with the various different professions, be it psychology, social work or medicine &ndash; and we represent doctors so that is our emphasis but I am sure the committee has met the other professional groups and I will not speak on their behalf &ndash; to see why certain posts are vacant.  We must also look at why it is more difficult to recruit in certain areas of the country than others and at what can be done to recruit people in those areas.</p></speech>

From a GP perspective, the only option we have is to give medication and we often know it is not the answer.  As Professor Sadlier correctly mentioned, it is part of the answer and they work together.  Where I am based in Monaghan, I have a 16 to 17-month wait to send a patient for primary care psychology.  In Laois and Offaly, I think it is nine months.  As the Deputy knows, if somebody has a problem that needs to be dealt with he or she is either cured or in hospital by that stage if he or she is going to access that service.  Time and again we see patients who we know do not need to be seen by psychiatry but we have no other option.  We send them for psychiatry because we are giving them medications that they do not necessarily need or that they might need in combination with psychology and other therapies but we just cannot access them.  It is important that if we are going to look at mental health as a whole we start at primary care level and put in the other resources like the multidisciplinary team, MDT, psychology and other supports.  This will filter onto secondary care and more time will be available for people who have specialist psychiatry illnesses to be seen.  We can then deal with the issues that it is possible to deal with in primary care.  It is a good point to make that it is not just one factor but is multifactorial.</p></speech>

Dr. Brides mentioned that 8,500 children are waiting for primary care psychology and over 4,000 of them are waiting for over a year.  That is the deficit in services we have.  If these services were running properly and in parallel with one another, there might not be the need for children to be on medication for as long as they are.  That is one of the issues I have heard from talking to parents of children in CAMHS.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#D00400"><p>To provide a specialist mental health service, a multidisciplinary team with a full range of skills is needed.  Such a team is led by a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with the necessary skills and training.  Children who present will require a proper and full assessment of their needs and then it is part of the care planning to identify how those needs are best met.  That may require a number of inputs from different members of the team and a number of therapies.  It is not only about having the resources but about having the skills available on teams.  That is one point.  Medication may be a part of that but it would never be the sole intervention.</p> <p>  The other point my colleagues have made is that it is important for specialist services that services for primary care at other levels are available too in order that children whose needs could be met in primary care are not being referred to specialist mental health services.  The Deputy made the point that often, an earlier and more timely intervention can have the effect of the problem not developing such that children require later referral to a specialist mental health service.  That holistic approach has to be taken, rather than just looking at the importance of resourcing and having those skills and specialist mental health teams.  We must also ensure that resources are available at primary care level to allow timely support and access.  A whole-of-system approach has to be taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.556" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#D00500"><p>I want to ask a supplementary question on that because it came up in respect of the 3,500 children who are on the CAMHS waiting list.  In response to a parliamentary question, I was recently told that 4,900 children were refused a service by CAMHS because they were deemed inappropriate after being referred to it by a medical expert.  I do not have an answer for this but what happens to these children?  At one stage a medical expert deems that they need a service in CAMHS and then they are deemed inappropriate for it.  Are they referred on somewhere else?  Is there any reason they were deemed inappropriate?  Parents have got in touch with me who have children who might have a dual diagnosis, who may be on the autism spectrum and who have mental health difficulties.  They feel their children were turned away based on these issues.  Could Dr. Doody comment on that?</p></speech>

CAMHS has a specific remit for moderate to severe mental health disorders and these children are being redirected to other services.  It will depend on how well resourced and how available other services are but it is deemed that these children do not meet the threshold for entry into a specialist mental health service.  That does not mean that child and family do not have a need that must be addressed.</p></speech>

Are they referred back into services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#D00800"><p>What should happen is that there would be a clear signposting as to what other services the child would be more appropriately directed to.</p></speech>

I entirely agree and often in primary care we send a referral to CAMHS when we know that is not the best place to send it to.  However, due to a big fragmentation of services at primary care level, we often do not know where it is best to send them.  Sometimes a child may have needs that would be best dealt with by Enable Ireland&rsquo;s child development team but because there is such a fragmentation of services it is hard to know where it is best to refer them.  They may be sent to CAMHS knowing there is no medical need and as was mentioned, CAMHS is a specialist service.  If we are to look at reforming mental health services we have to start looking at all the services provided having a centrally referred process and from there it can be assessed which would be the most appropriate service.  I imagine there are many children on that waiting list whose needs would be better met elsewhere.</p></speech>

The proposed Bill uses the words: &ldquo;in so far as practicable&rdquo; and to me that just leaves a loophole open.  We passed a motion last week calling for this loophole to be closed and to stop this practice.  Why is this needed in the legislation?  Can other safeguards be put in place if we legislate to stop this practice?  The Ombudsman for Children was here in recent weeks and it was telling that he mentioned that:</p> <blockquote> 	We have become lazy about it and we have let the idea that we do not have the resources in place rule the fact that the best interest of the child is being overrun. </blockquote> <p>Those are the words that were used.</p></speech>

You can smoke at 16, you can drive at 17, you can get married at 16, the Mental Health Commission says you are a child at 18 and there are various different other examples we could list off.  As people are trying to drop the voting age to 16 as well, where does childhood end?  The Mental Health Commission and the mental health legislation have always had a strict rule for 18 years of age, despite the fact that the national children&rsquo;s hospital and national paediatric services for medical illnesses define childhood as ending at 16-years of age.  Are these numbers being picked out of biological physiology and psychology or are they being picked out of legal ideology?  I do not know but we need to align these services.  If a 17-year-old unfortunately harms him or herself or something like that, he or she is brought to an adult hospital, not a paediatric one and he or she is within an adult health service.  It comes back to a point I am sure I will raise over and over.  Mental and physical health are intermingled in a large number of cases.  If somebody severely harms him or herself and might need plastic surgery, for example, that will be delivered in an adult hospital but his or her mental health services have to be delivered in a paediatric hospital.  The adult services that are trying their best to treat this person in the adult hospital are being condemned all the while.  There are areas where we need to align those numbers.</p> <p>  As for the loophole, I will give the Deputy an example although I will not mention names and I will obfuscate the details a little bit.  I remember many years ago a patient was referred to us who was 17 years and 355 days old.</p><p>The patient had a first episode of schizophrenia and needed admission into our unit.  Would it have been appropriate for us to transfer this person to a child inpatient unit for ten days, until the age of 18, to then come back to us to be treated?  I think there needs to be a loophole with these age cut-offs.  We had a motion at an annual general meeting years ago that sought to define the loophole.  When people are close to their 18th birthday, with their first presentation, there has to be a loophole, otherwise one will be bouncing people.</p></speech>

In certain situations, in the best interests of the child, it may be prudent and necessary for the child to be admitted to an adult unit.  In the last two years, the numbers admitted accounted for less than 7% of all admissions.  The vast majority were aged 17.  Over half were transferred to a CAMHS unit within four days and the average length of stay in the adult facility was four days.  We also have to bear in mind that the recommended provision of inpatient beds for child and adolescent services in A Vision for Change is 100 beds and 70 are currently in place.  We have 70% of the recommended level.  The population has significantly increased since 2006.  As I said, if somebody is very close to his or her 17th birthday, it may be in his or her best interest to remain in the adult unit rather than having to travel a significant distance to the four regional child and adolescent mental health units.  If admission occurs, a transfer should take place as quickly as possible.  The number of bed days that under-18s spend in adult units is very small.  One would want to minimise that number.  It is set out in the legislation that we should strive towards that.  There will be exceptional circumstances where it is in the best interests of the young person to be admitted to an adult facility in an emergency situation.</p></speech>

The rules can be made and changed at will by the Mental Health Commission.  We have some concerns about rules that could potentially create a situation where a doctor might face criminal sanction being made anywhere except the Oireachtas.  We feel that changing the rules about criminal criteria should remain with the Oireachtas.  Seclusion is not used regularly.  It is used only as a last resort if there is extreme violence and other patients need to be protected from somebody who is extremely unwell to allow that person that extra space to get better.  In that situation, any decision is made in the context of protecting people.  It is not about being restrictive or for any other reason than protecting patients and making sure that if somebody goes into an acute hospital, with severe self-harm or severe depression, for example, that person's recovery is not occluded by somebody else nearby potentially being very agitated, who might be better in a separate environment.  We are concerned that the provisions of the legislation in this area are quite vague.  Given that we have such difficulties at the moment with recruitment and retention of people to consultant and to training posts in Ireland, we are concerned that provisions like this could get in the way of us being able to adequately staff these services.</p></speech>

The UN recognises seclusion as a possible form of torture if misused.  Nobody is suggesting that is what is happening, but there is a criminal aspect to this.  For clarity, Dr. Doherty's first point is that the decision-making process is not vested in the Oireachtas but somewhere else, and she is concerned about that, but not the criminal aspect itself.</p></speech>

We are all answerable to the Medical Council for the decisions we make, as are our nursing colleagues, who are potentially also open to this provision of the legislation.  They are responsible to their governing body.  There are already clear checks and balances.  We are concerned about additional rules that are not reviewed by the Oireachtas and which could result in colleagues potentially facing criminal sanctions.  I think that will be a real issue.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a correct sense of this.  Obviously, the Medical Council is not a court.  Where there has been a breach that has had a serious impact on somebody's human rights, physical well-being or mental well-being, that can become a criminal matter.  I am not speaking specifically about this jurisdiction, but we have seen medical professionals prosecuted for various transgressions that meet a criminal bar.  I am just trying to understand where the seclusion aspect meets that criminal bar.  We are not suggesting that the decision-making there would be vested in the Medical Council.  Dr. Doherty's point is more that any issues of legality or criminal matters should be overseen by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

It is about the concept of malicious intent.  One concern that everyone working in the mental health service has is that some of the processes around involuntary admissions and the inpatient unit have become too pedantic and technical.  Patients' health, well-being, risk and safety are often secondary to pedantic things like filling out the wrong date on the form, such as writing 1 January 2021 on New Year's Day when it is actually 2022.  The risk to the patients, their families and society is completely ignored in those processes.  If there is going to be a criminal prosecution, there must be some concept of malicious intent by the doctor.  The concern is about having some phraseology or words within the legislation to ensure that people will not be prosecuted in a criminal way for what is, as Dr. Doherty said, an administrative or technical failure.  If people are to be criminally prosecuted, there should be a concept that they have done something intentionally to harm another person.  "Malicious intent" is a phrase included in other legislation that maybe provides some comfort.  Without that wording and with the Mental Health Commission devising rules and guidance that could potentially lead to a criminal prosecution, those rules and guidance would need democratic oversight by the Oireachtas rather than allowing an agency to define what is a crime or not.</p></speech>

The phrase "chemical restraint" may suggest perhaps not malicious intent but that it is not about the best care of the patient but about the care of everybody else.  Some of what we have discussed today relates to the safety of staff and other patients.  I can understand the concern from medical professionals about the language here and language has a value.  However, is it fair to say that chemical restraints could be a fair reflection of what is happening with patients who might be in particular difficult circumstances and in services that are not funded correctly and not do not have the resources to deal with them?  Is it useful to completely eradicate that from the legislation?  </p></speech>

We use medications to alleviate distress and treat illness.  Most people who come into hospital are suffering from a very acute phase of illness.  That is the criterion for admission.  Even the use of the term "chemical restraint" is quite misleading.  In any other branch of medicine, we would be using medication to relieve suffering, treat the illness and relieve distress.</p> <p>  There is a further problem with the section regarding physical restraint and chemical restraint as it is termed and the draft Bill.  Some 80% of admissions to inpatient units are voluntary.  We really encourage people to come in as voluntary patients.  It is highly preferable.  That has been very much the ethical position from psychiatrists and other multidisciplinary staff for years.  We are very comfortable with that.  However, they are coming in in a very acute phase of illness.  Unfortunately, some of them exhibit behaviours that are difficult to control, for example, self-laceration on a ward or attempting to harm themselves by banging their head on the wall.  These are very much a minority of those patients who come in as voluntary.  However, they present a real challenge in how to keep them safe and how to keep their neighbour in the next bed safe.</p> <p>  I am not sure this is workable if there is an absolute ban on using such techniques in order to ensure safety and in order to relieve distress for 80% of the patients coming into adult-approved centres.  In the centre I am most involved with, we have 29 beds and at night we have four nurses.  I do not know how we are going to make that work.  I think there will be many injuries for other patients and for staff.  I ask the committee to take that into consideration.</p></speech>

We could look for such statistics.  Physical restraint in general is a very short-lived intervention.  It takes just minutes to get a situation under control.  It is not as if someone is being physically restrained for hours and hours.  In my experience, that has been an extremely rare event.</p></speech>

Some of the phrases used in the opening statements expressed concern over the blurring of the lines of accountability and the various roles.  I am not a medical professional, but I was under the impression that multidisciplinary teams are being introduced across a number of European countries or have been in operation for quite a long time because it is a move towards a more rights-based model of care.  It is an effective way of dealing with complex needs.  I frequently hear of complex needs with mental health where, as a previous speaker said, people have both mental and physical requirements.  Can one of the witnesses outline the concern over responsibility or the lines of power within interdisciplinary teams?  Does this present a wider problem?  The opening statements reflect very serious concern about interdisciplinary teams.  I am also a member of the Joint Committee on Health and we frequently discuss the importance of those teams for Sl&aacute;intecare in the future.  Could somebody outline some of the concerns and how we move forward?</p></speech>

All doctors, consultants, GPs and everyone else are now working in multidisciplinary teams and the IMO is very supportive of the concept of the multidisciplinary team.  No concern was expressed in our opening statement on that.  We expressed concern about the provision in the legislation that the consultant must consult with another member of the team for a variety of tasks.  This is not in line with the consultant's overall clinical responsibility for the patient or their clinical independence as outlined by contract.  We feel that the lines would be blurred there.  I want to be very clear that the I am always very supportive of all our colleagues within the multidisciplinary teams each of whom has value and each of whom brings something to the care of the patient.  I will ask Professor Sadlier to expand on that.</p></speech>

Historically, the doctors and the consultant psychiatrists have been that person within the team.  There must be a straight line on responsibility and clinical responsibility.  One of our concerns is the blurring of that level of responsibility and whether other members of the team step up to take responsibility as well as decision making.  Nobody is opposed to-----</p></speech>

I would have assumed that consulting with another member of staff would provide some extra oversight which I cannot imagine is a bad thing.  I can understand that a person is either responsible or not.  Is this a contract issue because the previous speaker said it did not reflect what was in the consultant's contract, or does this relate to the actual operation of the multidisciplinary team on a day-to-day basis?</p></speech>

One is the requirement relating to an involuntary detention and the need to consult with another member of the multidisciplinary team which, in fairness, is a very small but very important part of every consultant psychiatrist's work.  However, as previously said, only a very small fraction of the patients are admitted as involuntary patients.  We would have serious concerns about having to consult with another member of the multidisciplinary team given that in the current structure only doctors are people who work on-call and who work on 24-7 basis.  Obviously, nurses work in staffing the inpatient units on a 24-7 basis, but involuntary admissions occur at all times of the day and night.  The other members of the multidisciplinary team invariably work a 39-hour week.  There are variations and obviously I will let other specialties and professions speak for their own contractual entitlements.  Historically and up to now they have not worked on a shift rota pattern; only doctors have done that.  Will we be delaying involuntary admissions that occur at 4 o'clock in the morning waiting for somebody to be there?</p><p>To have that level of staffing, we would need to double, if not triple, the numbers of staff and I am not sure enough qualified people are available internationally to fill the number of posts this requirement could create.  That relates specifically to the issue of approved centre admissions.</p><p> The other area relates to the general principle of multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary team working.  The documents even show what the difficulties are, such as the confusion between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary team working.  Nobody is against the concept of multidisciplinary working with patients.  As for how the health service structures that in a way that avoids issues such as postcode lotteries and allows complicated and specialist care to be given to complicated and specialist patients, which is a much longer discussion about how we structure mental health services, that is a different issue.</p></speech>

It is the use of the word "must".  There will be circumstances where that is not possible.  It depends on the various members of the team, their availability and their qualifications to do some of this work.  Not all the team members will be qualified to do some of this work.  Team members' skills are not interchangeable.  Everyone on the team has a role to play.  Not just in psychiatry but in all areas of medicine, consultants work well with their multidisciplinary teams.  Everybody recognises the value of all the professions within the healthcare setting.  There is no inference to be taken that, because we have an issue with the use of the word "must", those team members are not important.</p></speech>

If there is a clash between language in the legislation and a contract that is widely used among consultants, we need to be aware of that.  For the sake of clarity, our guests might indicate whether they believe that would be a clash.</p></speech>

The report showed there are difficulties with multidisciplinary team working. which are not unsolvable but nobody has ever really examined trying to solve them in this country.  They include deprofessionalisation and what happens if there is an attempt to work as an interdisciplinary team.  People all have different skills and abilities, which is why it is an interdisciplinary team.  If there is an attempt to get everyone to do the same tasks, does it lose people's individual skills and abilities?  How do we maintain our individual professional competence while amalgamating the team?  It is a complicated process.</p> <p>  Sometimes we conflate service delivery and legislation.  The legislation contains the word "must" and we think that will create a conflict in respect of issues where the consultant psychiatrist heretofore has been the person who held clinical responsibility for the treatment of the patient.  Our belief is that having one named person who holds clinical responsibility is of benefit to both the patient and the service.  As members can appreciate, words such as "consult" are difficult to define in legislation.  What does it mean to "consult"?  What happens if there is a disagreement and how is it to be resolved?  We do not find such ambiguity in legislation to be beneficial in the long run.</p></speech>

Is the suggestion that the commission would undertake not financial auditing but financial overviews of services?  Some services receive funding from various streams.  Could one of our guests unpack that a little and explain what it would look like?</p></speech>

The legislation must ensure a service will be provided equitably to all citizens regardless of what areas of the country they live in.  It will be up to the Mental Health Commission to ensure two outcomes.  The staffing levels must be appropriate and the funding allocated to that service must be sufficient to meet the requirements of that catchment area.  In the recent agreement the IMO reached with the Department of Health, for example, there is specific funding for areas of deprivation.  It is recognised, therefore, that within a catchment area, there are some areas where additional funding will be required to deal with them.  The lines get very blurred in respect of funding.  We talk about millions of euro being spent on health but, when we bring it down to individual catchment areas or to the fact that there are mental health teams throughout the HSE, they are not fully staffed teams.  I keep on having to come back to this.  In many cases, they are notional.  They allow us to tick a box and say something has been done but they do not deliver an holistic, comprehensive service to the patient.</p></speech>

A review of mental healthcare in Ireland is very much warranted.  My first question relates to what happened in south Kerry CAMHS.  Like other statements, that of the IMO has shone a light on the inadequacies in respect of mental healthcare in Ireland, but it paints a picture that is not only very honest but also quite bleak in regard to the current state of our mental healthcare.  In light of the consequences of inadequate staffing and so forth, is there a systemic failure in respect of CAMHS throughout the State?  I fear that this overprescription of medicine for children is not an isolated scenario.  If that is the case, there is a serious issue of trust in the context of CAMHS throughout the State.  What happened is very serious and people want answers.  It is in everyone's interest to find out what happened.  Is it symptomatic of the wider service?  The IMO's statement refers to the consequences of a lack of resources and to other structural issues that are ongoing.  Is what happened in south Kerry one of those consequences?</p></speech>

I do not think anybody in the profession is surprised at what has happened in CAMHS, and nor should anybody in the HSE or the Department of Health have been surprised.  It is absolutely a system failure, and the rush to conducting an audit to find somebody to blame or to hold someone accountable will not address that system failure.</p><p>There is no easy solution to this and it may well be replicated across not just mental health services, but other services as well.</p><p> There has been a decade of austerity in the health service.  There has been much longer than a decade of inattention to mental health services.  Therefore, mental health services got it on the double,</p><p> We are incapable, as a public health service, of attracting people to work in it.  That is not just consultants.  It is across the board and across all services.  We ask people to come into working environments that are extraordinarily stressful.  I do not think there is a professional body now that represents anybody in the health service that is not saying that all healthcare staff are suffering from stress and burnout.  The answer will be to do a bit of baking or yoga at the weekend.  </p><p> We are putting people under enormous pressure.  We are not funding services appropriately.  We are letting services be delivered when we know that they are inadequate and have a lack of supervision.  There is an issue with the lack of a consultant being there in the delivery of health services and in psychiatry and CAMHS.  Consultant colleagues form Wexford have spoken very eloquently about the difficulties of CAMHS services and the interaction and community within the acute services.  I am very sorry to say that we are not shocked.  It is 100% a systems failure.</p></speech>

Child and adolescent mental health services are specialist services.  Delivery of the service requires a full multidisciplinary team with the necessary skills mixed across a range of disciplines.  A consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist will have done up to ten years of post-graduate training, including at least three to four years of higher specialist training.  Clearly, if that consultant is not on the team, one cannot expect the service to be delivered to the standard as the public expects of a specialist mental health service.</p> <p>  Across the country, there are particular circumstances that we need to take into account, such as in Kerry.  We need to look at the fact that although there has been investment in CAMHS over the years, we started from a very low base.  In a sense, we had that coupled with a growing population and increasing rates of referral of young people to CAMHS.  In addition, as we know, post-Covid there has been a significant increase in referrals to community services, inpatient services and a large increase in, for example, young people presenting with eating disorders.</p> <p>  On one hand, we should not be surprised that this is a phenomenon across the world.  Across the world there has been a recognition of a need to expand services.  The question is not just resourcing, but it is how we ensure that posts and the structures are there to make recruitment to these posts attractive.  We are not competing only with Ireland, we are competing internationally.  The standard of training in Ireland for child and adolescent psychiatrists is on par with the best anywhere in the world.  Unfortunately, the world is currently experiencing a worldwide shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists trained in Ireland will have no difficulty getting positions anywhere across the world.  This is a reality.  </p> <p>  If we are to deliver the services, we need to look at the recommendations in the report.  It is about resourcing and also having the necessary structures in place to support teams so that we can deliver services across the country to the standards we want them to be delivered to.  We need to be able to attract not only doctors, but also attract and retain other skilled disciplines within the service as well.</p></speech>

These difficulties have obviously beset a specific CAMHS in Kerry.  However, we know that there are resource issues across the country and across pretty much every mental health service that exists.</p> <p>  In 2005, which is now 17 years ago, A Vision for Change was published.  That set out the numbers of staff and multidisciplinary team members that were needed in every team, from CAMHS to adult psychiatry to all of the specialist areas.  In many areas, some teams are running at 20% or 30% of the staffing.  Even the more general community adult teams will often be without key multidisciplinary team members for prolonged periods of time.  We have colleagues all the time talk about how they have no social worker for six months or the psychologist on their team has become unwell and they have not been replaced.  </p> <p>  This problem does not only affect CAMHS.  In some ways, until mental health services are properly resourced and the required team members are put in place, we will probably see further problems.  It is inevitable that if services operate under such a strain, they will crack at some point.  It is inevitable in many respects.  Unfortunately, a service that is under such strain all of the time is not an attractive place for people to work.  If people are getting job offers from New Zealand where there is a very nice quality of life and pleasant working conditions, it is very difficult to dissuade them from going there. </p></speech>

How do we address very serious issues in the here and now?  Obviously, there are huge problems, such as the retention and recruitment of staff.  I understand that.  That has been a legacy issue for more than a decade.</p> <p>  Under these circumstances, children who need intervention are being failed.  That is the most serious of the consequences of this.  How do we amend the structural issues, particularly around CAMHS, for the here and now?  Obviously, the review will take place.  As I said from the outset, I do not think this is an isolated situation.  How do we address the immediate issue of trust in relation to children and adolescents who are seeking CAMHS?</p></speech>

The first thing is that we cannot just have an audit alone.  We have to have a full review that looks at all of the issues and not only focuses on the action of a particular staff member who was left unsupported.</p> <p>  It really does come down to recruitment.  If there are not the professionals on the ground to deliver the care, the care will not be delivered.  You can have all the shiny buildings you like, or you can have terrible buildings, and there is a big mixture of both - not everyone is operating out of purpose-built centres - but we cannot solve the problem without recruitment policies in place.  </p> <p>  I do no not accept that the recruitment policy is a legacy issue.  The recruitment policy is a live issue and it has been a live issue since the day it was brought in by a former Minister for Health.  It has had devastating effects.  Until that is dealt with and we accept that we cannot run a service without the correct number of people delivering that care, it is the patients who will suffer.  There is no quick fix that we can do today.  </p> <p>  I would make the point that every single person working in that service goes in to do their best for the children who are accessing care in that service.  Everybody is committed.  However, there is not the level of shock within the service that there might be within other areas looking in on this, because they are working with this day to day.</p> <p>  No more than my colleagues at the IHCA, we are exhausted from talking about this for ten years and saying it must happen.  This will keep happening if we keep taking the same attitude toward recruitment and our public services will continue to absolutely fail to be able to encourage doctors to stay in Ireland or come back to Ireland.  Our trainees will not stay here.  They see what it is like for their consultant colleagues.</p><p>They know they will come in on inequitable and unfair contracts.  Abroad, they have systems that will support them in order that they can support and deliver best care to the patient.  I am afraid there is no quick fix, but it is certainly not a legacy issue.  It is very much a live issue, and the Government absolutely has it within its power to address it.  It has committed to it.  The last three Ministers for Health have committed to it and have failed to do it.</p></speech>

There is a plethora of those organisations.  The IMO says in the statement that there should be a requirement to achieve accreditation to international standards.  Is there a situation at present where these voluntary bodies or private bodies do not achieve the proper accreditation in respect of standards of care?  Are there instances of this happening in the State at present?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.604" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#J00300"><p>I have a very simple answer.  I am not sure, and the issue is that we are not sure.  The fear is that the Mental Health Commission will become a body that only regulates the State services.  We know that mental healthcare is provided by non-governmental organisations, some of which accept State funding and some that do not.  It is provided by fully private, insurance-based hospitals and a variety of different services.  What we are seeking there is to ensure that the Mental Health Commission, when it expands its remit from inpatient units to community services, does not just look at the State-provided community services and that it looks at the other sectors.  It is up to the Mental Health Commission to determine how it does that, what standards it sets and how that is operated.</p> <p>  We know that the difficulty with talking-type therapies is the regulation of them.  There is no central register of therapists.  I have a qualification, but anybody can put a plaque on the wall in the morning and say he or she is a something-or-other therapist.  There could be somebody with very little qualification who has been engaged in exploitation of clients of various different types who, unless the person is criminally prosecuted, can just walk down the road and put a plaque up on a different wall and set up again.</p> <p>  It is that security, so my answer is, "I do not know".  The problem is that we do not know.  The issue is that the Mental Health Commission not only gets involved in State services but that it also has some type of remit towards the non-State orientated talking therapies, the therapists and qualifications that are out there and that it sets standards of some description.  That probably would require a session by itself, to be honest.  However, it is that setting of standards.</p></speech>

I am sure they can provide a very good service, but where there is no regulation then one has the opposite.  That would be a concern.  Professor Sadlier has answered the question but with the lack of monitoring of voluntary and private bodies, how concerned would he be, in his professional opinion, that there is a sense that there is no regulation or there is no sense of oversight with regard to those who are in an important and responsible position in the context of advice and intervention?  There could be a situation where there is no oversight, and where there is no oversight that could lead to serious difficulties as in what happened in south Kerry.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, in primary care we have essentially no access to talking therapies.  Often when I have a patient in front of me who is <i>in extremis</i>I resort to Google just like anybody else.  Unless I have had a personal recommendation or know from previous patients how somebody performs, I have nothing else to go by.  People are paying money to these people, money they often do not have.  However, as they are so desperate to access services, this is what they will do.  Anecdotally, one often finds that people who may have accessed counselling services themselves previously then want to go on to counsel.  All of us - doctors, social workers or occupational therapists - are part of a regulatory body and we have to meet certain standards.  If people are having a very big impact on another person's life, and that is what happens in these talking therapy sessions, they have to conform to some type of regulatory body.</p></speech>

Second, I love their honesty.  I can sense from some of them that they are angry and feel disappointed and let down.  I understand that people who work within the services are fully committed.  I suppose it is like trying to bake a cake in that if one does not have all the ingredients initially, one will not get the cake one wants.</p> <p>  I will refer to a few matters.  The witnesses spoke about funding, the demographics, the postcode lottery for services and so forth.  They also referred to the CAMHS teams.  Is it an 11-a-side team or a 15-a-side team?  We never get that because it is always work time equivalents.  When they spoke about audits and the like, I suspect the issue that is arising out of a full audit of the 70-odd so-called CAMHS teams we have is how many of them can be put into the premier league to play against each other.  I suspect there are perhaps three that are fully staffed.  We are met with the Department saying that we have X amount of CAMHS teams but that it has an issue with staffing and so forth.  It is total misinformation.</p> <p>  I have worked in committees previously.  In the previous D&aacute;il, I was lucky enough to be a member of the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care and I was also privileged to work on the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  There is one bugbear I have, and this is a question for all the witnesses.  If we are so under-resourced, I think it is an Irish thing where Paddy will not buy into it unless he sees it.  If we want a new community centre, he wants to see what the building looks like first before he will support it.  What I am trying to say, and I have appealed to two or three Ministers about this over the years, is that we should start rolling out pilot projects.  We have access to a lot of data.  We know where in mental health there could be a spike in suicides.  It is very simple.  In my town between 2000 and 2002 there were 59 suicides in one area.  That should have put up a red flag straight away that we need to put resources into that area to nip it in the bud.  Our guests spoke about primary care.  I am a firm believer in it, but we have a situation where we are now at a crisis level and people who could have got early intervention have now escalated to what we will call the "fullstop.com".  There is no going back, but they cannot move forward.  We have a massive crisis there.</p> <p>  It goes back to funding.  How many are in the teaching profession at present, how many psychologists or psychiatrists are being taught, is there a limit on numbers?  Do we have to look at all of that?  There are certainly incentives.  I have seen this in England.  Even for basic nursing, one particular city has on-site campus accommodation for the nurses so they can afford to work and live in the area.  We cannot get a trainee to come to Dublin and expect him or her to pay extortionate rents while basically living on nothing and working in an over-stressed and over-stretched job when somebody can go to Australia or Dubai and have all the incentives, as well as the opportunity to progress.  I will look at the brass tacks, because the witnesses have covered so much in this regard.  Through parliamentary questions, I have seen evidence of posts being advertised for more than 13 years that will never be filled.</p><p>How is it they can fill agency posts but we cannot fill permanent posts?  I would love an answer because that is a bugbear.  What about the value of funding a fully staffed, fully resourced pilot project and show it to people, the Government - it does not matter what Government will be there - and the HSE how and where it works?  Then we could start replicating it and use a common-sense approach.  If you are in County Cork and County Donegal, it is probably cheaper than in Dublin city.  You would have to find an equalisation or incentive from there.</p><p> The three main questions are around how we can get people to fill agency posts when they are needed.  I do not want to bring it up now but I would like to revisit what Dr. Hanlon said during the first round of questions.  I suspect there is some danger in the lack of support in the hospital and ward setting.  I heard Dr. Brides speaking on the GP side of things.  Either the GP or the Garda is the first port of call.  I heard her say GPs do not have an option to send them anywhere because the service is not there.  She is right.  It has been happening for years and years.  I am tired of hearing about retention and recruitment.  The reason they cannot be recruited or retained is because they will not pay them.  Second, who wants to work in a toxic system?  Third, the only thing that you get is blame, and that is totally wrong.  It is very frustrating.  There are any number of parents who are roaring at us that they cannot get their children into X, Y or Z, and it is correct to say that in the private sector, if a parent has cash, it does not seem to be an issue.  How do we find a balance?</p><p> What do the witnesses think of the pilot project?  Could it work?  Why are we getting agency staff but not permanent staff?  Is a tsunami of mental health issues coming down the road not only for patients but also for staff in the system?  It has been said we are talking about this for ten years.  If we are not going to invest now, do we just close the book and let it crash or what do we do?  There is a lot in that.</p></speech>

I would suggest looking at something like the Australian model for funding mental health.  First, it has about twice the budget dedicated to mental health than Ireland.  Second, it has great resources and funding at primary care level.  GPs are funded to spend 20 or 30 minutes with a patient and they know they can resource their practices with extra nursing etc. to take that time out with the patient.  GPs can allocate up to ten sessions of psychotherapy, psychology or talking services per year for an individual patient.  I spoke to a colleague this week who has worked as a GP in Australia.  She said that she loved working as a GP from a mental health perspective when she was there.  She prescribed medication in about 30% to 40% of patients because she knew she had other options to give them, whereas since returning to Ireland she said that she is prescribing in almost 100% of cases because she has no other option.  The number of patients she is now referring to secondary care services has quadrupled because, again, there is no other option.</p> <p>  Taken as a whole, there are many pilot studies around the world.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel here.  That would feed into the secondary care services because it would take the pressure off the consultants.  They would not have to look at endless waiting lists.  They know that perhaps three quarters of that is not in their remit.  It would allow us to keep secondary care for specialist psychiatry services that are badly needed.</p></speech>

Seven out of ten doctors across the board are at high risk of burnout or are suffering from it.  They carry that with them into their daily lives.  There are many reasons for that.</p> <p>  I can see where the Deputy is coming from on the pilot projects.  We have a lot of evidence on what works.  We have some concerns about the systems in place now.  That is why our submission calls for a review to see if it is actually the best way to have consultants operating in isolation in some areas with insufficient teams in place.  That is not to say that the patient would not continue to receive care in the community, but that does not mean the whole team needs to be based full time in the community.  Consultants rely very much on talking to colleagues.  Not all of discussion on patients and moving treatment on is formal.  I would be against a pilot project because we already know what is needed.</p> <p>  No more than the IHCA, I am sure all the members are tired of organisations such as ourselves saying the funding is not there.  I hear people say all the time that resourcing is not the issue, but resourcing is the issue if the resources you are applying are not sufficient to attract people in to work in the service.</p></speech>

As some colleagues have already said, there is a lot of international evidence about what works.  We could take some of that and apply it to the Irish context, perhaps as a pilot but also perhaps, if it works really well, we could just implement it.  Even if we could just implement the requirements set out in A Vision for Change, which is now 16 or 17 years old, we would at least be moving in the right direction.  However, as everyone keeps saying, we need to be seriously investing in mental health services at secondary and primary care level.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about a tsunami of mental health problems.  I work in an emergency department.  Obviously, if people are coming in through an emergency department, they have reached a serious point of crisis.  That is not how people should have to access mental healthcare.  It should be possible to access secondary mental healthcare in a much more structured way.  We are seeing an increase of about 150% or 160% of pre-Covid levels now.  The numbers coming through are enormous.  They are people who are very unwell who need very expert care.  In some ways they are the tip of the iceberg because they are the people we are seeing in that setting.  There certainly does appear to be an increase in people who need our services at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.615" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#K00600"><p>The Deputy made some very valid points.  On the matter of agency staff, it can be a question of different pay rates.  I would love to be able not to say that.  It is not necessarily true that we can always fill posts with agency staff either.  They can often be short term or temporary.  I know of a post in an area where there was something like 14 different consultants in a two-year period.  The fact a post is listed as being covered by agency staff does not necessarily mean they are they same agency staff there last week or in two weeks' time.</p> <p>  My only gripes, as it were, are around two things.  First is about when we get reports like A Vision for Change, Sharing the Vision, Sl&aacute;intecare, but looking at those on mental health in particular.  They need to be accompanied by an operational report.  We get reports that are ideologically driven.  They outline how a utopian mental health service would work.  For instance, they might say we will have mental health team and a primary care centre all over the country without anybody having established whether people will work in a mental health centre or a primary care centre across the country.  How much will this cost?  Have we engaged on the operational side of how to deliver this?  Sometimes we set out health policies with a utopian ideology of where we want to get to without necessarily understanding if that will happen in the real world.  Consultant psychiatrists work as per the Sl&aacute;intecare concept of a consultant.  It is about 20 years since a consultant psychiatrist was appointed when he or she has had access to private practice.  I am not sure of the date but every consultant in psychiatry since then, and it is well over 90-odd per cent, do not have access to private practice.</p><p>They work in a community base yet this is a speciality where, give or take, one third of posts are vacant.  The process in psychiatry is supposed to be this ideological one that we are supposed to be getting to but it is the one where we have the biggest problem.</p><p> My final point is one I get tired of trying to bang home.  I am not against the delivery of care in the community or against basing care in the community, but delivering and basing care in the community is more expensive and less inefficient and requires a redundancy.  Where a mental health team is comprised of one consultant, one junior doctor, one psychologist, one social worker and one occupational therapist and it is based in a primary care centre in a rural area and the consultant wakes up some morning with a sore throat - in the current world environment we are told not to attend work if we have a sore throat - the outpatient clinic for that morning is cancelled.  If one member of the team gets sick or has to take leave, that area does not get another staff member.  We are dispersing our teams into small teams rather than having a more departmental or larger hub model of the type operated in Australia, where there are four or five consultants or a larger team assigned to one area, such that you have that redundancy.  They are the questions that were not built into this.  There is no mental health services report issued to set out how the structure would work.  I have never seen in an appendix how we cover annual leave.  Every staff member gets four, five or six weeks' annual leave, depending on their contract.  How do we cover that?  They are the type of operational issues that are not being considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.617" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Donal O'Hanlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#L00200"><p>With pilot projects one has to start somewhere.  If one adequately funds a pilot project and can show it can be done that would be great.  What can happen is that over time the degree of commitment to funding the pilot programme can be eroded.  For example, in multidisciplinary teams colleagues who are on leave are not replaced and immediately a whole arm of the team no longer functions properly.</p> <p>  Over the ten years this has gone on, it has been a progressive demoralisation of the whole service.  I say that genuinely.  It has been a repeated wearing down of staff morale.  According to a recent survey, this year, 44% more trainees are applying to go to Australia than applied in 2018.  Over the years, I have recruited many consultants who stayed for a year or two and then went to Canada, including one about two weeks ago.  These are people we have trained here.  They may have spent about ten years in our system but are originally from another country.  They would have integrated well and provided really good service.  The reason they are going is they cannot see any political will to change things and they believe they will be treated in a more inferior way than their longer established colleagues.  I do not think we are addressing that.  That has knock-on effects.  </p> <p>  Many speakers here today have spoken about multidisciplinary team working.  As mentioned by Professor Sadlier, we have been doing that since the community psychiatry initiative started in the late 1980s.  We have always had a multidisciplinary team.  We recognise the role of medication.  We also recognise the need for talk therapies, social assistance and the human contact of a very skilled psychiatric nurse.  That is the way we have worked for years but we have not had the teams to deliver that.  It has been kept going on a shoestring.  One cannot convince people in the system that things will start to change unless there is a real political will to do so.  I hope that answers some of the questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.618" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#L00300"><p>I agree with what my colleagues have said.  I have spoken to higher skilled trainees finishing their training about the posts they would be attracted to.  It is not just about money.  It is about the supports and the structures around them.  They want to be in supportive structure.  The report on CAMHS raises the question as to whether there is need for a complete separate support structure for child and adult mental health services.  Where there is a child and adolescent psychiatrist reporting to another child and adolescent psychiatrist, they would find that more supportive.  The risk is about professional isolation.  It is not surprising that it is not just in mental health services that consultant posts which are seen as peripheral are the ones that are least attractive.  People said there are posts around which there is no certainty about who will cover for them when they are not there.  It is about that level of isolation and the need for that support, which sustains them for a career of 30 to 40 years.  They are thinking about how they are going to sustain this not just now, this year and next year but for all of their careers.  We need to look at the structures but it is not just about money; it is about the structures and how we support the services.</p> <p>  It is not possible to grow services overnight.  That requires sustained investment over years.  It is about identifying need across a range of disciplines and training people through college for them.  That is going to take time.  That is the need for that multiannual investment.  As mentioned earlier, we have a vision.  It is about how we operationalise that vision, how we make it happen and how we address the need for the huge amount of investment required for training.  When we lose a consultant, we lose the huge investment made by the State in training that person.  In a sense, it is about how we create the conditions to hold on to that investment when we know that they are skills that are highly mobile and highly valued.  These are the real issues.  It is about we operate, about structures and all of those things.  Within the structures we need to look at how we develop and innovate.  Building innovation on a shaky or not so good foundation is not sustainable.  We sometimes have service innovations that prove not to be sustainable.  We need a sound foundation to sustain and support innovation.</p></speech>

My wife does not like it when I say that prevention is better than cure but it is a fact.  It is about the destigmatising of mental health issues.  There are many areas where it is difficult to do that.  For example, a member of the Defence Forces would not admit to suffering with mental health issues because it would mean he or she could would not be allowed to travel overseas or to use live rounds.  That is a different issue.</p> <p>  As mentioned by Professor Doherty, this already works in one country.  We should have the capability to look at how it works, how it is written in legislation and how contracts are addressed.  As mentioned by other speakers, it is about the work plan.  When a report is issued, it should be accompanied by an operational report on how X operates in X country with X population, which we should then try to mirror to our population.  We need to identify the cost of X, Y and Z and then bring it to Government as the best way forward.</p> <p>  I did not choose this path but it is where I am today.  I have always been very passionate about it, but it can be very disheartening to be here so many years on listening to the witnesses still saying that if we do not do X, Y and Z, which we have not been doing for the past ten years, we will be back here again in another ten years and things are probably going to be worse.  </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their honesty.

It is important to recognise that there is a difference between the specialist service and what could be provided in the community.  The CAMHS issue is focused on the specialist service.  We are trying to make the point that there is a lot of work that can be done in the community.  There are many other pathways.  There is a lot of work our GPs and their in-house teams or the services coming in can do them for them.</p><p>I think we have failed across the board.</p><p> Some of the stigma around mental health has been lifted, but there is no point encouraging people to talk about their mental health if there is no one to talk to.</p></speech>

It is a structured care programme that offers two visits a year to patients who have these illnesses.  They come to the GP, have their bloods done and are seen by the GP after that.  It has been resourced and is working unbelievably well.  The hope is it will move many of those diseases out of crowded outpatient facilities into general practice.</p> <p>  If there were a similar system for mental health, it would work really well, but without funding it cannot happen.  The Deputy mentioned figures.  I did the maths last night, and Australia&rsquo;s budget for mental health is exactly double that of Ireland.  There are many solutions but funding is needed.  As GPs, we say that if someone has a physical problem, he or she will take treatment, and the same should be true of mental health.  The Government, however, pays much lip service to mental health provisions, but very little action is ever taken.  If that is happening at Government level, we will find it very difficult to get patients to accept the same changes.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate the time they are giving to the committee to discuss this really important legislation.   As they said, it is for the most vulnerable people in our community and is about putting patient health first.</p> <p>  I come from Ballinasloe, which was once home to St. Brigid's psychiatric institution, a wonderful place that managed acute episodes of need.  Some of our guests' submissions mentioned the lack of acute beds and I take that on board.  This year, there has been an increase of more than &euro;47 million for mental health, under the remit of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Butler.  I am curious whether the increase of 5% is to be taken against the increase that has been invested in the health service due to Covid-19.  I do not know whether that is a percentage of what would normally be invested in the health service or whether it is because of what has been invested following the emergence of Covid-19.</p> <p>  Our guests made very relevant points about parts of the legislation.  I do not know if it was the IMO or the IHCA that pointed out that it will remove the right of family members to apply to have a relative admitted.  Our guests indicated there is a lack of authorised personnel to allow families to bring their loved ones forward when they are going through an acute episode.  I understand very much the significant recruitment processes within the HSE.  I worked previously in health innovation within National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, but linked with University Hospital Galway, UHG.  A considerable bone of contention related to recruitment.  We had a part-time person working with us from the HSE and I got to know very well the term "backfill", which I had never heard previously.  That was pre-Covid, so I can only imagine the challenges that exist now.  When someone is moved internally from post to post without that position being filled or that person being allowed to come into role, it is a big issue.  Are there ways we could examine the recruitment processes to speed up bringing people into role?</p></speech>

The issue whereby the authorised officer has to approve every involuntary detention is a false solution to the problem. The idea that it destigmatises the relationship between the family member and the person who is involuntarily detained is not necessarily true because, obviously, it will be the family member who will have called the authorised officer, who will have to sign the forms.  I am not sure, therefore, that it will necessarily solve the animosity problem.  It is a bit like saying that, if there were a car crash, the family could not call an ambulance but rather would have to call somebody else who would then arrive on the scene and determine whether an ambulance should be called.  Most of these involuntary detentions, when a family signs for one, occur in a moment of crisis.  They happen when there is not necessarily time for a calm period of reflection or to wait for somebody to arrive.  I am sure Dr. Brides, as a general practitioner, will have much more experience of managing these cases in the community, so I will pass to her.</p></speech>

It is an extremely fraught scenario when somebody requires an involuntary admission.  It usually starts with a phone call from a family member.  Thankfully, as a GP, we will often know the patient and the family and we might even know the scenario is coming.  To think we would have to delay the process to allow another person to become involved is beyond comprehension.</p> <p>  I might give two examples.  I have a patient, a lady in her 50s, who manages to hold down a job for two years at a time while attending psychiatry services.  She might then stop attending and taking her medication, and it is often somebody she works with or a family member who will call us and say she is starting to slip.  She will isolate herself in her house and become extremely paranoid.  Thanks to the family member contacting us in a timely manner, we can get her to hospital for a period.  She is usually in hospital for only a few days but it is enough to get her well.  This involves a degree of communication and negotiation, as was mentioned.  The encounter can sometimes be turned into an opportunity to encourage the patient to be admitted on a voluntary basis.  If, however, we have to sit there in a stressful environment and wait for somebody else to arrive, that just will not happen.</p> <p>  In another case, I was working in psychiatry as a senior house officer as part of my GP training.  There was a case where somebody in their early 20s was on the other side of a bedroom door, in possession of several knives.  We did our best to encourage them and coax them out of the room, hoping they would not harm themselves, but we could not know what was going on behind the door.  As soon as we got the chance to encourage the person to come out so we could get them to a place of safety, we took the opportunity.  I have heard of GP colleagues travelling in cars to hospital with patients who need involuntary admission.  I heard of one such example where the person travelled with a shotgun on their knees.  We do what we need to in these circumstances to get the patient to a place where he or she will be safe.  If it involves more legislation and designated officers who may not be available for 24 or 48 hours, that will not be in the patient's best interest.</p></speech>

Staffing one of those positions 24-7 will probably take about five whole-time equivalents.  Those five whole-time equivalents will come from the existing pool of mental health professionals, and we have real difficulty recruiting at the moment.  Moreover, given the nature of the work, it will take two or three hours to conduct an assessment, so they may get through two or three assessments per shift, and then travel time must be included.  In some urban areas, perhaps it is possible to get to a Garda station or a person's house within a half an hour, but that is not going to be true in Cork, Kerry or even Kildare, where I work, given it takes two hours to get from one end of the county to the other.  My main fear relates not to the principle of authorised officers but to the practicality.  I think it will suck all the trained staff out of the system, and they will be doing this rather than providing care, if they can be recruited.</p></speech>

If I may make one other brief comment, the criteria for involuntary admission are also changing under this Bill.  One of the criteria will now be "where such treatment is immediately necessary to protect the life of the person, or to protect the health of the person from the threat of serious harm, or for the protection of other persons".  I can see the rationale for that but it means that many people who are severely ill and whose condition is deteriorating will not be covered by the Bill.  We will have to wait until their position is dangerous.  I am concerned about that because, with schizophrenia, the longer you go untreated, the more functional damage and disability you will have.  That is a big choice for society.</p></speech>

I will come back to the issue of recruitment but my second point is on the legislation.  I was listening to the meeting virtually as I was coming in and there was discussion on the age.  I was very interested in that.  I apologise because, although I was listening, I did not get to see who was making the comments.  Someone spoke about how a child is defined as someone aged under 16 in paediatric hospitals but as someone aged under 18 in this type of legislation, child and adolescent mental health, CAMHS, units and other mental health facilities.  What would be required to align those age profiles?  What is the logic behind the age being 18 for CAMHS and, I am guessing, for legal services?  I direct that question to Professor Doody.  He may have commented on it previously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.638" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#N00700"><p>In the 2001 Act, children are defined as those aged under 18.  Looking at the legislation, this also pertains to inpatient units.  The child unit is for those up to the age of 18 and children are defined as those aged under 18.  That is not the practice in medical treatment, where it is now moving towards 16.  At one stage, the cut-off age for paediatrics was 14.  The Mental Treatment Act 1945, if we go back that far, set the age for adulthood at 16.  Until the current Mental Health Act, you were an adult from the age of 16.  That changed with the enactment of the 2001 Act, under which those aged under 18 were defined as children.  The 2001 Act vested that those aged under 18 did not have capacity to consent whatsoever.  That was not in line with provisions on consent for medical treatment and other forms of treatment covered under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act.<br/><br/>Practically, which is to say, from the point of view of the clinical director of an inpatient service, even though the Act states that you can be admitted on the consent of your parents, the views and assent of the young person will be involved.  The same point comes up here again, which is that to rely solely on parental consent when admitting a young person is not appropriate.  In such a scenario, admission may cause stress in the relationship between the young person and their parents.  We have been using the best interests principle, that is to say, the decision is made and children are being admitted as involuntary patients, even where their parents consent to admission, because that is in their best interests.  In effecting the admission of a young person who is unco-operative and who does not want to be admitted, any such assistance requires the making of a court order.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind that the Act, as it applies to children, involves a court process, the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is very helpful.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>is an independent court officer.  That can be very helpful because the young person then has someone who will engage with them and represent their views to the court while also forming an independent opinion or view, which they can then bring back to the court.  In doing so, they will meet with the parents and the treating team and participate in planning meetings.  They become very integral and are a very important part because we are trying to ensure that the young person receives treatment but not in a way that adversely impacts on relationships within the family.  <br/><br/>In one respect, the new Bill brings us back to allowing 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds to consent.  Consent is vested and, as a 16-year-old, you can give consent.  The amendments to the Act will bring that age to 16.  Legally, 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds are most definitely not adults.  There was a High Court challenge in respect of section 25 of the Act a number of years ago and the judge talked about the continuing role of parents.  In the Act, it seems that families and parents continue to be an important part.  Even though there is talk of young people and their consent, parents remain a very important part.  The High Court judge pointed to this fact, in a sense, in that particular case.  Consent is a very complex area and, of course, the capacity to consent is not the same as the capacity not to consent.  Those of us who are child and adolescent psychiatrists feel more comfortable with how this issue has been teased through in these latest amendments to the Act.  However, the principles set out in the Act are very helpful.  <br/><br/>It is also helpful that the part of the Act that addresses children is to be completely separate.  The 2001 Act referred to large sections of the Child Care Act, which allowed us to, for example, undertake nasogastric feeding under restraint, where necessary, through an order under the Mental Health Act.  That is a very important step.  We can do that with the permission and oversight of the courts.  We are very much mindful of ensuring the rights of the child are respected and advocating for those rights.<br/><br/>With regard to an omission in the proposed amendments, the 2001 Act specifically precluded social workers from giving consent for children in care to be admitted.  The expert review group did not make any recommendation for that to be removed but it does not appear in the proposed amendments to the Act.  It was very important and there was a reason for its inclusion in the 2001 Act, which was to ensure that an agent of the State would not provide consent for children to be placed in inpatient units while they are in the care of the State and that the courts would have oversight because it is important that young people not remain in an inpatient facility if they do not need to be there.  In our experience over the years, that provision has been very important safeguard for children who are in the care of the State.</p></speech>

I know that it is crucial.  I had not realised how complex the challenges were with regard to the ages between 16 and 18 and how acute general health episodes and mental health episodes are managed.  That leads on to issues relating to admission to adult units.  Professor Doody mentioned that the number of days children or young adults under the age of 18 have spent in adult units has reduced.  That is important.  We need much more access to beds.</p><p>The submissions were great and provided feedback on areas outside of the legislation as well.  As I mentioned earlier, the area of recruitment is of interest to me.  Salaries are one thing.  A very good article in <i>The Journal</i>was forwarded to me by someone in healthcare.  It was about the increase in the number of young doctors going to Australia.</p><p>Mention was made of the GP experience in Australia and the fact that there are so many things we would love to bring on board, but I know from GPs in my area &mdash; the Ballinasloe&ndash;east Galway area &mdash; and south Roscommon that they do not have access to Westdoc.  They do not get access to night-time supports, from 12 midnight to 8 a.m.  This is absolutely incredible.  I very much recognise the lack of funding and investment in these areas.  I would like to hear the views of Ms Clyne, Professor Doherty and a few others on this.  My questions are informed by my understanding of the multitude of challenges that exist, the burnout and the incredible weight on people, particularly on women, including young women, but also on families and young dads.  It is just so hard.  What are the other quality-of-life measures to be considered that relate to the university training hospital, the likes of University Hospital Galway and work with research?  While all of these are great draws, how do we retain the excellent graduates that come through our system?</p></speech>

There is a changing demographic involving women in medicine, yet the whole structure pertaining to how consultants are trained has not changed.  There are no significant efforts towards family-friendly policies, work&ndash;life balance and flexible training.  There is some commentary around this and we talk about it, but we do not address it.  It is almost a shock to us when we hear that women will have babies and that their posts will have to be filled.  We do not have a workforce plan anyway but we certainly have no workforce plan for the changing demographics in medicine.</p> <p>  We know our trainees can go to a better system.  Let me refer to a very simple practice in Australia.  If an individual and her or his partner apply for a post in Australia, the service there will do its best to ensure both work the same shift pattern and do not work hundreds of miles away from each other.  These are the things an employer does.  One of the things we have forgotten is that doctors in Ireland are highly trained and valued, and they are being headhunted daily.</p></speech>

I very much understand that is thanks to the fantastic colleges of medicine in our institutions across the country, but also the experience the trainees get in the hospitals themselves.  The challenge we have is related to population.  The population of Australia by comparison with the population of Ireland has to be taken into account.</p></speech>

It is most frustrating if the system does not allow them to do that, if they have no beds for patients they would like to admit to hospital and if there are no talking therapies for patients who need them.  It is these sources of frustration that make it very difficult to have any sense that patients are getting good care and that one is managing to change anything by going to work in the morning.  These factors are probably the most important.  Senator Dolan mentioned access to additional research facilities etc.  These are definitely draws and make areas more attractive, which is often why the cities and academic centres find it easier to recruit than more peripheral areas.</p></speech>

In the setting I work in, online services are probably not as appropriate because we see people who are extremely unwell who really need face-to-face assessment.  However, there is evidence that services such as talk therapy can be helpful online but a certain proportion of people will need face-to-face therapy.  Once things open up and we are able to allow people to have more face-to-face therapies, they will opt for them a little more.</p></speech>

Our health services did receive an increase in funding because of Covid but mental health services did not receive any increase directly related to Covid.  Therefore, the proportion of funding has fallen substantially.  We know the demand on our mental health services will increase because of Covid and that our population is expanding and ageing, so there are huge demands.  Despite this, our pot for mental health services is very much shrinking.</p></speech>

GPs had to identify whole ranges and cohorts of patients during vaccination because there were no disease records.  Hospital colleagues had to do the same.

I was listening in but had to leave briefly.</p> <p>  Dr. Brides talked about prescribing and mentioned a colleague who was prescribing to about 30% of patients in Australia and nearly 100% here.  Does that mean we are overprescribing?  My comments are not intended to take from and do not reflect on the quality of medication for mental health issues.</p><p>Does Dr. Brides think we are, therefore, over-prescribing or that GPs are forced into over-prescribing or becoming overly reliant on medication because they simply do not have access to talk therapies or the other supports we would ideally be offering patients?</p></speech>

I have no evidence to support this but I know from being in practice that when people in distress come to me, and often they do need medication but also need talking therapy along with it, they come back to me a couple of weeks later because they have not had access to talking therapy and I have no other option but to increase their prescription.  That will happen again a couple of weeks later.  I might even find myself adding medications I know the patient does not really need but I do not have the allocated time to go through his or her problem.  I do not have the qualification.  I am not a psychologist and am not trained in therapies.</p> <p>  Once again, if we refer to the Australian model where there might be an in-house person trained in this discipline, if I was able to refer on this person on the first occasion either with or without medication, it would be much more advantageous to the patient.  As Dr. Sadlier referred to earlier, there is a lot of evidence that certainly with moderate depression, it is not just medication or just talking therapies but a combination of both.  We are not providing adequate services to our patients.  We are simply ignoring half of their treatment because we do not have access to that level of care.</p> <p>  If we think back to something mentioned earlier, that is, the lack of regulation among the talking therapies, for want of a descriptive term, we can see that the people are out there or certainly there are vast numbers of them.  I would imagine that a lot of them are of a certain standard so it is just about using them appropriately.  It is about making them more accessible.</p> <p>  Yes, e-health is good and some patients can engage in online therapies but really therapies need to be accessible.  It is a bit like general practice.  We need it on the ground and to be accessible to patients and not something they must travel for.  Our counselling and primary care service is based in Navan, which is about an hour and 15 minutes from Monaghan.  That is just pointless because people need to be able to access it.  Often these are patients with very limited means.  We need as few barriers as possible to accessing these services.  To answer the Senator's question, I do think there is far more prescribing in general practice than we would ideally like to see happening.</p></speech>

That is a really pertinent point to take away from this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#P00400"><p>I know the focus is often on the idea that there is a dichotomy between medications and talk therapies.  The benefits of both at times are oversold a bit.  One of the best projects I was ever involved with in my professional career was one we did with the FAI in west Dublin where a number of service users went on an eight-week training programme and got a Kick Start certificate.  The way it changed their lives and activation was literally a miracle.  As well as the non-provision of talking therapies, the non-provision of these group activities that can help mild to moderate depression and anxiety and would be more in the realm of occupational therapy than psychology is also a significant deficit.  It is not that I am trying to downplay talk therapies.  I just think that when we get into this discussion, this is an area that is often ignored.  I know it is often called social prescribing.  Certain mental health services throughout the world offer free gym membership, physical exercise, physical fitness or weight control programmes - various aspects that can be done that quite often are very cost-effective because they are done in a group manner and can be just as beneficial as the one-to-one counselling or the use of medications.  We must keep an eye on those sorts of programmes as well and not lose them in the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#P00500"><p>Dr. Brides spoke about the regulation of certain talk therapies.  The Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy has been trying for years to get a regulatory underpinning of the work it is doing.  I do not want to stray too far from the topic we are discussing but I know the association has been talking to other members of this committee about its frustration about being able to provide a service but not having a regulatory framework to do it.  It seems to be taking forever.  This may be a reflection of where we are in general with this sector.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about workforce planning or the lack of it, and the changing demographics of medicine.  Many different groups would come before this committee representing the diversity of Ireland's population.  The witnesses spoke about people entering training and rapidly backing out again, which is a problem.  Is there any commentary the witnesses can offer about the diversity of those seeking training?  Is there a realistic prospect in the future of seeing services in communities staffed by people who represent them?  I will not go too far down into the diversity of the communities but it is important when we are talking about medicine and the diversity of people who are going and training in different sections.  As the witnesses said, we do not even have workforce planning so perhaps this is a comment that is too far down the line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.677" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Clyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#P00600"><p>There is no workforce planning.  Obviously, workforce planning would take all of these things into account.  Anybody who wants to be a doctor has to start thinking about it at a very young age.  He or she is asked to get a huge number of points in the leaving certificate and must then do the health professions admission test, HPAT, and go into the very long university and training period.  We see more diversity in medicine.  Obviously, we see more women in medicine.  We see through the graduate entry medical programme that people with previous degrees as their primary degree are coming into medicine.</p> <p>  One of the issues we have is the number of training places.  We have a reliance on international doctors who work mainly within our acute system and are not on training pathways and whose visa regulations and critical skills are not dealt with very quickly.  While they can go on to apply for training pathways, if the training pathway number is not increased, all we are doing is having more people apply for a static number of posts.  We talk about needing "X" number of GPs and consultants in the future and these retirements happening over five years or even ten years.  We talked about this a decade ago.  We have the problem now.  What we are saying is that we really have to do something about it now.  It takes a very long time to train a doctor so we need the training places to be increased.  We need our international doctors to be valued, to be able to see a future within Ireland and to be respected and treated appropriately and equitably within the system.</p></speech>

It is certainly a specialty that tends to have quite wide representation of the population.  As Ms Clyne has just said, sometimes it can be very difficult for international doctors to access training programmes, which is a problem that needs to be addressed.  Again, it is important that we represent the population we serve and that patients can feel comfortable talking to any mental health professional they see not just in psychiatry but across the other disciplines as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#P00800"><p>Again, we need to look at what other countries have done because it is important we learn.  Other countries have experienced difficulties regarding service, service planning and development.  In our workforce planning, we need to look at what the current workforce is because sometimes we might think we have created more posts but over the next five years, there may be an increased number of retirements given the age profile.  It might be a case of "We have created all these additional posts so why hasn't that resulted in an increased number of consultants on the ground?"</p><p>If we do not invest sustainably, there will be periods when certain specialties suddenly expand and many consultants are recruited at the same time.  That is fine until it comes to retirement when a large number of retirements happen together.  A service must be grown and invested in sustainably.  We cannot just put a lot of money into it and expect changes to happen overnight.  Health services - not just mental health services - are delivered by people and technology.  Investment in people is taking a long time.  We want to invest, but we need to do that on a multi-annual basis.</p><p> We must then ensure that we attract graduates.  This is about providing undergraduates with exposure to psychiatry.  In our service, we are fortunate to have two psychiatry intern posts.  Interestingly, they are very sought after.  This is a question of how to provide early training opportunities.  Psychiatry has often been at a disadvantage in this respect, with doctors making their career choices early.  As such, it is important that they have an opportunity to be exposed to working in mental health services before they complete their training and their pre-registration year.</p><p> We have spoken about an operational plan.  A workforce plan is required, by which I mean a plan that sets out what we want the service to look like.  We must then determine how to put in place the structures to make that happen and train people.  It is five-year, ten-year and 15-year planning as opposed to believing that we can invest a great deal of money in the short term and expect change.  We are just chasing people, which has been an issue previously.  An interesting point was made about increasing the number of posts.  All that means is staff moving from one part of the country to another.  Additional staff are not being recruited.  Instead, vacancies are being created somewhere else.  Staff drift from areas where there is a high cost base.  Although there are advantages in some respects, there is a disadvantage to services being in cities where there are high accommodation costs.</p><p> Many elements feed into this situation.  As a result, we need a co-ordinated operational plan and workforce plan if we want there to be change.  It will not happen unless we address these aspects simultaneously.</p></speech>

It is bonkers that we do not have a workforce plan.  It is so obvious when listing issues like expanding bubbles of employment and retirement.  It seems ineffective and inefficient that we are not getting to grips with a sustainable and steady workforce plan.  I will not go into it too much, though.</p> <p>  Ms Clyne spoke about what was going to be my next question.  At this and other committees, she has spoken about bringing in international doctors, the ethics of a brain drain out of countries, in particular developing ones, and our unacceptable treatment of them by not providing training pathways.  I will not go into that matter again.</p> <p>  If the points that the witnesses have made are included in the final draft of this Bill, will we be on track to having gold standard, world standard or just good legislation that will protect, support and provide care and compassion for the people who will be affected by it?  Are we going in the right direction in terms of how we need to treat our patients with mental health issues?  I mean that in terms of this Bill specifically as opposed to the overall situation.</p></speech>

Overall, the heads of the Bill come to more than 300 pages.  This is a large document.  We have only raised a tiny number of problems with it at this meeting, but the majority of it is fine.  There are many good elements in it.  We have not emphasised them because one cannot emphasise all of the hundreds of good elements.  The change in the management of anorexia is a positive.  People detained under the Mental Health Act will now be able to get physical treatment if they need it.  To date, we could not feed an adult patient with anorexia under the Mental Health Act.  One would have to make him or her a ward of court by going to the High Court and through a convoluted process in which he or she would have to be declared to be of unsound mind and unable to manage his or her affairs.  That is an archaic way of going about things.  This part of the Bill will make a major difference to patients' lives, in that their physical healthcare and the elements of their mental healthcare that involve physical health treatments will now be given in the appropriate setting.</p> <p>  The main issues that we have raised are those that we believe might get in the way of people having access to healthcare and the right to prompt treatment with dignity and in the appropriate setting.  If some of these changes can be included, we can develop a health service that allows people who need it to get treatment in the right place at the right time.  We are speaking about people who are admitted under the Mental Health Act.  We have probably spent most of this meeting talking about the thousands of people in mental health services more generally.  A small proportion of those will be admitted to mental health units, and probably only 20% of those will be held under the Mental Health Act.  We are speaking about a tiny proportion of a tiny proportion, but because they are so vulnerable, we need to ensure that their right to treatment and their access to treatment are promoted as much as possible.</p> <p>  To answer the Senator's question, the direction of travel is excellent overall, but we need to ensure that everyone can access treatment in a timely way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.683" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#Q00400"><p>Under the Act, we have been able to initiate and deliver nasogastric, NG, feeding for seriously unwell people with eating disorders in our inpatient services and where restraint has been necessary.  We have a colleague working with us in the inpatient unit who has long experience of working in inpatient services in the UK.  He is able to compare and contrast the Act's provisions that apply to under-18s.  He says that the system here, which goes through the courts, is a far superior mechanism than what he experienced in the UK.  The oversight by a court provides protection, in that we are going to court to vindicate and protect the rights of the young person.  It provides oversight, even where parents are consenting.  There is also the important guardian <i>ad litem</i>role.  In a sense, the Act and the amendments to it as they pertain to children make it clear that it is a separate Act.  Most of those provisions were in the Act initially but were just seen as references to sections of the Child Care Act.<br/><br/>The rules and regulations that come with the Mental Health Act and apply to children and adolescents need to be separate from those that apply to adults.  The initiation and use of NG feeding and, if necessary, the use of restraint constitute a form of restrictive practice, but one that delivers a necessary and life-saving treatment.  It is important to remember that, until three years ago, children who required such treatment were being sent abroad.  That is no longer happening.  We have the legal framework.  The amendments to the Act clarify and build on the experience that we have gained in the use of the Act over the past number of years.</p><p>It also clarifies the anomaly in respect of 16- and 17-year-olds, even though in practice we would not have been admitting 16- and 17-year-olds or even younger, if they did not consent to admission, solely on consent of parents.  In a sense, it is bringing the status of 16- and 17-year-olds in line with that for other treatments.  It is important that 16- and 17-year-olds have that capacity to consent.<br/><br/>There are lots of positives with regard to the Act.  I have been in court many times, explaining to the a judge that we are here, even though the parents are consenting - and this may be for a young person who is only 11 or 12 - because it is important that we vindicate and safeguard the rights of the child.  It is important that they are properly safeguarded and vindicated and are appointed a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  There are many positive aspects to the legislation.  The safeguards with regard to children who are subject to care orders have been omitted from the amendment in the Act but there is a very good reason they should be there.  They have been omitted without a recommendation of the expert group for them to be so omitted.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Act should be reviewed more regularly, rather than waiting for long periods when things change so much in medicine, in the delivery of care and in people's rights.  We chose to home in on a number of issues today that we think will inadvertently have negative consequences for immediate, crisis care to patients.  We commend the legislators and look forward them seeking the necessary funding to have mental health services in place around the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Matthew Sadlier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#R00300"><p>I agree.  The 2001 Act, which updated the 1945 Act, created a stepped change in mental health care.  We can date all the improvements in terms of rights to that Act, which introduced tribunals and rights of appeal for people involuntarily detained.  We have questions, as pointed out earlier, with regard to issues that can slow up the delivery of care.  There are also some areas of ambiguity in the Act and obviously ambiguity in a legal document might lead to difficulties in operation.</p> <p>  To echo Dr. Dooley's point, my specialty is psychiatry of later life where we deal with patients aged over 65.  The vast majority of our work in psychiatry of later life deals with disorders related to dementia.  In that context, the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act will have a big impact.  Similarly to Dr. Dooley's call for a separate set of rules and guidance for young people in mental health facilities, there is an urgent need for a separate set of rules and regulations for older people within mental health facilities.  I can give the committee one or two examples of that.  We had a patient come to our unit who was in a particular wheelchair that had a curvature of the back because of severe degeneration of the spine.  The wheelchair was designed to match the curve of the spine but to benefit from that, the patient had to have a seat belt.  That was not allowed to be used when the patient was admitted to the psychiatric facility because it was seen to be mechanical restraint, and it was not a restraint that was related to pain relief.  There are issues around ligature points in older age care where patients might need oxygen or hoists to be lifted.  Unfortunately, when people develop dementia, it is not just a brain disease but an all-over body disease and they have many other deficits.  It is very difficult to say that our units are fit for purpose.  We have to remove oxygen points because they are seen as potential ligature points, despite the fact that the vast majority of our patients are in a state of frailty where that is not really as much of a concern as it would be in younger patients.  We would absolutely be asking that as part of this process there would be a separate set of guidance and rules for the provision of care to those with medical frailties within units.  </p> <p>  As an aside not related to legislation, I would also be advocating that the provision of services specifically for psychiatry of old age are moved more into the older persons' programmes than programmes for mental health because we have more in common with our colleagues in medicine for the elderly.  Often our units need significant hospital support, which they do not get, because there is a basis under which our services are constantly being moved to the community.  A DaTscan is used to differentiate dementia diagnoses and in the UK, the highest orderer of DaTscans is the psychiatry service.  In Ireland, we have no access to them whatsoever.  The provision of physical health care to mental health services is difficult with this constant move to the community, which is totally suitable for many people with various diagnoses but within the psychiatry of later life we need a more centralised system because of the need for hospital care, access to scanning, blood testing and so on.</p></speech>

While I do not speak on behalf of everyone on the committee, I can say that we are extremely committed to making this legislation the best it can be.  That is always our job as legislators, of course, but we are particularly focused on this Bill at the moment.  Hopefully with everyone's suggestions, we can think of ways that this can be done.  It is really useful to get a sense from experts as to whether we are going in the right direction and how we can ensure the legislation is the best it can be.  Some of the additional suggestions are really important and I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I have no more questions and I thank the Chairman for facilitating me.</p></speech>

I am glad that the final question from the Senator allowed us to hear their thoughts on the legislation that is coming.  Reference was made to the fact that three Ministers agreed that there was a shortage of resources for recruitment.  What is the blockage there?  Why did previous Ministers not act on what the witnesses spoke at length about today, in terms of issues with recruitment?  What is the blockage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Clyne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022020800002#R00600"><p>The blockage is the Government's attitude towards consultants and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform allowing that to happen.  Consultants had to go to the High Court to have their contract upheld following a decision by another former Minister for Health, Mary Harney.  Ourselves and the IHCA ended up in the High Court.  The current T&aacute;naiste was Minister for Health at the time of the cuts.  Everyone understood those cuts in the context of austerity but it was the targeting of this additional cut that was problematic.  We believe it was a politically motivated cut.  It had no basis in evidence and did not save the State a fortune by any means.  In fact, it had the opposite effect in that it was devastating.  When Deputy Harris was Minister for Health he attended the AGMs of the IMO and the IHCA and acknowledged and recognised that it was a mistake and said that it would be fixed but it was not.  The current Minister has spoken at length on the record of the D&aacute;il several times and at various meetings acknowledging that this is a problem.  We are in contract talks at the moment that are stalled because there is no chairman.</p> <p>  We have to accept that people will vote with their feet.  There has been a very big reliance on doctors doing the right thing for their patients, putting up with it and not taking any kind of industrial action - options that are open to many other workers in the public service.  Consultants support a partnership approach.  They want to see health reform.  We have to get over that, accept that consultants want better services for their patients and want to advocate for their patients but also want to be treated fairly.  It is the inherent unfairness that has had a toxic influence.</p><p>It is difficult for consultants to be working on a team where a consultant appointed two weeks before another consultant, and appointed before the deadline, earns 30% more than the other consultant, despite being as qualified and doing the same amount of work.  It creates such a toxic feeling in the health service and it has driven morale down.  Unfortunately, our trainees see it.  They see how they are valued by the employer and by Government and they move along.  I would like to hear from those three or four Ministers why they promised something they are now not delivering.</p></speech>

I apologise for the delay in starting the meeting.  The Order of Business in the D&aacute;il delayed some of us.  The Seanad is sitting so Senators may have to go in and out as Seanad business requires.</p> <p>  We are joined from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage by Ms Caroline Timmons, assistant secretary, and Ms Rosemary Tobin, principal officer for homelessness policy; and from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, by Ms Mary Hayes, director, and Mr. John Durkan, deputy director.  We are joined remotely by two representatives from Waterford City and County Council, Ms Sin&eacute;ad Breathnach, homeless lead for the south-east region, and Mr. Ivan Grimes, director of services; and by Patrick O'Sullivan, principal officer for social policy from the Department.  Members have been circulated with the briefing documents and opening statements from the witnesses.</p> <p>  I will first ask witnesses to give their opening statements and keep them to about five minutes because we are quite constrained on time.  Then we will go to members' questions and answers slots, which will be six minutes each. We should be able to fit everybody into the two hours.</p> <p> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  Those attending remotely from within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present within the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty as Chair to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  </p> <p>  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Our witnesses are welcome to assist us as we continue our work in the area of homelessness.  When the committee formed in July or August 2020, it was an item every member wished to address.  It was high on our agenda and still is.  I thank the witnesses for their assistance.  I ask them to make their statements.  I will start with Ms Timmons, go on to Ms Hayes and then to Ms Breathnach.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for inviting the Department to discuss the committee's interim report on homelessness and the recommendations made therein.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Ms Rosemary Tobin, principal officer with responsibility for homelessness policy, funding and delivery, and Mr. Patrick O'Sullivan is online.  He is principal officer with responsibility for Traveller accommodation.  The Department works closely with DHRE and local authorities and I am pleased to see the local government sector in attendance.  It also works closely with many of the NGOs doing great work in the area.</p> <p>  Resolving homelessness is one of the most important challenges facing the State.  Housing for All is the Government's plan to meet our overall aim of ensuring everyone in the State has access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life.</p><p>The plan enumerates more than 200 actions across four pathways which will collectively address housing issues, and all of those actions will contribute to creating a housing system that meets the needs of our people.  The State has committed &euro;20 billion in funding over the next five years to achieve those aims.  The plan recognises that housing policy must address the needs of socially excluded members of society and that the issue of homelessness is one of the most pressing of our time.  The State made an overarching commitment at European level through signing the Lisbon Declaration on Combatting Homelessness and has committed again in Housing for All to working towards ending homelessness by 2030.  This will be done through a number of actions, including by increasing the overall supply of housing.  The plan aims to deliver 300,000 homes between now and the end of 2030, including 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.  While all of the actions in the plan will have a bearing on this issue, particularly those on the supply of social housing, which is essential to addressing homelessness, in pathway 2 of the plan we clearly set out specific actions that will directly address homelessness.  There are 17 recommendations in the interim report and I am happy to note that Housing for All includes actions which reflect many of the recommendations made by this committee in the interim report.</p><p> I will update the committee on some of the recent progress made and I am happy to discuss any of the recommendations in more detail during the meeting.  The most recent monthly and quarterly homeless reports produced by the Department show that there was a decrease in the numbers accessing emergency accommodation in December 2021, down to 8,914, and the figure is 15% below the peak in October 2019.  However, the trend in 2021 was an overall increase on the 2020 figures and this remains a serious concern for the Government and for my Department.  In terms of recent progress, and this particularly relates to one of the interim report recommendations, the Housing First national implementation plan was published on 20 December 2021.  This outlined our target to provide over 1,300 new supported social housing tenancies and to build on successes under this programme.  We are also driving better co-ordination in policy measures and actions, and a new national homeless action committee has been established.  All of the key Government Departments, agencies and stakeholders are involved.  A key first task for the committee is homelessness prevention.  It met again yesterday and will continue to meet monthly.</p><p> Work has begun on the development of a national youth homelessness strategy.  Preparing this strategy will involve co-operation and co-ordination between our Department and our colleagues at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; Tusla, the Child and Family Agency; and local authorities.  Greater cohesion between actions locally and policy nationally is also being advanced.  New guidance was issued in December to local authorities on the preparation of local homelessness action plans.  In tandem with the expansion of Housing First, Housing for All commits to expanding street outreach nationwide into urban areas, where rough sleeping is a concern.  There are specific measures to support rough sleepers into sustainable accommodation.  The Department of Health and the HSE, in Housing for All, have committed to ensuring that individual healthcare plans will be put in place for all homeless individuals who need them.</p><p> The Department has continued to invest in important services both to prevent homelessness and accelerate exits, including the HAP placefinder service, which is playing a vital role in keeping individuals out of homelessness, and in housing those who find themselves in emergency accommodation.  We continue to fund Threshold&rsquo;s tenancy protection service, which provides advice and support to individuals, couples and families living in private rented accommodation experiencing tenancy problems.  It must be acknowledged that some families have been living in homelessness for lengthy periods and this is an area we need to focus on.  Housing for All commits the Department to working with local authorities and NGOs to identify families experiencing long-term homelessness that have complex support needs.  Those that do will be provided with enhanced tenancy sustainment supports to help them exit homelessness and maintain their homes.  Additional supports are to be provided to families by Tusla.</p><p> The priority of the Department and local authorities continues to be to get people out of emergency accommodation.  However, it remains critical that all emergency accommodation, whether NGO or private, operates to a high standard and actions are being taken to ensure this.  A national quality standards framework, NQSF, has been put in place for services delivered by NGOs under contract to local authorities.  The aim of the NQSF is to have it applied to all services for those experiencing homelessness.  Taken together, these actions represent a significant and expanding level of interventions to support individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness.  My Department is committed to ending homelessness and we thank all of the organisations involved that are working hard to help those at risk of, or experiencing homelessness.  We will continue to drive all of the actions in Housing for All, which will be essential if we are to make progress.  I thank members for their time and attention and my colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.699" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#C00200"><p>Part 1 of my submission was just some general context on the work of the DRHE so I will go straight to an update on the recommendations relevant to the DRHE.  Recommendation 3 is on Housing First.  The target of 273 tenancies for the Dublin region from 2018 to 2021 was met and exceeded.  There were 414 tenancies created in the Dublin from 2018 to end October 2021.  The DRHE is strongly supportive of Housing First.  Recommendation 7 is for a methodology to be agrees for recording the deaths of people experiencing homelessness.  The DRHE met the Department of Health and the HSE on this and it was agreed that the DRHE will cease reporting on deaths in homelessness and will co-operate fully with the Health Research Board&rsquo;s, HRB&rsquo;s, national pilot on mortality in homelessness.  The HRB will be the first point of contact for future research in this area as it collects and analyses data from all coronial files.  The pilot on national homeless deaths will inform the permanent structures for the recording and monitoring of trends.  The HRB will provide the evidence on which State agencies can make recommendations on what can be termed as preventable deaths among people who were homeless at the time of death.</p> <p>  Recommendation 8 is on trauma-informed care.  The HSE is supporting the DRHE with training of our staff and staff in the sector in the area of trauma-informed care, among other training inputs which we will come to.  Recommendation 10 is on inspections.  The DRHE placed a tender to source an independent inspectorate for all homeless accommodation facilities on the E-tenders website in June 2021.  That process finished in December 2021, unsatisfactorily, as the tender process did not identify a suitable entity to undertake this role.  The inspection tender was changed and reviewed and the new one has been advertised on the etenders website since Monday, 7 February.  In advance of that tender development, the then deputy chief executive, Brendan Kenny, had instructed Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, to begin inspections in all homeless facilities, including both NGO and private emergency accommodation, PEA, facilities.  DFB risk-assessed all property files and identified 38 for physical inspection.  All inspections and any consequential remediation works required have been completed.  We had an in-house inspection team pre-Covid and we have resumed inspections for now until the tender process concludes.</p> <p>  Recommendation 11 is on the NQSF and its application to PEA.  A process for the implementation of the NQSF to PEA has begun.  As with the previous roll-out to NGO services, a developmental approach is being taken.  The first phase is to introduce a framework of standards, focused on the quality of the accommodation and what the resident can expect from the facility and its staff.  The standards for PEA were presented to the joint consultative forum in the Dublin region and to the management group in September 2021 and they were adopted.  We are due to appoint a staff member this month who has previous NGO experience of rolling out quality standards.  She will begin the process of rolling out the first developmental standards and will build up incrementally as we get the PEA operators used to the idea, trained in the idea and understanding of what the NQSF will involve.  A tender is under development for the operation of DCC-owned or long-term leased buildings and we will be requesting tenders for the operation and management to include full facility and care and case management for those buildings.</p> <p>  We appointed a dedicated complaints officer as members will see in the report and I would like to give some context for this.  In 2020 some 576 complaints were received by NGOs and 133 were received on PEAs.  That is reflective of the fact that over a long period of time the NGOs have had well-developed complaints procedures and that we are just starting to promote PEA.  I am confident that by the end of this year we will have a robust complaintsprocedure across all our services in a number of languages and that trust will be built in the service.  A joint project with HSE Dublin north city and county social inclusion team and the DRHE has been established to develop the skills of emergency accommodation providers.  Training is being rolled out in the following areas: first aid; naloxone and overdose awareness; suicide awareness and prevention; trauma-informed care; children first; safeguarding of vulnerable adults; intercultural diversity; and equality and diversity.</p> <p>  Recommendation 12 is on NGOs having the capacity to tender for the provision of emergency accommodation.</p><p>As of Monday, 17 January, the DRHE had put out a tender for emergency accommodation on the eTenders website.  We have contacted all the NGO services to encourage participation in the request for tender.  Since I came into the post in March last year, I have met with all the main homeless charities.  I have actively encouraged and agreed we will support proposals for supported accommodation for families and singles experiencing homelessness.<br/><br/><b></b>Recommendation 13 relates to the phasing out of private emergency accommodation, which the DHRE fully supports.  We support housing solutions to homelessness, in particular Housing First.  It as much a priority for us as for anyone else.<br/><br/>Recommendation 14 refers to the Minister developing a plan for an adequate supply of emergency accommodation and to reverse the over-concentration in places such as Dublin Central.  We have split our tender for accommodation into five lots.  We have sought properties across the region and we are actively trying to encourage properties in a balanced development of homeless services across the Dublin region.<br/><br/>Recommendation 15 relates to the use of private security.  It is used in very limited circumstances, usually where we have received complaints about congregation outside a facility, and is not involved in the management of the service.  NGOs, private emergency operators and the DHRE in Parkgate Hall have private security to manage extreme episodes where there have been issues.  It is not all the time and I regard its use as quite limited.<br/><br/><b></b>I will take recommendations 16 and 17 together because the latter is just an iteration of all the supports.  On recommendation 16, since the Covid-19 pandemic, the DHRE and the HSE have been working extremely closely together.  We already had an assigned key worker in place for all families.  We are now working to extend that to single homeless people and those in PEA.  Housing support officers, funded by the Department, are covering people who just have a housing need.  The HSE has started funding in-reach services that are providing care and case management.  We are building that up all the time.</p></speech>

The report also outlines some of the national and regional initiatives implemented in the south east, which have helped us in bringing about a collaborative and consistent approach to addressing homelessness and providing better housing, social and health outcomes for our service users.</p> <p>  Some of our regional initiatives are currently subject to a case study by the Housing Agency for inclusion in a policy and practice insights paper, with a view to promoting them as best practice.  They include the review and strengthening of our regional structures, our innovative own-front-door model of emergency accommodation, the introduction of homeless prevention and support workers to local authority homeless teams, and the use of care and case management throughout all our services.  The care and case management framework is used to identify the support needs of our service users and to address issues that may have caused or contributed to their homelessness in the first instance.  This framework is embedded throughout our services and is key to preventing rebound homelessness in the region, where our priority focus is on homeless prevention and tenancy sustainment.</p> <p>  Much progress has been made in the region on addressing and managing homelessness over the past number of years, which is mainly due to a significant shift in culture where the local authorities, the HSE and the homeless service providers have committed to working together in preventing and addressing homelessness and in improving the health, social and housing outcomes for our service users.  Having that strong partnership approach has enabled us to be more proactive, progressive and innovative in managing the homeless crisis and has had a substantial positive impact in the region.  I acknowledge the dedication and commitment of all involved.  I very much recommend and promote this partnership approach to managing homelessness. </p></speech>

I felt some sympathy for Ms Hayes as she tried to deal with all her recommendations.  I have no doubt we will try to tease all of them out in our questioning.  I will go straight to that.  There has been a decrease in the number of people sleeping rough, from 139 to 94.  Every person makes a difference.  In respect of recommendation three, there seems to be an increase, beyond what was expected, in the number of Housing First tenancies created.  Will Ms Hayes talk to us about the process relating to where the reduction in rough sleeping has occurred?  How has it occurred?  How has the creation of Housing First tenancies been successful in increasing the number to 414, to date?</p></speech>

Last year, 61 tenancies were created, specifically in Dublin City Council, under Housing First.  I recognise the names of those tenants.  We review them at the end of every year and those names are well known to us; they are people we have known for years in the services.  Housing First has been fantastic and has received major support.  There are difficulties with bedding it down in some communities, but in the city centre we have access to one-bedroom accommodation.  When we reach out to communities to say what we are trying to do, people have been incredibly supportive of Housing First and its outcomes.  That can be seen with the tenancy sustainments.</p> <p>  On the reduction in homeless numbers, we have to pay tribute to Dublin Simon for its role, which has been fantastic, and the Peter McVerry Trust in terms of the intake team.  Both those teams are contributing.  They are telling us what the person wants and what it will take for that person to come off the street.  That kind of bespoke response is producing results we were not getting previously when it was just the same.  Sometimes, we were offering the same accommodation all the time and people were not responding to it.</p></speech>

Under recommendation 11, Ms Hayes talked about a process, but I did not think there was a timeline for the establishment of an NQSF for private operators.  Is it possible to put a timeline on that now?</p></speech>

We started that in 2014 and the full national roll-out was in 2019.  We will be much faster now because we already have the standards we want.  Our timeline for the first roll-out includes an introduction and training.  We have to get that because otherwise private operators will not understand it.  We have to bring them into the process.  That first process of rolling out the first standards will take a year.  We will have the standards ready for the second phase of the higher and more integrated level by next year.  That is our intention.</p></speech>

Four people are working in that team.  Until now, they have worked exclusively on NGO properties, but they will now also apply what are modified standards for private providers because, again, we are at the starting blocks with PEA.  That team will monitor and manage the quality standards for PEA.  That will be supplemented across all facilities, both NGO and private emergency, by the independent inspectorate.</p></speech>

Will they be broadly similar?  Will there be a difference between public and private?  This committee is of the view that they should not be different and the same standards should apply regardless of who operates a service.</p></speech>

The only question is how we get there.  Again, I point out the fact that when we started with NGOs, we had quite a long lead-in time and we developed standards with them.  Standards should not be suddenly planted on private emergency operators, if they do not understand the context or how to apply them.  Training and development, whether it is done through HIQA, the DHRE or whoever, will apply.</p></speech>

I will add that in the interim we have visiting support services going into facilities.  Those services are subject to the full suite of NQSF standards.  The role of those services is care and case management, health, and case management supports within the services.</p></speech>

The Minister made a very clear commitment that people's point of origin would not be something that barred them from accessing emergency accommodation.  Could Ms Hayes restate the DRHE's commitment to that?  I ask her to verify that, regardless of where people who become homeless are from, if they are in need of emergency accommodation on a given evening, they can avail of it from the DRHE.</p></speech>

We have to consider, for example, whether the person has built up years on another local authority waiting list.  Last week we had someone who was under consideration for Housing First in a county area, who then came to Dublin-----</p></speech>

It is good to see her again.</p> <p>  Dormitory-style emergency accommodation is a big issue and one that is raised with me regularly.  The Mendicity Institution conducted a survey recently.  I should declare an interest here as I worked with the institution for about four years.  The aforementioned survey showed that nearly 90% of people staying in emergency accommodation experienced crime.  What is being done to move away from dormitory-style accommodation?  I spoke to an individual last week who told me that he slept in an emergency dormitory and when he woke in the morning, the person in the bed next to him was injecting heroin.  He is trying to get himself straight but is surrounded by drug use.  This style of accommodation is really distressing and makes it very difficult for people to get clean.  What is being done to ensure that dormitory-style accommodation is phased out because it just does not work?</p></speech>

We have only used dormitory-style accommodation because we had to at times when we suddenly had to increase capacity.  Obviously, we minimised the amount of dormitory accommodation we used during Covid and our intention is to keep those standards and try to improve rather than step backwards in that regard.  In terms of dormitories, we have a minimal number at this stage.  There are only five properties where people are sharing a room with more than four people.  Again, the vast majority of our accommodation is moving towards one and two bedroom units with two people sharing.  We agree with Deputy Andrews and support his argument but we have to manage, on a nightly basis, the risk of someone rough sleeping versus being able to offer a bed.  We agree that minimising the use of dormitories is the most favourable solution.</p></speech>

Obviously that scenario is not working for either party.</p></speech>

The NGOs tend to manage that themselves.  They tend to know the people and tend to move them around.  That is also done in the private emergency accommodation.  The Ana Liffey Drug Project is going into the private emergency accommodation services now and would frequently come back to us with advice on sharing arrangements, what is appropriate and so on.  Accommodation for people who have no addiction needs does exist.  Crosscare provides a temporary emergency accommodation service in Amiens Street which is highly successful.  It is for people whose only need is for alternative accommodation.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that people who are not from Dublin but who find themselves homeless in Dublin cannot access emergency accommodation.  If they use the free phone number, they find it extremely challenging if they are not from Dublin and have not got a local link.  I appreciate what Ms Hayes said about getting them an offer of accommodation in Waterford, Cork or wherever they are from but if they are homeless in Dublin, they need to be accommodated in Dublin.

We must consider where that person was intended to be discharged to.  There are factors of which we need to be careful.</p></speech>

That may not be known to the emergency accommodation service or the NGO working with that person but it would be known to us.

As the supply line increases, our first target will be private emergency accommodation.  The NGOs are poised and ready and some of them have already drawn up plans to convert their emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation.  They are working hard on that.  We hope to be able to reduce our dependence on private emergency accommodation but we can only do that through a steady supply of housing alternatives.</p></speech>

Senator Cummins is next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#E04200"><p>I will jump straight in and follow on from where Deputy Andrews left off.  Has leasing played an important role in reducing reliance on emergency accommodation?  Is it not better to have someone in accommodation under a secure 15 or 20 year lease rather than in HAP or emergency accommodation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.759" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#E04300"><p>I am certainly in favour of leasing and I feel the same way about HAP in a sense.  I recognise all of the risks in terms of security of tenure and understand the nervousness around value for money with social housing versus leased housing but my comparison is with the cost of emergency accommodation.  It is extremely important that the DRHE has as many housing options available as possible to prevent homelessness and help people to exit homelessness as quickly as possible.  Any tenure that allows people to build up a life, access schools and so on is preferable to homelessness.</p></speech>

That is an important message.  It is often lost in the arguments that are made in here at committee and also in the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers, and in the media ultimately.  It is about people and finding them solutions so that they can improve and better their lives.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Hayes and Ms Timmons, and Ms Breathnach, in particular, and all of their teams for the work that is going on in this space.  Specifically, I thank Ms Breathnach, who, obviously, being from Waterford, I know best, for the work that is going on there in terms of reducing homelessness and the demand on emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  I have a question on the repair and lease scheme, which has been heavily taken up by Waterford.  It has provided a lot of one and two-bedroom accommodation, predominantly in the city centre.  Has that been an important supply line for Waterford City and County Council in assisting in this space?  I would appreciate it if Ms Breathnach could talk about the best practice that she cited the Housing Agency was working at.  I note Waterford has an integrated homeless hub for anybody to come to who is either experiencing homelessness or threatened with facing homelessness and it has all agencies operating in the one location.  Perhaps Ms Breathnach can elaborate.  It has proved an important successful model for Waterford.</p></speech>

To answer his question on the repair and leasing scheme, anything that increases the supply line specifically for homelessness is more than welcome.  In Waterford, there definitely has been a significant uptake in the repair and leasing.  As a result, our stock and supply has increased, which has helped us to even eliminate the use of private emergency accommodation, and using our own properties and stock as own-front-door emergency accommodation in lieu of it.  That is certainly welcome.</p> <p>  In relation to the best practice and the Housing Agency's casework at present, it is hitting on a few points there.  One is in relation to the Waterford integrated homeless services which we operate here in Waterford.  It is a local authority-led initiative but we operate in partnership with the HSE, with Focus Ireland and with South East Simon Community in addressing the needs of those who are homeless or those who are facing homelessness.  We have combined our resources and expertise all under one roof in order that the client is coming in to nearly a one-stop-shop for homelessness here in Waterford.  We have seen a significant uptake in the service, with approximately 3,600 households per year availing of it since we opened in early 2019.</p> <p>  Another initiative that the Housing Agency is looking at is the own-front-door model of emergency accommodation in lieu of the use of bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels.  Something we as a region have prioritised over the past few years is the reduction of private emergency accommodation.  That would not happen without the collaborative working between ourselves, the local authorities and the NGOs here in Waterford, particularly Focus Ireland and Tinte&aacute;n Housing Association.</p></speech>

In Waterford, we have eliminated the need.  We last used bed and breakfast accommodation in September 2019 because of this initiative.  As a region, we have significantly reduced the reliance on bed and breakfast accommodation and were able to save over &euro;1.07 million in funding because of that from 2019 to 2020.</p></speech>

If it can be achieved in an urban area such as Waterford - obviously it will take longer to address the challenges in Dublin - it certainly shows that progress can be made.</p><p>This is addressed to Ms Timmons in relation to the Department.  I have requested that targets be placed on local authorities for the repair and lease scheme <i>ad nauseam</i>for 12 months and it still has not been done.

We have the overall delivery target of 120 units for 2022.  The targets have not been set for individual local authorities.  At present, what we have going on is a programme of work under vacancy generally.  As the Senator will be aware, it is a fairly big pillar of Housing for All at this point.</p> <p>  We are starting on a programme of vacancy.  We are going to be looking at many different strands of work.  Repair and lease will have to come into that because that will be an important part of that.</p> <p>  We have not moved as far as deciding to set individual targets for local authorities but, working with the Housing Agency on both the compulsory purchase order, CPO, programme bringing forwards grants for refurbishment of vacant property and the repair and lease scheme for housing, those all will be considered in the round as part of that.</p></speech>

This is not a blame game for anyone.  That is what we need to get out of the way.  It is a crisis in homelessness and we need to tackle it in a multifaceted and holistic way.</p> <p>  I picked up on some words there from Ms Timmons when she talked about the Housing for All implementation plan.  That is really important.  We need to police this and monitor it.</p> <p>  I have sat in this committee for the past five years on Rebuilding Ireland and heard so many promises.  The focus now has to be on implementing this plan.  I am fully supportive of it - better co-ordination, better communication and better synergies between agencies, NGOs and everyone who is involved in tackling this crisis.  I do not want to go over all that history again and the multi-agency approach.</p> <p>  I will pick two issues that are critically important in terms of homelessness, that is, the national youth homeless strategy, which we need to focus on, as well as the need for us to stop people getting into homelessness.  That is a real concern to me, particularly the focus on people who have been either in care, in the probation services in the prisons, on the margins of difficulties or on the margins of family breakdown who have had enormous difficulties.  I am familiar with many of the agencies that work in the city here and the problem is buy-in.  When you talk to a 15-year-old or 16-year-old who has had a breakdown in family relationships from early on, invariably, that young person has left his or her place of care or, in some cases, detention.  How do you keep that relationship going?  Then you mix that in with drug addiction.</p> <p>  Addiction is a big issue here.  We need to be careful.  I am very concerned by the stories I am hearing in relation to addiction, which, let us be honest, is a mental health issue but for which there are other reasons.  We must accept that.  I do not like the idea that any person would be excluded.  I am hearing of young people who feel excluded from the health services and the health supports.  We talk about wrap-around supports - lovely jargon - but they feel excluded in many ways and they are finding it difficult to access it.  They feel they are excluded in terms of housing as well.  I made a case to a housing authority.  It does not make a difference in what housing authority it was - it was not one in Dublin.  This was a woman in her 70s and they said that she had had addiction problems and a multiplicity of problems.  Yes, but that is life and we must support them.</p> <p>  My concern here - I only want to focus on those two issues - is the area of addiction and vulnerable people, particularly young people, and how we will support them, and the issue of the national youth homelessness strategy because they are interlinked.  I have no doubt walking the streets.  I came through town fairly late on Friday night, on Talbot Street and thereabouts, and it is all over the place.</p> <p>  There is another aspect, of people who have come into this country from direct provision and other countries who are very vulnerable.  They are vulnerable to abuse, addiction, sexual abuse and exploitation.  These are our most vulnerable people on our streets and you only need to take a walk on any of our streets to see them.  What I am asking Ms Timmons and Ms Hayes is that they focus on youth and addiction and how we can better improve facilities and outcomes for these highly vulnerable people, most of whom end up homeless.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Timmons" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#F01100"><p>Senator Boyhan is making really important points there.  In fact, the youth homelessness strategy is one of the things we discussed yesterday at the national homeless action committee.  We will be focusing in the first aeration of that committee on two important points, namely, what more we can do on prevention and the national youth homelessness strategy.  You will see that we are aiming to have that done quickly and we are working with our various partnerships, such as the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Tusla and the local authorities.</p> <p>  Part of preparing that strategy will involve consultation.  There will be a consultation process with the regional leads, the Departments of Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Tusla, the national advisory committee for the teen parents support programme and Hub na n&Oacute;g.  Obviously, we want to hear from the youth themselves as to what they perceive to be the barriers in terms of coming into homeless accommodation and being prevented from going into homeless accommodation in the first place.</p><p>I agree it is very important for care leavers in particular - those who experience vulnerabilities in their youth - that we have a particular plan for them to progress onwards.  Housing First is part of that.  Our CAS programme is also to provide accommodation for care leavers and is a game-changer in that respect.  AHBs working with care leavers or those who have had contact with the juvenile justice system can be particularly important.  In respect of that, we should have a fully formed strategy by the end of May.  That is what we are aiming for at the moment.</p><p> The point on addiction was apt.  There is a commitment in Housing for All around integrated care pathways and making sure there is an individualised care plan for each person.  The HSE and the Department of Health are very committed to the work on that.  They have appointed a national clinical lead for dual diagnosis where there are both addiction and mental health difficulties.  That is going to be very important as they develop their model of care in collaboration with others.</p></speech>

Sadly, we probably do not have housing for everybody.  There are young people who have left care who are homeless but at least there is that mechanism and that co-working which was not there previously.  On addiction, I pay tribute to my colleagues in the HSE who have supported us enormously, particularly with putting in addiction and support services into private emergency accommodation, which we did not have heretofore, as well as putting in training.</p></speech>

I appreciate their work in the area.  My question is for the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE.  On the inspections by Dublin Fire Brigade, of which it stated 20% resulted in works to bring the accommodation up to standard in terms of fire safety compliance, should inspections not have taken place before people moved in to ensure all accommodation Dublin City Council or DRHE is contracting is fire-safety compliant before anyone moves in?  Were any hostels or accommodation shut down on foot of those inspections?</p></speech>

I do not have the breakdown of the works.  In some properties, remedial works were required.  In some cases, the properties Dublin Fire Brigade selected were ones it had not reviewed in quite some time.  It was going in prior to the request but it is just that it put a special focus on it during that period of time.  It would normally have been reviewing-----</p></speech>

It depends on the building's current use.  The deputy chief executive gathered a comprehensive response to this question last March at the council meeting.  Prior to the building regulations coming in in 1992, and if the use did not change or it remained in hospitality or as a hostel, the property may not have a fire certificate.  That is a very important point because not everyone gets that.  Subsequently, when you do works, make material changes, build an extension or have a change of use, if a building has no fire certificate, it will trigger the need for a new fire certificate or a regularisation certificate if that has not taken place since the regulations came in in 1992.  The Deputy is asking a very technical question and the response is very nuanced.  To be clear, that is not the case in every property or in all properties in all parts of Dublin or the country.</p></speech>

If you were contracting purely for a building, you would set out your standards for the building so then you are looking at cost and location.  They are the kind of factors we take into account in regard to pure emergency accommodation.  Sometimes there is an issue in regard to services where we may build up award criteria, where we are forced to look for value for money.  We would build up our award higher scoring points to the quality - for example, where you are trying to discern between the quality of one tender and another.  Therefore, your award criteria has to be specified from the outset when you are tendering.  People would know that when you are tendering.</p></speech>

I would ask members when reading them to bear in mind that it is a starting point.  I was involved in drafting the standards in 2014 and I have a slightly different perspective on the decision.  At the time we did not think we would be relying on private emergency accommodation so our perspective back then was a shared process with the NGOs.  The NGOs had developed their own bespoke standards and we wanted to standardise the standards across emergency accommodation.  Back then we were really talking about NGO providers and we had a residual use of private accommodation that we had hoped to move out of.  We did not anticipate back then the requirements for private emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

It is great to hear that bed and breakfasts no longer need to be used.  We know Waterford is leading the way in terms of delivering those one- and two-bed units, under its repair and lease scheme which has provided long-term solutions for people who were homeless.  I very much welcome the Department&rsquo;s commitment to ending homelessness by 2030.  I support Senator John Cummins on his point that the Housing for All implementation plan needs to include targets on schemes such as repair and lease, and the tackling of vacancy and dereliction because this can play a role in long-term solutions for people who are homeless.  My main comments are going to centre around Dublin and are for Ms Hayes more than anyone else.  That is because I am a Dublin Deputy and the people who come to me looking for advice due to fear of homelessness or who have found themselves homeless, end up receiving support for her organisation.</p><p>I thank Ms Hayes and all her team for all they do to support people in homelessness and for progressing so many of the actions that we as a committee set out in our report on tackling homelessness.  In particular, I welcome their updates on the inspection of facilities, the fact all families the DRHE deals with now have an assigned key worker and the fact single adults now have access to housing support workers.  That is critical and it is an issue that has been raised with us time and again in committee.  It arises also with the families we all deal with.</p><p> I welcome Ms Hayes&rsquo;s assurance that no one is being denied access to emergency accommodation because of the local authority area or the county he or she comes from, an issue that was uncovered by "RT&Eacute; Investigates".  It is great that is no longer an issue on the ground.  She stated 4,923 families had been prevented from entering homelessness through the creation of alternative tenancies in the Dublin region over the past three years.  That is a real success.  I for one am grateful these tenancies are there to support people who might otherwise find themselves homeless, a point that was raised earlier.  They might not be in line with everyone's political ideology but they are a practical measure and intervention that prevents people from ending up homeless, which is the shared goal of all of us.</p><p> I would like to learn a little more about the reasons Ms Hayes identified, and the trends around them, for homelessness among people presenting in the Dublin region.  She had previously identified relationship breakdowns and the ending of leases as the two main causes of homelessness, and earlier in this meeting she outlined the example of families arriving from abroad with nowhere to stay.  Will she give a little more information on those trends?  I do not know whether it is possible to quantify this in percentages, but to what extent are those three categories the driving forces for people ending up in homelessness?  Is the ending of leases still as big an issue as it was before the pandemic?</p></speech>

Family homelessness and single homelessness tend to be different issues and we have seen two different trend lines.  Single homelessness has climbed relentlessly in one direction, whereas family homelessness in December 2021 had fallen by about 40% since the peak in 2018.  There was definitely a fall-off in the number of families presenting from private rented accommodation or due to a notice of termination situation during the moratoriums.</p> <p>  We did not see the same trend in single homelessness, which leads me to believe it is really an issue relating to access to affordable accommodation.  Cases often involve presentations from the family home or institutions or they may be migrant workers.  They may have some work but they may not be able to afford housing, or they may be in housing in a sharing arrangement or overcrowding, for example, and fall out of it.  That is a trend in regard to single accommodation.</p> <p>  As for families, there used to be a fairly even split between the number of issues relating to family or relationship breakdown, a small but significant volume of domestic violence, and notices of termination.  Increasingly in recent years, there have been more presentations of families accessing low-paid work or looking for work who exercise their rights as EU mobile citizens to work in Ireland, so we have seen an increase in that context in the Dublin region.</p></speech>

I think this is Ms Hayes's first full appearance before our committee.  She will find we are very friendly.  I wish her the very best in what is a very demanding job, as I am sure she knows much better than the rest of us.</p><p>I had the pleasure of visiting Waterford and seeing the centralised hub.  It is a really good model, so I commend the good work of Ms Breathnach and her team.</p><p>My questions are for Ms Timmons.  We know from her presentation and from the figures last month that, while there was a slight dip between December 2020 to December 2021, the general trend is upwards.  Part of what seems to be driving that trend is a significant increase in the past six months in the number of landlords issuing vacant possession notices to quit and more family presentations.  At the same time, there are fewer rental properties because of those sales.  The main worry I have is that the Department issued a circular last week that prevents, among other things, local authorities from purchasing properties that have housing assistance payment, HAP, or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenants in them despite the fact they could then face a notice to quit and be at risk of homelessness.  I fully understand why the Department does not want local authorities to be in open competition with private purchasers for vacant properties with for-sale signs, but it makes no sense at a time of rising family homelessness to remove the ability of a local authority to prevent a family from becoming homeless by purchasing that property if a HAP or RAS tenant is <i>in situ</i>and the other criteria are met.  Is that something the Department will reconsider, particularly given the likelihood that the number of family homelessness presentations will increase?</p><p>Many of us were surprised when we saw the new Housing First targets.  The target of 50 additional tenancies a year is far too low.  I suspect that if the Department had a private conversation with NGOs or homelessness service providers in the regions, they would say that if the targets had been based on need, they would have been closer to 400 or 500.  What metric was used to determine that figure of an additional 50 and how will the Department determine how they are allocated?</p><p>My next question follows on from one that Deputy Andrews asked.  Local authorities are not refusing people on habitual residency condition, HRC, grounds at the moment, but in part that is because they have the cold weather initiative, which will end in April.  All the local authorities, as I understand it, are waiting to know what the outcome of deliberations between the Department of Justice and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be for guidance on what happens.  In cases where a local authority is availing of the cold weather initiative and there are people in a property, rightly but not habitually resident, perhaps if they are Irish people from the area of a different local authority or people from outside of the State, what will be the guidance from the Department to the local authorities?  April is fast approaching and there are quite a number of those HRC cases.</p><p>My final question relates to inspections.  Did the Department actively consider HIQA as the independent inspection body?  I am sure Ms Hayes and her team would love not to have to worry about carrying out inspections.  They developed a really good-quality standards framework.  Would it not be better for an already-existing independent body to carry out inspections of both the public and private sectors?  I appreciate HIQA at a board level discussed how there would need to be a change of legislation and some additional resourcing, but would it not make more sense?  The service providers could then get on with providing services, with an independent inspection regime.</p></speech>

It sets out the criteria against which a local authority can purchase.  It means that if a local authority has a property with a HAP or a RAS tenant, where previously it would purchase the property to prevent the family from becoming homeless when a vacant possession notice to quit had issued, this circular prevents that from happening.  While that had previously been prevented from happening by an earlier decision, the circular that issued last week will not allow a director of housing or of homelessness services to proceed with an acquisition of such a property.  It relates to various types of vacant property, including disability adapted.  Given this practice was a crucial way for local authorities to prevent some levels of family homelessness, surely it should have been included as permissible in the circular.</p></speech>

If the Department is now saying an occupied property of any size with a HAP or RAS tenant who has a vacant possession notice to quit and who is at risk of homelessness could be purchased, that would be very valuable.  If Ms Timmons could clarify that it would be great.  Maybe she could come back on the HRC and the other questions in writing, if possible.</p></speech>

When somebody receives a notice to quit, there are other options to try to maintain the tenancy, which is our preference, before there is a need to consider the acquisition.  We are asking local authorities to not automatically go to an acquisition because of a notice to quit but if that tenant falls into one of the priority categories then that can be considered as an acquisition by the Department.</p></speech>

I have some other questions but this is a really important issue.  I thank Mr. Durkan, Ms Hayes, Ms Timmons and Ms Tobin for coming in.  This meeting is meant to be one of a series.  Ending homelessness by 2030 is a key priority for the Government and for this committee.  We made it one of our first priorities by producing the report and we are committed to reviewing progress.  It is not about policing the work of our guests in whom we have absolute confidence; it is about ensuring things are progressing.</p> <p>  On the matter of acquisitions by local authorities to prevent homelessness, the language of a circular can be very far removed from the reality of the lived experience of the individuals.  I can think of countless cases in the last number of years where Dublin City Council has been in a position to respond to a family about to become homeless.  Such families have been on the housing list for seven, eight or nine years, have children but are not at the top of the housing list because the list is quite long.  They have a notice to quit and will be going into emergency accommodation.  The way that was prevented, when we had a decade of undersupply and under-construction of housing, was by the local authority buying the house where the landlord agrees to it.  That is not the ideal solution.  All our guests have said as much today.  Housing for All is committed to the State leading on the building of housing and delivering 300,000 homes over the next number of years.  That is what we need to get to.  I am delighted to hear political unanimity here that in the short term, it must be a combination of measures with one being the acquisition of homes.  I would like the Department officials to come back and clarify that in a circular to us afterwards.  It is really important the local authorities understand it is a criterion that allows them purchase a home where a landlord wants to sell and when the family is otherwise going to go into homelessness.  The whole committee and the local authorities would appreciate that clarification.</p> <p>  I have a specific question for Ms Hayes on the Dublin presentations and the homeless numbers in that.  It is great the family numbers are down by 40% since 2018 but we still have a big way to go.  My first question is on the causes of homelessness.  I heard what she said about relationship breakdown and coming out of care.  How many cases of homelessness, or what percentage, does she think are being caused by illegal evictions?  Has she any idea?</p></speech>

We use the Threshold service because its staff are the experts in that field.  They take up any case where they feel a notice is not valid.</p></speech>

That is really reassuring to hear and we encourage everybody to engage with Threshold.</p> <p>  On achieving the target of ending homelessness by 2030, we know about the 90,000 social house builds that are committed to, funded and which the local authorities are obviously gearing up to achieve but in the short term, what are we going to do?  Is there sufficient supply there in the short term?  The reality is, as well all know, it takes two or three years, at best, to build new homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#J01400"><p>I have a concern about the short term in the sense that it is very important.  That is why I have an openness on this point.  I am almost tenure-neutral when it comes to having alternatives to emergency accommodation, as I said earlier, because we must bridge that gap between now and supply coming online.  I am confident supply will increase this year.  I am aware secure tenure is the option preferred by everyone here for social housing and that is what we aim for but we still strongly encourage uptake of homeless HAP in the city because we do not want a build-up of people waiting for a social housing letting within emergency accommodation.  We have often been asked why we are so encouraging of homeless HAP and encouraging people to take it up.  The alternative is homelessness which, apart from the expense, has a human cost.  We are far happier to build up supports around a family in a community-based service, whether it is HAP, leasing or social housing.  I recognise social housing is most people's preferred choice.  It is not everybody's.  Not so much with homelessness but with the general housing list, we see huge interest in HAP uptake across the city, where there is not necessarily huge desire for social housing in the long term.  In homelessness you see the opposite.  Where people have been through and have concerns they definitely prefer social housing options.  I hope it will come on board.  I hope HAP will continue to deliver for us in the short term.</p></speech>

We then have a Fianna F&aacute;il and a Fine Gael slot.  That will complete the cycle and I propose we then go to those still in the room.  I have indications from Deputies &Oacute; Broin, Cian O'Callaghan, Andrews and Senator Fitzpatrick.  We will divide the remaining time between them after the cycle is complete.  I wanted to let everybody know what I am doing and that I am not making it up.  That being the case, the next speaker is myself.</p> <p>  Remaining with Ms Hayes, we talked about single person homelessness.  I raise emergency accommodation.  There is an issue with emergency accommodation for people who do not have a substance issue.  People, especially if they are single, are very fearful about taking up any sort of emergency accommodation because it just is not a suitable environment for them.  I ask Ms Hayes to talk about the steps the DRHE has taken to try to provide that accommodation.  There is a sort of chilling factor there where people are in very unsatisfactory situations because they cannot avail of emergency accommodation, which seems to me like a complete oxymoron, if Ms Hayes does not mind my saying so.</p></speech>

I will start with some of the prevention work we have done in the executive.  Not just in the DRHE but with the council we have decided older person homelessness is not something we want to see.  We do not want to see older people coming into emergency accommodation and maybe having to share with a younger cohort where addiction is an issue.  In those cases, we have built into our scheme of lettings a prevention approach where if we have older persons' accommodation or senior citizens' accommodation that we can go for an overall priority and immediately house those people.  I accept that is not covering everybody and there is still a huge cohort of people whose needs we are not meeting.</p> <p>  On prevention, there are the prevention officers.  The year before last, the Department gave us extra funding for housing support officers for single people.  The officers' focus is on trying to acquire HAP and try to build up relationships, as well as to supplement the social housing offering we have.</p><p>Members will see fairly strong, consistent results in terms of our lettings to single adults experiencing homelessness.  It is certainly a priority for us in Dublin because we are aware that we have never made a dent in that huge number or changed the curve in respect of single adults experiencing homelessness.</p><p> It is hard for me to say that we are able to separate all hostels.  There are hostels and places available for people who do not have addiction issues.  Sometimes people will say they do not have any addiction issues, go into accommodation and, subsequently, addiction issues become apparent and we have to move them out of the accommodation.  I would say, however, that we have a good turnover in the accommodation we have, but perhaps we need more of it.  As part of the homeless action plan in Dublin, we will look at whether we should segregate the accommodation we have a bit more and create some more drug-free spaces if we can.  We have done that.  The Peter McVerry Trust and Crosscare have developed some excellent services for us, just as the other services have developed really good low-threshold services, which are also important for people who are in the full throes of their addiction and need quite an amount of support.</p></speech>

For example, a middle-aged man or woman with young children may just not feel safe going into emergency accommodation.  He or she could be staying with a brother or his or her mother and therefore would find it very difficult to access the housing market.  We know that homeless HAP is one of the key ways for people to access the higher rate of HAP.  If people in such circumstances cannot access the homeless HAP, they cannot access HAP as a solution and therefore cannot provide a secure environment where they can enjoy full custody of the children in their care.  I go back to the point that by not having access to emergency accommodation, people are locked out of a solution that they would be very much willing to adopt.  They are not able to get on the first rung of the ladder because, as they tell me all the time, they feel they would not survive in emergency accommodation where there are high levels of substance misuse.</p></speech>

We are constantly under pressure.  The Deputy must remember that we are up against it as it is as regards rehousing homeless people.  There is an incentive.  We try to use the incentives we have for people who are actually homeless.  If people have an alternative place to stay, it might not give them full independence but their need is perhaps not as critical as that of someone else who is sleeping in a doorway or sharing accommodation with other people.  I understand that people want us to open to everybody all the incentives available under the homeless HAP scheme.  Unfortunately, if we were to do that, we would lose their bonus or use for people who are actually experiencing homelessness now.  I remind the Deputy that in the Dublin context, there are beds.  The Iveagh Trust has contacted us at times to tell us there are beds.  There are organisations that we work with and occasionally beds are available.  I do not want to paint too rosy a picture of any of the issues I have discussed.  The picture is far from rosy.  We have huge work to do and we know it.  I am providing members with an update on the recommendations.  The challenges remain and they are certainly there for single people.</p></speech>

I suppose the question is not whether someone has alternative accommodation.  On a short-term basis, many people can access some accommodation but it is not a sustainable or long-term option.  It is called sofa-surfing for a reason.  The real difficulty in cases of marital breakdown is that what often happens is the parent who does not have primary custody is never able to become established in an independent residence with HAP because he or she can never access homeless HAP as there is no safe place to go to access emergency accommodation.  That is a real gap in the system.  It is having a real impact on many parents and their children, particularly fathers and their children.</p></speech>

He was very clear that the circular issued to local authorities was a way of reiterating to county councils that acquisitions cannot be an alternative to building.  What we do not want is local authorities buying up <i>en masse</i>three and four bedroom homes that would otherwise be available to first-time buyers.  Local authorities should not be doing that.  There is a balance that we need to strike.  That balance is that local authorities should be able to purchase homes where there is a tenant <i>in situ</i>who will otherwise end up homeless, there is a need to improve the stock of a particular type of home, for example, one-bedroom apartments, or there is a specific need to deliver more homes that are accessible from a disability perspective.  It is my understanding that this is what that circular sets out to achieve.  I know we spoke a little about this but it would be useful if more clarity could be provided.</p></speech>

What the circular is outlining is where those priority acquisitions are.  This is very much units that are difficult for the local authorities to source otherwise, such as one-bedroom units for single people, particularly for Housing First, units for larger families who it can be very difficult to exit from emergency accommodation and units that are specifically adapted for a person with a disability or another priority need that cannot be dealt with from the normal social housing stock.  We are trying to focus and target where that money is really needed for acquisitions, and otherwise move local authorities away to build from acquisitions.</p></speech>

Just to be clear, does the circular prevent a local authority from intervening, for example, in the case of a person who is in a HAP tenancy and whose accommodation is being sold?  Does it prevent the local authority from purchasing that property to add it to its stock?</p></speech>

My understanding is that Dublin City Council has a policy on purchase in those circumstances.  The circular does not directly address whether Dublin City Council should or should not do that.  What we have said is that in the case of a particular priority circumstance, if the local authority wishes to use some of its allocations for those particular purposes, it is entitled to seek to do so.  We have not specifically determined, in or out, whether that can be done in the particular circumstance the Deputy raised.  However, there is an ability to look at that.  Obviously, the whole point of it is to keep the acquisitions for those particular priority categories.  It is designed to militate against local authorities competing with first-time buyers in the market or approved housing bodies, which is something people have been strongly advocating.  It is trying to do the right thing in that respect, focusing on the build.  In those particular circumstances, in which we very much recognise that there might be vulnerable households, we are also trying to protect them insofar as we can with the limited number of acquisitions we can do.  The intention is certainly to so something good for those categories and not to injure, as it were, any ability to help them out.  I think that is the full expression of the circular.  If there is a need to provide a clarification, we are happy to do so.  We will come back to the committee on that particular point.</p></speech>

A pot of money has been allocated to acquire properties where it makes sense to do so.  We could be waiting for one and four bedroom properties to come up and, at the same time, we could be allowing families to go into emergency accommodation when they are in properties that meet their needs and will prevent them from going into homelessness.  We must be very clear that there is no confusion at local authority level on that issue.  It is just too important.  It makes no sense to be adding housing stock, on the one hand, while allowing people to drift into homelessness, on the other.  There is a huge cost.  I am not talking about the financial cost but the emotional, social and psychological costs to individuals and families, including their extended families and communities, of becoming homeless.  That must be clarified.  There should not be any hesitation at local authority level.</p><p>Will Ms Timmons tell us what has been done to prevent young people leaving care and entering homelessness?  Young people are in care for a reason, namely, because they need care.  Just because they turn 19 it should not become a case of one day to the next.  Humanity is not like that.  What is being done to prevent that cliff-edge transition from care to homelessness?</p></speech>

This does not mean it is not already being addressed at some level on the ground.  Members will be aware that as a person exits care at the age of 18, he or she is supposed to have follow-on care plan up to the age of 23 if he or she is still in education.  The person's social worker and guardian <i>ad litem</i>are supposed to make that follow-on the care plan.  The aspect of housing should be part of that.  If the person coming out of care needs accommodation, then prior to leaving care he or she should already been linked in with the local authority and an application should have been made on their behalf.  At the local authority level, we have tools to link them in with the supports they require.  There is quite a bit of good work there, but this does not mean that we have it all figured out.  We absolutely acknowledge that the development of the youth homelessness strategy will be very important to make sure there are no gaps in what we are doing, to make sure that everybody is on the same page, and that a collaborative focus is brought to what needs to be done.  Good work is going on but we certainly will be drawing it altogether so it is more obvious by way of the strategy, and we will be seeing if anything else needs to be brought into that.  Perhaps Ms Hayes would like to add to that.</p></speech>

In the short time allowed, perhaps Ms Timmons could come back to me on the HRC, the cold weather initiative and the metrics for the Housing First target.  That would be useful.</p> <p>  I want to belabour the issue about the circular, because I believe it is important.  I want to make two points.  I have the circular here in front of me and there are three priority categories.  The first is for one-bedroom units delivered on Housing First to meet the short supply in this category.  The implication is that it would be a vacant property for a Housing First allocation.  The second category is other properties that would allow families to exit homelessness, and the implication here is that it is a vacant property.  The third category is specific housing required that is suitable for individuals with a disability and other particular priority needs.  All of this is consistent with the Minister's call for housing from August two years ago, which was looking for a vacant properties.  We have a particularly acute problem, which is written in the past couple of months.  If one looks at the DRHE report, the longer December report shows a very significant fall back in exits for families last year than in the two previous years.  Some of this is because there were fewer families in emergency accommodation, which is good, and some of it is a supply issue.  There absolutely must be a fourth bullet point in that circular which is, where in the opinion of a local authority a HAP or a RAS tenant is at risk of homelessness because of a vacant possession notice to quit, then the local authority should be empowered to pursue an acquisition.</p> <p>  Here is the problem: if a person receives a three-month notice to quit, are we suggesting that we should send the family off for two months to look for an alternative housing assistance payments tenancy, and when they do not find it maybe then the council would start talking to the Department and the dead hand of the four-stage approval process for acquisitions, in terms of trying to get an acquisition through?  We want to avoid the spiralling of family homelessness beyond the numbers we had in 2018.  This one small measure would be very key.  I fully agree with Deputy Higgins that it is not about allowing local authorities to purchase properties that are on the open market and vacant for buyers.  They should not be touched.  This would be a very specific cohort.  I would urge the Minister to look at that.  Last year in the South Dublin County Council area, we had a bizarre situation with 80 properties, nearly all of which were second-hand homes in private residential suburbs.  The bulk of those occupying them had been HAP tenants and they were issued with notices to quit.  HAP tenants were put out and the houses were put on the market. Who is now buying them?  It is small-scale institutional investors who are now leasing them long-term back to the local authority.  This is bad for first-time buyers and bad for the original HAP tenants who were evicted.  This urgently needs to be looked at and particularly in light of the rising homelessness figures.  I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

As a priority for our Department, everybody must have a humanitarian attitude to people who need accommodation.  It is imperative that someone who requires shelter and needs a roof over their head is dealt with as a person first, rather than looking at the particular situation.  If the person does not fulfil the requirements we have in relation to social housing eligibility, the question is what happens to them then.  We are talking to Department of Justice about this.  We do need to figure this out and I do not believe that we have settled on quite exactly how that policy should be dealt with.  We would like to bring some clarity into that area in the near future.  It could help everybody to understand what way we are going to deal with that going forward.</p></speech>

I have not been able to find the standards for the private emergency accommodation on the website.  The witness said they were published but I cannot find them.  I can find the reference from 2009 in the national quality standards saying that these would be for all providers.  That is very clearly on the website but I cannot find the new standards that were referred to.  It is important when one looks at the previous inspections and compare the questions for the NGOs and the not-for-profits for the inspections; it is some 15 pages in the document and it is quite thorough.  The private emergency accommodation providers was a questionnaire of one page and a few lines, which was incredibly minimal checking with only the absolute basics.  Are there different questionnaires for the inspections?  Has that been done yet and can we see that questionnaire?  One can get quite a lot of information from the inspection questionnaire.  Has that work been done yet?</p></speech>

Our website is being revamped.  It was put up there but it might be difficult to find.  I assure the Deputy that it is available and we are happy to send it to you.  That is not an issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that there was a huge disparity between the inspections previously.  It must be borne in mind however that the physical inspections are done by the inspectorate who would provide reports to us on all services, whether they are NGO or private emergency accommodation providers.  Those inspectorate reports will be based on environmental health standards, fire standards, and hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP standards.  That is what the independent inspectorate will do.  With the private emergency accommodation PEA we are building up to replicate what the quality standards team due currently in the NGOs.  They will be doing the exact same type of questionnaire with the care and case management teams that are going in on an in-reach basis into the PEAs.  As the standards develop, around things such as whether people feel respected, and consultations with staff and clients within PEA services, that will become normalised as part of the roll-out of the quality standards.  Our quality standards team would be asking those questions of residents within private emergency accommodation.  At the moment, for part of that we are relying complaints, but we want to get more proactive and be testing that in the same way we would with an NGO.</p></speech>

There have been some terrible complaints from very vulnerable people in some privately-run emergency accommodation.  It is not that we do not have a fit-for-purpose inspection regime; it is that there is no inspection regime in place at the moment.  It is critical that HIQA is appointed to do that.  The Department did not give any view on recommendation 5 in its opening statement.  I ask for a written response from the Department as regards whether HIQA should be appointed to such a role.  Ms Timmons said she would get back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin about whether that is being considered but I would like a detailed response on the Department's view.  Does the Department think it is a good idea?  If not, why not?  It would be helpful to understand that.  I certainly think that is what needs to be done and that many of these issues around quality and standards would be sorted out if HIQA were appointed to do the inspections.</p></speech>

I will pass them on.  Ms Breathnach and I can both talk about this issue.  As I have said, our assessment is not immediate and is open-ended.  Our concern in Dublin is that we do not want to become the only place developing homeless services.  We need to ensure that services are still developed close to where people are from and where they are becoming homeless from.  That is different from when someone is in Dublin for a long time, although we do not quantify it in terms of years.  If someone is in Dublin and for whatever reason they are not going back home, we do an assessment, which might involve checking with the local authority of origin.  That is about making sure someone is making a full and informed decision.  If someone is giving up after a few years on a housing list somewhere else, we want that person to realise exactly how long they will be waiting for an offer of social housing from Dublin City Council if they start at the bottom of the list with us.  Those are some of the things we do.  It is important for us to do that because we do not want people to just drift into homelessness.  We are also very conscious of the drug issue.  There is a drug culture in Dublin city and there is risk there.  We have to bear all those factors in mind and decide if someone is at greater risk coming in.  Of course we try to prevent that and say to people to keep their natural supports if they have them, but notwithstanding that, people will come to Dublin and will need accommodation in Dublin from other local authorities.  It takes a little back and forth but most of that is assuring ourselves that the person is in full possession of the facts before they come to Dublin and before we accept them onto our housing list.</p></speech>

As regional leads, we ensure there is open communication between us and that we contact each other if we have somebody out of region within our homeless services.  We also utilise the inter-county HAP.  If somebody from Waterford was to go to Dublin, we would support them in Waterford to get a HAP property in Dublin and the supports would come from the originating local authority.  That is operating well throughout all the regions.</p></speech>

In my experience in Waterford, there is a difficulty because the HAP limits are artificially low and we can only have a 20% uplift whereas in Dublin it can go to 50%.  That is causing quite a problem.  When the Minister visited the integrated hub in Waterford he said he was considering the matter, and he is on record in the House saying the same.  What is Ms Breathnach's view on that issue?  I would also ask Ms Timmons what action is being taken to address it.</p></speech>

Outside the Dublin region, our HAP discretionary increase is 20% and not 50%.  At the moment the affordability gap between the actual rents and the HAP rates, especially for single people, is too wide.  Even with that increase and reducing the differential rent we cannot close that gap.  It is blocking a lot of our hostels and STAs at the moment.  There have been few or no move-ons for single people in the past 12 to 18 months because of this factor.  We have requested that the 50% discretionary rate be rolled out nationally and I understand a review of that has been carried out so we hope to hear from that shortly.</p></speech>

As members of the committee are aware, the second half of 2021 saw an alarming trend of increasing homelessness.  The housing situation of too many people is insecure, due to rising rents in an already unaffordable private rental market and the impact of the growing cost of living, so the committee's reflection on where we are with homelessness framed through the April 2021 report, is both timely and welcome.  In reviewing the progress made on the 17 recommendations made in the committee's report, we are conscious that Housing for All has since been launched.  The commitments in Housing for All mirror many of the recommendations outlined in the committee&rsquo;s report.  We have acknowledged that in our submission to the committee, which members hopefully received.  In the submission, we have responded to each of the 17 recommendations.  I do not intend to go through all 17 of them.</p> <p>  I particularly welcome the commitment in the Housing for All plan to work towards ending homelessness by 2030.  The ambition of the plan for the 2030 target builds on the successful collaborations that happened as we worked to ensure those experiencing homelessness were protected during the pandemic.  The ongoing commitment to Housing First and to the strengthening of integrated care pathways, and case management for people experiencing homelessness is equally welcome.  The development, enhancement and successful implementation of these recommendations over the coming months will be critically important.</p> <p>  Areas that we want to raise which are pertinent to the recommendation of the committee, which need a particular focus, include homelessness prevention.  We need a greater focus on homelessness prevention.  Emergency accommodation is a vital service required to meet people&rsquo;s immediate and urgent need for accommodation, but it is possible to stop homelessness from happening before it starts.  The moratorium on evictions is a prime example of a homelessness prevention measure that successfully reduced family homelessness in Ireland, or at least significantly contributed to it.  Increased funding and planning are required to implement nationwide homelessness prevention measures post Covid.  State interventions and prevention strategies need to be prioritised if we are to eradicate homelessness in Ireland.  Committee members will be aware that, as part of our work in this area, we developed the Simon homeless prevention Bill, which has received significant cross-party support.  We hope the committee will be involved in seeing that implemented in the coming months.</p> <p>  As set out in our submission, the Simon Communities of Ireland welcome the continued commitment to Housing First in Housing for All.  However, we believe that that there is both the need and scope for greater ambition in the west and south west in particular.  They are areas where Housing First has been successful, but we feel that there could be more ambition, particularly in those areas.  In the longer term, we would like to see Housing First be the foundation of a strategy for how we respond to homelessness and housing-led solutions.</p> <p>  The committee will be well aware that HAP rates and discretion of local authorities is an issue that the Simon Communities of Ireland has been focused on for some time.  Our Locked Out of the Market report found very low levels of rental accommodation available, even when discretion is used to its maximum.  There needs to be greater discretion for local authorities to support people to get out of homelessness and to prevent people from getting into homelessness.  It has worked well in the Dublin region in particular.  I think Ms Mary Hayes just highlighted that.  One thing that we and others around the table are seeing is that the level of topping up is endemic.  Combined with the inflation for staples such as bread and milk, people are being forced into homelessness.  That is a whistle-stop tour of our report.  If members are interested in any individual recommendations, I am happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

To avoid taking up the time of the committee with a long description of the work that Focus Ireland does or the unique approach we take, we have included links to our most recent annual report and to our strategic plan in our submission.</p> <p>  Since the publication of the committee's report last year, the Government has published its Housing For All strategy.  From our perspective, the most significant words in the strategy are its endorsement of the Lisbon declaration in the context of working with other EU countries to end homelessness by 2030.  We are aware the strategy does not set out exactly how this objective is to be met but we do not consider this to be a criticism.  Focus Ireland campaigned for such a commitment.  We not only welcome it but we are also fully committed to working to achieve it and to working with Government and Opposition to identify what this will require.</p> <p>  We have argued that the next step should be to set out a series of milestones along the path to 2030 with detailed plans about how the first of these are to be achieved.  Before Christmas we sent the committee a booklet of drawings made by children who, with their families, are homeless and whom we support.  These drawings contained a clear message imploring the committee to ensure that ending child homelessness becomes one of our first milestones.  We strongly recommend that the next report on homelessness from this committee should seek to identify the milestones to 2030 and how they are to be reached.</p> <p>  It might be helpful to see the pathway to 2030 in terms of three three-year stages.  In doing so, we realise that very few people who are homeless now will be homeless in three years, and very few people homeless tonight will be homeless in three years.  This points us towards measures which will prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place.  Hearings for the committee&rsquo;s previous report coincided with a time when the Covid-related moratorium on evictions was coming to an end.  Professor Eoin O&rsquo;Sullivan noted the significant impact that the termination of tenancies in the private rental sector had on homelessness, notably leading to the lowest ever numbers of new entries into emergency accommodation by April 2020.  The report also noted, based on Focus Ireland research, that the termination of tenancies in the private rental sector was the biggest driver of numbers into emergency accommodation.  Regrettably, the Government did not adopt the committee's recommendation 1 to extend the eviction embargo, resulting in a new wave of family homelessness.</p> <p>  In our view, there is little point in continuing to call for something the Government has so resolutely set itself against but the problem continues, forcing families into homelessness daily, so we must find other ways to deal with it.  We agree with the Government that a balance needs to be struck between the rights of tenants and those of landlords.  We believe that the Government has consistently got this balance wrong, introducing measures the do little to increase the security of tenants and that create anxiety and frustration among small landlords.  We believe that a major effort is now required to ensure, at the very least, that landlords who plan to leave the market delay their decision by a number of years.  We are happy to discuss these proposals further.</p> <p>  The committee's report identified the gap between the maximum HAP and the level of market rents as a major problem in recommendation 4.  This gap has widened in the intervening months.  HAP levels were last adjusted in 2016.  Since then, the Residential Tenancies Board's rent index has risen by 30% from &euro;1,060 to &euro;1,397.  HAP tenants attempt to close this gap from their already inadequate income from employment or social welfare.  We want to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that tenants offered the social housing solution of HAP are treated entirely differently and much more harshly than tenants in actual social housing.  This is resulting in entirely avoidable evictions and indebted returns to homelessness.  It also further disaffects landlords.  We have made proposals to tackle this, which we will be happy to discuss further.</p> <p>  The committee's report correctly identified the importance of Housing First in tackling homeless in its recommendation 3.  At the end of last year, the Government published the second housing first implementation plan.  We welcome this plan and the establishment of the new housing first office in the Housing Agency but believe the current approach to housing first is too narrow.  We believe the achievements of Finland arise from ensuring that housing first principles inform the entire housing and homelessness system.  We would be happy to discuss this area, and the need for one-bedroom units as outlined in recommendation 4.</p> <p>  We commend the committee's recommendation 8 on trauma-informed practice.  Recent research commissioned by Focus Ireland and the Housing Agency, on domestic violence and homelessness called for staff in all relevant service sectors, including homelessness, domestic violence, and housing, regardless of their position or prior training, to be trained in basic trauma knowledge to ensure their interactions with survivors are trauma informed.  This report is very relevant to the forthcoming strategy on gender-based violence.  Focus Ireland advocates strongly for a trauma-informed approach to service provision.  Trauma-informed care is part of our organisational strategy.  We have an extensive training programme in trauma-informed practice for all our staff and we recently appointed a head of practice development to ensure this approach, along with a psychologically informed environment and the housing first principals, inform all our work.</p></speech>

We offered continuous, sit-in services throughout Covid, seven days a week and late into the winter evenings.  Our priority group are those sleeping outside and those accessing hostel accommodation where there are no supports.  In 1852, the Mendicity Institution opened the first public baths in Dublin and from April 2020 and throughout the pandemic the Mendicity Institution offered the only shower in the city to those sleeping outside when we were all told to stay at home and wash our hands.  These are impossible to do together for too many.  During this short period in history, we said a final goodbye to nine people who used our service, arranging more than our fair share of funerals.  We are sure there were others for whom we did not have the opportunity to mark their passing as there is no system in place to share such information.  If death is a part of life then people who are homeless are consistently being denied the opportunity to grieve with dignity.</p> <p>  This submission intends to address some of the 17 recommendations of the April 2021 interim report on homelessness.  It addresses those that speak to our expertise, focusing on those accessing private emergency accommodation and their experience of it.  As referred to in recommendation 4, we rarely have an opportunity to work towards a housing assistance payment and a tenancy on the open market because when we asked we were told that of 105 homeless people at Mendicity, all accessing private emergency accommodation and none of whom are on a housing list with a local authority, 92% were ineligible.  There is no housing for them, which is a stumble at the first step.  Without access to a social housing waiting list we cannot look to the housing assistance payment as an exit.</p> <p>  The 200 or so individuals who access Mendicity every week depend largely on private emergency accommodation where the national quality standards do not apply.  This is mentioned in recommendation 11.  Although many regulatory standards exist none are applied, including those of HIQA, as referred to in recommendation 5, the Charities Regulatory Authority, the Health and Safety Authority, the Food Safety Authority, the Private Security Authority, the National Vetting Bureau or CORU.  With regard to recommendation 15, security at emergency accommodation is not delivered by firms licensed by the Private Security Authority.</p> <p>  There is an absence of information in the public domain about the ownership and management of accommodation paid for by the DRHE and delivered by private individuals.  This creates a gap for people who stay there and those who support them, especially when things go wrong or there is a complaint.  We hear complaints daily against hostel staff or other residents involving behaviour that is criminal in nature and there is no independent arbitration process.  This lack of a regulatory framework is at odds with best practice, good governance and common sense.</p> <p>  Between April 2021 and December 2021 there was no reduction in the use of private emergency accommodation, referred to in recommendation 13.  This represents 56% of the accommodation provided in the Dublin region.  Where a clear majority of accommodation is delivered for profit, with no regulatory oversight and where there are no on-site supports for people at their most vulnerable, they are there for longer and at a higher cost, not only to them.  Those who use our services are at its heart and we rarely make changes without their consultation.  We want and need to ensure the best use of our resources.</p> <p>  In looking at the 2021 recommendations, we opened the conversation to people in Mendicity and our findings are stark.  We carried out a snapshot survey on 30 and 31 January and interviewed 96 individuals, comprising 93 men and three women, all single-person households.  Based on these findings we intend to revisit this topic in more detail, and we will share this with the committee in due course.  A total of 67% of the 96 people are between the ages of 36 and 45, 5% are under 25 and 3% are over 55.  A total of 35 of them are Irish and 61 are from other EEA countries.  A total of 78 of them have been homeless for two years or more.  Only three of the 96 people have the support of a regular key worker.  Only three of them are staying in supported temporary accommodation, 21 are sleeping outside but had previously stayed in private emergency accommodation and 72 currently in private emergency accommodation with no on-site supports.</p><p>The DRHE annual report of 2020 tells us that all residents in private emergency accommodation have received a copy of revised Guidelines for Service Users in Emergency Accommodation.  None of the 96 had a copy of these guidelines and 88 of the 96 we asked said that no house rules had been explained to them.  This is critical as we see regular exclusions of people for breaches of house rules.</p><p> We asked if they felt safe in their hostel and asked if they had been the victims of crime.  We asked if they had been robbed or assaulted while in their hostel.  When it came to a safety rating, 85 rated their safety at three or less out of ten.  When it came to crime, 90 of the 96 had personally been the victim of crime, being either robbed or assaulted while in their hostel.</p><p> From our experience, there are limited exits from homelessness unless a local authority accepts an application for social housing.  It is necessary to establish a local connection where one is applying.  Without an application, a homeless person cannot access a range of housing supports such as supported accommodation or a housing assistance payment.  This is illustrated well by Aidan who spent periods of time in foster care and residential care as a minor and was at times hospitalised.  He has lived, at some point or another, in almost every county in Ireland.  He is currently in Dublin.  He is working and is staying in a tent.  He has spent time in private emergency accommodation, sharing a room with three others, but drug use and violence make him feel safer outside.  Rory, another resident in private emergency hostels, speaks candidly about drug use.  He admits that he had drugs and drug paraphernalia in his room and when they were found he was restrained by staff, while being choked by one of their colleagues.</p><p> I will close with a few recommendations, not more than 17.  To move forward, it is critical to review the social housing application process and remove existing barriers for people who are homeless.  We must allow for intercounty transfer and improved information sharing between local authorities.  We also must end our dependence on private emergency accommodation, where there is no support.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity to share the experiences of Novas clients.  Since I last had the opportunity to present to this committee last year, the number of homeless people throughout the country has increased.  The cessation of rent freezes and of the moratorium on evictions last May has contributed to a 9% increase in homeless figures.  While the pandemic saw reductions in the number of families experiencing homelessness, it did not have the same positive impact on single people, who continue to spend protracted periods of time living in homeless accommodation.<br/><br/>Twelve months ago, I reported 13 deaths in our services during 2020 to this committee.  In 2021, this figure was seven.  This is most welcome news.  However, the level of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among our clients is staggering, particularly among the women in our dedicated female services.  Taking as an example the Abigail Women&rsquo;s Centre in Dublin, from April 2021 to the end of January 2022, on 26 occasions our staff cut women down who had a cord or wire around their necks.  This was in a period of just ten months and in just one of our services.  Staff in our supported temporary accommodation, STA, service carry ligature knives in the small first-aid pouch around their necks at all times.  While all staff in our STA services receive ligature training, the trauma of these experiences is unparalleled.  It is fair to assume that the death rate among the homeless women we support would have been far higher in 2021 but for the interventions of our front-line staff.<br/><br/>Living in low-threshold, congregated accommodation is very difficult for people with complex needs relating to addiction and mental health who have experienced significant trauma in their lives.  This is compounded by a number of issues.  One of the them is the standard of accommodation in supported temporary services.  We believe that everyone who lives in STA accommodation should have a single room as a minimum standard.  We all agree that trauma informed practice is significant in supporting our clients and in delivering front-line services.  It is something that Novas has pursued since 2016.  However, if we expect people to live in dormitory style accommodation there is nothing trauma informed about this type of accommodation.  It is very difficult for people with complex needs relating to addiction and mental health to share with strangers.  When we lost the Abigail Women's Centre on a site in Finglas late last year we lost 40 single bedrooms.  Now we have replaced them with 15 single bedrooms and the rest is shared accommodation.  This makes it very difficult to support the most vulnerable people with the most complex needs who find it the most difficult to share rooms with others.<br/><br/>Another significant issue is the lack of dual diagnosis support for clients with addiction and mental health needs.  They find it extremely difficult to access mainstream supports, as one issue blocks their ability to access treatment and support for the other.  All the while their health and well-being deteriorate and their addiction becomes more entrenched, limiting their exit pathways from homelessness.  Access to dual diagnosis support for homeless people has been long raised as an issue and considering the level of self-harm, suicide attempts and overdose among our clients, it is more pertinent now than ever.<br/><br/>Lack of appropriate move-on accommodation is stifling single people's ability to move from supported temporary accommodation.  In terms of women, more gender specific move-on options, such as supported long-term accommodation, are essential.  While we broadly welcome the new targets for Housing First, the figures are modest.  For example, in the mid-west region, which has the largest homeless population <i>per capita</i>outside Dublin, just 52 clients will access a Housing First tenancy up to 2026.  This precludes hundreds of homeless people from availing of the programme and also reduces the ability to deliver the programme on scale, to ensure it is economically viable to provide all the wrap-around supports to Housing First clients as per the model, including access to alternative accommodation should the first tenancy break down.  As a final point relating to long-term housing options, HAP limits are too low and many of our clients are not even put forward for available accommodation by the Place Finder service, as the top-up to the landlords is so high it is unsustainable from the outset.<br/><br/>My final point relating to the difficulties and challenges facing our clients is reunification with their children.  Many of the clients we work with are seeking to reunify with their children upon exiting homelessness, but this is an extraordinary challenge for them.  For example, if a client does not have the primary care of his or her children, he or she is not entitled to more than a one-bedroom unit of accommodation on the social housing waiting list and, therefore, social workers cannot recommend reunification of a parent with his or her child.  More discretion is required in the type of properties single people with children are entitled to.  Reunification can be the overriding motive for the women who live in our services to recover from addiction and homelessness.  Currently, it is incredibly rare for homeless women whose children are in care to regain access, despite their immense efforts.<br/><br/>I am conscious that much of what I presented here today is a repetition of my presentation to the committee a year ago.  However, it is worth repeating.  The trauma experienced by our clients and the vicarious trauma of our staff need to be understood.  The epidemic in self-harm, physiological distress and suicide attempts among our client group in low-threshold services must be acknowledged, and the things we can change to improve matters must be changed.</p></speech>

It is tremendous.  They are dealing with the most vulnerable people in our society.  We talk about the big numbers in Housing for All such as 300,000 homes and so forth, but it comes down to the individual lived experience of the people who suffer homelessness.  The witnesses and the people who work with them are at the coalface, and we appreciate the work they do.</p> <p>  I have some questions.  I refer to the opening statement by Mr. Dennigan regarding the causes and prevention of homelessness, particularly the issue of illegal evictions and the moratorium on evictions.  We discussed this issue with representatives of the DRHE and the Department when they were before the committee previously.  The representatives of the DRHE clearly stated that it is not illegal evictions or evictions that are driving homelessness, but a number of other factors.  It is not funds either.  They said clearly that funding is not an issue now.  However, what they clearly stated was an issue is the supply of built properties, because we are coming out of a decade of undersupply and we have had two construction lockdowns in the last two years.  Mr. Dennigan mentioned small landlords leaving, which is a major problem.</p><p>How do we keep small landlords?  How do we increase supply in the immediate and short term?  I heard what Mr. Dennigan said.  He believes people who are homeless tonight will not be homeless in three years' time.  That is great news, but three years is a long time.</p></speech>

Our view is that prevention is the key issue that we need to deal with right now.  We want to prevent people falling into the trap of homelessness in the first place, which can then lead on into trauma impacts and everything else for individuals and for families.  That is key.</p></speech>

The key element is to increase supply and make sure that we have more units, especially one-bed units in the city and in the major population centres.</p> <p>  We also see it as key to make sure that people with support needs are supported and that the services that they need in order to keep their homes are funded and provided.</p></speech>

There were no new social or affordable homes built in the area in the past ten years.  That is just a reality.  To be fair, all of the services know my constituency very well because a large number of emergency accommodation services are being provided there.  The Government has committed &euro;20 billion to build homes, but it will take time.  In the short term, do we ask the Government to take leases on properties that are built today and take people out of substandard emergency accommodation where they cannot cook a meal, wash their clothes or do homework with their children?  Is there a place for that?</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  Anything that will increase the supply for people in emergency accommodation is definitely worthwhile.  There is no question about that, but it is not just that; we also need to provide the services and supply that go along with it.  What is key is to stop people falling into that trap and moving into emergency accommodation in the first place.  There has been a marked trend in people leaving the marketplace as landlords and we must do anything we can to stop that.</p></speech>

What typically tends to happen is that private rented accommodation is not going back into the sector.  At best, there is a gap period where one landlord leaves and another landlord buys the property.  At worst, it moved out of the private rented sector altogether and, as a result, the supply is further reduced for people on the lowest rung of the ladder who are seeking to rent properties.</p></speech>

Where a local authority could purchase the home and keep the family that was renting <i>in situ</i>, as they were on the housing list anyway, that prevented the family becoming homeless.  Is that the type of measure Mr. Dennigan is talking about?</p></speech>

It could be that if people are working, they are working for too short a time, or they might not have a local connection.  If someone had been working in Wexford and arrives in Dublin, that person has no local connection here.  There are myriad barriers in people's way.</p></speech>

The longer people stay in emergency accommodation, effectively, the fewer opportunities they have to move out.  That is why we need to approach this with a sense of urgency, so that when people arrive in emergency accommodation, resources need to be applied swiftly because if people are there for 18 months or two years, while their needs may not be complex on day one, they certainly are after 18 months.</p></speech>

On behalf of the two of us, I thank the witnesses for the presentations and also in particular their front-line staff in Dublin, Cork and the south west for the enormous amount of work they have been doing, especially in the very difficult Covid circumstances.</p><p>It is hard not to have an appalling sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu </i>when we have these conversations, as we do periodically.  While the phrase &quot;returning to normal as we exit Covid&quot; is a very good phrase for most people in most aspects of their lives, it is the wrong thing that is currently happening.  From everything we have heard in the presentations today, we are slipping back into the pre-Covid set of realities.  For me, the worry is that in a committee like this, we can end up getting so focused on the details of the 17 recommendations or a set of proposals that it gets lost.  I do not mean to the witnesses or to us but in the wider debate.</p><p>This is a tough question, but I wish to ask it of each of the groups represented today, given that we are now seeing an increase in homelessness again.  The cold weather initiative will end quite soon and some of those in emergency accommodation that have habitual residency condition issues, as Ms Santoro mentioned, are at risk of homelessness and rough sleeping.  If there was one intervention that each of the groups wanted to stress that the Minister should take now, what would be the crucial one so that we do not end up back where we were in 2017 and 2018 with ever-escalating levels of homelessness among families and single people month on month, and an expansion of emergency accommodation in the public and private sectors.  There is genuine fear when I look at the loss of properties in the private rental sector, rising rents and in particular the exit figures from the Dublin Region Homeless Executive report on Friday.  I am more concerned now than I have been at any other stage since the peak in 2018.  I know I am putting the witnesses on the spot.  I am keen to hear from Cork Simon as well.  Our committee is going to have to do something and to communicate with the Minister and give him some recommendations.  Given that most of the 17 recommendations either have not been implemented or have not been fully implemented, it would be helpful if we had a shorter list coming out of this meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.916" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Dermot Kavanagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#Q02200"><p>I will come in first.  We are in an emergency situation when it comes to homelessness and housing.  If I am allowed, I will suggest two things rather than one.  First, it used to be the case that the private rented sector offered a viable pathway out of homelessness.  That has become increasingly difficult, in particular for single homeless people over the past several years.  The HAP rate has not shifted since 2016 for a one-bed unit in Cork, which is five years.</p><p>There are approximately 300 homeless people in the city, most of whom are single people.  The HAP rate is stuck at &euro;550 or &euro;660, if the 20% uplift is offered.  The price in 2016 for a one-bed apartment in Cork city centre was already expensive, at around &euro;850.  It is now &euro;1,500 and it is &euro;1,200 in the suburbs.  The HAP has totally lost touch with reality, at least in Cork.  It is vital to get that pathway back and operating, as is increasing the uplift and reviewing the overall HAP rate.  </p><p> Second, this is a bit like emergency medicine and is about triage.  When one looks at our 2021 figures in the Cork Simon Community shelter, it is notable again that the group of people who have been homeless for the longest term represents 6% of those who availed of our shelter or Night Light service in 2021 and accounted for 50% of the bed nights.  While it is extremely welcome to see that Housing First is now part of the mainstream response to homelessness, I was disappointed that in Cork and the south west, the number of extra new tenancies to be created is actually a reduction year on year.  In the previous three years, the target had been 28 tenancies per year but under the new plan, it is 21 tenancies per year.  That is quite disappointing.  </p><p> We deliver the service in the south west in partnership with Focus Ireland.  We have exceeded the pre-existing targets for tenancies in the city already.  If you want to create more space in emergency shelter, it is about getting the long-term homeless people into housing with the supports that they need.  Housing First does that.  The faster it can go and the more units that can be prioritised for homeless people, especially for those in the long-term homeless group, the more we can ease the pressure on the services.  Those are my two main points.</p></speech>

I see in inner-city communities that what very often happens is that the person disregards any work they are doing when they get a flat in a particular flat complex.  This can lead to challenges for the local community but also for the individual themselves. They are very often quite vulnerable.  They end up being targeted by unpleasant types of people.  It causes a difficulty.  For me, Housing First needs to be better funded.  There needs to be a more comprehensive range of wraparound services.  This is because clearly people are being left to their own devices after a certain time.  It is not good for them and is not good for the particular community in which they live.  Would witnesses agree that an increase in funding for Housing First is needed?  Any witness may reply.  I know Mr. Allen from the City Council.</p></speech>

In Dublin, there was a large gap between the amount of money that the State had made available for delivering Housing First services and the amount of money that was paid to the contractor who was delivering the service.  Therefore, if the service is finding itself unable to provide the resources to deliver the service quality - I do not know if this is the case but the Deputy seems to be saying that - then the Deputy needs to look closely at whether it is appropriate to put out social services to the most vulnerable people in our society on the basis that they be given to people who would provide them on the cheapest basis.</p></speech>

I think it was Mr. Dennigan who, in response to Senator Fitzpatrick, seemed reluctant to say that leasing had a benefit.  Am I taking that up wrong?  What are his thoughts in relation to that?  Obviously, anything that increases supply and provides people with secure tenancies is surely of benefit in keeping people outside of emergency accommodation.</p></speech>

That question was about whether direct leasing by the local authority for the provision of social housing could have a benefit, and it could.  Anything that would increase the supply of available housing for people who are in emergency accommodation has its place.  We need to look at it in those terms.  There are structural issues with the way the leasing plan is constructed for approved housing bodies at the moment.  These make it difficult to apply the leasing provisions for approved housing bodies at the moment.  This is a set of proposals that we could look at to help achieve a better balance in how that works but by all means, leasing by the local authorities has its place in the provision of social housing.</p></speech>

It has been used to great success in Waterford in providing those exact one- and two-bedroom properties that we are talking about here today.  They have a role in removing people from homeless or emergency accommodation and in providing them with their own-front-door accommodation.  Has Focus Ireland utilised that?  Is there a reason why it is not being utilised further?  I believe that the Peter McVerry Trust is using it to some extent.  What is Focus Ireland&rsquo;s use of it, or view on that?</p></speech>

However, if the structure of the proposal was looked at in more detail, particularly around the long-term maintenance and upkeep costs of properties and if that balance could be re-addressed, it would be much more suitable.  It could result in more approved housing bodies being able to avail of that particular scheme.  However, as it stands, there are particular difficulties.</p></speech>

That is the main constraint or concern in relation to the full structure of the building.  Mr. Dennigan has answered that sufficiently and I will hand over to Deputy Higgins.</p></speech>

My questions are to Mr. Dennigan and to Ms Santoro.  In Mr. Dennigan's opening statement, he spoke about his vision for milestones on the path to the 2030 goal of ending homelessness.  I would love to learn more about what he feels those milestones should be.  While Senator Fitzpatrick touched on this earlier, I know that Mr. Dennigan has some specific proposals on how we could proactively delay landlords who may want to leave the rental market.  I would be interested in hearing about that.  Focus Ireland&rsquo;s trauma-informed approach to service provision is progressive.  It sounds like the training that has been done with Focus Ireland staff will be exceptionally valuable and that it will revolutionise how Focus Ireland works with its clients.</p> <p>  To Ms Santoro, I was quite disappointed to hear that only three of the people who were surveyed had key workers working with them.  I would be interested to hear about what Ms Santoro thinks are the hurdles to getting those key workers.  We had the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, into the committee only an hour or so ago.</p><p>It had some very encouraging statistics around key workers.  At this stage, all of the families with the DRHE have key workers and many of the individuals it is working with have a housing support worker.  What challenges does the Mendicity Institution find and how do we break that down?</p><p> I fully endorse the recommendation around being able to more freely transfer from one local authority housing list to another.  I note that the majority of the Mendicity Institution&rsquo;s clients are not currently on a housing list and are not, therefore, eligible for accommodation.  I ask for information on why people are not eligible and whether there are challenges we should be looking at from a policy perspective.</p></speech>

The DRHE may have given the Deputy a statistic around a housing support worker.  A housing support worker will monitor somebody along an application process.  If the person is not entitled to make an application, the support worker can monitor him or her along that forever.  The housing support workers have a caseload of about 50 or 60 each.  They are not key workers, they are not support workers and it is not a generalist support provision.  There are no on-site supports at the private emergency hostels so people do not have any access to a regular key worker.  Arguably, the three people who did have access to a key worker are in supported temporary accommodation and the others are not.</p></speech>

We recognise that in the coming years construction and supply of housing need to ramp up significantly and anything we can do to accelerate that, particularly the supply of social housing, is vital.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  From a prevention perspective, Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the characteristics in the market in Cork and these apply directly right across Dublin and other places.  The HAP issue is vital around the country and needs to be dealt with urgently.</p> <p>  There are two other matters that we think deserve prioritisation.  One is around the youth homelessness strategy and we are working with the Department in that regard.  I know a public consultation is being developed for that and the strategy is in progress.  We have fed into that and we see it as very important because it is a key area for people who are some of the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p>  The last point is to try to address the whole area of family homelessness, particularly the issue of children in emergency accommodation and how that can be time-shortened and prevented.</p></speech>

I have a question for Ms Santoro on that point about people not being able to get onto the housing waiting list and not being able to exit homelessness.  They may be developing complex needs while they are in and out of private emergency accommodation and they could be sleeping rough.  What are the barriers to getting on the housing waiting list that could be tackled and what needs to be done in that regard?</p></speech>

It is not user-friendly.  We deal with many people who have literacy and language issues, so a 25-page form is outside of their scope.  Nobody is helping them with this.  The forms go back and forth and are ping-ponged for an extended period of time.  We have to simplify the housing application process, which would make a huge difference.  Without that housing application, in any local authority, people do not stand a chance.  In any of the discussions we are having about Housing First or housing assistance payment, they do not get there - they do not even get the support of a key worker in supported temporary accommodation.  It is a critical takeaway for this committee.</p></speech>

Does Ms Santoro have a view on that?</p></speech>

We are focused on a particular group, which is those in private emergency hostels.  There is no on-site support.  There may be an inspection of the building, which should tell us whether there is a working fire alarm or a certain number of staff on-site, but there is no support for these individuals.  If things go wrong, they have nobody to go to.  Again, I am pointing back to the lack of knowledge of who is running those services.  There is no method for us to communicate with somebody who is in a hostel.  The nature of the complaints we hear is hair-raising and there is nowhere we can go with those complaints.  It speaks to people's direct experience of violence in the hostels.  Any inspection of a physical nature of the fabric of the building is welcome but we cannot have people at their most vulnerable in hostels where there is no on-site support.  That is reckless.</p></speech>

Recommendation No. 12 touches on a point that was raised earlier by Focus Ireland.  It states that emergency accommodation for homeless people is best delivered by experienced homeless services rather than for-profit private operators.  Simon suggests that it is not convinced that competitive tendering, which is open to such private operators, is the best approach to commissioning those services.  Does Simon consider it is a problem in terms of providing services for people who are homeless that it can be open to competitive tendering, where quality is perhaps not considered as much and it is more about the lowest bidder?</p></speech>

What we can do is look at best practice and the quality of services we want, and ask people to compete on being able to get the best outcomes for people experiencing homelessness.  When we look to tendering, that is the benchmark we should be looking at.</p></speech>

There is a compromise there somewhere.  I am not saying that is the be-all and end-all, but it is a focus.  We can look at the way tendering is done at the moment.</p></speech>

With regard to the standards of regulation that apply to NGOs and charities, the bar is set much higher.  If we are working with a private emergency hostel, people do not have to have any background in social care, they do not have to be Garda vetted and they have zero training.  We are talking here about trauma-informed care.  This does not exist in the provision of private emergency accommodation for profit.  It is not like-for-like tendering.  What Simon, Focus Ireland, Novas and the Mendicity Institution can do is completely different.  We are not being given a fair shot in terms of competition.  We also need to look at the value in regard to how long people stay in hostels.  We are looking at this from January to December.  If people are three years in accommodation, which looks cheaper on paper, it is not cheaper.</p></speech>

How important is that and what needs to be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.944" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022020800002#S01600"><p>It is important and it comes up from time to time.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to create a passport, which would help people to transfer in the social housing realm, where it has been shown to be very helpful.  It would make a big difference for people who are homeless.  The idea that a person needs to be linked to a particular county when homeless is an ancient one and not particularly helpful.  A much better approach would be what is in the best interests of the person.  Ms Hayes referred to this earlier.</p><p>She spoke about a person who wanted to be in homeless accommodation but was told there was a reluctance to send the person back to where he or she had been because there was a Housing First option available there.  It was clearly in that person's interest not to be in Dublin.  Very often, the choice is not necessarily made on the basis of what is in the person's best interests.</p><p> The issue of private emergency accommodation is addressed in our submission.  One of the important issues in the context of regional variation is that there are completely different patterns of provision of private emergency accommodation in each region.  I ask the committee to consider the data we published on that.  Most of the private emergency accommodation is for families.  Many of the issues that have been raised here by the Mendicity Institution and so on do not apply to that family accommodation.  It is private emergency accommodation for single people that is the particularly problematic area.  I do not think that has ever gone out for a competitive tender between a voluntary organisation and a private organisation.  The history of how private provision of accommodation for single persons came into Dublin is more complicated than that.  It is about the standards the voluntary organisations that provide emergency accommodation wanted to provide and the amount of money that was available to deliver it.  Focus Ireland does not provide emergency accommodation or run shelters.  It is much more complicated in this case than simply a competition between people doing it on the cheap and people doing it well.</p></speech>

I thank her for her participation today and all the work she is doing.  In terms of the updating that is being undertaken by the Minister for Justice of the policy on combating violence against women, gender-based violence and domestic violence, the Minister is pursuing four pillars, namely, prevention, protection, policy and prosecution.  The protection part of it primarily relates to housing and the requirement for a commitment to increase the number of refuges and capacity in the existing refuges.  I hope Dr. Burns will tell me she or her organisation is engaged in that as a stakeholder and is contributing to it.</p></speech>

A couple of years ago, refuges and homelessness were separated.  People who experience domestic violence are not included in the official number of people who are experiencing homelessness at the moment.  They are quite separate matrices in terms of the way they are measured.  I am not sure that is really helpful because many of the women we support, particularly in our dedicated female services in Dublin, but also right throughout the country in our mixed-gender services, are victims of domestic violence, as well as sexual and gender-based violence.  Domestic violence is the reason they are homeless, so there needs to be more cohesion between those two sectors.  It would be great to be involved in that process.</p></speech>

I refer in particular to the usage of HAP on a preventative basis to make sure people do not fall into the trap of homelessness in the first place.  On the final follow-up question, I point to the fact that in our submission we refer to a research report published before Christmas on domestic violence and homelessness and the implications in that regard, which is really important.</p></speech>

There is a need for more work on prevention.  The only other thing, which is a follow-on from the repair and leasing scheme, relates to vacant and derelict properties.  Those properties can be turned around really quickly.  There is enormous capacity in cities and towns in this respect, so we need to find a way not just of bringing them back in, but making sure they are brought back in and attached to the local authority or an approved housing body so as to ensure they are brought in as affordable accommodation.  That is a significant win that can be achieved.  It is a medium-term objective, but it is much quicker than waiting for greenfield projects to come on site.</p></speech>

I am seeking the committee's approval for the revised Estimates for the justice Vote group, to provide for much needed expenditure across the justice sector.</p> <p>  The Estimates provide for gross expenditure of &euro;3.153 billion across the six votes in the justice sector, &euro;2.883 billion of which is current expenditure and &euro;270 million is capital expenditure.  In addition, an amount of &euro;12.4 million in unspent capital from 2021 has been carried over to 2022, bringing the total capital allocation available to &euro;282.4 million.</p> <p>  I will set out the detail in respect of each of the individual votes, but the main objective of the funding in 2022 is protecting communities and supporting victims.  This is core to what we do in the Department of Justice.  The budgetary allocations reflect the ongoing and increased investment in supports for people and communities impacted by crime and also the broad range of services offered to the public, including by accelerating the digitisation of these services.</p> <p>  The gross expenditure estimate for Vote 20 - Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is &euro;2.062 billion, which amounts to 65% of the funding for the entire group.  This includes a capital allocation of &euro;146.5 million, which builds on capital expenditure of &euro;131 million in 2021.  The capital expenditure includes &euro;61 million in respect of the building programme, including the completion of the new Military Road, Dublin 8 development, &euro;72 million for ICT expenditure and &euro;12 million for investment in the Garda fleet, including in the region of 100 new Garda bikes. </p> <p>  In the region of 88% of the Garda current expenditure budget is pay and pensions related.  I am pleased that the funding for 2022 provides for a further 800 garda&iacute; to commence training and for the recruitment of an additional 400 Garda staff to free up more garda&iacute; for front-line duties.  It is intended the next competition for recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will commence shortly. </p> <p>  The organisation's capacity will be further strengthened by the recruitment of additional Garda staff, including specialist roles to support the investigation of crime and enhance the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, since 2017, approximately 840 Garda members have been released from posts not requiring Garda powers or expertise and their duties reassigned to Garda staff.  This has, in turn, facilitated the redeployment of Garda members to operational and front-line duties.  This process will continue in 2022.</p> <p>  The budgetary allocation for 2022 includes in the region of &euro;10 million for further investment in the new Garda uniform, which people will have seen this week, and an additional &euro;10.5 million for Garda operational expenditure, which includes provision for new mobile devices, equipment for a range of Garda specialist units as well as on-going training in relation to priority areas such as tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It also includes a specific once&ndash;off allocation of &euro;1.5 million to mark the centenary of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2022.  This significant milestone in the history of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be rightly recognised and celebrated this year. </p> <p>  Before moving on from the Garda Vote, I want to acknowledge and thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for its exemplary service through and during the pandemic and in the many ways An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to support communities throughout the country.  The work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is valued and appreciated by people throughout the country.  It is important that the work of the organisation continues to be supported and that Government is committed to this, particularly in the context of ongoing reform, which is both in the best interests of the public and of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a whole and each member who serves in it.</p></speech>

We have allocated additional funding.  More than &euro;2 billion is being allocated directly to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Consequent to that, 800 new recruits will come out of Templemore.  The campaign should open in the next two to three weeks.  There will be a significant campaign to try to open up recruitment to as many communities as possible in order to ensure that the force is representative.  We also want to ensure that as many garda&iacute; as possible who are currently working behind desks are freed up.  Through the funding, there is a commitment to have 400 additional civilian staff.  The commitment will ensure that 400 extra garda&iacute;, in addition to the 800 recruits, can be deployed in our towns and villages.  One hundred and twenty recruits came out of Templemore in the past two weeks.  This is increasing our number, bringing it closer to the total of 15,000.  We are also committing to focusing on and expanding our Garda Reserve, which over the years has unfortunately been depleted.  However, the Estimates contain a clear commitment, amounting to &euro;1.5 million, to increase the number and to have Reserve members as part of the overall team.</p></speech>

On the provision of office facilities for Garda staff, co-location in Garda stations is not always required.  Even in my area, there is an opportunity to develop an office building for Garda staff.  Is that part of the programme for capital expenditure?  There are pressures on some Garda stations because of their size.</p> <p>  On Templemore, recruitment is to begin shortly.  Is there provision for additional training to deal with domestic, gender-based and sexual violence, or is it already a well-entrenched part of the programme?  Is more funding required to enhance the training?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.987" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2022020800002#D00800"><p>On the latter question, members of the divisional protective service units received specific training initially.  Some of it has been online.  Owing to the relaxation of restrictions, there will be further training in person, working on very specific, sensitive and difficult issues.  The training is extremely important because the staff working in the units are dealing with very difficult issues.</p> <p>  Training of garda&iacute; overall continued throughout the pandemic, albeit in a hybrid format.  It will continue.  Very much part of my objective in supporting victims in their journey is ensuring training in this area for members of the Garda, those in the legal profession, the Judiciary and others who come into contact with victims or survivors.  There is ongoing training.  It is a question of more specialist training for those working in the divisional protective units, but it is important that everybody have training at a certain level, especially regarding this issue.</p> <p>  Capital expenditure is set at &euro;270 million but we are considering a new capital budget that will project into the next five to ten years.  We need to determine how needs and requirements fit into the new operational model being rolled out as part of the restructuring and the move from the district model to the new divisional model.  The new model will include a focus on community policing and severe crime, but also on HR, finance and ensuring those who have specialist training in certain areas are doing the work they need to do.  Of course, all these staff will need to be housed and to have the space in which to do their work.  The capital plan will be announcing shortly will set out just how we will do that.</p></speech>

An example of that is the divisional protective service units, whereby units within each of the 19 divisions will have a particular focus and capacity in the areas in which they are working.  That will apply across the board.  Economic crime and fraud divisions, and also other divisions, will be included.  As the divisional models are rolled out, we will also see a particular focus on community policing.  It is not all about buildings and structures; it is also about ensuring we have equipment and support for An Garda, an up-to-date fleet, bicycles for garda&iacute; in towns and villages and the right IT and other technologies.  As I mentioned, there is &euro;72 million for overall IT expenditure.  This is extremely important in making sure the Garda is up to date and can match so much of what is being done by its counterparts across Europe to share intelligence.  It is about fighting local crime but also about making sure we can deal with international criminals and gangs and co-operate with our partners across Europe and internationally.</p></speech>

I have a couple of minor points.  On the youth justice strategy and the youth diversion programmes in place in many areas, will there be additional training for rank-and-file garda&iacute; to ensure they are adequately trained to deal with the kinds of incidents involving juveniles that we have been seeing more of recently?</p><p>Body cams are supposed to be coming on board.  I hope it will be soon.  When does the Minister expect them to be used and to be able to ensure adequate protection for the public in this regard?</p><p><font color="#0000FF">  </font>With regard to the capital building programme, for which there has been an increase, many Garda stations around the country are in dire need of renovation.  New Garda stations are required in some places.  Sligo is probably the main example but there are others.  Are there plans to build on progress to ensure a good capital resource that is fit for purpose, because many existing Garda stations are not fit for purpose?</p></speech>

In recent months, we published the overall strategy.  Training that will take place will be paid for directly through the Garda Vote.  There will be training as part of the overall strategy.</p> <p>  On automatic number-plate recognition, ANPR, and the body-worn cameras, the Deputy will be aware that legislation is being worked on.  It is on the priority list for this session and I hope to have it published in the coming month or two.  Work will obviously need to be done on setting codes of conduct once the legislation is passed.  Much of what we are working through at present is to make sure individuals' civil liberties and rights will be protected at all times, such that the body-worn cameras will be used only when necessary.  In light of so much of what we have focused on in recent weeks and months, including domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, the position on the use of body-worn cameras is clear.  The first few moments after a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appears on the scene are often the most important.  There will be very clear rules and guidelines on how the body-worn cameras will have to be used and on other elements that fall under the legislation.  We intend to make sure the ICT budget for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will contribute towards delivery in this regard.  While I do not envisage that the legislation and all the codes of conduct will be fully completed this year, the intention, moving into next year, is to see deployment and what I describe happening on the ground.</p></speech>

My other question is on public transport, which has been a focal point in the past several months.  The trade unions whose members drive trains and buses are very exercised over the dangers faced by the public and employees.  They feel there needs to be a section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with public transport.  I agree and believe it is a direction in which we need to go.  As the Minister is aware, we are pushing everybody to use more public transport and stop using their cars.  I hope that is what will happen and that we will have the required infrastructure in place as we move forward, but we will have to ensure people can use public transport safely.  Many people, particularly young women, are afraid of their lives to go near DART stations and other such places after dark.  They will take a taxi and do anything other than do so.  The main reason is security.  While some public transport operators use private security firms, which do a certain job, we need to consider using Garda resources and forming an appropriate corps to deal with the matter.</p><p>I would like to hear the Minister's comments on where that might go.</p></speech>

I am aware he keeps all these issues under consideration, such as where certain issues arise; where there needs to be a greater focus; where there needs to be a greater redeployment; or, indeed, where there needs to be a new operational model within the structure of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I know in recent times, due to the issues the Deputy has just mentioned where we have had particular issues, unfortunately, many of them within the Dublin area as well as further afield, there have been specific targeted operations within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at certain times over weekends.  That has had a huge impact and has been very positive.  Notwithstanding that, it is something that will always be kept under review and, obviously, if a situation escalates that needs further consideration, that will be the case.  As is always the case in the context of the budget, I would sit down with the Garda Commissioner and the team, and where there are priorities, not just from the Garda Commissioner but our own priorities within Government, we will align.  An issue like this or any other issues will always be under consideration.</p></speech>

The budget is broken down into two separate programmes, the criminal and civil justice pillars, comprising almost 50 separate subheads.  The budgetary provision for 2022 enables a number of key priorities to be advanced and provides additional resources to a number of agencies and programmes in the civil and criminal justice sectors.</p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that it is possible to build on the investment in Estimates 2021 for victim supports and to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms.  This reflects the fact that tackling these crimes and supporting victims is a priority for this Government.  Over the past 12 months, we have made good progress in tackling and raising awareness of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  An integral part of this has been in working closely with our front-line partners and taking a sectoral approach to the issues, and we want to continue this.</p> <p>  In 2022, we will provide over &euro;1 million to the Legal Aid Board to provide for legal advice and services in court to victims of sexual violence.  Over &euro;1 million will be provided to the Garda to upgrade its divisional protective service units.  Some &euro;5.3 million will be provided for awareness-raising initiatives, including knowing the signs, what supports are available etc.  In addition, &euro;4.9 million is being provided to support victims of crime groups.  A significant proportion of this is earmarked for the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence area.  The &euro;5.3 million also deals with training, which I touched on earlier with Deputy Carroll MacNeill.</p> <p>  The Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 was launched in 2021.  The immediate priority within the new strategy is to enhance engagement with children and young people who are most at risk of involvement in criminal activity, principally by strengthening the services available through the existing network of 105 youth diversion projects, YDPs, across the State.  The additional &euro;6.7 million provided for in the Estimates represents an increase of one third in support for youth services.  Apologies, I said "doubled" earlier.  It provides the resources to kick-start delivery of key objectives in the youth justice strategy and, in particular, the programme to expand and deepen the range of supports available through local YDP services.</p> <p>  The budget of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, is over &euro;56.5 million in 2022.  This includes a capital allocation of &euro;30.5 million to complete the development of a new state-of-the-art laboratory in Backweston, County Kildare.  Despite the impact of the Covid restrictions, in the region of over &euro;69 million was spent on this project over the past two years.  A number of other agencies in the criminal justice sector received additional funding.  The Criminal Assets Bureau received &euro;900,000 with its total allocation being &euro;10.9 million.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission received an additional &euro;2.1 million, which brings the total allocation to &euro;13.4 million.  This reflects the increased workload in terms of volume and complexity which the commission is dealing with.  Increased resources have also been made available to the Inspector of Prisons of &euro;400,000, bringing the total allocation to &euro;2.35 million, and the Parole Board now has a total allocation of &euro;1.74 million, which reflects the expanded remit of this body following its establishment as a statutory agency in July 2021.</p> <p>  I am particularly pleased that the community safety innovation fund has been established in the justice Vote in 2022.  An amount of &euro;2 million has been provided in 2022.  A call for funding proposals will issue seeking applications for community safety projects and similar initiatives from the new local community safety partnerships.  Applications will be assessed against criteria outlined in the call for proposals to ensure funding is allocated to encourage the development of innovative ways in which to improve community safety, from people who understand local community safety-needs best and to avoid duplication with other services.  The new fund will reflect the significant successes of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Criminal Assets Bureau in disrupting criminal activity and seizing proceeds of crime, by providing additional funding for investment in community safety projects.</p></speech>

There are a lot of cases coming before the courts in which there is a background of domestic violence involving, for example, breaches of protection orders and barring orders.  In my experience, many of those cases are dropped before they are to be heard or on the day of the hearing.  What extra plans does the Legal Aid Board have?  Does it have any ambition to help the complainants in those cases who have protection orders and barring orders, and to give them legal advice and support?  Sometimes cases are dropped because there is an improvement in the relationship, but it is difficult for them, mostly women, to leave the relationship.  Could they get help and advice from the Legal Aid Board?  Will that be considered by the board to address the problem?</p></speech>

The &euro;1.1 million comes directly from Supporting the Victim's Journey and the recommendations in the Tom O'Malley report, which was published almost two years ago this summer.  It is intended that victims who previously did not have access to or were not able to afford legal support going through the court process, would have access to that from the beginning when they decide to take that difficult step of coming forward and seeking help.  It is the intention that they would have access to legal advice and would be able to make the decision whether or not to process, move forward, or go to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The intention is that, in years to come, that money will expand even further.  This is initial funding as we get this particular action up and running.  It is intended to support victims at every stage of the way.</p> <p>  It complements other work that has also been done where we have expanded and improved the victims' charter, making sure that when people go online to see what supports are available to them, there is a clear and understandable website with the directions signposted for them as to where they can go.  Of course, legal advice would be one option available to them.  There are many others as well.  It is important to note that this is not just about going through the courts process.  Not everybody decides to do that.  However, we must ensure they are still supported and have that legal protection.</p></speech>

I would like to get an idea of the timeline for the appointment of a new Inspector of Prisons so that we do not have an interregnum during which there may be a lack of transparency.  Is that information available?  The role of the Inspector of Prisons will expand when we ratify the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, OPCAT, which will extend inspections to other places of detention.  Will the inspector take on that role?  Does the Minister have a timeline for ratifying OPCAT?</p></speech>

As he outlined, the current Inspector of Prisons will finish her work shortly.  We are going through that process and hope to have a person recommended in the coming months or potentially weeks, and sooner rather than later.  The increased funding is to acknowledge the significant work that is carried out by the Inspector of Prisons and to acknowledge the workload which is still increasing and will increase further, based on the OPCAT legislation the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  We have a framework for the Inspector of Prisons being developed.  Launched in September 2020, it sets out how we conduct inspections of prisons in Ireland.  It is informed by statutory underpinning of the legislation.  We have national legislation relating to prisoners and prisoners' rights as well.  All of this comes under the remit of the inspector.  It also draws upon the relevant International human rights standards, in particular the preventative approach and standards set out by OPCAT and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</p> <p>  In the next year or two, all places of detention will be included in the remit for the inspector, not just prisons but perhaps also Garda stations where people are detained.  A number of things are happening in regard to upgrading our legislation, ratifying certain European protocols and ensuring that when this change takes place, the Office of the Inspector of Prisons will have the capacity to take on this additional workload on top of its already difficult workload.  For this reason, the office's budget has been increased by &euro;750,000, bringing it up to &euro;1.954 million overall.</p></speech>

Significant work is being done on the new strategy and the link with how services have been covered with Tusla.  On a related point in respect of the youth justice strategy and the Garda youth diversion office, one of the big problems over the years has been follow-up with Tusla where a decision is taken not to prosecute a child but to refer him or her for therapy, counselling or Tusla-based welfare follow-ups.  Historically, the monitoring of the follow-up has been weak.  I am flagging more than anything else because I know so much has been invested in the youth justice strategy.  We need to make sure those Tusla follow-ups are monitored in some way to ensure they take place.  There is not much point in choosing not to prosecute a child because he or she needs a welfare-based intervention if nobody checks how the decision is followed up.</p> <p>  Similarly with the prisons, as Deputy Costello mentioned, there has not been a report of the Inspector of Prisons report for some time for various reasons, which is a pity.  I could be wrong but it could be four or five years at this point.  The visiting committees have not been working well recently.  When the suite of legislation is being considered, will there be some capacity to mandate a timeliness, or regularity, as to when that report is done?  This would enhance transparency.</p> <p>  The community safety innovation fund is a fantastic initiative.  When will it open?  I was really only flagging the other issues while we have the opportunity to do so.</p></speech>

This will involve Tusla working with Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth but also that, where there are issues that need to be resolved, we have a structure in place to enable Departments to come together to resolve them.  Often when there are many Departments and agencies are involved, things fall down.</p></speech>

While it is not at the level of the Minister, to take the example of the efficiency of the service level agreements, if they are not being resolved until November of the calendar year, by whatever agency is involved, that makes delivery very difficult.  Similarly, multi-annual funding as opposed to year-on-year funding is among the important structural changes on the ground that impact enormously on the ability for managers to concentrate on doing the job.</p></speech>

This is extremely important for many reasons.  I hope that each individual community will have an opportunity to identify what its priorities are, what innovative ways it can apply to protect the community and respond to the issues in the locality.  The fund will be open to community groups and organisations.  I urge people to look at what already exists, how that is working and how they could potentially identify something new.  This is about new innovative ways, not about filling a gap where funding does not exist elsewhere.  It is not about providing current spending where perhaps there has been a drop in support.  It is about new innovative ways individuals can identify for how they can help keep the community safe.  Of course, individual groups can also look at the issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, safe spaces and working closely with local councils here.</p> <p>  We have three community safety partnership pilots and a group in Drogheda, which came together following Vivian Guerin's report.  In future, each individual community safety partnership will include representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, education, local authorities, Tusla and community services.  I hope they will be able to apply to this fund, for which &euro;2 million has been provided this year.  Over the years, I hope this will increase significantly and there will be further funding for groups to apply for.</p></speech>

I note the increase in funding for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC.  One of the biggest difficulties many people have with GSOC is that the inquiries it carries out often require that it second members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from other areas to do investigations.  There is certainly an impression among people who make complaints.  We are all adults and we know that people who do not get a satisfactory outcome to their complaint are not going to be satisfied.  However, some people have a grievance that they believe to be legitimate feel they are not dealt with appropriately.  Part of that is the way in which these inquiries are carried out.  I hope GSOC will have its own staff to do this kind of work, that these staff will be properly trained and that GSOC will have a greater level of independence and separation from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than is currently the case.  I invite the Minister to comment on that.</p> <p>  The other issue I will raise relates to the Mental Health Criminal Law Review Board.  Many people who work in the criminal justice system, whether in the courts or in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, see that many of the repeat offenders who come before the courts have difficulties with addiction and mental health.  Many of these difficulties are interlinked, for example, people may have become psychotic because of drug addiction.  There is a range of issues there.  At the moment, the services available to such people are poor.  It is widely recognised that while some improvements have occurred in recent years, we are still a long way from a satisfactory situation in regard to that.  The zero increase in funding for the review board, which I accept only considers cases, reflects the huge amount of work to be done to bring this area up to the standard needed to protect people with mental health problems who end up before the courts and often in jail where they should not be.</p><p>There is a huge amount of work to be done in respect of bringing that up to the standard that we need to protect people who have mental health problems, end up before the courts system and often end up in jail, where they should not be at all.  It compounds their condition and destroys their lives, in effect, in many cases.  It is a real issue that we need to look at.</p><p> The other issue I wish to raise concerns the crime prevention measures.  There is zero increase in respect of that.  I point to the case that is ongoing at the moment in my own constituency in Sligo.  It concerns an elderly man who was attacked in his home recently and is currently on life support.  The garda&iacute; are doing their best to find the culprits.  However, it has certainly heightened that sense of fear and vulnerability among elderly people, particularly those living alone in rural and isolated areas.  While it may not be under the remit of the Minister's Department, I suggest that from somewhere in government, additional measures need to be put in place in respect of  providing security, greater protection and perhaps cameras and that type of thing.  Assistance should be provided for pensioners who are alone in rural areas to help them to get a greater sense of security around that.  That is not to separate the issue from the fact that we need more garda&iacute; and, of course, a more visible Garda presence in rural areas.  That is certainly a direction that we need to go in.  I will leave it at that for the moment, but I will come back with other questions afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-02-08a.1029" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2022020800002#G00200"><p>On GSOC, acknowledging the workload and the need to continuously expand and support the work that it does, the budget has increased by around 19% from last year.  That is quite a significant increase.  I believe the budget has increased by &euro;2.133 million, bringing it to &euro;13.406 million.  GSOC is obviously independent in its function and its work.  What we will be moving to do in the new Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill, which is obviously quite a significant Bill looking at all areas of reform across An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, is to strengthen the role of GSOC as an ombudsman.  Obviously, there will be particular discussion happening in the months ahead on that reform and how we can make sure that GSOC, remaining independent, has the supports, the structures and the legislative support that it needs to continue to do its job to the best of its ability.</p> <p>  On the mental health element, it was a programme for Government commitment to establish a task force to look at mental health in our prisons.  I suppose it is about looking at what is often a revolving door situation, where people come in and out.  When they leave, they do not have the appropriate supports and they are in contact with the Probation Service.  We must look at what can we do.  I and the Minister for Health, along with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Feighan, have come together with our Departments.  There is a group that is being chaired by Kathleen Lynch, the former Minister of State with special responsibility for primary care, mental health and disability.  For the past year, the group has been looking at all elements of this right down to the type of support that is provided in prisons.  We know that there are many people who are not appropriately housed.  They should be in Dundrum or perhaps other facilities, but there is not the scope or the space for them.  We must also ensure that the appropriate supports are there for those who do need to be in prison and that they are supported when they come out into the community.  In terms of the spend and the requirement from that, we will have recommendations in the coming months from the task force.  Some of that will fall under my own remit, most likely in the areas of probation and the prison service, but a lot of it will also fall under the remit of the Department of Health.  That is why there are three Ministers in the Department who are very much involved in that.</p> <p>  In terms of crime prevention, this morning I spoke of what happened in the last few days.  It is unthinkable than a man living on his own in his home, who had every right to feel and to be safe, was attacked viciously.  We need to take a number of actions here.  We need to make sure that our Garda numbers continue to increase.  As I outlined at the outset, that is happening.  There will be an additional 800 garda&iacute; this year, 100 of whom are just coming out of Templemore.  We must ensure that those who are working behind desks but should be out on the ground are allowed to do just that.  That is why there will be an increase in civilian staff also.  We must ensure that there are focused and targeted operations in our towns, villages and rural areas.  Operation Thor, which has been under way for some time now, is specifically focusing on supporting and protecting rural communities.  We also need to focus on the new development of the community safety partnerships, which will allow individual communities to identify what it is that they need and want to help keep themselves safe.  The issue of cameras has obviously been very much discussed in recent weeks.  In that regard, there is work that needed to be done, because of new GDPR legislation that came into force in 2018, to ensure that the councils working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and community groups can apply the law in the correct way.  We must ensure that where surveillance is required or where community groups seek to have cameras put up in their locality, they are in line with national and European legislation, and that they support the Garda to do the work that it needs to do, while also protecting people's rights and their right to their own privacy.  There are a number of issues to consider here.  The incident to which the Deputy referred should not have happened.  It should not be tolerated.  I might ask anyone who has information, no matter how small they might feel it is, to come forward.  It is an ongoing investigation, and supporting the Garda in that regard is hugely important.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  On the &euro;1 million that has been provided for the Garda to upgrade its divisional protective services units, will the Minister expand on that for us?  I listened very attentively this morning to the Minister's interview on "Morning Ireland" regarding last night's documentary on RT&Eacute;.  I am conscious of the fact that my own constituency is one of the areas that does not have a refuge for women.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say that she intends to almost quadruple the number of beds that are available for women and families who find themselves in that situation.  Is that part of the &euro;4.9 million in extra funding that is being provided?  I also listened very attentively to the Minister saying that she will be leading on a response to domestic violence.  The issue crosses so manyDepartments.   It is an issue that was very clearly presented here by Safe Ireland and Mary McDermott when she spoke about the fact that there are so many different Government Departments that feed into the issue, including the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Justice and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I ask the Minister to provide us with details on how the work is coming together.  Are we finally going to have one Department that will be responsible for addressing the issue in an adequate way, so that organisations such as Safe Ireland have one Department that they can go to, or are we still going to be in a situation where three or four different Departments deal with the issue?  On the Tusla report that we are still waiting on, does the Minister have any idea when that will be coming to Cabinet?  When will the full audit of where the gaps are be completed?</p> <p>  My last question concerns the community safety innovation fund.  It is very welcome.  I am wondering if that will support local community crime prevention groups.  I am thinking, in particular, of the local crime prevention community groups that feed into our joint policing committees and local authorities.  They do not actually have any funds, so they have to look further afield.  For example, in respect of the property marking scheme and the provision of signage for it, unless the Garda and the local authority have that support, they do not have any source of funds.  Perhaps the Minister could expand on that as well.</p></speech>

It is provided to ensure that those who are working in the units have adequate provisions and the resources that they need.  Some will require additional building capacity and space.  That is something that we can address as part of the wider capital plan.  The &euro;1 million funding is simply to make sure that those who are working in a very difficult area &ndash; because this is not just about looking at domestic and sexual violence, but historic and current sexual abuse cases, online child sex abuse and all of these different areas &ndash; have the relevant technology, equipment, resources and support that they need.  Touching on Deputy Kenny's point, unfortunately, we will probably need more funding to build on that in the years to come.  The &euro;1 million funding is very much an acknowledgement that we need to start.</p> <p>  On the &euro;5.4 million, the funding that is currently in my Department for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence totals around &euro;13 million.  None of that is for refuge or delivery of services.  All of that funding comes under Tusla.  Last year, &euro;30 million was spent on the delivery of services to accommodate around 140 spaces.  We will need a multiple of that.  In the coming weeks, the responsibility for the delivery of service and refuge space will move to the Department of Justice.  We will set out very clearly what that structure will look like and how we intend to deliver those services.  The accommodation review will be brought to Cabinet next week.  As part of the process, I will meet with front-line workers and the community and voluntary sector to go through the accommodation review with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, because it is still very much part of his Department with Tusla.  The intention is that in the short and medium term and as part of the launch of the third national strategy, that will bring together all the different strands.</p><p>The accommodation piece and refuge is just one element of tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, albeit a huge part of it overall.</p><p> In terms of the community safety fund, as I mentioned at the outset, what it is not intended to do is to substitute funding for groups that are there on a day-to-day or yearly basis.  It is intended for community groups to identify new and innovative projects that are perhaps once-off, but which are distinct and separate from activities or organisations that are already functioning or operating.  It will not fill a gap where funding is not provided.  Again, I would ask people to still apply.  Every application will be taken on its merit and the criteria will be set out very clearly in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I suggest that we link in with local authorities to see what other types of safe environments and accommodation can be provided for women other than refuges, and that we find something that is appropriate for different areas and needs.</p></speech>

With the publication of the accommodation review next week, what we will make clear is that while nine counties do not have refuge spaces at all, that is not necessarily where the immediate need is and there may be a crossover.  We need to look at where there is a lack of capacity, and at where there are already refuges spaces but a significant need for further and additional ones.</p> <p>  What we do not want to do, and what I do not want to do, in responding to a short-term demand, is to identify possible accommodation that is not suitable, that does not have the wrap-around supports and services that are needed, and that will not fit into a longer-term model, which is really what we need to do here.  We need to plan longer term.</p> <p>  On the structure that currently exists, which we are very much working on it at the moment, it is a bottom-up approach.  Organisations have to come forward.  They have to be designated as an approved housing body.  They have to apply through the capital assistance scheme, CAS, which is the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  They have to go through a very difficult and lengthy process.  If one does not have an organisation that comes forward then there will be no refuge.  We need to look at that and amend the model.  We also need to possibly look at a number of ways in which a refuge, accommodation units or spaces can be provided.  That may include the Government or our agencies intervening as well.</p> <p>  There are various different elements of work under way at the moment to identify all of those gaps and needs.  I will outline them in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

It is a large constituency but it has no refuge service.  We have gone through the process exactly as described by the Minister.  The difficulty we have reached is to find suitable accommodation that is available.  As Deputy Smyth said, it is a subtle and nuanced task because not all accommodation is suitable.  One needs accommodation that is safe and geographically subtle because people are at risk.  In addition, any accommodation needs to be imbedded in the community in a subtle way.  One can have multiple sites that are gently integrated into a community as opposed to something too obvious.   The process is very difficult and it is certainly something that we would strongly welcome in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, as part of the accommodation review.</p></speech>

While there are a number of excellent people working between Tusla and the organisations, it is not happening and not working fast enough so we have to look at all options.</p></speech>

She appealed to the ombudsman and she was not happy with the response.  Since then, the Garda has reopened an investigation.  Perhaps there is a difficulty with independence.  Are there plans to recruit more investigators from overseas?  I ask because it is unsatisfactory for an inspector or a superintendent from a neighbouring district to conduct an investigation.  Whether an investigation is done properly, there is the perception sometimes that it is not fully independent.  Are there plans to recruit investigators from abroad?</p> <p>  Finally, I see that the budget for the Office of the Inspector of Prisons is increasing but there still is no complaints system in place.  Are there plans to introduce a complaints system from within the prisons?</p></speech>

There are reports that were signed off in the last few days.  The delay has been due to the fact that the inspector has not been able to get into the prisons and inspect in the way that she would have previously.  There are reports that will be published in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  In terms of the ombudsman, while I cannot comment on an individual case the office of the ombudsman is 100% independent in role and function, and in the work that it does.  It goes without saying that the work it does will require engagement with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na because of its very nature.  What we want to ensure, through the new legislation, is that we can strengthen, support and provide additional resources, where necessary, to the new ombudsman.  I am not sure whether the name will change.  Obviously, the focus is to make sure that the office continues with its independent nature, and that it is resourced and supported as much as possible.  Again, that would probably require expansion and additional individuals to work within the commission.  As always, we will go through the normal process and it will be an open process where anybody can apply, whether they are from this country or elsewhere.</p> <p>  Can I come back to the Deputy on the other question on the timeline for a complaints mechanism? </p></speech>

Gambling is one of the problem hidden addictions in this country, and I suppose that applies to most of the western world.  In addition, much of it has now moved online.  In regard to the ability to hold the big corporate companies, which run much of this stuff online, to account and bring adequate enforcement to the gaming scene, the budget seems quite small.  Will the Minister indicate the plans for all of that?</p><p>I refer to subhead B10.  I see that funding for the Coroner Service has increased.  As I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge, there have been problems with the availability of a coroner service for a considerable length of time.  There is no coroner in some counties and there is a coroner's office in some counties that functions in a very <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  Outside of Dublin, the coroner service is almost a non-professional type of organisation so I think there needs to be a refocus on reforming the entire process.  I am sure most people would agree that there are problems, even those who works in the service.  While the increase in resources is welcome, it is still a long way from where it would need to be to bring the kind of reform that is required.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, is working on bringing forward legislation, which he hopes to have enacted by the end of the year.</p> <p>  To show our intent in this regard, there was initial seed funding of &euro;200,000 allocated and then a further &euro;500,000 for this year.  The increase shows the intent but obviously the legislation must come before that.  I know a huge amount of work and focus, within the legislation, acknowledges the online element of gambling and how it has changed form in recent years.  Obviously, that is something the regulator will deal with directly.  While the funding this year may seem small, it is seed funding and intent funding to show what the overall objective is, and what will be more likely next year and the year after.</p><p>Regarding the Coroner Service, the Deputy will appreciate that the coroners are independent in their functions, conduct and how they carry out their work.  As a result of Covid-19, many services have been seriously curtailed.  I appreciate that it has impacted on many cases and decisions and has had a severe impact on families and the timelines in which they expect to have the results.  We have had what are referred to as documentary inquests or remote inquests, in the same way that, across the justice sector, everybody has tried to digitalise and work remotely to be able to respond to the evolving situation with Covid-19.  I think, bar a small number of cases, the vast majority of families have agreed to progress in this way.</p><p> Regarding the situation in the Dublin coronial district, we have a second coroner and two new deputy coroners were appointed in February 2022.  Further, we have the Civil and Criminal Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which specifically looked at the assignment and appointment of temporary coroners to act simultaneously with other coroners in exceptional circumstances.  This was to try to deal with the capacity.  We are continuously trying to update, review and amend, but taking into account that coroners are independent in their role and function, we have to try to support them.  The last two years have been particularly difficult for them in carrying out their work.</p></speech>

Subhead A15 is Legal Aid (Criminal) and subhead A16 is Legal Aid - Custody Issues.  The question also covers forensic science to some extent and subhead A23, commissions and special inquiries.  In the Supplementary Estimates last year, we increased the amount available to the Department for legal aid.  There was a significant fall, particularly in subhead A16, if my figures are correct, of 38.46%.  It is a significant underspend in that area.  The same could be said for the criminal legal aid criminal too.  Does the Minister want to comment on that?  Is there a specific reason for that?</p></speech>

It is always difficult to predict the final outturn for the year.  It depends on the volume of legal aid certificates that are issued and the length and complexities of cases, especially in the Circuit Court and higher courts.  In 2020, the expenditure was in the region of &euro;62 million.  The original allocation for 2021 was &euro;69 million, which was increased through a technical Supplementary Estimate process to &euro;77 million.  The actual expenditure for last year was &euro;72.7 million.  This is demand-led so it is hard to predict how that will change.  The legal aid custody issue, as the Chair outlined, is a more significant drop of 38%.  The original Estimate for 2021 was &euro;3 million, which increased, through a further Supplementary Estimate process, by &euro;3.5 million, to &euro;6.5 million.  Actual expenditure was around &euro;6 million, including arrears of approximately &euro;1.5 million, which will not occur again.  It is demand-led and included once-off payments.</p></speech>

It may be one of the few professions which has still not received that restoration.  Does the Minister want to comment on that?

I meet regularly with legal representatives about quite a number of issues regarding to legal aid.  What I committed to last year and what we are working towards now is a review of civil legal aid in particular, acknowledging that there are challenges within the structure as it currently exists.  That is obviously separate from the funding for those who carry out the functions.  There are a number of things that we need to deal with.  I am aware of it and am engaging with the sector about it.  We have legislation on criminal legal aid.  We need to make sure that if we review civil legal aid that we have the particulars to be able to support and work with the people who will be able to access the legal aid.</p></speech>

I am pleased that an additional &euro;2.4 million has been made available to increase investment in medical, mental health, psychology and other services to a vulnerable group in our prison system following a number of reviews including the health needs assessment and the Commission for the Prevention of Torture review.  This is in line with the Government's commitment to reduce the rate of reoffending and to improve community safety.  Additional funding of &euro;4 million has also been provided across a range of other areas to in respect of ICT, cybercrime and other operational costs including payroll.</p> <p>  While the redevelopment of Limerick Prison has been impacted by the Covid restrictions in 2020 and 2021, significant progress has been made.  The capital allocation in 2022 will enable the completion of this project, which will provide additional capacity for 40 female prisoners as well as a new wing to Limerick male prison, which will have additional capacity for 90 male prisoners.  It will completely upgrade and modernise Limerick Prison, as well as eliminating the practice of slopping out.</p> <p>  I acknowledge also the impact that Covid-19 has had on the operations of the Prison Service and the collective efforts that have been made by the Irish Prison Service staff, management, prisoners and Red Cross volunteers to contain and minimise the impact of the virus.  The infection prevention and control teams that are in place in all prisons have made a significant contribution to the handling of the virus, which is particularly challenging in the closed environment of a prison.  I commend the work that has been done and recognise the difficulties the virus, including the most recent Omicron strain, has caused for staff, prisoners and their families.</p></speech>

Clearly, the Omicron variant got us all in one way or another.  The Prison Service did exceptional work in an enclosed environment.  I want to question the remaining Covid restrictions, insofar as they are in place.  I understand that family visits have started again recently, which is positive and welcome.  Is there now full access for legal representatives for consultations?  It is an ongoing question.  Will the Minister come back on that point?  Deputy Bacik and I co-chair the Oireachtas penal reform group and it is a question that continues to come up.  Family visits are so important.  Will the Minister clarify the position on legal visits?  Will she discuss the timing of the completion of work at Limerick Prison, please?</p></speech>

Family visits have returned, but not to full capacity in every prison, because, as people may be aware, outbreaks are still happening within our prisons, and it is important that the Prison Service is able to manage those.  The intention is to get back to full capacity as soon as possible, acknowledging that, for some, the use of a hybrid model or video links is also satisfactory.  That feeds into the work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service are doing, working with the Prison Service on the modernisation programme.  It is not necessarily always the case that a prisoner needs to travel, whether to a court or to a Garda station, to carry out the judicial process.  We need to take some of the positive elements of the changes that have happened and apply them.  That is beneficial not just for the prisoners, but also for resources, funding, timing, and managing a more effective system between the courts, garda&iacute; and the Prison Service.</p> <p>  It is extremely important that family are allowed to visit.  Where possible, that has been resumed, but it has to take on board the fact that outbreaks are still happening.</p></speech>

Family visits are so important, for obvious reasons, but so is the taking of legal instructions.</p><p>It is understandable in the context of the broader modernisation programme that it is not necessary for people to attend every court appearance.  That may particularly be the case on the criminal side of things.  On the family law side of things, though, cases involving many prisoners are heard in the District Court in Dolphin House, such as childcare proceedings, for example.  It could be important for those involved to be able to be present to articulate their cases.  I ask that the Department follow up in this regard and ensure that this aspect is resumed as quickly as possible.  There is as much need to give and take legal instruction in those family cases as there is in criminal justice cases.  It is not possible to replicate the process over Zoom in perpetuity.  It is not possible to give advice or take instructions in the same way through that medium.  Family visits are the priority, but, equally, I urge that, where possible, visits where legal advice can be given and taken be resumed as quickly as possible as well.   </p></speech>

This is in addition to &euro;3.648 million of unspent capital being carried over from 2021.  The allocation of a further &euro;1 million for the new courts modernisation programme builds on &euro;8 million already provided in the Estimates in 2021 and retained in 2022.  The ongoing courts modernisation programme is focused on designing court services around the user, leveraging digital technology to streamline services and processes and, ultimately, delivering a courts system which is more accessible to all.</p> <p>  I am committed to driving the modernisation and digital first agenda across the entire justice sector.  I particularly welcome the commitment set out by the Courts Service to maximise the use of digital technologies to provide an improved and user-centred service.  Throughout the pandemic, the Judiciary and the Courts Service have worked closely together and innovated through the use of technology to maintain the highest level of court activity possible, with a particular focus on families, victims of domestic abuse and people who are most vulnerable at this time.  I expect that the progress made on new ways of working will be maintained in future.</p></speech>

Representatives of different groups have appeared before our committee, and before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and have spoken about the difficulty with access to justice because of a lack of translation services.  These services can be <i>ad hoc</i>.  My experience in using translators is that sometimes they can be excellent, while at other times they can be deeply unprofessional.  There is no overarching mechanism to regulate this area.  This point is a bit outside the content of the Estimates, but any courts modernisation programme must ensure and improve access to translators.  Is there anything in these Estimates that we can use to increase and improve access to translation services?</p><p>When it comes to the courts, as well, I am conscious of the number of judges we have and ultimately, the lack of judges.  The European average of judges <i>per capita</i>is about 20 judges per 100,000 of the population.  In Ireland, the equivalent figure is 3.3 judges per 100,000 people.  I was talking to one barrister who practises in criminal law who had a bail hearing in January this year and the trial is scheduled for March 2024.  There is a huge backlog.  The impact of Covid-19 is contributing to this but so is a lack of judges.  This is the case at all levels of the judicial system.  The President of the High Court asked for an additional 17 judges and we were able to give her five more.  Equally, the District Court and the Circuit Court have as much of a demand for the allocation of more judges.  The addition of judges with no fixed circuit or district would mean they could move around and go to where the backlogs are to help us to be more flexible.  I am aware that I cannot fully appreciate if that is possible under the current structures, but something like that is desperately needed to ensure that someone will not be waiting for two and a half years for a trial.  That type of situation impacts on the accused and on the victim.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I will have to respond later to the Deputy on whether those funds cover the costs for translators.  In the last year, however, we have allocated &euro;9 million specifically for the courts modernisation programme, and I would be surprised if translation did not form part of that overall allocation or if the requisite funding could not be found within that allocation.  I accept the Deputy's point that a lack of access to a translator means that it is not possible for someone to realise their right to have a fair trial and due process.  I will follow this up with the Courts Service.</p> <p>  Regarding judges, we were able to allocate six new High Court judges following the request that was made.  I appreciate, however, that is not enough in the context of the overall structure and system.  A group chaired by Brigid McManus is looking at the overall number of judges and how many might ultimately be required.  The group is also examining new types of structures and court structures which will have specialised judges.  My Department and I are also working towards a new family courts Bill, which will identify new courts' structures specifically for family law cases.  We wish to have specific judges who will only be working on family law issues and who are trained in this area.</p> <p>  Therefore, we must do several things.  We must increase the number of judges and increase specialisation among judges.  Equally, we must maintain the changes which have occurred in respect of modernisation.  We have moved on from the days when many people would go into a courtroom on a particular date not knowing whether they would be heard that day, and perhaps then having to return to same courtroom only for the same thing to happen several times.  We must build on the changes that have happened and on the positive approaches that have been taken in the context of the modernisation programme.  I should have an initial report on the number of judges by Easter.  I would assume that I will be bringing recommendations based on that report to Cabinet once I have spoken to my colleagues in other Departments.</p></speech>

Our <i>per capita </i>number of judges is low compared with the rest of Europe and other countries that use common law.  That is certainly a concern.  It is a theme that has emerged in multiple hearings of this committee in the last 18 months.  The lack of judges has arisen as an issue even in unexpected areas.  The number of judges across the system is impacting a wide variety of justice issues.  It is a matter that has attracted recurring comment in this committee, so I am glad to hear that it is being positively addressed in the Department under the direction of the Minister.  I call Deputy Daly.</p></speech>

I think the payment for the Criminal Courts of Justice, CCJ, takes up about &euro;27 million of that total, but I could be corrected on that figure.  Does the Minister think this spending is still good value for money?  It seems to be the model that is entrenched in the Department for the construction of any future court buildings.</p> <p>  I turn now to Tralee Courthouse.  In that context, I welcome and look forward to the proposed family law changes.  I also welcome the amendments and changes that have facilitated the smooth running of the courts during this pandemic, such as the remote hearings, which have helped victims and witnesses.  Even prisoners do not have to travel for relatively mundane remands.  The situation on the ground in Kerry, however, is that the forthcoming Circuit Court criminal trials, which commence for five weeks at the end of this month, are still going to be held in Limerick.  It means that members of the Garda, witnesses, family members, and defendants must all travel out of the county.  That is inconvenient for the people involved and for criminal justice.</p><p>It is not good for business around the town because business from juries and everyone else involved in the courts is leaving the county.</p><p> Could the Minister give a commitment that criminal trials will be returned to Tralee as soon as possible?  I did put a proposal to the head of the Courts Service prior to Christmas, which was to go before the buildings committee in December, to say there is another building available across the road, the old Kerry Protestant Hall, which could be used for family law.  Has that alternative been considered yet by the Courts Service in order that we could refurbish the existing court building?  That would free up the Island of Geese site for other positive additional benefits to the town centre, following on from the Government commitment to invest in town centres.</p></speech>

What I have seen in the past is that PPP projects tend to start and be delivered within the timeframe that is set out.  It is important that we are commencing such significant projects, Hammond Lane being one example, and that we know there is a start, middle and end and that when the projects finish they will come in on time and, most importantly, on budget.</p> <p>  In terms of the criminal trials, we met with the Courts Service in the past week, and we were assured that they would resume.  It is important that there is a phased return where there is still a level of uncertainty and people who are vulnerable, in particular when juries are being sworn in, as we have seen with work in various Departments the length and breadth of the country.  The intention is that criminal trials will resume in their original courthouses as soon as possible.  It is being done on a phased basis for the very reasons I have outlined, namely, that there are still people who are vulnerable and there is still Covid.  We must take all of that into account.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a lot of engagement locally in respect of Tralee courthouse between the council, the OPW and my Department.  A decision was taken through the council that the Island of Geese site was identified as the most appropriate.  My understanding is that there are still discussions happening between the council and the OPW on what might potentially happen with the current building and what is required to do that.  The intention is for the work to progress as quickly as possible in these instances, particularly as it has been going on for some time.</p></speech>

Does she think it is good value for money to spend &euro;38 million per year?  My understanding is that the Criminal Courts of Justice cost &euro;27 million per year for 25 years when it was constructed in the late noughties, which is a total amount of nearly half a billion euro.  I do not think that is good value for money.  There are various views about how effective the building is.</p></speech>

PPPs are only progressed if they provide value for money.  To go back to my original point, in the vast majority of cases, they have been delivered on time and within budget.  New PPP projects will only be approved if they are going to provide value for money and if they can be delivered.  I apologise that I cannot comment specifically on individual cases.  I am not clear on what the initial costs were and what, potentially, the current costs may be.</p></speech>

This is part of a PPP bundle that includes Macroom and Clonmel Garda stations.  Significant work has already taken place and the intention is that building will start next year.  It is a significant investment.  What we have seen, especially in Dublin, when it comes to the family courts in Dolphin House and other places, is that there has been a lack of investment in recent years and the delivery of the new facility will be very welcome for the many people who need the services.</p></speech>

A gross estimate of &euro;23.3 million is being made available to the Data Protection Commission, which is Vote 44.  This allocation includes an increase of &euro;4.1 million or 21.5% compared with the previous year.  The Data Protection Commission budget has increased significantly in recent years, as the responsibilities and functions of the office have expanded also, as the lead supervisory authority to the various multinational organisations which have their European headquarters within the State.  The largest aspect of the budget relates to staffing costs of almost &euro;16 million, with legal expenses accounting for approximately another &euro;2 million of the budget.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that this committee produced a report on the commission.  We had people like Mr. Schrems attending the committee.  The Minister will also be aware of the ongoing debate and concerns as to the effectiveness and capacity of the Irish Data Protection Office to manage effectively all of Europe's data sets.  By extension, there is a potential threat to our economic offering, which is grounded in having tech centres and multinational tech companies in Ireland because it is the gateway to Europe in those jurisdictions.  If there was to be any slippage in terms of those operations looking elsewhere, including for data protection regimes, as is beginning to happen in certain quarters in Europe, that could jeopardise our economic offering.  It is a specific concern for a number of reasons.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with the committee's report on this from last year.  I welcome the increased funding of 25%.  That is positive.  Perhaps the Minister would like to make a brief comment on that at the outset.</p></speech>

It is seeing a significant increase in staff and there is an ongoing competition as well in that area to recruit additional staff.  In the past six months, my Department has said we will look at the potential of increasing the number of commissioners from one to three.  That does not require legislation, as the legislation has already been approved and passed in that regard.  I will be making a decision on that very shortly.</p> <p>  Separately, while I do not comment on individual cases or the work of the commissioner, I met recently with the Commissioner responsible for this brief and remit at a European level, Didier Reynders.  He was very clear that the work the commission and the team are carrying out is very much in line with the rules, regulations and legislation that was set out at a European level.</p> <p>  My role is to ensure that the commission is resourced and funded to the best of its ability.  I hope the increase in funding and the expansion of the staff working within the commission's office, and the possible expansion of the commissioners is a clear indication of that support.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue.  As has been said, we are the lead supervising authority, but to be honest, our European friends have been very open and clear in their criticism of the Data Protection Commissioner here, so much so that they are trying to find ways around the role of Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner as the lead supervisory authority.  They are trying to side-step us because we are seen as a block to effective administration of the general data protection regulation.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the commitment to review the number of commissioners.  I was about to refer to the commitment to more commissioners, but I know that decision has not been made yet, so I must choose my words carefully.  That was a recommendation of this committee, and it is very important.</p> <p>  One of the other recommendations of the committee was a review of the policies and procedures within the Data Protection Commission.  I appreciate it is an independent office and it is not within the Minister's ability to demand anything, but I hope if any review or consultancy is required to be paid for in terms of policies or procedures that the Minister would commit to funding it if need be.</p></speech>

It is an important area.  Because we headquarter so many of the big corporate centres of data and have a lot of data storage in the country, it is obviously something we must take very seriously.</p> <p>  Even in the engagements we had when we were preparing the report, we recognised there were issues that needed to be dealt with and required attention.  Many people cannot understand how the Data Protection Commissioner is so active in talking to communities that have cameras up to prevent crime and yet does not seem to be as active in other areas in which people would be much more satisfied if she took a greater role, in particular when we look at cybercrime and some of the very violent and sexual online content that is available for children and so forth.</p> <p>  There is a huge area about which we have to be very serious about and put the resources in to ensure we can lead in it.  Our credibility as a centre of tech will depend on how we can regulate that centre of tech.  We need to be conscious of that.  While the increase is certainly welcome, it is a reflection of the direction in which it needs to go.  We need to accelerate that and ensure we live up to the standards we set ourselves by being a centre of tech in this country.  We have invited so many companies here.  We have so much data passing through Ireland from all of Europe.  We cannot just simply ignore our responsibilities in respect of all that.</p></speech>

The conversation I had recently with the commissioner around this very clearly shows that the commission is operating within the data protection legislation, that is, the Data Protection Act, which was passed in 2018.  Obviously, that is what we would expect from an independent Data Protection Commission.</p></speech>

I refer to the CCTV community scheme that was available for community groups throughout the country.  This was in the previous D&aacute;il term before the Minister's time in the Department of Justice.  There was an issue around the protection of data.  The Minister's Department was rolling out the funds for this through our justice and policing committees, JPCs, to local community groups.  There was a reluctance between the local authorities and the Garda in terms of who would actually be the data holders.  At the time, the direction from the Department of Justice was that responsibility rested with the local authority.  Has that ever been resolved?  Is that scheme still being rolled out from the Minister's Department?</p></speech>

It had been working off Garda legislation from 2015 and, obviously, the changes meant that much of the work that was being carried out was incompatible and issues had arisen.</p> <p>  The legislation that will be and is currently being progressed, which also includes the body-worn cameras, will address this particular concern.  In parallel with that is a programme for Government commitment that we will engage with our county councils and communities to make sure that, when this legislation has passed and the changes that are needed are made, it is very clear how communities, local councils and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can work together to make sure, if there is a decision to implement a new community CCTV scheme, it is very clearly set out who is responsible for what.  That work is ongoing.  The legislation is due to be published in this term and we will progress it throughout the year.  I hope to have it enacted by the end of the year.</p></speech>

That was once-off funding under the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald.  Significant funding had been allocated at the time.  Since the difficulties and challenges have arisen, however, it is my understanding that this funding is not being provided currently.</p></speech>
