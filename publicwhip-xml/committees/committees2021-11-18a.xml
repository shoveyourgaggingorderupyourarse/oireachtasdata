The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all others in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending the meeting physically and to use the sanitisers provided.  They should maintain an appropriate level of social distance and masks should be worn at all times, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.</p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 32 - Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 6 re Covid-19 restart grant schemes.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General; Ms Pauline Mulligan, head of corporate services division; Mr. Declan Hughes, head of indigenous enterprise, SME and entrepreneurship division; and Mr. Cathal O'Gorman, finance officer.  From the Department of Public expenditure and Reform, we are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer, and Ms Jessica Lawless, assistant principal, from the Department the of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote section.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure the privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the statements of a witness are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, that witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that such a direction is complied with.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions under Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.</p><p> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. S&eacute;amus McCarthy, to make his opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#B00200"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 32 Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicates gross expenditure of &euro;1.76 billion was incurred in 2020.  This represented an increase of 89% over the 2019 level of expenditure, due mainly to the provision of funding for Covid-19 related schemes.  In a number of expenditure areas, the level of funding provided for Covid-19 related spending was significantly more than was actually required in the year.</p> <p>  The 2020 spending was distributed across three expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme was in jobs and enterprise development.  This accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, or 72% of the total spent in 2020.  Key areas of spending under the programme included &euro;652 million for Covid-19 related business restart grant schemes which was routed through Enterprise Ireland; &euro;192 million in other funding for Enterprise Ireland including its normal programmes; &euro;198 million provided to the IDA; &euro;79 million for local enterprise development; &euro;48 million transferred to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and just under &euro;25 million transferred to Microfinance Ireland, to fund various business loan schemes. </p> <p>  Expenditure on the innovation programme in 2020 was &euro;414 million, which was similar to the level of spending in 2019.  This included spending of &euro;332 million on the science and technology development programme; &euro;24 million on the programme for research in third level institutions; &euro;24 million on subscriptions to international organisations; and &euro;19 million for the &lsquo;disruptive technologies&rsquo; fund.  Expenditure on the business regulation programme was &euro;77 million in 2020, again, similar to the 2019 expenditure level.  This funding supported the direct operation by the Department of certain regulatory functions including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Companies Registration Office and the Patents Office.  Funding was also provided from the programme for independent bodies, such as the Health and Safety Authority, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p> <p>  Receipts into the vote amounted to just under &euro;50 million in 2020.  These substantially relate to fees for services operated by the Department, including employment permit fees in respect of foreign workers; Companies Registration Office filing fees; and trade mark and patent fees.  Receipts also include retained staff pension contributions, both from the Department&rsquo;s own staff, and the staff of agencies under its aegis.  The surplus remaining unspent at the year-end was just over &euro;182 million.  The Department secured the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;106 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;76 million was due for surrender to the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The appropriation account records the cash transactions related to the vote in the year of account.  In addition the vote has incurred a contingent liability arising from the operation of a number of credit guarantee schemes.  This is explained in note 2.9 to the account which indicates that, at 31 December 2020, the Department&rsquo;s maximal exposure under the guarantee schemes was &euro;80 million on outstanding loans totalling &euro;113 million.  This was up from a maximum exposure of &euro;5 million at the end of 2019 on outstanding loans of &euro;30 million. </p> <p>  As outlined in chapter 6, small to medium businesses received grants from Vote 32 totalling around &euro;633 million in respect of interruptions to trading as a result of Covid-19 related restrictions in 2020.  The schemes were operated and funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the payments being made by the relevant local authorities. The funding was routed to the local authorities via Enterprise Ireland.  The purpose of the grant was to assist businesses with costs arising from the restrictions.  Under the scheme provisions, businesses were invited to self-declare their eligibility.  Conditions of the grant included that the business was a commercial enterprise operating from a premises liable to local authority commercial rates; had incurred, or expected to incur, a 25% or more loss of turnover between April and June 2020; intended to retain staff on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and committed to remain open for trading or to reopen.  Businesses were not required to explain how the money was to be used, and vouching for the manner in which the grants were applied was not required.  </p> <p>  A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls.  One of these is the completion of post-payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received.  The conditions of the scheme were such that a significant number of businesses were likely to qualify for the financial assistance available.  Nevertheless there is a risk that claims were submitted and paid where the prescribed conditions were not met.  The Department signalled at the outset of the scheme that reviews of eligibility for the grants would be undertaken, but these have not yet occurred.  As a result, there is no basis of assurance about entitlement of grant recipients to the amounts paid.  At the time of completing this report the Department was in the process of procuring an independent audit of the scheme.  Subsequently, the Department plans to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme.  </p></speech>

I am pleased to be here before the committee this morning.  The Chair has introduced my team and her thank her for that.</p> <p>  As members know 2020 was a year like no other and Covid-19 had an immediate impact on the Department, on the economy and on our citizens, while dealing with Brexit at the same time.  Our budget, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, increased hugely to &euro;1.95 billion which was double our allocation of &euro;977 million in 2019.  This allowed us to roll out significant and targeted supports for enterprise, including the restart and the restart plus grants, the sustaining enterprise fund, the Covid products scheme and the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  It also allowed us to significantly expand other supports such as the working capital and future growth loan schemes and the Microfinance Ireland Covid loans scheme.  In addition we responded with a large number of non-fiscal measures in areas of company regulation, health and safety, workplace relations as well as new advisory supports.  One of the most significant measures was the restart grant scheme.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report, grants to the value of &euro;640 million were paid to enterprises of which &euro;633 million was paid out by ourselves and &euro;7 million by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The local authorities were used to specifically and quickly get that money out to businesses and we provided those businesses impacted by the pandemic with modest amounts of cash.  The aim was to meet the additional costs that all firms incurred due to Covid-19 and to preserve, in particular, economic activity in our country.  It was delivered in conjunction with other Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment.  </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report makes two specific recommendations on auditing and evaluation.  The Department accepts both recommendations and is committed to implementing them.  I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched, and in particular the need to have them available as urgently as possible.  I am very pleased that those schemes, after a Government decision in early May, relaunched on 22 May, which took huge effort by the officials of the Department, and others.</p><p>Apart from the restart schemes, we also rolled out other measures.  Some &euro;98 million was allocated for the sustaining enterprise fund, which assisted 340 businesses to stay in business and contribute to the recovery of our economy.  The online retail scheme was hugely successful.  The business planning voucher, the enterprise centres and the Brexit ready for customs grant were all very important.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland had an overall net loss of 872 jobs but created 16,500 new jobs, with 65% of those jobs based regionally.  IDA Ireland also got specific grant aid for Covid.  That scheme has considerable potential for us into the future.  Notwithstanding the pandemic, IDA Ireland continues to win new investments, with 246 new investments secured last year and 20,000 new jobs.  I am pleased that half of those went to regional locations, which is one of our policy aims.</p><p> The local enterprise offices were very important.  We increased their funding by 170% last year.  The business continuity voucher scheme supported more than 12,000 businesses at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The trading online voucher scheme would, in the recent past, have involved 1,000 vouchers annually.  Last year, vouchers were sent to 13,000 recipients to allow companies to go online.  That was hugely successful for small businesses.  I am delighted to report that employment in that regard totalled 35,000 at local level.</p><p> We also responded significantly in terms of liquidity to business, which was a considerable factor, particularly at the time when banks were not lending.  We provided almost &euro;50 million for the Covid and Brexit working capital loan schemes and the future growth loan scheme.  Those schemes included 3,000 loans to businesses, worth &euro;548 million.</p><p> Probably the most significant was the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  In the first four months it was open, 1,890 loans were given out to a value of &euro;98 million.  The scheme has continued to grow strongly.  We are now at almost 8,000 loans with a value of just over &euro;550 million.</p><p> Microfinance Ireland was key.  It was the first agency to market with a Covid loan fund in March 2020 and 1,300 firms availed of it.  That involved a six-month interest and repayment holiday, as well as reduced interest.  It supported 3,000 jobs.</p><p> We also looked to innovation.  I will later touch on the disruptive technology fund, which funded 43 innovative projects.  We see that as the future for Ireland.</p><p> Apart from direct financial supports, we established a call centre and provided guides for business and a whole range of communications material.  Legislation was to the fore.  We changed company law and employment rights.  We recently introduced a new examinership-lite process, the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, to assist our small and micro companies.</p><p> The Health and Safety Authority is important. It is at the forefront of workplace safety.  It developed the Return to Work Safely Protocol and has revised it several times since.  We are working on it now.  It also took on a new role as the lead agency in co-ordinating compliance right across Government.  All of our agencies and bodies, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Companies Registration Office and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement played vital roles.  They adapted their services.  They were agile and flexible.  They responded, postponed regulatory requirements and provided advice.  </p><p> While the challenges of Covid remain, the reopening of our economy and the return to the workplace has allowed our businesses to get back trading and to remain in business.  Unemployment has fallen from a high of 31.5% in April 2020 to 7.9%.  We are not where we were before the pandemic but we certainly feel that our supports have been key to achieving this progress.</p><p> I note that, with the exception of &euro;6 million provided to the Department at the end of 2020, all of the additional funding was expended solely on business supports.  There were no additional administrative or staffing resources incurred in the Department.  These schemes were developed and delivered under enormous pressure by staff in the Department with our offices and agencies.  The combined efforts were such that we were able to deliver in a timely and efficient manner.  I must put on my record my thanks for the commitment and dedication of those teams.  I am happy to take any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00300"><p>At the outset, I wish Deputy Stanley well in his recovery.  I thank Dr. Quinn for being here.  She has outlined a couple of the key points around the gross expenditure of the Department and its growth in 2020 in comparison to 2019 as the Department reacted to the situation around Covid-19.  Looking at the restart grant, there seems to be quite a number of concerns around the whole process to test eligibility and the effectiveness of its implementation.  That has caused some concern.  The restart grant was important for many businesses and provided them with the financial support they required to reopen.  One could argue that many businesses which felt outside the criteria for that support needed it while others which may not have needed it received the support.  I will ask a couple of questions about the restart grant.  How did it come about in terms of the Department's operations?  How did the notion of providing this type of support arise on day one?  Could Dr. Quinn outline that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00400"><p>I absolutely will.  It arose as a result of many of the meetings we had with stakeholders at that time.  Our advice to Government was that companies were really struggling.  They were struggling to provide the type of Covid equipment that would allow them to remain open.  They were struggling with their banks.  They were struggling with their cash flow because many of them had closed due to Government restrictions.  There was an immediate need to cover fixed costs and the cost of opening, reopening and adapting their businesses.  One of the conditions we were very keen on and that was built into the scheme was that companies would maintain employment.  That was an important factor.  We did not want to wipe out a whole range of small companies.  There are approximately 250,000 small companies in Ireland.  Very many of those are sole traders so they did not come into that scheme.  We were intent on trying to maintain employees in their jobs.  Many of the sole traders qualified under other schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00500"><p>I will interrupt to build on a point that Dr. Quinn was making.  She mentioned there are approximately 250,000 businesses that fit the bill.  In terms of the support scheme, an original estimate expected approximately 80,000 businesses to take up the support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00600"><p>That is right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00700"><p>According to information we have received in briefings, there were approximately 57,500 applications.  Some 49,300 had been approved to a value of approximately &euro;195 million.  Would Dr. Quinn explain the gap between the estimate and the uptake?  What does she feel is the rationale as to why that happened?  As I have said, many businesses that were deserving of support did not receive it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00800"><p>Our estimate was based on the knowledge we had at the time.  We processed over 109,000 applications between the two schemes.  We spent a lot of time with the sector and explaining the schemes to them.  Under the criteria, companies had to be rate payers to qualify.  They had to have a turnover of less than &euro;5 million.  We were aiming this at small businesses and, in the first round, it was for companies with 50 or fewer employees.  It was aimed at the small business sector.  We expanded that in the second round, the restart plus grant.  Eligibility was expanded to include companies with 250 employees because we picked up from our feedback that companies were struggling.  We expanded the scheme to cater for that.  It was based on self-declaration and we made it simple.  We are quite satisfied that the companies which applied were eligible under the criteria we were maintaining.  A huge number of people are listed as small businesses but work in the construction sector or are sole traders.  They came under other schemes organised by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>Just to cover F&aacute;ilte Ireland and bed and breakfast establishments, the latter was another sector that felt excluded.  From our perspective, we were satisfied that we had a scheme that was easy to apply for but that was rigorous in its intent.  We are satisfied, therefore, that we hit the market and that we reached the cohort that we were trying to reach.  There were 57,000 applications in the first round and we approved 85% of them.  Not everybody who applied qualified.  That is a really important point.  Then we had 65,000 in the second round.</p></speech>

She will be aware that I do not have the luxury of time.</p> <p>  In the context of the process relating to the restart grant, the Department's service level agreement with the local authorities provided for the review of the restart grant scheme when approvals across 31 local authorities reached more than &euro;200 million.  Approximately two months after its introduction, the scheme was replaced by the restart grant plus scheme.  In terms of that process, why did it negate the requirement to complete a review from the Department's point of view?  Dr. Quinn outlined that there were some teething problems and issues.  She referred to tourism.  I was going to use that example because there were many non-rate paying businesses there which were excluded that perhaps should have been given that support.  In my view, their exclusion was a great shame.  Many businesses fell by the wayside as a consequence.  On the fact that the Department stated that the process negated the requirement to complete a review, would Dr. Quinn mind outlining to us why that happened?  Does Dr. Quinn think that was proper practice, from an accounting point of view, in the context of the amount of public money involved?</p></speech>

That was our concern at that point.  One needs to bear in mind that this was done under enormous pressure.  The aim was to get the funding out to businesses quickly.  From our perspective, we reviewed on a weekly basis.  We sat down and looked at who was gaining and who was not, and that allowed us to adapt the scheme, as the Deputy pointed out, for other cohorts very quickly.  In the normal course of events, it would take us more than a year to design and roll out a scheme like this.  We did it in a matter of weeks.  I am quite satisfied that the review kept control of the numbers and that we were plugging gaps.</p> <p>  I would also mention again that we adapted it on a number of occasions for various counties that went into lockdown, such as Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  We did extra payouts for the wet pubs at the time in Dublin and Donegal.  In fact, it was a constant review that we were doing to pick up where there were needs.</p> <p>  We were satisfied, as we went in.  Again, we worked very closely with our stakeholders, both in terms of the regular retail and enterprise forums we have.  We were picking up what was happening on the ground.  Obviously, the local authorities were extremely important to us.  They are on the ground and they know exactly what is happening.  That allowed us to adapt and review as we went along.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall review we have committed to doing, it is important to state that we could only carry it out when the scheme was up and running and we had the experience of it.  If we were to review those on an ongoing basis, I can tell the Deputy that businesses would still be waiting for the money.  The latter was not our aim.</p></speech>

Credit is due in many ways with regard to the work the Department has done.  There have obviously been flaws and issues, however, and the job of this committee is to identify them and to try to the processes involved.  That said, we have to acknowledge that there was a lot of very hard work done rapidly to try to help businesses out.  Nobody here disputes that, but, obviously, our duty is to scrutinise both the accounts and the direction of the Department.</p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to use some of the time I have as follows.  Obviously, where we are now compared with where we were two months is very concerning in the context of the situation with Covid.  Can Dr. Quinn give us any outline from her Department's point of view?  What is the Department planning at present in terms of what may come down the line?  Could Dr. Quinn see us going back to a previous situation?  Is the Department making contingency plans for potentially looking at businesses being forced to close again?  Obviously, we have seen that there will be additional restrictions imposed on the nightclub industry.  That is a considerable worry to many businesses at present.  Has the Department got contingency plans in the event that that should arise because of the unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of this pandemic that we are battling?</p></speech>

When we were designing these schemes and reviewing them, members of the committee and, in particular, the Oireachtas gave us great feedback and helped us on the way there.  I want to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  We keep Covid on our management board agenda on a weekly basis.  Every scheme is under review.  We will obviously look at all contingencies as they develop.  That is obviously working right across Government.  I am on the Covid oversight group, and we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  Many of our schemes are still available to companies.  In fact, all of our loan schemes are still there.  We are still working.  We are looking to extend some of the schemes where we can.  Some of them are part of our EU funding requirements and, again, we keep them under review.  I would say to the Deputy that absolutely everything remains open to us in how we respond.  I take his point.  Covid has certainly had an impact, and we are looking at some challenges for certain sectors.  Some of them come in under the hospitality sector and, again, we will continue to support our colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on that.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity here for the Department to look at the geographical breakdown in terms of the different local authorities' administrative areas and examine the ability to work with areas where the Department feels that there are teething problems that we need to be dealt with.  If we are going to be dealing with a situation - I hope it does not happen, but it would be prudent for us to plan in this direction - whereby businesses may be forced to close again because of Covid restrictions, then I am of the view that this should be the subject of close scrutiny and analysis by the Department.  Depending on where a business is located, and in the context of the remits of certain Departments, it is not fair that it would not be given the same level of support that colleagues in other local authority areas would be when money is being drawn down from the national schemes.  I am not having a dig at my own local authority - to be fair to Cork County Council, it has been excellent to deal with - but this matter has been raised to me by other elected representatives from across the country.  It can be seen from the data and the analysis that are available to us, as public representatives.  Would Dr. Quinn reply on that point, please?</p></speech>

Clearly, there are fewer enterprises in some local authority areas than there are in others.  Obviously, Cork is a key one and it has many enterprises.  Our regional action plans, which we are working on at present, are key for the Department.  They allow us to take a cross-agency approach at regional level.  We rely heavily on colleagues in other Departments and in the industry sector who head up those plans to keep us in the loop on them.</p> <p>  Certainly, from our perspective, we keep this matter under review.  There are other schemes.  When we did the restart grant, it segued into the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the schemes run by Revenue, which are really important for businesses too.  We have used the money we were allocated in our budget.  If there is more money next year - again, that forms part of the overall review of schemes - we will look at the schemes.  We will also do that in terms of our carryover as well.</p> <p>  From the perspective of the local authorities and their roll-out of the scheme, as already stated, we do review.  We also have, really importantly, the local enterprise offices at local authority level.  They are available to roll things out.</p> <p>  We would have to dig a little bit deeper into the point the Deputy is making.  Is it simply that there are fewer businesses in the areas in question as opposed to it being an issue with the roll-out?  Our feedback from the local authorities was that they were rolling it out.</p></speech>

There is one other key question I want to ask.  The Department has oversight of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, which have quite large budgets of more than &euro;1 billion and &euro;280 million, respectively.  Many areas in the Cork East constituency, which I represent, and in other parts of the country that are outside of the greater Dublin area suffer from high unemployment and do not have sources of local employment.  I refer to the town of Youghal, from which I originally come.  Deputy Sherlock is beside me, and Mallow is in a similar situation, as are Fermoy and other towns in our constituency.  They are crying out for investment from IDA Ireland.</p><p>Is there room for improvement in terms of IDA Ireland locating in regional towns and trying to bring investment out of Dublin into the regions for more balanced regional development?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#E00200"><p>It is one of our policy aims, and one the Government has charged us with, to ensure regional balance.  IDA Ireland has been successful in regional balance in recent years.  I mentioned that more than 50% of all jobs are now outside of Dublin.  I will mention a number of features.  First, IDA Ireland runs the regional action plan.  That takes a regional approach and is led by businesspeople in the regions, which gives us a good oversight role.  Enterprise Ireland's latest figure is that more than 60% of new jobs are being created outside Dublin.</p> <p>  We do not tend to think about a particular area, for example, Youghal, which the Deputy mentioned.  We tend to think of it as a region because there are opportunities for people to commute and travel.  We focus strongly on the region and to the forefront of our policy and aim is to have regional balance.  I should say, particularly from the IDA Ireland side, that companies coming into Ireland make their own decisions.  Quite often, they want to be beside an airport, water source or other feature, depending on their needs.  We cannot control that but we encourage them by providing regional sites.  IDA Ireland purchases advanced sites.  We have advanced manufacturing coming up in Limerick and we try to work that closely on a regional basis which provides a basis for companies to come in, create employment and take up opportunities in other areas outside Dublin.</p></speech>

It is nice to see some familiar faces from my old Department.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to pose some questions.</p><p>I will stay on the Covid-19 restart grant schemes.  In that context, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated:</p> <blockquote> 	A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls.  One of these is the completion of post payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received. </blockquote> <p>The Secretary General stated: &quot;I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched&quot;.  We have to try to reconcile the two.  It would be useful to articulate in concise terms how the Department intends to answer the questions posed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is widely acknowledged that money flowed into businesses quickly and it was a responsive scheme in that regard.  However, questions have been posed and it would be useful to understand the timelines for any review or what such a review would look like.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  It is important that the Comptroller and Auditor General made two recommendations.  We fully accept them.  The first concerns the audit of the scheme.  We have commissioned an independent audit company to carry out an audit on that as recommended.  We have had some delay with the company because it has not been able to support a full team but we expect that early in the new year.  That is the first part of the audit.  The other part is important as well and concerns looking at the impact of the scheme.  We plan to perform an evaluation which will look at the longer-term impacts in terms of whether it achieved business survival and job protection and its impact on the public finances.  They are important questions for us to be able to stand over, not least in case, though hopefully not, of future schemes of this nature.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is important that we make sure public money is spent correctly.  There is no question of that.  We kept the criteria simple.  We did it through the local authorities so we knew every business was a rate payer and, therefore, a bona fide<i></i>business.  That was important.</p></speech>

We allocated a certain amount to each local authority, but that changed over time depending on businesses.  It was a funding review concerning who had funding and whether we could release funding from one local authority that was not using it to another that had a greater demand.  It was that type of ongoing review.</p></speech>

When it was adjusted, in August I think it was, the Department said there was no need for that review at the time.  The reform scheme was meant to trigger a review upon payment of &euro;250 million but, despite &euro;633 million being paid, the review has not been carried out to date.  It seems there is little justification for that.  Revenue oversaw the temporary wage subsidy scheme and it had safeguards in place despite the short notice.  As a result of that, Revenue was able to recoup payments made to businesses that should not have qualified.</p><p>Why was the Department unable to put in place similar safeguards in the same period?</p></speech>

Online companies are available to Revenue.  We did not have that.  One of the conditions for our scheme was that companies had to declare a 25% drop in expected turnover.  That was not possible to ascertain at that time, apart from companies that had closed.  It can only be determined afterwards whether companies experienced a 25% drop in turnover.  As I mentioned at the beginning, if that kind of check was done at local authority level for companies that had closed, it would have required an army of staff.  We did not have the online data, which were available to Revenue.</p></speech>

Those reviews were worth nothing because they were not thorough.

I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General about his opinion of the practice of setting up a scheme based entirely on self-certification, and whether it would have been prudent to carry out those scheduled reviews according to the Department's service-level agreement.</p></speech>

The comparison with the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, is interesting.  As the Secretary General said, Revenue has a much better database, so it was in a much better position to address the challenge of getting the money to the businesses that needed it.  Participation in TWSS was known to Revenue.  I certainly support the Department's idea that there should be a review but there were practical difficulties once it came to do the review.  It would have been difficult for the Department to assemble the data.  I understand that the data about individual cases were lodged with individual local authorities.  Even the sectoral analysis of which types of businesses were being supported, the scale of the businesses, and so on, would not have been in the Department's possession at the time.</p> <p>  I do not want to be overly harsh in my assessment of what the Department did.  Neither do I want to suggest that many of the businesses were not entitled to the money.  I think it is likely to be found that many of these businesses were entitled to it.  The difficulty is that opportunistic people may have been able to tick some of the boxes and get money which was never really intended for them.  We should look for lessons for situations where something like this has to be done in the future and identify where there is scope for sharing of information or the best place to locate a funding scheme of this type in an emergency.  Does that address the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

I still think there was a lack of prudence in carrying out the scheduled reviews.  Things that could have been picked up on were not.  Why have it in the Department's service-level agreement if it is not going to be adhered to?  It is part of the Department's service-level agreement but nothing was done about it.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the opening remarks.  I was in the Chamber.  I apologise if I am going over old ground.  I think the Department's response to an intense crisis in a short time was exemplary.  I acknowledge the questions of my colleagues about reviews and ensuring that public money was spent wisely.  I note what the Comptroller and Auditor General said a moment ago.  I think it is right to say that the majority of businesses applied because they needed the funding to keep their companies afloat or in abeyance for the period of the pandemic.  The feedback that I have got has been positive.  The engagement by the Department was excellent.  I will start from that basis.  It is important that we review the money and the various grants.</p><p>God forbid that we are in another similar situation and we have to respond quickly.  We are obviously going to need to learn from the various situations and the grant systems we put in place.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, were excellent and the fact we had that local network and an ability to channel money out to businesses, some of which we had been engaging with already, was very important.  I commend all the local authorities and other organisations on their work.</p><p> In the Department&rsquo;s briefing note, at part 3, on page 16, a point of interest to me was the funding in regard to the European Space Agency.  How much is Ireland contributing to that?  I note that, in 2020, 87 Irish companies were under active contract with the European Space Agency, representing a 45% increase in activity since 2016, which is very good to see.  Some &euro;13.3 million in contracts was won by Irish industry from the European Space Agency just last year.  Will Dr. Quinn comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words and I will certainly relay them back.  The Deputy mentioned the LEOs and we certainly had huge impact from them.</p> <p>  To turn to the European Space Agency, as the Deputy knows, the purpose is to build a base of innovative Irish companies to develop space technologies, but it is for commercial exploitation in the global space and related markets, and that is very important to us.  We have seen increased export sales and employment, and we have made additional money available to them.  The point we make is that when we send money into the European Space Agency, the companies get contracts to the value of what we invest, so it is a very important approach for us.  More recently, we saw &euro;13 million won by them.</p> <p>  The number of companies has grown by 60% in the past five years.  It is small.  It is up from the 55 companies we had in 2015 and it is now at 87, but they are key, niche companies.  The important part about them is that because they engage across with the IDA sector as well, quite often there can be partnerships and other areas we can then exploit for Ireland to be at the leading global edge on innovation.</p> <p>  For us, where we have additional funding, we have put it in there.  In 2020, for example, three Irish companies were selected by the European Space Agency to develop solutions on satellite and satellite systems.</p></speech>

Is that an annual set amount or does it change?</p></speech>

The annual figure that we provided this year was &euro;18 million.  We then allocated an additional &euro;1.5 million so, again, that was an additional investment by Ireland.</p></speech>

In terms of the restart grants, in particular the restart grant plus, does the Department have a timeframe for when the review might be carried out and how it might be carried out?  Will it be done at a local level through the LEOs or through the funding organisations, or will it be done through the Department?  When will it be done?</p> <p>  My second question, which is not related to the Covid grants, is in regard to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspectors.  This is covered in part 4 of the briefing note from the Department, which was very helpful and very informative.  There were 10,295 workplace inspections and investigations carried out in 2020, with 9,135 inspections which addressed occupational safety and health issues.  Given our discussion earlier about the number of premises that were not open during 2021, how many inspections were carried out?  I know the HSA was involved in many of the health and safety checks in certain industries over the course of the pandemic.</p></speech>

We are outsourcing the audit.  We tendered for it in July, we had three proposals and we awarded the contract in September.  We expect that to be run from the Department but it will most definitely involve the role of the local authorities and engagement with them.  On the timeline, the awarded contractors have had some delays but we are expecting it early in the New Year.  When that audit part is done, we will then commence the evaluation.  As other Deputies have noted, the evaluation is very important for us from the learning perspective in terms of how we might do this in the future.  I cannot give the Deputy a definitive date but we are expecting the audit to be finished by the end of February.  That will allow us to move straight away onto the evaluation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#G00800"><p>The audit will examine that and give us conclusions, and we then have to examine all of that, if there are negative findings.  There are obviously procedures available to us, if need be.</p> <p>  To turn to the Health and Safety Authority, the Deputy asked specifically in the context of Covid and more broadly.  In Covid, the HSA initially started off with a relatively small staff and we needed to expand the inspectorate for Covid.  The HSA took on the lead role in co-ordinating other resources.  We now have inspectorates working collectively from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Education and any of the Government agencies that have an inspectorate.  The environmental health officer is very important.  In total, there are about 700 inspectors now working on the protocol as part of their normal inspection duties.</p> <p>  For the HSA, more than 15,000 investigations and inspections were carried out but, overall, there were in the region of 50,000 inspections of Covid compliance.  It is a huge task.  In the context more recently of the reopening of the night sector, they have been out at 11 p.m., 12 midnight and 1 a.m. doing inspections, so both the number and the time at which they inspect has changed.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

In addition, because it is a huge part of their work, it is important we mention other areas of inspections they do as well, such as farm inspections.</p></speech>

I think there was an original provision of &euro;2 billion for this line of support.  Close to two years into the operation of the scheme, we have reached a quarter of the provision.  It did not need to be a target but it needed to be there for businesses when they looked for it.  Did Dr. Quinn get feedback at any stage from business about difficulties with the banks?  Businesses complained to me, and, I am sure, other to Deputies, about undergoing a long, slow process and the worst thing for any business is a slow "No" after many months of engagement with a bank.  Was that feedback received in the Department?</p></speech>

Part of the response we took was to expand the amount of lenders in the scheme.  Where before we had the pillar banks, we have now included other sources like the credit unions.  We have 15 credit unions working with us to provide the funding.  I take the Deputy's point about the &euro;2 billion in lending but it is a contingency fund.  It is not to say the &euro;2 billion should be drawn down or that there is a fault in the scheme if it is not.</p></speech>

It is not a target, as such, but what you would be watching for though is if you were hearing from businesses that it is difficult to get it.  The original figures show that there was a very slow drawdown at time when you would have thought it might be most needed.  It is worth keeping under review.  The most important thing is that it is there for businesses.</p> <p>  Credit unions were brought in, which was a good thing.  Was that after difficulties or frustration were experienced with the pillar banks?  That was reflected, possibly, back to Deputies from SMEs throughout the country.  What was difficult?  Why was it necessary to do that with the pillar banks receiving such support from the State in other ways?</p></speech>

We heard that feedback.  As I mentioned, we meet regularly with our enterprise forum and it was a feature that came up.  Partly as a response to that, we tried to expand.  Hence the credit unions' involvement, which we see as a positive.  Last year was particularly difficult for businesses, and they simply were not lending.  In comparison with other EU countries, our SME sector tends to borrow less.  We have studied it at various times and the Department of Finance did a review on it recently.  For us, it is about making sure the funding is available and accessible for companies.  That is our aim.  As the Deputy mentioned, we got that feedback from her and other Deputies.  That is why we moved to adapt and grow it.</p></speech>

I will refer to one of the challenges highlighted by business initially.  The scheme was well flagged throughout that first summer of Covid.  I think it was introduced in September 2020 and business was waiting for it, notwithstanding the EWSS, CRSS and other supports.  One of the criticisms was that it was there to finance Covid-related debt as opposed to non-Covid-related debt.  If a business had taken on significant commercial loans to redevelop or refurbish the business or whatever it happened to be, the refinancing of those loans was coming due and this scheme was not available to help refinance that debt, which needed to be serviced in order to continue to operate, particularly with reduced revenue.  Did the Department get that feedback?  How did it adapt to that?</p></speech>

We had other offerings available to people who needed them.  It was specifically for Covid and it was EU funding, so there were criteria that businesses could not refinance their loans.  It was because the offering under this was better than other products.  It was not there to allow everybody to refinance.  It was focused on the exigencies of the pandemic, and we operated on that basis.  I take the Deputy's point that because of people's circumstances they were hit with something that was not expected but the scheme-----</p></speech>

That is the difficulty when you are trying to design a scheme within EU parameters and those relating to the Department.  The reality for business is if, for example, a hotel has been redeveloped over the previous three years and the business has that debt and is capable of refinancing it based on normal returns, revenue and trading, that changes because of Covid.  It has not incurred the debt because of Covid but is unable to pay it because of Covid.  It cannot refinance the debt because it is not covered in that way and it employs 80 or 100 staff who are at risk, notwithstanding the other schemes, which are insufficient to cover that level of financing.  From a business and operational perspective, how do we address that?</p></speech>

That would have been a competition area if we had refinanced bad loans<i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>others.</p></speech>

They were simply not interested.</p></speech>

It is just to have an overview and an understanding of it.  Another issue, which probably is not to do with the accounts, relates to page 23 of the Department's Covid-19 and Brexit planning document, specifically the permits section of the Department and delivering employment permits.  I understand the Department concentrated on the health sector, which I very much appreciate, and any interaction I had with the Department in regard to that sector was brilliant and immediately taken care of.  However there are other sectors, such as the road transport sector, which has been applying for an employment permit for four stipulated countries and I am told the process has taken between six and nine months.  There is the added difficulty whereby the Department must correspond with the Department of Transport in regard to the driving licence, but Dr. Quinn will have heard and noted, particularly of late, that there is an even further difficulty and crisis within that sector.</p> <p>  Will Dr. Quinn outline for me how she correlates with the Department of Transport to try to speed up the process?  I note the Minister of State, Deputy English, said the quota requirement has been removed.  However, as Dr. Quinn will be aware, because she probably has more insight, that does nothing for the recruitment process because we are talking about countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia and South Africa.  They were not able to obtain 380 employees.  They only filled 180 permits from those jurisdictions, so removing the quota is of no benefit.  What is required here is a look at the jurisdictions.  Dr. Quinn might outline what her Department has prepared on that front.</p></speech>

We have an EU driving licence system, yet we cannot seem to get the RSA to make a move on that.  What I have been hearing from colleagues, Deputies and people within the sector is that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no difficulty granting the permits; the difficulty is with the licensing sector.  Surely in this day and age and the crisis in which we find ourselves, bearing in mind we have the ongoing Brexit process, and God knows where it is going to end up, Covid-19, and the haulage fraternity has kept the country going, should there not be collaboration and joined-up thinking between these Departments to ensure that sector can operate properly?</p></speech>

I have a concern in regard to the region.  Last week the Department of Transport was before the committee.  In the south east there are Waterford Regional Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The previous Government granted funding of &euro;15 million to Waterford Regional Airport which was to be combined between the local regional councils, with the balance to come from the Department of Transport.  I heard last week that money is no longer on the table.  However, Waterford Regional Airport is in the process of a planning application to extend the runway.  Rosslare Europort, as we know, has had an exponential increase in traffic of 400%, and yet not one shilling in Government funding has come from any Department, except from the Office of Public Works, OPW, which provided housing for the regulatory agencies such as customs.  As Rosslare is now without a doubt the country's most important piece of strategic infrastructure and the regional airport is not far behind, will Dr. Quinn identify for me what is required from a regional perspective to attract the investment?</p></speech>

All of them include our agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices.  What we are looking for is opportunity.  I take the Deputy's point that the port is very important in the context of Brexit.  As the Deputy knows better than I do, the airport has plans for development.  We try to pull together what is specific and what is a draw for the particular region.  It is clear that Waterford benefits from a port and airport but it is a whole-of-government approach as well-----</p></speech>

There was one transaction where a total of &euro;27,000 was paid in both interest and compensation for late payment.  What was the size of that bill to begin with?</p></speech>

It was not a situation that I could in any way stand over.  As soon as it came to my attention, we paid the bill immediately.  We did a review internally.  Even after that, I asked our head of internal audit to take it on and to do a separate review of all of our procedures to ensure that this could not happen again.  In his report to me and to the management board, he noted that it was an exceptional case and that it was not indicative of any wider problem.  However, we did review our compliance across all of our payments.  We found that we are pretty much average across other Departments.  We only had one late payment, for example, in 2019.  The figure in that case was &euro;3,000.  We accepted all of the recommendations that the auditor put forward around segregation of duties, financial procedures and records management.  We accepted everything in that report.</p></speech>

I want to ask some questions about the vacancies there.  It is an important office.  It will be moving to a new office.  I think it is due to do so in the new year.  The legislation is certainly going through the House at the moment.  It may well have just concluded, although I am not sure what stage it is on, or if it is before the Seanad.  One of the issues with the underspend was to do with recruitment of staff.  Where is that now?</p></speech>

In technical areas such as the IT side and the cyber side the pay rates in the private sector are difficult for us to match.  We have had a significant number of different appointment processes.  There is one ongoing at the moment with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement for specialist skills.  There has been an increase.  They have changed not just the legislation - as members are aware, that is going through - but even prior to that, we changed the roles within the office.  It is far more technical now with specialist skills than was the case previously.  At the end of 2020, there were 43 staff engaged in the ODCE, including nine members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The figure for the previous year was 41.  We are working on it.</p></speech>

Obviously, that cost has increased since.  That was the collective cost over a couple of decades.  If you do not pay, it is not all going to fall within this particular area, but some of it will.  We pay for this one way or the other.  It is far better to take a preventative approach rather than a reactive approach.  An organisation such as this, with real teeth, is very important.  I think we are missing the boat in terms of embedding bigger powers, including the right to arrest and things like that, but that is a policy area.  Has a business case been made in respect of the staffing issues?  If the Department cannot get certain grades of workers and is competing against the private sector, has a business case been made in respect of particular skill sets?</p></speech>

It is not just in the ODCE; it is across a range of areas.  We are currently being more successful because we tend to be more attractive in times when the economy is at a lower ebb, and then <i>vice versa</i>.  We have considered it and made special arrangements.  Staff in particular grades might start further up the scale.  Obviously, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when we look to particular sanctions for particular jobs.  At this point, we have had a significant amount of work done to increase, for example, the number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the organisation in particular.  As the Vice Chairman is probably aware, its representation is due to increase from nine to 16.  These discussions are ongoing and we are very keen that, as a new statutory agency commencing its work, it must have the resources it needs to take on this new role.</p></speech>

I can provide an update in terms of staffing because those discussions have been going on for a long time.  I met with all of the team a year ago.  My understanding is that the existing staff and their expertise will continue to be available.  My apologies - I am backtracking now because I have to reflect back on our previous discussions.  They will stay for two years and within that period we will work with them to see if there are options they wish to consider further.

No more than other bodies, the WRC showed a significant amount of agility and moved very swiftly to hold online hearings.  That was a change in business.  Some individuals did not want to do online hearings.  There was a whole range of issues, as the Vice Chairman can well imagine, that had to be developed in terms of setting that up.  The same was true in the case of the Labour Court.</p> <p>  In terms of the caseload, first, it had a significant number of calls, with more than 50,000, but in terms of the remote hearings the number was low initially, with an 85% objection rate.  However, that has since changed as people have become more familiar with the technology.  My understanding is that almost 2,000 adjudication hearings were held in 2020 but that is less than half the number held in 2019.  That is on the adjudication side.

I understand local authorities had the information in terms of who the rate payers were and how the scheme was structured.  I, too, got a lot of compliments from people who said it was the difference between staying afloat and going under.  I understand there was speed associated with that, but that does not mean there should not be care.  I think Dr. Quinn fully accepts that.</p> <p>  As regards the lessons or takeaways in terms of not leaving good things that happened during the pandemic behind us, will there be a different relationship between the LEOs and the Department?  Is it envisaged that there would be a different role or is there anything being considered from that point of view?  Are new datasets being gathered?

I take my hat off to them.  They worked fantastically.  At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a proposal to take them out because it was thought they would not be needed.  I think all present are aware we fought very hard to make sure they stayed where they were.  I refer to the relationship and, as the Vice Chairman stated, how we approach this matter.</p><p>We are always keen to blend and make sure that the LEOs are closely aligned with Enterprise Ireland, which they are.  We are keen to grow that and make sure that it is successful.  We have seen 130 companies transfer from LEOs to Enterprise Ireland.  We are trying to make sure that there is a seamless approach.  People start small, locally, but then have the capacity to grow and scale.  Our approach is-----</p></speech>

Creating a job through IDA Ireland, for example, costs approximately &euro;5,900.  I will come back to the Chair about the cost for creating a job through a LEO.  The difference between them is the earnings capacity.  The average IDA Ireland job has an earning capacity of approximately &euro;78,000 and Enterprise Ireland has a capacity of &euro;54,000.  The earning capacity of a job created through Enterprise Ireland is 32% of the average and a job created through IDA Ireland is 90% above the average.  The earning capacity of jobs created through LEOs tends to be lower, since start-ups are involved.  From our perspective, they should be focused on and grown, because they are in every part of the country and have been successful.  They created 5,500 jobs last year.  That is a great credit to them during the pandemic.</p></speech>

We have charge of the skills needs in the economy and employment permits.  Twice a year, we run an in-depth assessment of what skills are in the economy and what skills are needed, when considering employment permits.  We do not do that ourselves.  We do it collectively across Government, working with colleagues.  We do not necessarily always have the data for some of those skills, including related to transport, but we expect our colleagues in the Department of Transport would have it.  In the same way, we would not assess health needs, but we would certainly expect our colleagues in the Department of Health to know.  We do a review twice a year.  Based on that review, the Minister decides what sectors are open or not.  The Department of Transport would be part of that review.  We encourage people to come to the table with the needs as identified.  From an enterprise perspective, we would certainly have a view that transport is important.</p></speech>

This is where the issue seems to be.  As I said, there are two defined issues.  One relates to licensing and the other to the employment permit itself.  With the current system for granting permits, the sector is unable to access employees satisfactorily.  Outside that, no other jurisdiction has agreed a licence with Ireland.  The Ukrainian licence is accepted in other EU jurisdictions, as I pointed out.  The IRHA is becoming frustrated that nobody seems to be collaborating on these two aspects.  I am assuming, or at least, I have been told that the association has made representations to both Departments.  It may not be to Dr. Quinn but to the Minister.  I will check that and I will follow up with Dr. Quinn.  It is a simple issue to resolve, which we do not need to get into a crisis over.  I have to follow up on it, with what I know about it.</p> <p>  I have a question about proof of eligibility for schemes.  There were defined eligibility criteria for the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, but when we moved on to the restart grant schemes, I do not believe that eligibility criteria were set down.  Am I right about that?</p></speech>

In the case of the restart grant scheme, the Department did not specify the proof that may be required to confirm eligibility for the restart scheme.  Therefore, it may be difficult to verify the claims paid.  Does that effectively give an out to those who were not eligible?</p></speech>

If it is okay, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Declan Hughes, because there have been a number of questions about how we reviewed this between the scheme ending in July and the August scheme.  On the commercial side, a company had to be a ratepayer, have turnover, and have a self-declaration, which I think is what is causing some concern.  We were not in a position to assess that at that time.  They had to commit to retain employees on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  That commitment was made, but we would not have been in a position to verify it at that point in time.  Deputy Verona Murphy asked how we will run the review and why that was not done in July.  I think Deputy Munster asked about that too.  I will ask Mr. Hughes to speak on this.  He was in charge of it at the time and might be able to help the committee more.</p></speech>

It will look at the applicants.  There will be spot-checks across local authorities and sectors.  It will look specifically at the declarations that were made.  It was a self-declaration, but it was clear to the individuals that they should retain those records and that they would be subject to further checks.  That will be part of the evaluation.  It is about the turnover levels, the sectors that they were in, the TWSS etc.</p></speech>

Essentially, we asked for a self-declaration relating to accounts.  When it came to the small business assistance scheme for COVID, SBASC, that we subsequently launched, and we had more time to develop it, we asked that individuals upload their accounts.  That is the type of proof we will be seeking when we go back to do the spot checks in respect of the accounts that were held at the time.  As they were on the rates system, the local authorities knew the business and the size and scale of the business.</p></speech>

They are known to the local authorities and the local authorities have a relationship with them either in terms of existing rates payments or outstanding rates and so forth.  It is on that basis we will be working on those.  Where there may be reclaims or other issues arising we will deal with it through the local authority system.</p></speech>

There were a number of parties involved in the assessments.  In many cases it was the rate officer together with the finance unit and, in some cases, with the local enterprise office, which would have known those businesses and perhaps were involved in the verification as well.  However, as I said, it will be an independent audit.</p> <p>  To come back to the service level agreement, SLA, it specifically provided that we would undertake the review at &euro;200 million.  The scheme was launched in May.  By the middle of June we had allocated &euro;38 million.  At that stage, in the negotiations for the programme for Government and with feedback from Members of the Oireachtas, we were already in the middle of a review.  We assigned an assistant principal officer as an additional member of the team to undertake a review.  It was not an independent external review as envisaged in terms of the evaluation.  That review then fed into the redesign of the scheme for restart plus, which was launched as part of the July stimulus.  That came in early in August.  Restart grant 1 was to run until the end of August and it would have been completed but it was subsequently overtaken by restart grant 2.  We never reached the &euro;200 million for restart grant 1.</p></speech>

Is he on the call?  There is nobody indicating yet so I will ask a few further questions.  To pick up on the point about permits and the critical skills, and this question is for Dr. Quinn, has the critical skills list been updated or is it being updated?  I understand it dates back to approximately 2006, and things will have changed.  I could be wrong about that, but that is my understanding.  I am getting queries from sectors such as construction and healthcare for permits for people from outside the EU.  It may well be an issue with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Transport would be the other area.  Is the critical skills list being updated?  The last time I looked at it with regard to construction, it was architects as opposed to plumbers.  That is the type of query I am receiving.</p></speech>

We do it twice yearly.  Most recently, on the construction side, for example, almost all construction jobs are now eligible for a permit, and that includes pretty much all construction.  They have been reviewed and are included.  It is probably distinguishing between the critical skills and the general employment permits, and the new ones in the construction sector have come in under the general employment permits scheme.  Also, I should mention that we have an expert group on future skills and there is the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS.

Often they are recruited as care assistants in nursing homes and the like.  My feedback is that the experience one gets is of a very high level of skill.  However, they are not included.  Is there any consideration of that type of thing, where there is no equivalence in the recognition?</p></speech>

We brought in almost 4,500 nurses since the pandemic, but they would be registered according to the registration that is required by the Department of Health.  The Department of Health would have to revisit the equivalence for people who do not match our skills.  That has not happened as far as I am aware.</p></speech>

That may well have been to do with vacancies.  The offices are the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Health and Safety Authority and other offices.  The agencies are, by and large, the bigger number with 1,700.  What is the vacancy rate across all three?  If you do not have it, will you provide it to the committee?  What is the rate of people who are out sick?  I am looking for the non-Covid rate.  It may be that 2019 is a better example of that.  Regarding maternity cover, is there a plan for maternity cover?  In too many organisations there are gaps in the full complement of staff and often there is no maternity cover, sometimes in critical areas.</p></speech>

They are the civil servants.  The agencies, the IDA and EI, are recruited separately within their recruitment processes.  There is no problem getting the committee those data.  From the Civil Service perspective, vacancy tends to be at around 3%.</p><p>Our sick leave has gone down during Covid for a variety of reasons.  I suspect it is because people can work from home.  From what I mentioned earlier, it is clear that our productivity levels, I am proud to say, have gone through the roof.  I am very pleased with that.</p><p> On the point the Deputy made about maternity cover, we are very positive in terms of replacing people who are on maternity where necessary.  As the Deputy knows, the general practice is that such people are not replaced, but we look on that very much on a job perspective basis.  Where somebody is in a priority area, we replace that person.  We sometimes carry that vacancy somewhere else or we increase our staff budget to replace that person for a while.  It is very much on a needs-must basis.</p></speech>

It is one of the reasons the hybrid model may well be a positive we need to take from the pandemic, rather than just dwelling on the negatives of it.  It is good to hear about the maternity cover because we hear from people who say that they are coming back to work but their desk has a pile of stuff on it.  It is all the more reason it makes it unattractive to come back.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point the Comptroller and Auditor General just made, but I will ask Dr. Quinn about the Department's general oversight of the Microfinance Ireland, MFI, loans.  Dr. Quinn said in her opening statement that in the relevant period, especially through the Covid pandemic, Microfinance Ireland supported 1,300 businesses supporting close to 3,000 jobs.  From the Department's perspective, how does it monitor the key performance indicators, KPIs, and the performance of Microfinance Ireland?  How does all that sit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.231" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01100"><p>Interestingly, Microfinance Ireland is coming more closely back into the Department, which is a change we are working on.  We would certainly monitor closely.  We have a senior official on the board of MFI, which gives us very good insight into the data and operation of the organisation.  We also keep a very strong watching brief.  MFI has to give us details of approvals of loans.  Again, we always have a liaison team assigned to each of our agencies to monitor their performance, the drawdown, where the spend is and where money is not being spent.  We also receive a quarterly performance report from each of them, which the management board examines and assesses if there are areas of concern.  Does that the answer the Deputy's question sufficiently?</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Murphy, covered some of this previously.  I appreciate the Comptroller and Auditor General's point about coming back to it later.</p> <p>  I will go back to the point we discussed at the outset, which was the review of the restart grant.  I know that body of work - the major review and not the more ongoing work - is yet to be done in the Department.  What does Dr. Quinn believe that review is likely to generate?  What is her sense of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01300"><p>My sense is that we put a lot of money into the economy at a critical time to support businesses.  I would be very surprised if we find a high rate of abuse of that scheme because of the criteria that were set in terms of commercial rates, businesses closed and 25% turnover.  Until we see the full data, which we obviously will, I would say we set the criteria sufficiently high while at the same time making sure that people were able to get access to the funds quickly.  It was always that balance between the public finances and the code when we were trying to achieve good.</p> <p>  We had never done this kind of scheme before.  It is perhaps something we will look at as part of the review.  We had to find operators that were close to the ground and we picked the local authorities.  It was done in an emergency.  It was not one I would have stood over if I was asked to roll out a scheme to support businesses.  It was done in an emergency.  It achieved what we wanted it to achieve.  I look forward to the evaluation because there will be huge learning.  If this happened again, is it the Department that does it?  Should we have rolled it out directly via the local authorities?  There were all these questions at the time.  When I look back, we put our hands up and said we would manage and do it because somebody had to do it at the time.  There was such pressure on those small businesses.</p></speech>

However the review goes, I know the businesses in my constituency that needed the grant got it.  Even where they were not aware they were eligible for it and then became aware and went back, they still got it.  It was the difference between surviving and not at many stages.</p></speech>

The areas we had very much focused on prior to that were the traded and export sectors.  It was new for us too and we have learned a lot as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01800"><p>It is interesting Dr. Quinn should say that, because most people in Ireland are employed by much smaller enterprises, in many respects.  On some of what Dr. Quinn said, for example, on hairdressers, I was in touch with them through Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, and they were hugely concerned about the emergence of an even stronger black market in their sector and what that meant.  As a group of employers who were largely female entrepreneurs hiring largely, but not exclusively, female staff, with all the pressures they were already facing plus a stronger black market economy and how to counter that, I would have thought it was probably a good thing for the Department to be more closely linked with that kind of very on-the-ground retail business.</p> <p>  One of the things I worried about at the time was the risk regarding insurance costs or insurance hikes.  We have seen very strong inflationary pressure in the economy, in the past six months in particular.  There are international forces at play in that.  A big force are the direct cash transfers made to businesses and individuals throughout the pandemic period.  Will the Department look at some of those broader effects, or if they are linked effects, in the course of its review as well as the actual operation of the scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01900"><p>We will certainly look at the broader impact as well.  There is no doubt we will be looking at the impact of the pandemic, what we did and what we could have done, for a long time to come.  Insurance was certainly a factor.  As the Deputy knows, the T&aacute;naiste chairs the insurance group.  The bit we have in it is the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  We have had some very good results there in terms of the judicial guidelines and the work we did collectively across the Government.  We have an interest in anything that affects enterprise.  It might not necessarily be ours, but we do have a very strong cross-government approach.</p><p>Even to take the example the Deputy raised about the black economy, with regard to the hairdressers, we would have had detailed discussions with the Department of Social Protection, feeding back some of that comment as well.  Again, while we do not always have the levers ourselves, we do have a strong voice.</p></speech>

She said that, in other circumstances, it might have taken a year to put a scheme of that kind together.  We saw the same quick delivery of schemes in the Department of Social Protection with the PUP and CRSS.  For the future, is there some timeframe between three weeks and a year, given we might have learned that we can do things more aggressively in the future?</p></speech>

It is certainly our aim to be flexible and to respond as quickly as we can, but always bearing in mind the need to ensure that the public finances are correct and that people get what they are entitled to and not anything else.  That is some of the discussion we had earlier and it is an exercise that we will try to make sure we conduct.  I hope that as part of the evaluation, if not necessarily of the audit, elements of that will come through to us.</p></speech>

In Dr. Quinn's Department, it is very important to be responsive immediately to all of the different parts of the economy and its different sectors, and perhaps this will be considered in the evaluation.  Of course, our good friend, Mr. McCarthy, has a very important role to play but speed and responsiveness are key in responding in such a small, open economy with the different pressures it faces.  Let us hope it ends up being that little bit speedier.</p></speech>

Given our conversation in regard to work permits, while I am not long elected, I have been voicing concerns about work permits since being elected.  In Wexford, we are currently experiencing a huge deficit in regard to CAMHS staff recruitment.  It took three years to find an applicant to accept the senior child psychologist position.  Now, we are in a position where, for 12 months, the HSE has been advertising for a dietician and there is no applicant to take the position.  There are 549 families who have been granted a home care support package but we do not have the employees in the private sector, who could make the provision of services available to the HSE, or within the HSE itself to deliver those home care support hours.  This year&rsquo;s budget was lauded because home care support hours were increased by 1.5 billion hours and funded, which hugely increased the hours.  However, the hours cannot be delivered so, essentially, the funding will never be used.  I hope Mr. Hughes understands me.  I am just asking where all of that comes back to his Department with regard to finding somebody to deliver those job specs.  We need to bear in mind a home care support package is generally for applicants over the age of 66 who probably have long-term illness or are in serious need of short-term care.</p></speech>

Essentially, for healthcare occupations, the supply and demand side is led by the Department of Health, working with SOLAS.

As the Secretary General mentioned earlier, there is engagement, whether it is with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of the meat and dairy sector, the Department of Health or the Department of Transport.  All of the sectors would have had an input to that review which was done recently and published at the end of October.  The Secretary General talked about HGV drivers, agricultural workers, horticultural workers and so on.  That was all fed into that review process, which was undertaken by the Department and informed by the expert group on future skills needs.  It is not my area directly but that is the position.  We would be happy to brief the Deputy separately on it.</p></speech>

Perhaps the issues I want to raise have been raised so I hope our guests will bear with me.</p> <p>  I thank the Department for the work done in a very difficult 24 months and for the progress it made in retaining jobs and helping to create new jobs.  With regard to a review of jobs over the last five years, we spoke in the last meeting about value for money and retention of jobs.  Has an analysis been done by the IDA and the Department in regard to job creation where support grants were provided in order to find out, five years on, what number of those jobs are still in place and whether we got value for money for the grants paid out in different areas?  Has detailed analysis been done on that by the Department in the last few months?</p></speech>

We would obviously keep an ongoing review of all of the agencies and their performance, the jobs created, where they are created and where they are lost.  It is ongoing but we check at particular times because all grants that are given by the IDA or Enterprise Ireland for any jobs sustained are repaid if those jobs subsequently do not materialise or the company is lost to Ireland.  We would keep those records in detail.</p></speech>

For example, for any year of the last five years where grants were provided, what percentage of those jobs are still in place and what percentage have not lasted more than 12 months, two years or three years?  Have we any kind of detailed analysis of that?</p></speech>

I do not have it to hand but we certainly would have that type of analysis available to us.  It has to inform all of our future planning in terms of the sectors we concentrate on.  We have had a number of reviews over the years, not least the public spending review of the impact of our supports on our enterprise agencies.  I can certainly make that available to the Deputy after the meeting.</p></speech>

Is there an 80% or 90% retention, or is it less than that?</p></speech>

If we look at the growth in our agencies, we are now at 257,000 jobs in IDA companies and more than 230,000 jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies.  They have been huge growth areas and, even with the pandemic, those numbers have gone up substantially since last year.  I would say to the Deputy - again, without the data - that it would be a very high number in terms of retention.</p></speech>

There are certain key areas where we have difficulty in filling jobs.  I know the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was involved with the meat industry through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In the healthcare sector, for example, we have a difficulty in the nursing home care area.  Have there been discussions with the Department of Health in dealing with that?  I just came in at the end of Deputy Murphy's question so this may have been dealt with.  In the private nursing homes, there are about 23,000 residents, so a fairly substantial number of staff are needed.</p><p>Quite a number of people who worked in the area have retired for very genuine reasons.  The home care area in Cork and Kerry run by the HSE is something for which we cannot bring in people from abroad to deal with and the number of workers in the area has reduced from 1,800 being available to provide home care down to 1,400 in the past 12 months.  Therefore, we see challenges in that area.  As there are also particular challenges in the nursing home area, what engagement has occurred with the relevant Departments on the matter?</p></speech>

Last year we did three, again because of Covid-19 and its impact.  We are very much guided by the individual sectors and the Department of Health is clearly very important.  More broadly, we must always achieve a balance between those who are on the live register, creating jobs and bringing in people.  It is the type of evidence we expect from Departments.  I mentioned earlier that last year, for example, we prioritised the healthcare sector in particular because of the pandemic and we brought in over 4,000 nurses in 2020.  We also brought in over 4,000 doctors to support our colleagues in the health sector.  We had over 9,000 employment permits just in the health sector alone that came in 2020.</p></speech>

My understanding from nursing homes is that they have had a very poor response from the Department of Health on this type of assistance.  We have seen an increase in nursing staff and doctors but not in care assistants or in other areas.</p></speech>

These may not be skilled jobs, perhaps.  If the Department of Health comes to us to make a case and provides evidence that those skills are not available in the nursing homes sector-----</p></speech>

Do any substantial changes need to be made in view of the fact that Covid-19 has brought huge changes?  There is also the issue of the UK no longer being part of the European Union.  Should we be exploring new avenues as a result?  As we are the only English-speaking country within the European Union, are there further opportunities to grow jobs that we should now be using, with policies being adopted accordingly?</p></speech>

We are exploring all possible options.  It is one of the main selling points now used by IDA Ireland in any of its promotional and marketing opportunities that we are the English-speaking member of the European Union and in demonstrating the talent and skills we have.  That is built in very strongly to its message.  From our perspective, we must look to other opportunities.  We have seen much from companies here gaining access and changing supply chains as a result of perhaps no longer being able to access companies in the UK.  It is a very fluid position now and we see it as a major advantage.  There is a major opportunity for companies but there is a tricky bit for them first if they want to move to other markets.  For our companies, the English-speaking UK is a near and good market.  Enterprise Ireland is very strongly focused on growing out the capacity of the sector across Europe and more broadly, as well as inward investment.  We see that as a major potential advantage and one we are all working on collectively.</p></speech>

The first is from the Donegal Education and Training Board and relate to 2020.  That received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The financial statements from the Ombudsman for Children's Office also received a clear audit opinion for 2020.  </p> <p>  The 2020 accounts for Ciste Pinsean Thithe an Oireachtais ar fad c&oacute;lta&iacute;, the pension fund for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The 2020 accounts for the Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The 2020 financial statements for Microfinance Ireland, the provision of additional funding for which was mentioned during the meeting this morning, received a clear audit opinion.  However, I draw attention to note 9 in the financial statements.  It discloses that there was a provision charge for 2020 of &euro;11.4 million in respect of bad and doubtful loan debts.  At the end of 2020, the total of specific and collective provisions for loan bad debts amounted to &euro;13.3 million on outstanding loan advances totalling &euro;30.2 million.  What a provision is doing is looking at the quality of the loans and anticipating that losses will be incurred in the future.  That is a significant increase in the provision in the year, largely because of additional lending to businesses that were operating in a Covid environment.  It is anticipated there will be a higher level of losses incurred as a result of that.</p> <p>  The final set of accounts presented are the annual financial statements for Science Foundation Ireland for 2020.  There is a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that have not been flagged for discussion for the meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee's web page.  Five items of correspondence have been flagged in this category.</p> <p>  I will move to consider correspondence from Accounting Officers, Ministers, or both, and relating to follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 872B was received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 5 November 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the fact that the Revenue did not accept certain recommendations in the committee's most recent report on its engagement with Revenue.  The committee asked Revenue to clarify to what extent it can investigate the financial and sectoral implications of a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in March 1997, as well as a copy of the 2019 European Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs values and repayments.  I have flagged this item for discussion, as have Deputies Carthy and Stanley.  I suggest we hold it over until next week as I know it is of interest to Deputy Stanley.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 873B is correspondence from Ms Marie-Claire Maney, chairperson of the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 8 November 2021.  It responds to the committee's request for information relating to tax settlements between the Revenue Commissioners and Perrigo.  The chairperson states that due to its statutory obligations around the confidentiality of appellants, rather than any reluctance to respond to oversight, the commission cannot provide such information.  The chairperson goes on to detail the relevant statutory provisions, stating that if a settlement is agreed at any stage before the commission makes a determination, the appeal is treated as having been withdrawn and the parties need only notify the commission of the settlement.  As such, the commission has no role in the tax settlement agreed between Perrigo and the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  The chairperson also provides an update on the current status of the top ten appeals by quantum.  The most recent update was provided for our meeting with the commission on 8 July.  It is worth noting that the aggregate quantum of tax under appeal has reduced from &euro;4.5 billion in January 2021 to &euro;1.55 billion on 8 November 2021.  We have also requested detailed information from Revenue relating to this settlement, which is due today.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Carthy and I have flagged it.</p> <p>  No. 874B is correspondence from Ms Cliodhna Guy, interim chief executive officer of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, dated 8 November 2021.  It provides further information requested by the committee about the installation of CCTV cameras at racecourses.</p><p>The interim CEO states that it has concluded the evaluation of the tenders for the installation of CCTV systems in racecourse stable yards, and that the board continues to work to the previously stated timeframe for installation to be completed at each racecourse prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The interim CEO also notes that the cost of the system is considerably higher than what had been allocated by Horse Racing Ireland previously and on that basis the matter is currently with the Horse Racing Ireland board for approval.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Deputy Imelda Munster and I flagged this item, but I do not think she is present.  It would be useful to get a breakdown of the cost of the new system to include the installation costs and an update pack when the sanction to the purchase is granted.  I presume it will do that, but it would be no harm for us to request it.</p><p> No. 875B is correspondence from Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 8 November 2021 in which he provides information on updated arrangements for public bodies presenting their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, following their audit, the arrangements for laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It arises from a 2018 report of the last Committee of Public Accounts, which highlighted the inconsistency in the obligations of when public bodies must present their financial accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.</p><p> The new arrangements, as set out in Circular 24 of 2021, require that, unless otherwise specified in legislation, annual accounts should be presented to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit no later than three months after the close of the financial year.  As the accounts are laid before the Houses and brought to the attention of this committee by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the circular also removes the need for audited bodies to arrange for copies of audited accounts to be submitted to the committee.  This requirement was not being complied with in the majority of cases in any event.  In most cases, once the Comptroller and Auditor General has certified accounts, the accounts must be laid before the Houses within three months.  Members will be aware that this committee has a standing agreement to write to any bodies that are late in laying their audited accounts before the Houses.  However, this circular, as was the case with the one it replaces, includes a requirement, at paragraph 9, that the clerk to this committee be notified where there is an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits.  In practice, this is not being done.  If it were, it would remove the need for us to write to bodies to request explanations for late laying of accounts.</p><p> It is proposed to note and publish the item, to thank the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for providing the updated circular and to request that it remind Departments of the requirement to inform the clerk if statutory accounts are being presented later than the specified time limits and to explain the delay.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I hope our consistent following up where accounts were late had a role in putting that onto a more formal footing.</p></speech>

The Secretary General states that in September the Minister for Foreign Affairs requested that the Department undertake a review of the role and appointment of special envoys, and make specific recommendations on how future appointments will take place through a competitive process.  The terms of reference are included.  The Secretary General states that the report arising from the review will go before Government at the next available opportunity and that the Minister&rsquo;s intention is to publish the report following its consideration by Government.</p><p>Regarding expenditure in the Department&rsquo;s accounts relating to special envoys, almost &euro;70,000 was spent on travel and subsistence in 2020.  The Secretary General clarifies that no remuneration was paid to special envoys in 2020.  However, in recognition of their work as special envoys he states that it was decided to pay each of the six retired special envoys an <i>ex gratia</i>payment of &euro;5,000 per year for each of the two years of their work on the campaign.  While the Secretary General states that one of the special envoys waived this <i>ex gratia</i>payment, it was paid to the other five retried staff in January 2021, totalling &euro;50,000, which was &euro;10,000 each.  Special envoys who were then serving staff of the Department, the then Minister and the then Deputy did not receive any remuneration for their roles as special envoys.</p><p>It is proposed note and publish the item and request a copy of the report once it is published, as well as the basis for the <i>ex gratia</i>payments to special envoys.

The term &quot;<i>ex gratia</i>&quot; just refers to the fact that there is no scheme in place under which the payment is made.  I think it has no bearing on the taxability of it.  I will check it and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I do not think it is appropriate to state that no remuneration was paid and then state in the same paragraph that an <i>ex gratia</i>payment amounting to nearly &euro;100 per week was provided.  This again highlights the need for a structure in respect of the concept of special envoys and the process involved because it all appears to be incredibly <i>ad hoc</i>, as was prominent for a period.</p></speech>

Obviously, that is self-explanatory.  I again ask the committee to agree to make those inquiries.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 881C is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 9 November 2021.</p><p>It requests an update on the implementation of the recommendations in our report regarding the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 110 - Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme), which was published in January.  One of the recommendations was that the value for money review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme be published without delay.  It was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019.  Over two and a half years later it has still not been published.  We looked for an update on this review and on the report concerning the costs and timeline for the national children's hospital from the Department on 18 October and issued a reminder earlier this month but have not yet received a response.  It is proposed to provide Nursing Homes Ireland with the updates the committee has received in respect of the implementation of its recommendations and to advise that the Department of Health will appear before the committee on 16 December.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Deputy Munster flagged an item of correspondence.  We could hold it over.  That is probably the fairest thing to do, so she has an opportunity to address it.  If we can move on to the work programme, it is agreed until the end of the year.  We previously agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November.  It is suggested that we do so next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does any member wish to raise anything in respect of the work plan?  We will be coming back to it next week anyway.  Is there any other business?  I take it there is not.  We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 25 November, when we will engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss aligning disability services for chronic disease with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Olga Wehrly, Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe, Ms Lorna McGreehan and Ms Mary Casserly.  I will introduce each of them in turn and ask them to speak in a few moments.</p> <p>  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in the meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  If members are joining the meeting remotely, I ask them to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions.  For anyone watching this meeting online, the witnesses are accessing the meeting remotely.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise.</p> <p>  Before we commence formal proceedings, I must begin with some formalities and advise our witnesses on the matter of privilege.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before the committee may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Before I call Ms Olga Wehrly to make her opening remarks, Senator Erin McGreehan wishes to make a statement in regard to her relationship to one of the witnesses.</p></speech>

I am very proud of my sister who has come in today and it is great to have sisters doing it for themselves today.  I will not be directing any of my questions towards Lorna as I do that regularly anyway.  I thank the members.</p></speech>

I have a connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, EDS.  It means the collagen my body makes is faulty, so my joints are really bendy and it affects my organs in varying degrees.  My daughter, who has it too, also has anaphylactic allergies and significant asthma.  I also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, which is a common comorbidity with EDS.</p><p>Since we are in the middle of a pandemic, I should add that I have had long Covid since January 2020.</p><p> EDS is a multi-systemic disorder of which there are many subtypes.  Most are diagnosed genetically, but there are no markers yet for the subtype I have.  It was flagged when I lived in the UK in 2012.  When I moved back to Ireland in 2013, I set about the laborious task of trying to find an assessment.  There were no EDS specialists in the country at the time, and almost a decade later, there still are none.  This is disastrous for families like mine, since usually more than one member is affected, and EDS presents completely differently in everybody.  There is no one overseeing our care, which needs a multidisciplinary approach.  A GP is the first port of call, but it is outside their wheelhouse, so to speak.  In order to access medical and physical therapies in the Irish healthcare system, we generally have to be referred individually for each body or brain part and explain the disorder from scratch each time.  Although awareness has increased, this whole lengthy process could easily be avoided.  The resultant drain on everyone&rsquo;s time and money could be avoided by multi-systemic overviews, saving families time on travel to and from a plethora of appointments and risking being considered a hypochondriac for having a systemic illness.  </p><p> I have travelled to the UK for treatment by EDS specialists in the hypermobility clinic in London.  I had no choice, as I wanted to put a treatment plan in place to get back working.  I work as an actor, which can be quite physical.  There were no options here, which is contrary to the UNCRPD.  The HSE does not cover these trips under the treatment abroad scheme.  Many of us have Chiari malformation in varying degrees, which can be quite dangerous.  For us, it is diagnosed with an upright MRI scanner, and we do not have this service in Ireland either.  A scan in the UK can cost &pound;2,000, excluding travel and accommodation and, again, this is not covered by the HSE treatment abroad scheme.</p><p> This wastes lots of time and resources for us and the health service.  Many of us have had to go private to be assessed, where possible, treated, and for maintenance of the many anomalous chronic EDS issues.  This is costly.  Other hidden costs involve buying support garments and modifying our cars to make them easier to drive.  For example, I drive an automatic car now.  Some people need more extreme modification.  Costs for heat pads and regular physiotherapy all mount up.  Without regular physiotherapy, I would not be mobile.  I do it so I can work and parent.  I have had access to amazing physiotherapy through the HSE for a few years, and then a physiotherapist came to my area who had no interest in EDS and no interest in helping me, so I ended up going private.  It costs me thousands every year to do private physiotherapy, without which I would not be able to walk or work with ease, and I am one of the extremely lucky ones.  I am paying through the nose so I can participate in society, but I should not have to.</p><p> The mobility grant, which was to aid people with walking difficulties, was stopped to new applicants in 2013.  A new scheme was due to replace it but, as far as I am aware, nothing has transpired.  The mobility certificate is available to those who are significantly impaired, but for many of us who are chronic sufferers, we fall between the cracks.  We are not considered disabled enough, and therein lies most of the indignity of the application process.  The refusals for domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and disability allowance are such a common thing that people in support groups are advised to apply over and over.  I have never applied for it.  I find the social welfare system hostile and intrusive at best, and I do not have the stamina for the overly complicated application process.</p><p> I am lucky to have a medical card on medical grounds, but I have no idea how I would afford EpiPens for my daughter, inhalers for both of us, medication and the many doctor appointments we have throughout the year without it.  The renewal process for the medical card is stressful and humiliating.  By the time your card is granted, you are panicking about having to reapply for the year following.  I must pay for letters from my GP to reapply and prove how needy we are, despite the reality that our circumstances are not likely to change from year to year.</p><p> Disability payments are means tested, meaning many people with EDS would lose all their family supports should they, for example, meet a new partner who is expected to shoulder the burden of a family's medical costs.  Further, should they want to be fulfilled and try to work as much as they can, they may lose access to supports like their medical card and other health services.  This puts people like me in an even more marginalised category, where we are left under a glass ceiling and unable to fulfil our potential.  If we work, we have supports removed.  If we move in with a partner, we have supports removed.</p><p> Most people I know are overwhelmed and not able to work as a result of bureaucracy, or are supporting families on low income rather than being able to do the jobs they previously enjoyed, even on a part-time basis.  There are no strategies to keep people in work because the support system is not tiered; it is all or nothing.  Rather than this binary view of our health and welfare system, we should be creating an environment where it is beneficial to all of us, and society as a whole, whereby people feel they can achieve their potential.  If we do not feel useful, we are not fulfilled, and we have every right to feel useful.</p><p> Anxiety, depression and neurodivergence are common issues with EDS, but again, there are no supports for this in the public health service.  There is no public adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, assessment pathway in Ireland, despite the HSE website saying the contrary and making public reports about it year in, year out.  The website for ADHD for adults looks like an advertorial.  There is no route progression that you can access and have a look at.  It took me more than 20 years and hundreds of euro to access an assessment.  My education experience was significantly affected by ADHD.  I dropped out of university and I struggled with disorganisation for years.  I now work as an actor and it affects how I learn dialogue.  I had to pay privately for these services for two decades on a low income because the provision is not there.  I am now able to access my local HSE mental health team, but they are so understaffed that I have had appointments cancelled due to no doctors being available.  The health system is creaking at the seams.  It seems almost unrealistic of me to expect improvement to disability services when there is a sparse and burned out staff.  We are at the bottom and we are suffering because of the inadequate structures.  My daughter has significant asthma.  We have seen her consultant once since 2019 and she will not be seen again until mid-2022, despite a few  accident and emergency trips in the last 12 months.</p><p> I have long Covid since January 2020, which has caused significant problems throughout the year with breathing, driving, walking, cooking, dressing, my voice and the school run.  I estimate it has cost me a few thousand euro this year alone in consultant fees and diagnostic tests in the private sector, despite attending one public hospital long Covid clinics as well, which was seriously busy.  Without those private appointments, my recovery would not be as advanced as it is now.  However, I had to pay for it and I could ill afford it.  I am one of the lucky ones.  There are no long Covid facilities for children in this country.  There are no statistics being kept on long Covid sufferers in Ireland.  Why not?  If you do not count us, we do not exist.  It is a disaster that is happening now.</p><p> That brings me to the end of my piece.  As someone said to me yesterday, it is not our issues that are expensive, it is inequality itself that is so costly to society as a whole.</p></speech>

I call on Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me today.  Have members ever experienced a phone battery that does not get them through the day, or a battery that dies exactly when they need it?  Imagine if that battery were your body, and you woke up one day and your internal battery was only charged to 20% and it could never be fully recharged.  You would need to get your priorities right if you did not want to get sicker.  What would you choose, showering or having a conversation with a friend?  Imagine this is your reality every day and no doctor can tell you what is wrong.  You are on your own.</p> <p>  I am 53 years old and my life changed in 2014.  From working full time, I could no longer get out of bed.  It took me five years to get the correct diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, ME/CFS.  It is a complex, multi-system disease and the typical diagnostic criterion is that if we exert ourselves outside our energy envelope, our symptoms get worse.  The deterioration may be immediate or delayed, and can last days, weeks, months or forever.  Currently, I am mostly housebound, but on my best days when I am able to go outside my home, I use a mobility scooter.  For years I have been bed bound. </p> <p>  I will focus on three things essential for myalgic encephalomyelitis, ME, sufferers: healthcare, mobility and housing.  Adequate support starts with healthcare.  The HSE currently has no pathway to care for ME patients and not a single official ME consultant.  Many consultants and GPs dismiss ME or have no knowledge of it.  The result is that many patients get no diagnosis or treatment.</p><p>In some cases, patients are unable to access healthcare as they cannot leave their beds or houses and home visits are not available.  Without early and correct diagnosis, patients risk permanent deterioration.  This happened to me when I tried exercising my way out of illness.  It ended with collapse and I never got back to my previous level of functionality.  Even if there is no medicine specifically for ME, there are possible medical interventions to alleviate some severe symptoms.  In my case, I now take medication that helps me to remain upright for longer periods.</p><p> Without a supportive consultant, you are also alone in your fight for financial survival.  After five years of limbo and relying on my partner for the basics of care and food, I could get a diagnosis and treatment that improved my quality of life.  This could happen only because a friend drove me - I was horizontal in her car - from Dublin to Tullamore hospital, where I saw a consultant with a special interest in ME.  He is accessible publicly only if you live in the catchment area.  Before Covid, he used to see patients privately one afternoon a week; now, we have nobody.  Ireland desperately needs public ME clinics in each hospital group.  We need healthcare staff trained in ME and willing to keep up with the biomedical research in the field.</p><p> A consultant is also essential to accessing relevant mobility aids.  I missed out on being outdoors for years and it took an incredible toll on my mental health.  It was not primarily the isolation that got to me.  I desperately missed the sun on my face, the wind in my hair, even rain in order that I could still feel I existed in the physical world.  I have a tiny mobility scooter now, thanks to a friend who organised a fundraiser for me. It is the only mobility aid we can get into and store in our living room.  We have no access to a car and my ability to use public transport is extremely limited.  I really need a power chair and a ramp but, if renting privately, you have no right to adapt your housing.  The welfare system is designed assuming that disabled people who do not own their home live in social housing.  This is not true.  My household is now on the council's list for adapted housing, thanks to my consultant, but how long will we wait?</p><p> In the meantime, despite my partner and I both getting the invalidity pension, we do not get fuel allowance.  The maximum household income you are allowed in order to qualify is &euro;1,509 per month, while the average private rent in Ireland is currently &euro;1,334 per month.  We cannot afford to keep the heat on.  The system increases the risk of my health deteriorating further.</p><p> I cannot expect society to give me my previous life back, but I expect everyone with a disability to get their basic needs met, access to appropriate healthcare, mobility and suitable, warm housing.  We deserve a life with dignity, quality and independence.</p></speech>

I have lupus, which is an auto-immune disease, and I am visually impaired due to medication I was taking for lupus.  A wide range of problems affect people who have disabilities or suffer from chronic illnesses.  Some of these issues are small and some are massive.  Disability awareness training should be compulsory for all who deal with people.  Not all disabilities are on show.  I have been told that I do not look like a blind person.  People need to learn and I do not speak for all disabilities.  I also need training.  Change needs to come from the top down.  Every Department needs to have an ethos of inclusion, not just a box-ticking exercise.  Training needs to be given to schools and colleges in order that this can become the norm rather than the exception.</p> <p>  I do not want special treatment but I do want equality and a level playing field.  When technology is available but cost prohibitive, it is soul destroying.  Grants should be given to the person, not the employer.  No one should be indentured to an employer.  If appropriate technology was available to all with disabilities, it would improve job prospects and career development.  This should be dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We want to be employed.  Having assistive tech grants based in social welfare seems out of place.  Help to encourage people with disabilities into the workforce has to be a win for all.  Having a purpose, getting up in morning and going to work is so beneficial to a person's mental and physical health, disabled or not, but so many obstacles are put in their way.  Having to take annual leave to attend doctor's appointments seems totally unfair.  Annual leave should be used to rest but, alas, that does not always happen.  Losing benefits because you are marginally over the income limits is not right.</p> <p>  I have always worked.  I might be in agony and have loads of obstacles in front of me but I still work, and I think that has stood to me mentally.  I am lucky to have supportive family and friends but additional supports are not always available, and sometimes it feels counterproductive even if they are offered.  Should I burden my carer, my husband, with another journey?  Should I use the last of my annual leave when I feel exhausted and could do with a day off?  Financial pressure is increased tenfold when you have a disability.  Families struggle, and then there are additional costs such as bills, travel expenses and medication.</p> <p>  The long-term illness list has not been touched since its inception in 1972.  Lupus was first named in 1971.  Why can this not be added?  Surely, after 50 years, it is time to look at it again.  It should not come down to finances whether a person with a disability can go out to work or not.  Running a car is getting more and more expensive, but when you are living in rural Ireland, a car is a necessity, not a luxury.  Only 24% of people who are visually impaired or blind in Ireland are employed.  This needs to change.  We should not be made to feel grateful for the scraps from the table.  Some people ask, "Sure haven't you got a job?"  I know I am lucky in many ways, but it could have been easier and still can be made much easier by letting me reach my full potential.</p> <p>  It is up to the members of this committee to make changes.  I urge them to be our voice at the table where decisions are made.</p></speech>

I was diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's three years ago, at the age of 53.  I am married with two sons and live in County Wexford.  I started to notice I had symptoms such as slowness of movement, fatigue and unexplained pain.  I would sometimes have a tremor, which started to appear more often if I was under stress.</p> <p>  It was thought I might have fibromyalgia and an essential tremor.  My sense of smell was affected and I was referred to a consultant who did a scan, which came back clear, and I was then given steroids, which showed no improvement.  My shoulder was sore, so I was referred to a physiotherapist.  My left hand and wrist were painful and typing long documents became difficult.  My sleep was disturbed and I would be awake for several hours at night.  I also noticed I was not swinging my left arm when I was walking and I started to drag my foot at times.</p> <p>  I went through many years of wondering what was wrong and why was I feeling like this.  We need more awareness of conditions such as early onset Parkinson's, as per Article 8 of the UNCRPD on awareness raising.  My GP sent a referral to a neurologist and, even with private health insurance, it took three months to get an appointment.  Going through the public system at that time would have meant waiting about 18 months because there are not enough neurologists in Ireland.</p><p> It is a lot to take in when you are told you have a progressive, incurable disease.   I left the neurologist's office in total shock and wondered what I would do.  I was given a prescription which I paid for myself in the first two months because I had never heard of the long-term illness card.  I went through many emotions as I learned that my life would no longer be how I had imagined.  It was difficult to tell our sons, who were 21 and 18 at the time.  I also wondered who else I should tell and when, and if I would be treated differently.  It was also coming up to our 25th wedding anniversary, but I did not feel like celebrating and thought: what a gift for my husband.</p><p> I was working in accounts at the time.  I had hoped to have worked for many more years, but as the months went on, I was finding it more difficult due to lack of sleep and pain.  I did not know what options were available to help me to stay working.  I had not heard of EmployAbility or work adaptation grants.  So, nine months after my diagnosis, I gave up work due to the symptoms of early onset Parkinson's.</p><p> I felt very isolated, being diagnosed with a disease that normally affects older people.  My closest experience of Parkinson's was with a family member who was diagnosed when he was in his 80s.  I wondered if I was the only person in County Wexford with this condition.  Eventually, I met people my own age, and through this peer support I got information on what I needed to do to try to live as well as possible with Parkinson's.</p><p> I had balance problems in the beginning, because I did not know that I needed to do certain exercises to help this.  I was in a supermarket one day and I went from just standing to a stumble.  I could see from the look on a lady's face that she assumed I was drunk.  I have also been told that I look as if there is nothing wrong with me, but it is only my immediate family that get the true picture of what it is like to live with the disease: the fatigue; being up for hours at night; suffering stiffness and pain; toes curling under making it more difficult to walk; planning your activities when your medication is working and you are not "off"; struggling down the stairs with pain; and trying to do household chores when fatigue has set in.  My day now consists of alarms for medication, timing meals so that they does not interfere with medication, physical exercise and voice practice.  I used to be able to garden all day long, but now I have to come in after an hour to rest.  Some days, I just cannot do much at all due to persistent fatigue and pain and spend a lot of the day on the couch.  Eating a meal takes longer because I am slower cutting up food and my ability to chew is affected as the reduced amount of dopamine in the brain affects all my muscles, even my tongue.  My cognitive ability is also affected.  I used to be able to multitask, but now I have to concentrate on one thing at a time.  I am sensitive to loud noises, so even a supermarket visit can be stressful.  Stress tends to worsen my symptoms.</p><p> At the moment, I am said to be in the honeymoon stage of the disease.  The medication helps, but it does not slow the progression.  Exercise is the only known method that helps slow the progression.  Advanced Parkinson's can lead to more involuntary movements, and people find it more difficult to move - even to turn in bed.  Freezing of gait is another symptom of advanced Parkinson's, which means that your feet feel stuck to the ground and you cannot move forward.</p><p> Parkinson's is a very misunderstood condition.  There are so many symptoms, and the condition affects everyone differently.  I applied for a medical card, but I was turned down because my husband was still working.  I would like to outline roughly the cost of an average week.  Exercise classes cost &euro;30, alternative therapies cost &euro;65, supplements cost &euro;12.50 and travel costs to attend therapies or classes amount to &euro;25.  That comes to a total of &euro;132.50.  My social welfare payment is &euro;208.50, which leaves me with &euro;76.00 after paying for the above.  If I need to visit to my GP, it costs &euro;55, which is an extra for that week.  The social welfare payment needs to be increased and a medical card granted, especially as there are some services that are only accessible if you have a medical card.</p><p> There are many functions that are affected by Parkinson's.   I noticed that my voice had become very low and I was starting to leave social events early as people could not hear me.  I eventually got on to a programme called LSVT Loud.  It has really helped me and I now have the skills to help keep my voice strong for as long as possible.  In County Wexford, I do not have access to the care of a Parkinson's nurse.  I see my consultant once a year, but I do have questions in between those visits.  Parkinson's is a complex condition that affects everyone differently.  Therefore, one size does not fit all.</p><p> We are not getting the care we need to help manage this disease.  We should be given a care plan on the day of diagnosis that includes physiotherapy, nutrition advice and voice and occupational therapy.  We also need counselling to deal with the shock and ongoing challenges.  Early intervention with a multidisciplinary approach is essential to live well with Parkinson's.  It would be of huge benefit if we could attend a centre for a week of intensive therapies and assessment and be able to return again after two years for reassessment.  This would help monitor the progression of the disease, as per Articles 10 and 26 of the UNCRPD on the right to life and habilitation and rehabilitation, respectively.</p><p> Parkinson's is one of the fastest-growing neurological diseases.  The incidence of Parkinson's is expected to double by 2030.  I am pleading with the Government to act now and to put in place the services necessary to help us live well with Parkinson's.  The provision of early intervention and community-based programmes would be money well spent and would take the pressure off the hospital system.  People need to have access to ongoing exercise programmes nationwide incorporating balance work to help prevent falls, which can result in fractures and hospitalisation.  I ask the Government to ensure that we are not the forgotten people with this disability.  We have families that care about us and this disease affects their lives also.  I am still the same person as I was before my diagnosis.  I ask others to please see me, and not the disability, as per Article 17 of the UNCRPD on protecting the integrity of the person.  I thank the members for listening to my opening statement and I welcome any questions they may have.</p></speech>

Before I go to the members for their questions and comments, I want to remind the witnesses again not to name any individuals - for example, doctors - or medications when they are answering questions.  I call Deputy Wynne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1520" speakername="Violet Wynne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#D00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  They referred to a wide range of issues.  I thank them for their time and knowledge.  It has been really informative and also personal.</p> <p>  There are three main areas that I want to ask questions on, but first, I wish to mention several things that struck me in listening to the witnesses.  I have been working with a local diabetes advocacy group, Midwest Diabetes Advocacy.  Members of the group have been enlightening me as to the geographical lottery that exists even in terms of diabetes.  There is an intervention and education programme, Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating, DAFNE, that is not available in University Hospital Limerick, for example, which means that people in counties Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary are the only people in the country that do not have access to this incredibly helpful programme.</p> <p>  Ms Ulpe told us that there is not one official ME consultant in the State, which is quite unbelievable.  ME is not a new condition.  I find it concerning that across the whole of the HSE, there is no specialist.  Ms McGreehan mentioned that 50 years down the line, lupus still does appear on the long-term illness list.  In respect of Parkinson's, I know that there are only three neurologists when there should be 11.  This shortfall of eight massively impacts on access to services across the mid-west region.  Can any of the witnesses speak to their experiences of that geographic discrepancy, or instances of consultants with a specific area of expertise only working from hospitals that are a great distance away?  Is it fair to say that every witness has experienced this lack of access to expertise in their regions?</p> <p>  The theme of financial hardship was echoed across all of the witnesses' statements.  It is incredulous that not only is there no costed disability payment, but that other essential payments, such as the mobility grant, have been cut in austerity times and have never been restored.  I love the idea that assistive technology grants will be given directly to the individual and not to the employers.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on what the main asks should be in terms of lessening the financial burden on people with chronic illnesses.  Should we be calling for a costed disability payment that is tailored to the specific needs of each individual, or is it better to campaign for each separate payment, for example, assistive technology, mobility grants, etc.?</p> <p>  Finally, I wish to ask each of the witness about personal assistant services.  I find it interesting that such services were not referenced in any of the opening statements.  I am wondering if any of the witnesses have had access to a personal assistant.  Does it come back to the issue of the hierarchy of disability, and as mentioned by one of the witnesses, not being disabled enough?  Is a personal assistance service something that would assist the witnesses to live their lives in a more supported way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#E00100"><p>I want to comment on the cost of disability payment, which absolutely should be made available.  I am thinking not only of including health aids for physical mobility but also computer technology.  I could not live my life without my computer.  I do everything on it.  I cannot go to a shop to buy groceries.  I have to have them delivered, so I have to use the online services.  If my computer breaks down, I do not know how I will survive because I am totally reliant on it for everything.  Obviously, I would not be here and have a voice today if I did not have a computer.  That definitely needs to be included.</p> <p>  On the personal assistant services, I did not mention it because I do not have personal experience of applying for that, but I know many people in the ME community who have struggled to get this in place because ME is not considered a disability according to the HSE.  Some people managed to get home help anyway, but I am also aware of several people my age who have been forced to move into nursing homes because they cannot access appropriate home help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.310" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Casserly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#E00200"><p>With regard to access to consultants in regional areas, I was speaking yesterday to a young mum whose child was sick and she had her appointment in Dublin, 80 km away.  The child got sick and they had to turn around and go back, which means she has to wait another nine months for an appointment.  Had the neurologist been closer to her, she would have been able to travel herself but, with Parkinson's, people&rsquo;s energy levels for the day are a bit like money, and they have to spend it wisely.  She would not have enough energy to drive to Dublin, have the appointment and get back on her own.  That is why we need more neurologists in the regions.</p> <p>  On personal assistants, there are definitely cases where people with Parkinson's just do not have the energy to get up, get dressed and drive to appointments.  If they live in a rural area, they would have to drive for half an hour, 40 minutes or an hour to an appointment, do their therapy, or whatever it is, and then drive back home, which is just not possible.  A personal assistant would be of great benefit to somebody with advanced Parkinson's.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olga Wehrly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#E00300"><p>On the geographical aspect, I live in Dublin.  The reason I have stayed here is that my daughter has severe allergies and we have often ended up in hospital with her due to anaphylaxis.  I live very close to hospitals but it takes so much energy to go to appointments all the time, even before I had long Covid, and EDS involves an element of fatigue.  As Ms Casserly said, there is the spoon theory with regard to chronic illness in that we have a certain number of spoons and we can only use them to do a certain number of things.  When people have to drive to all of these specialists and doctors that they are paying through the nose for because they cannot wait for the public system, it is all skewed towards Dublin.  I really feel for people who live in more rural locations because their access and their support is much less.  I also do not know of anybody who has got personal assistance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorna McGreehan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#E00400"><p>I agree with everything that has been said.  At the same time, I am so grateful for my doctors in Dublin.  I have always attended them in Dublin, even though I sometimes have to travel 50, 60 or 70 miles.  They saved my life.  I tried to do it differently and things did not happen, and by that I mean that I tried to do it locally and things did not work out for me.  I am exhausted after my day in Dublin, and that is it.  I have to forget about everything else because nothing else is done for the rest of the day, or probably the rest of the week, because I am so exhausted.</p> <p>  On the question of personal assistants, I think that I am so independent that I do not need a personal assistant, and that I am not going to be that person.  I have never even thought I would be entitled to this, so I have never looked into whether I would be able to get a personal assistant.  We live in rural Ireland, away from my family, and there is no bus except the school bus, which passes my door although I am not allowed to use it.</p> <p>  There are so many obstacles.  I mentioned assistive technology, which would make things much easier.  It would mean I am able to be independent and to walk around the streets of Dublin or to go to the hospital without having to ask.  In some hospitals, I have noticed that the signs are positioned way up so some people cannot see them.  I have been laughed at and people say, &ldquo;Oh yes, the last porter was really tall.&rdquo;  Things like that are crazy in this day and age.  There are so many simple things that could make people's lives a bit easier.  It is also about the knowledge on whether people are entitled to supports and where to go for them.  In the private sector, people can apply for workplace adaptive grants and so on.  We need more knowledge and more assistance.</p></speech>

I will listen back to the responses.</p> <p>  I thank the four witnesses.  It was very humbling to listen to details of their experiences, which is essentially what we want to do.  We want to try to identify the many challenges they have in terms of living their daily lives and see what recommendations we can put forward to try to help to support them.  Today&rsquo;s meeting is very useful in terms of shining a light on the invisible disabilities that are not all too obvious, and getting more information on the background of how the medical world treats them and how society treats them, as well as looking at the stigma and discrimination that most definitely is impacting daily on all of them.</p> <p>  There are a few common threads.  The lack of effective communication between primary and secondary care is cited as a big barrier and is hugely important.  There is also the fact chronic disease management is currently hospital-based as opposed to community-based.  Having listened to Ms McGreehan talk about what it takes for her to go to hospital for her appointments, we can see that the day is fully impacted from her perspective, as well as the following days.  I would be interested to hear from all of the witnesses how they feel the appropriate community care would help in their own situations.</p> <p>  There certainly seems to be a lack of joined-up thinking in terms of the different supports that are needed.  I completely agree about the mobility grant.</p> <p>  With regard to the public realm, Ms McGreehan spoke about how inaccessible services can be and how many areas are not disability-proofed.  I was shocked to listen to Ms Casserly say she is not entitled to a medical card, particularly given the fact Parkinson's is the fastest growing neurological disease and is expected to double.  I have some friends who have Parkinson's and I know how it can impact people's lives.</p> <p>  I want to ask about filling the gap in terms of information around supports for people everywhere in the service industry, that is, within the Civil Service and public service, as well as in other areas, with regard to having the appropriate disability awareness in dealing with people with invisible diseases.</p></speech>

A great deal of planning is needed.  It is hard to know where people with Parkinson's are.  To roll out services, we need to know where people are located.  There is no database.  There is also a lack of information with regard to what the HSE is doing.  My understanding is that it sometimes runs courses or information clinics, but not that many people know about them.  The HSE is probably finding it hard to get that information out to people with disabilities.  There is need for more planning and more communication between departments and people in order that if courses are being rolled out they can get that information out there.</p></speech>

When you have lupus, there are so many things that can go wrong.  It can affect the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, central nervous system and the brain.  I have decided to keep everything in one hospital because that is the only way that I can feel safe.  In regard to my eyes, because I was on medication for a long time, the retina was burned out of the back of my eye.  It is very rare that that happens.  One has more chance of winning the lottery.  It is macular, but because it is drug induced nobody knows for how long more I will have the degree of sight that I have.  It is my personal decision to keep everything in one place, with the HSE and my doctors.  In recent times, things have been changed up.  One of my consultants retired and so things will be a little bit more difficult until I find my feet.</p> <p>  I am in the lucky position that I can interview my doctors.  I will not accept bad manners; I am fed up with that.  We have to be strong.  Without a specific doctor to go to, I do not know where I would be.  On discrimination with regard to public transport, rural Ireland does not have a public transport system to enable people to get from A to B.  One is always relying on taxis, strangers and so on for transport.  There are things that can be made better.  Hopefully, we can do that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.318" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna-Karin Ulpe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#F00300"><p>On the topic of accessibility, it is assumed that people can drive or that they have somebody to drive them to appointments because, very often, public transport is totally inadequate.  I am in a better position that other people because I live in Dublin.  During most of my illness, I have not been able to use public transport because I cannot not sit upright for too long.  During my journey to finding my final and good consultant, I saw ten health professionals.  As I could not sit for too long in waiting rooms, I brought my yoga mat with me to lie on so that I would not faint before I was seen.  When I rolled it out on the floor, I was told that for health and safety reasons I was not allowed to lie down.  Nobody ever thinks that people might be so sick they need to lie down in a waiting room if waiting for an hour.  This is the first hurdle that must be overcome.  It would be so easy to provide a space where people can lie down.</p> <p>  The person who cannot drive or access public transport should be able to access health care through home visits otherwise they are just being left to rot.  It is important services are provided close to the person in the community.  To get my Covid jab, I had to use public transport and even though it was only a short ten-minute journey it took so much out of me in terms of energy that I was in bed a for week afterwards and could only struggle to get to the toilet.  There was no accommodation to sort this out in any other way.  That is my note on accessibility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.319" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olga Wehrly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#F00400"><p>I want to follow on from what Anna-Karin said about accessibility.   Since I got long Covid I have had similar issues with public transport.  When I am in a flare of EDS, there is often no seating at the bus stop.  If you have to go somewhere and you need to be there at a particular time, inevitably it is easier to drive, if possible.  I have noticed that a lot of seating has been removed in our urban areas and villages.  Two weeks ago, I went to a private shopping centre in a nearby village.  There are no seats there, apart from in the caf&eacute;s.  For people with mobility issues and people who get fatigued, it is really important that we make our villages and towns more friendly.  Currently, these places are very hostile in that there is nowhere to sit down and rest.  It is seen as inciting antisocial behaviour.  That is at the expense of people who really need to take a little breather.  Access to toilets is also an issue.  I noticed during the pandemic that there are very few, if any, public toilets.  We are relying on the private sector to provide them and that is not appropriate.</p></speech>

I now invite Deputy Canney to make his contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.321" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#F00600"><p>I thank all our guests for being here and for their presentations.  Ms Casserly mentioned that a number of years ago, all of a sudden, as a young woman she was faced with Parkinson's, wondering how she was going to cope with that and tell her family about it and that she also had to give up work, etc.  It has been life-changing.  I do not wish to be despondent, but what I am hearing is that she is left in a void, that she has to start at base level as if she is in junior infants and only beginning to get on with life from hereon in, but the supports are just not there and there is no pathway.  This comes through in other areas such as, for example, when a child first receives a diagnosis of autism.  The parents have to first cope with that and then find out where to go, what to do and so on.  What is lacking is a type of case-worker who will take on the person or family and point them on the pathway in terms of services, contacts and how they are co-ordinated.  There is a huge gap in that co-ordination for anybody with disabilities, be that an acquired disability or one the person was born with.</p> <p>  An issue regularly raised with me, and with this committee by witnesses, is that of entitlements, in particular the medical card.  There should be no question that anybody with a disability should be entitled to a medical card irrespective of income.  That should be a given.  I know of amputees, some of whom have appeared as witnesses before this committee, who cannot get a medical card.  Even though the cost of replacement of an artificial leg is &euro;20,000 and that might need to be done every two or three years, in the cases raised with me these people cannot get a medical card or access funding.  The lived experiences of the witnesses are important to us as policymakers and legislators.  They have articulated those experiences well today.  It is important to note that the mobility grant was withdrawn and that ten years later it still has not been replaced.  That is a huge issue.  Anybody trying to get a primary medical certificate will know only too well the difficulties that arise in that regard.</p> <p>  I come from east Galway where, when people are refused a medical certificate and they have to go for an assessment, they are offered an appeal in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It might be an enormous challenge for them to get to D&uacute;n Laoghaire for the appeal because they may not be fit to travel to Dublin, which is a 2.5 hour journey each way.  We do have other clinics, such as the clinic in Roscommon, which I last visited three or four years ago.  That is the type of problem people are facing.</p><p> There is something that galls more than anything else.  I have come across a number of cases of it.  One man getting disability payment got married.  His wife is working.  His disability allowance has been cut to about &euro;50 a week because his wife's means are taken into account.  I have met the couple.  It is demoralising for him.  He says had he known this would happen, they would not have got married but would have lived in sin.  He smiles when he says that, but he is very upset that he is being penalised because he got married.</p><p> Housing adaptation grants were mentioned.  There is a problem because the local authorities do great work on this but they are given an amount of funding, and they make a contribution towards the cost but they do not cover it.  Then, when they assess how much they will pay, they must look at all income coming into the house.  If a son or daughter is living in the house because they cannot afford to rent, and they are working, their income must be taken into account and that might push someone over the threshold where they will not get even 10% of the cost of the adaptations.  We have a lot of work to do.</p><p> I do not necessarily have questions for the witnesses, but I want to echo what we get from others.  I commend the witnesses on their forthright contributions.  The committee is working hard and is united.  We are doing that because every one of us on the committee wants to be on it.  We volunteered to be on the committee to try and make a difference.  With the witnesses help and continued engagement we will do that.  I thank the witnesses and apologise because I must go to the Business Committee meeting at 11 a.m.  If I leave, I am not being disrespectful.  It is just that I have to be elsewhere.  There are many issues and problems, and we want to be able to support the Minister in making changes.  That is why we are working as we are.</p></speech>

It can be very hard to do both.  You do not want to have to be fighting all the time for your rights.</p> <p>  I was told that information was given on Parkinson's, but it was not geared towards the early onset form of the disease.  A young person in his 40s was in a group with people in their 80s.  They were talking about hoists and choking.  That is scary to hear that in your 40s.  We need information appropriate to the right age group.</p> <p>  On medical cards, it is terrible that we are depending on our partners to support us.  I am mindful that I am lucky to have a partner.  There are people living on their own depending on the social welfare payment.  I spoke to one man who had an automatic car but had to get rid of it because he could not afford to meet the bills.  That means he is further isolated from society because he cannot drive in a rural area.</p></speech>

It is good if you can put the money up front first and get some back but for those who cannot afford any co-payment, they cannot avail of those grants at all.  To the poorest, least is given.</p> <p>  On assessing the means of the whole household, it is well and good where someone has a partner.  Say if you are long-time married, the partner will contribute to your expenses but there are people in their 20s and 30s who cannot move on in their life or form significant relationships because nobody dares to go into a relationship with them because they know that they will have to be their carers instantly and have all that responsibility and they will have to pay for them for the rest of their life.  It is a totally unequal relationship that is doomed from the start.  I really feel for the young people who cannot support themselves or form new relationships.</p></speech>

I want to highlight the huge discrepancy between how Revenue and Social Welfare treat marriage and cohabitation.  In Revenue's eyes, if you are not married you do not get the benefits of being married, but with the Department of Social Protection if you live with someone, you are treated as though you are married and are penalised accordingly.  As a result, I am afraid that living in sin would not have saved him.  However, it is an issue for a lot of people.  Why is there this difference in the benefits and disadvantages accrue?  It is of benefit to be married for Revenue but in the eyes of the Department of Social Protection it makes no odds.</p></speech>

I appreciate that they are sharing their very personal experiences.  As Deputy Canney said, the committee is very united in supporting and advocating and very respectfully treating everything that is exposed to us.  It is a very vulnerable experience for the witnesses but it is very much appreciated.  We really value it.</p> <p>  If I were to look for a trend across all the contributions, it would be cost and a lack of joined-up thinking.  It is shocking that the list has not been updated since 1972 given how far medical science and diagnosis and so on has come on in 50 years.  I will give out about that in the Seanad later.  There will be chronic illnesses that we might not have the specialism or that has not yet evolved or it is newly diagnosed or new thinking.  However, there is a formula of using an multidisciplinary approach.  I am not a medical person and am learning on my feet in the Oireachtas.  However, the organiser in me would draw up a spider diagram and consider the A to Z of issues.  Having a template of considerations for novel illnesses should not be beyond the abilities of people in the HSE.  I fail to understand why that has not been done and why there is not a formula in central office for newly emerging illnesses.  Take long Covid.  While we are learning on our feet, literally, and it is new, there should be a formula that we are able to apply.  The common theme I hear from everyone is the idea that an illness comes forward and there is no adequate response.  It is up to the person who is grappling with the consequences of living with that illness to find out all the solutions for themselves.  The concept of a one-stop-shop or office that could be set up to provide that information and orchestrates co-ordinated thinking should be feasible.  I really do not understand that.</p><p> I know that each of the witnesses are here as individuals rather than representative organisations but are there organisations that support their particular illnesses?  I know in the case of Parkinson's disease there is.  Do we have any idea of numbers?  When we are talking to gurus in Departments, it is useful sometimes to turn around and quantify and say this is how many people there are.  It further exacerbates the shameful lack of thinking by being able to quantify.  One person is enough for us to have an adequate response as a State.  I am not trying to minimise it in any way.  I am just saying it gives us an idea.  I think I have covered it all.  I have not gone anywhere near the remotest outrage I felt when I was reading the witnesses' statements but I think from that perspective, those are the sorts of things.  On that medical card issue and the lack of not being disabled enough, I have a very close supporter who equally is an amputee and has never qualified.  Again, the idea of that is absolutely shameful.  I am aware there is not really a question in that; it is just me venting.  If there is anything the witnesses want me to take on board they should please feel free to say so.</p></speech>

The idea about a one-stop-shop would be absolutely fantastic because one has to duplicate so many applications for every individual piece of help that one can get and it takes absolutely all of one's available energy.  It has been just form-filling, eating and sleeping.  That is my life, more or less, so if the different parts of society could talk to each other and co-ordinate between themselves it would take a huge load off us really.</p> <p>  When assessing if people are eligible for different grants, benefits, housing or the fuel allowance, one important thing is forgotten now and that is to take into account what a person's available income is after his or her rent is paid.  I constantly feel like we renters in the private sector are forgotten about.  We may have an income that would have been adequate if we lived in social housing or if we had a long-term mortgage but with the current market rent, we are very often left with less after rent is paid than the supplementary welfare allowance.  We are, therefore, the poorest percentile in Ireland and yet for some things, we cannot get help.  We do not qualify.  That is extremely frustrating.</p> <p>  I can tell the Senator about the numbers of people with ME in Ireland.   It should be approximately 10,000 to 19,000 people but it is really hard to estimate because so many people are undiagnosed as a result of lacking consultants and because so many people cannot travel to care or consultants abroad.  They are really stuck in that sense.  There is a very good organisation called ME Advocates Ireland, MEAI.  It has a survey under way that will be handed over to the HSE when the data is collated and interpreted, and probably to the Department of Health as well.  Then, the Senator will be able to look at this and see what the situation is for all those people in Ireland now and what we need help with.  If anybody-----</p></speech>

When that is ready to go I would urge MEAI to contact us as a committee and we will go out to the gates of Leinster House and receive it on Ms Ulpe's behalf.  I believe that would be an important thing to do and I know our committee would be only too delighted to support that.</p></speech>

MEAI would be delighted to hear that; the committee is very good.  For anybody interested in the newest research on ME and also on long Covid and the relationship between long Covid and ME, there is a fantastic resource called Open Medicine Foundation.  The website is <i>omf.ngo</i>, which stands for non-governmental organisation.  It is a global research leader with six research centres across the globe.  It is US based but it is also in Canada, Australia and Sweden.  It is trying to uncover this newest problem in the world now.  It is independent so it is relying only on private funding.  No governments are supporting it.  It has two Nobel laureates among its researchers.  There is loads of information on its website if anybody is interested in that.</p></speech>

Therefore, how can we forward plan if Parkinson's is going to double by 2030?  If one does not have the figures on where people are, how can one forward plan for the health service?  It does not make sense for planning that we cannot get these figures.  We should have a database and every condition should have exact numbers.  I like the idea of having a centre to co-ordinate everything so that people could seek support or even say there is a support group.  Everybody needs peer support.  We could link in to all the support groups for every condition and say this is where a person can go and get peer support, which I found so beneficial.  I would not have gotten half the information I have today only for my peers.</p></speech>

There is always the fear, however.  It is like the social welfare fear of going in and asking for something.  Sometimes it is the embarrassment.  Maybe it is the disability awareness training that some people need to have to deal with people.  We are not liars.  Just because I look fine and look grand does not mean that I do not suffer with a problem or a disability.</p> <p>  There are costs associated with lupus.  I am again very lucky.  I have a wonderful family who supported me when I had nothing.  I work every day but I only live to work because I have not got the energy to do anything else on the other days.  Again, I am in the lucky position that I have a job but just because I have a job does not mean that I should be grateful, like I said, when other things are available to make my job easier.  It would be wonderful if there were more people with disabilities throughout all Government Departments and people were being promoted within them.  There is an initiative to get something like 20% of people with disabilities working in the public sector.  If we could be-----</p></speech>

Those types of things will be absolutely fantastic.  According to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, in 2013 there were 1,500 people with lupus in Ireland, which is a relatively small number.</p></speech>

People who are working and who operate the lupus support group are lupus sufferers.  We cannot, therefore, always be the best advocate for ourselves and we cannot always advocate for others because we are all struggling day by day.  The lupus support group does struggle and we are constantly relying on the kindness of strangers to donate to try to keep things going because it is funded by the members.  That is difficult.  I also work with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland which has been a wonderful organisation to work with.  It is absolutely fantastic.  I am currently doing an introduction to braille online course.  Those services it has provided have been great.  I am lucky to have the support of the NCBI with me.  Again, those types of people are great but they are not always there.</p><p> I mentioned the lupus support group.  It is difficult, but things have changed with social media.  I was 17 when I was diagnosed and now, with social media, I have access to groups all over the world.  That has been a complete eye-opener for me.  I can discuss medication and so many things with my peers all over the world.  Lupus mainly affects women and ethnic groups; black women are often affected.  Are we the people who are forgotten about?</p></speech>

I loved listening to what she said.  She is right, and it was a core point in my opening statement as well, that we are not being counted.  That is really important.  Judging by the Facebook groups, there are 2,500 people in the long Covid support group.  That is a condition that has only sprung up in the past year and a half or two years.  Then there are ADHD groups.  There are 4,500 people in one of the support groups I am in for ADHD.  That is 4,500 people who are not getting access to ADHD services.  There are approximately 1,000 people in the EDS groups, but they are English speakers and they are all from the same kind of community.  Peer support is amazing when joining these groups from around the world and you get access to tips that work and pathways to seek help.  It is coming from the wrong place though; it should be community-based because it would be the best way.  It should not necessarily be medicalised but it should be within our local health centres with our public health nursing teams or whatever so that one can access this information.  It could even be online on the HSE website or Department of Social Protection websites.</p> <p>  I would also like to say that for us it involves a lot of form filling all of the time, just like Ms Ulpe was saying, and it includes printing costs and so on.  Language is important and the forms contain a lot of jargon.  They are written for people who work in these offices and were expected to read them and understand what they mean.  They need to be in clear English and not everybody in Ireland has English as a first language.  It is not only about the language in the forms, it is also about the tone.  There is almost a sense of entitlement levelled at people.  It is as if they are asking for something they should not have asked for.  It is already demeaning enough to have to try to find your place in society without coming up against this barrier.  I know these forms have been used for years but going forward they need to be made more inclusive of everybody to retain people&rsquo;s dignity.</p></speech>

It is no excuse for forms to have a presumption of guilt built into them.  There is no excuse for jargon in law either.  I have been a barrister for only nine years and we were taught plain English and not legalese.  A Department should do the same and there is a directive on that.</p></speech>

All of the forms are in plain English there because they have had a multicultural society for such a long time.  The statistics are important.  The likes of Facebook groups are amazing resources but they can also be sources of disinformation and places where we can pick up the wrong ideas.  One only has a finite amount of energy to spend but over the years I have gone down some weird rabbit holes trying various remedies in the hope they would work and then I realised I needed to stop.  Having adequate resources is so important and saves time for everybody and you can trust those resources as well.</p> <p>  Another point was made about the groups that are managed.  Everybody who runs these groups is also ill or has significant hindrances so it becomes a problem in advocacy because there is a lot of genuine fatigue.  Nobody wants to take on the mantle of being the person who is co-ordinating the group, who will talk to the Minister and so on.  It is hard for people in this area to be clear, to have a voice and to be consistent because we are all holding each other up and we are all tired.</p></speech>

This week we are hearing about another element of living with a disability that is overlooked.  Chronic illnesses have a major and ongoing impact on people&rsquo;s lives and the witnesses have clearly shown us that.  Due to the limited time available I will only be able to ask a few questions but if there is time after these two questions I will come back in with a third one.</p> <p>  Ms Casserly highlighted the fact that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is one of the fastest growing neurological diseases and is expected to double by 2030.  She rightly encouraged the Government to be proactive and invest in early intervention and community-based programmes now, which would be better for individuals and health services.  Could Ms Casserly describe what kind of programmes she would have in mind or what would be useful?</p> <p>  Ms McGreehan highlighted that the mobility grant was stopped for new applicants in 2013.  A new scheme was due to replace it but nothing has materialised yet.  This is an issue that many of us will be aware of from our constituency work.  Could Ms McGreehan elaborate on the significance of this grant and why it needs to be reinstated immediately.  She points out that in some cases individuals have to use their annual leave for medical appointments.  Given that some conditions require multiple appointments with different healthcare professionals, this is an indication of the reality of living with a chronic illness and of Ireland's poor worker rights.  Does Ms Casserly think there should be a statutory right to take necessary medical appointments without affecting annual leave?  If there is time I will have a question for Ms Wehrly at the end as well.</p></speech>

I did not realise how important exercise was and now there is research and education on that.  Years ago people were probably told to go home and sit down and that is the worst thing one could do for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.  Some people think that walking alone is enough, but it is not.  There needs to be a wider range of movements in exercise programmes for functions such as getting out of the chair, twisting and turning.  Education is needed around that physiotherapy.  Community-based exercise programmes specifically for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease would help to prevent falls and would also have a social element that would connect people.  Speech therapy is also so important.  Once you start to lose your speech it is hard to get it back so specific speech therapy is needed.  There is a programme called LSVT Loud, which is specifically for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and everybody should be put onto that programme straight away and they would learn the skills necessary to maintain their voices as they journey through this condition.</p> <p>  Counselling is also important.  People are shocked when they get their diagnoses.  One could be in the workplace and at the height of one&rsquo;s career or one could be the main earner in the house and suddenly one might have to give up work.  One might have children to put through college and expenses such as a mortgage and it is hard to cope and manage.  Anxiety, stress and depression can be symptoms of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease as well so counselling is overlooked in helping to cope with the disease.  There is also occupational therapy and assisted technology.  I want to touch on information for employers.  If a worker goes to an employer and says that he or she has this condition, we must give the employer the skills to know what to do, what to say and how to help the worker.  I know that is getting away from the community question but it is something I wanted to mention to the committee.  We need more community involvement and the Sl&aacute;intecare programme seems to have the right approach in that regard.  People need to be kept away from the hospital system for as long as possible and they need to be given the skills to cope with this condition.</p></speech>

The grants I was talking about are assistive technology grants.</p><p>They are not available to people in the public sector; they are at the discretion of the employer.  Private sector employers can access grants on behalf of their employees.  It would be great if there was a national register of people who had chronic illnesses and a statutory entitlement to a day off to go to the doctor.  I would probably have ten hospital appointments in Dublin.  Taking ten days out of people's annual leave entitlement is a lot when they are exhausted.  It is not fair on their partners because they want to go away for a couple of days but they are constantly in the car driving to Dublin.  People go up to Dublin and are not even fit to go for a walk around St. Stephen's Green and smell the coffee.  These issues are very important.  I would like a national register of people with chronic diseases.  Employers are afraid that people will take advantage of statutory days.  The fear in some organisations is that people would get one up on the employer.  We are not trying to get one up on anybody.  We just want to live and work.  We just want to breathe and be able to have a level playing field in all aspects of our lives.  This would be great.</p></speech>

She was speaking about what seems like not enough recognition of EDS in Ireland.  She referenced the UK, obviously acknowledging there being pathways for diagnosis.  I do not know whether she has the information to hand and a written response would be great.  What is it like on a European or global scale?  Is Ireland a total outlier in terms of not really acknowledging it?</p></speech>

Last week, I came across somebody in a parenting group who suspected she had EDS.  She was presenting with many of the same symptoms.  She was added to one of our EDS Facebook groups.  She asked how she would go about getting a diagnosis.  We said there is not really anybody she could go to and that she could try this or that.  She is French.  Within 24 hours she had contacted a doctor at home and had been referred for an EDS assessment in France.  She had a plethora of appointments all lined up.  She asked us whether she should go ahead and everyone in our community answered &quot;Yes&quot;.  We said it was like winning the golden ticket in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i>.  We just do not have it here.<br/><br/>With regard to the mobility grants, it is about issues such as personal care and assistance with bedding and stairs.  It is not open any more.  Many of these supports are very much geared towards people who own their own homes.  This is a problem for many of us.  I am a single parent and I do not have a partner to help financially.  Those of us in private rental accommodation do not have an end point.  We are stuck.  We are in the private sector.  We will never earn a huge amount because we are a little bit restricted.  The retirement years look a little bleak at this point because there is no security.  It is not about getting a handout and looking for money.  It is about empowering us to be able to go out and build careers and lives for ourselves so we can provide for our families and have security.</p></speech>

My sister inspires me.  She is my driving force every time I engage with the committee and in every act I do in this regard.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  I am grateful for all of their comments.  What has come across is being othered, not being heard, not being listened to and not having access to grants or equity in society.  People cannot just get on with life.  They feel like they are begging for their best self when their best self is theirs.  They should be advocates and should have autonomy over their own futures and selves.</p> <p>  My question is for Ms Ulpe, Ms Wehrly and Ms Casserly.  It is a general question.  They have a hidden illness.  I also have an autoimmune disease.  How hard was it for them to get heard and listened to by the medical profession and even to be believed?  On the outside people look okay but on the inside they are crumbling.  People struggle along and they do not feel heard.  What was the experience of the witnesses in getting diagnosed and the pathway to diagnosis?</p> <p>  The witnesses all articulated very clearly how they struggle constantly to get things and to get answers.  Ms Wehrly spoke about Facebook groups and being brought down a rabbit hole.  I have been that person too and brought down rabbit holes to think a cocktail of turmeric or parsley or whatever could help me.  Many issues have been discussed.  What three things would they change tomorrow?  Would they include an independent advocacy service or employment rights and supports being moved to a different Department?  Would they include a different attitude?  How do we change from a medical viewpoint to a social viewpoint to help people, as opposed to making them sicker or to make them look like they are just a sick person or just a person with a chronic illness.  We are very aware there is so much more to everybody than just one label.  I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

It is crucial.  Longing to be heard is a big thing.  I saw ten different consultants over five years to try to get a diagnosis.  It is so crushing to receive disbelief, hear people saying there is nothing wrong and that the only problem is that people are fat.  I have been told this.  I heard that I was lazy for getting my own wheelchair.  I have been gaslighted so much that it is a wonder I am still alive today, to be honest.  We have to be so strong not to disintegrate completely from all of this.  The big thing to change is education.  Everyone in the health service should be educated about ME, as should everybody working with disability and social care, so they recognise how ill and how disabled we are and how many accommodations we need to access basic healthcare.  Getting this recognition would mean so much.</p> <p>  I will tell the committee what happened when I saw the first consultant who understood my illness and who listened to me.  I was a beautiful May day, with flowering fruit trees all around.  It felt like I had come to paradise because I was seen.  I cried with relief in the car all they way back from Tullamore that day.  It was a cathartic experience that finally somebody believed me and saw me and that now my journey to get help could begin.  He helped me with all of the paperwork for housing.  He got me medication.  Everything started then.  Five years of my life were gone totally, which made me worse.  Now I cannot do much but before all this started I had begun to get a little bit better.  I was able to do a little bit of light yoga and have more of a social life.  Because of all the fighting, I do not know whether I will ever get back to that level.</p></speech>

She asked about raising awareness.  I spent many years thinking I had fibromyalgia and going to different physiotherapists.  Like Ms Ulpe, when I eventually got my diagnosis, it was a relief to know I was not going mad and to have an answer as to what was wrong with me.  There needs to be more awareness raising around disabilities and the fact that some of them are hidden.  I sometimes feel we are like swans, looking calm on top but with hell going on at times underneath.</p> <p>  Financial assistance is an issue I want to highlight.  Some people find it very stressful to fill out the forms, and stress and Parkinson's disease do not go well together.  Why make it so complicated when people are in genuine need?  In the case of housing adaptation grants, for example, it can take more than a year for people to get funding to make their home more suitable for them.  Parkinson's disease is a progressive condition that is not going to go away any time soon.  We are praying for a cure but there is none at the moment.  Why put people trough so much stress and turmoil?  A woman I know has an upstairs bathroom and has to get in the bathtub to have a shower.  She lives on her own and could fall.  We are hearing those sorts of things every day.  Why make it so hard for people?  Fighting for help is putting stress on people who are already coping with this condition.  I do not think it is fair.</p> <p>  We need to have services and therapies available locally and we need more neurologists and nurses who specialise in Parkinson's disease.  We need to have that care in between our yearly appointments.  People go on medication, have side effects and are left wondering what is normal and if the side effects will calm down.  Parkinson's disease is complex and we need to have a backup system whereby people can pick up the telephone and ask somebody what they should do, including whether they should tweak their medication, take it at different times or whatever else.  We need that information but, unfortunately, it is not there at the moment.  I thank the committee for listening to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.352" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olga Wehrly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021111800002#L00200"><p>I echo what the others said.  With something like ADHD, it can take up to 60 years for people to get a diagnosis, especially women because they present quite differently from men.  We are used to masking in society as it is, getting on with it and putting a brave face on things.  I got fobbed off by GPs for many years in trying to access an ADHD diagnosis because it was kind of seen as some faddy American thing.  I was told, "Sure, you do not need that; you look fine."  With EDS as well, there is definitely an element of medical gaslighting because people are presenting with all these random, chronic issues that are not acute.  You are not at death's door but there are niggly things that kind of are fine but kind of not.  You are in and out to the GP all the time.</p> <p>  If I were to ask for three actions that would help, the first would be to have a register or database, as discussed earlier, from which people can take statistics as to who has what in this country.  If we are not being measured, there is no way of knowing how we are progressing.  It seems like a baseline requirement to have a register.  Second, GPs are usually our first port of call and they are amazing, but their knowledge relates to general practice.  With EDS, we call ourselves zebras because a zebra is the emblem of rare diseases.  When doctors are in training, the phrase "Hear hooves, think horses" is often used because, generally, one should not assume somebody has the rarest disease because that is statistically unlikely.  By and large, because of that, the exceptions, like us, may fall through the cracks.  It would be helpful if GP knowledge were updated every so often.  I find medical knowledge of EDS and ADHD has really increased in the past while.  In the case of long Covid, however, I am still seeing people in the support groups whose GPs are dismissing them or who have had no access to apply to long Covid clinics because the GP is not paying to attention to information on it or may not even believe in it.</p> <p>  The third action would be around localised access.  Obviously, it is not suitable for everybody but our health centres could be a really good resource.  I know from personal experience that staffing is a huge issue but it would be great for people to be able to go to their public health nurse rather than having to book lots of doctors appointments when, for example, they want to check side effects of medicine and link in on a continuing basis.  It can be exhausting for us to clog up the system and drain it for everyone else.  There has to be an easier way to streamline things.</p></speech>

The discussion has been a real education and something of an eye-opener for me, particularly when it comes to ME and Parkinson's disease.  I was not aware how widespread they are and how difficult it is to measure their incidence.  That is a real failing and flaw within our health service.</p> <p>  Regarding Ms Ulpe's contribution, it is very disheartening to hear how difficult it was for her to get a diagnosis.  It is simply not right.  She described as crushing the challenge of the diagnosis and of not having the high-level medical consultants available who specialise in these areas.  It must cause many challenges within the health service.  I support what Senator Seery Kearney said about accepting the letter and getting the committee to act on that.  That would be a really strong statement and I am happy to be part of it.</p> <p>  Ms Casserly spoke about her experience with Parkinson's disease as feeling like she is a swan.  As somebody who has had to navigate through the service, who was an unlikely candidate for the disease and who, because of her age group, did not have access to naturally occurring peer-to-peer mentoring, I am delighted she is getting help now and that those groups have provided so much support.  Both Ms Casserly and Ms Ulpe spoke about the need for a database of organisations and, even more importantly, a database or register of patients.  To use Ms Wehrly's word, that really needs to be streamlined.  I think this committee can put pressure on the HSE to provide the resources to make it happen.</p> <p>  The need for a database of patients leads on to what Ms McGreehan spoke about as somebody who is working and making a huge contribution to the economy as well as battling many other challenges.  Without additional leave, going up and down to Dublin or wherever else is putting people like her and Ms Wehrly under a lot of pressure.  Action in that regard sounds very doable and it needs to happen hand in hand with the setting up of a register of patients.  It should be relatively easy on an administrative level to make that happen if the will is there, and the budget, to do it.  My question to the witnesses is what that would that look like in terms of the amount of leave - specifically, the number of days - that would suffice to start with and how that leave might be drawn down.</p> <p>  Ms Wehrly referred to housing adaptation grants.  I would be really interested to hear how she thinks we could help with that barrier.  If, for instance, we were to make the adaptation grant available to renters, does she think there would be buy-in from landlords?  Would such provision be of practical assistance or do we need to think more outside of the box on this?</p></speech>

I do not know how to quantify the number of days that might be needed.  Some years, depending on my health, I might only see the doctor every six months, but if I am ill, I could do so every three months or every month.  It is dependent on my whether my lungs are affected or my eyes or getting worse.  I need different types of treatment.  There has to be a compromise.  I do not want anything for nothing.  Those are small details in some ways.  At this stage, we would be happy to take any scraps from the table.  Anything that is done, does not have to be set in stone; it can be reviewed.</p></speech>

In terms of the pandemic and the vaccine, because I was dealing with a hospital outside of my area and the local health board had issued appointments to all of the people on its books who were chronically ill, they all got the vaccine before I did.  The hospital in Dublin would not look after me.  As a result, I had to wait until such time as my GP was able to administer it.  My local health board was not aware that I have a chronic disease.</p></speech>

The local consultants looked after their patients, as one would expect them to do.  In Dublin, the country bumpkins were expected to be dealt with locally.  The GP tried to source a vaccine.  I eventually had it administered at my GP's clinic, but there was a bit of a lag.  If the HSE had an overall register of where each person with a particular condition is living, it could organise services accordingly and those services could feedback into the system with regard to the need for days off to ensure that people are not spoofing the system.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

I am self-employed but for some jobs, I am on PAYE.  My employment is strange in that I work doing voice-overs and as an actor.  Days off are not really an issue when you are self-employed, unfortunately.  The days off are the days on which you are looking for work.  There is another issue that has not been raised yet, but I think we can all relate to it.  I find that in the workplace I am trying to come off as not having anything wrong because I do not want to be a burden.  As there is an insurance element to it and I have to fill out an insurance form for every job I do, I want to be insurable.</p> <p>  Having had long Covid for the past year, I probably would not have been insurable to be on television or film set because I was experiencing a great deal of vertigo and other significant things.  On the issue of days off and annual leave, I do not know it is works in that respect for somebody in my position.  In terms of renting and rental accommodation, it is the broader issue of having insecure housing and relying on a private rental market.  If we are relying on hyper-inflated markets and the housing assistance payment scheme which, at best, is dysfunctional, it is a precarious system.  If one could find an amenable landlord, who would allow one to put rails in a bathroom and so on, it is not a long-term solution because the housing in itself is not a long-term solution.  It is about bringing it back to the basics.  We need housing, shelter and employment, all of which are core things.  Days off and grants for adaptation are amazing but they need to be tied into something that is more suitable for our needs as a whole.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

I previously lived in a private rental at first floor level.  Most of the time, I could not get out of it because I could not manage the stairs.  I had a wheelchair but my landlord would not allow me to store it in the lobby, and I was not able to get it up the stairs into the apartment.  I asked the landlord if I could store it in the lobby where buggies were being stored - it was a big enough area such that nobody was falling over them.  He stated that for health and safety reasons the wheelchair would be a fire hazard.  I had to store it outside.  I was lucky that it was not stolen, but it rusted.  When you rent privately, you have few rights.  It is you against the landlord.  If there could be any accommodation provided for people who need mobility aids and have to live in private housing for however long that might be, it would be a help.  Landlords should be allowed to refuse that.</p></speech>

I was told that if the issue was that wheelchair would be a fire hazard it could not help.  Some time later, we were issued with a notice of termination because the landlord wanted to sell.  I do not have any family in Ireland and we had nowhere to go.  We were facing homelessness at a time when I was completely bed-bound and could not even put my underwear in a bag.  Were it not for our lovely neighbours, we would not have been able to move.  They moved everything for us.  My partner was still formally employed at this point and we were able to secure a new contract for the place we live in now.  We were lucky in that nobody asked us for a P60.  If that had happened, we would have been screwed and homeless.  This type of stress makes my condition much worse.  It should not happen.  That is my comment in regard to private renting.</p> <p>  On the list of disabled persons, my concern is who would administer it?  My GP refused to put me on the list of vulnerable persons, which I had asked him to do in order that I could get the Covid jab earlier.  My GP said that because I was not immunocompromised, I was not at increased risk of getting sick.  To be honest, I could not see myself surviving Covid.  I already have so little energy that I feel like I am dying, so I would not even have the energy to cough.  Covid would finish me off, definitely, but that is not recognised.  If we could self-report, we could then, at least, put up our hands and say how many people fulfil the international consensus criteria for ME.  The HSE would have to decide the international criteria for diagnosis it would want to use, because there is, as yet, no diagnostic test.  The international consensus criteria would be a good idea.  If we had self-reporting, this register would provide us with a fairly accurate picture of how many people are suffering.  In terms of statistics, it is estimated that 70% of ME sufferers are unable to work.</p></speech>

I would like make a point about days and time off work.</p><p>It is kind of tricky to know what the ideal number would be.  I should point out that many people are afraid to tell their employers they have Parkinson's disease for fear or losing their jobs or not being treated equally.  It is a big issue at times.  How do people tell their employers?  It is a risk some people are worried about taking.  There may be stress in that and of maybe trying to hide the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as a tremor, making it even worse.  They are the sorts of issues that arise.</p><p> As I said, I have given up work and I spend my time trying to do the things to keep as well as possible with Parkinson's.  This includes exercise and alternative therapies.  When I need to go to appointments in Dublin, my husband is self-employed and he can arrange to bring me.  I am lucky like that because not everybody is in that position.  This goes back to local services.  People should be near the services they need and have access to a Parkinson's nurse and a neurologist.  That is essential because how else can one make plans?  It is great when we hear the Government is pledging money to the HSE but how is it going to be spent?  We would not give &euro;100 to a five-year-old child and a plan would be laid out on how it would be spent.  It is great that today the committee is listening to us as patients and our voices in speaking about what we need.  We really appreciate it and I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Many of the witnesses spoke about data on chronic disease.  We have heard at various meetings about the lack of data on disability.  It is mind-boggling think how there can be any proper planning without such data.  That is extremely important.</p> <p>  I find it unbelievable there is no diagnostic test for ME at this stage.  I know people who have had ME for 20 years or more.  It is amazing there is no proper diagnostic test at this stage and people are basically treated in a dismissive fashion, being told they are okay or look fine so they should go ahead and work and so on.  Is much research being done on all the diseases or illnesses mentioned by the witnesses?</p> <p>  The cost of disability is coming up time and again and we hear it from everybody.  It seems there is an assumption that people can survive on a payment of &euro;200 per week or that they have a medical card covering GP and doctor visits, along with medication.  As the witnesses pointed out, many other supports are needed, including assistive technology, physiotherapy, exercise classes or nutrition advice.  None of that seems to be covered and it is not taken into account.  That must be highlighted on a continuous basis to ensure it can be taken into account.</p> <p>  There is also bureaucracy around form filling and it affects so many people, no matter what payment people are applying for.  It applies if they are applying for social housing or any sort of social welfare payment.  The forms are so long and difficult and they must be put in simpler language and made easier for people to complete.  They should be available in different languages to ensure that everybody can understand what they are applying for.  So many people do not know what they are entitled to or what they should apply for.  I spoke with a woman whose son had an intellectual disability.  She did not know she could apply for the domiciliary care allowance.  She had never applied for it in the full 16 years it was available.  She should not have to know it and she should have been informed by the district nurse or whoever at the time that she had certain entitlements.  There must be an easier way of informing people of what are their entitlements or what supports are available without somebody having to ask, look or rely on others, such as the peer support that we have heard about as being so important to direct people in a certain way and make them aware of what supports are available.  That should not happen and people should be able to access all that information very easily.</p></speech>

I am aware that the EU has recently increased the funding for biomedical research around ME but it is extremely underfunded all across the world.  It looks like they are pretty close to a breakthrough in the Open Medicine Foundation to finding a diagnostic test.  My brain is too slow to explain what it is trying to do but it is something the researchers can see in blood.  It looks like they are close to finding it.  Of course, it would be great if governments could chip in and help fund this because keeping us sick is also a cost.</p> <p>  I do not know for sure if Ireland funds any biomedical research for ME but I would be surprised if that was the case.  I am aware of a recent study of the financial impact of ME.  It is from 2020 and members could google the financial impact of ME in Ireland to find it.  They could get an idea of the costs from that.  It is a pretty small study but at least it is a start.</p></speech>

Deputy Higgins asked about days off from work.  Many people with long Covid have surpassed their annual leave allocations and are now on to unpaid leave because they have taken all the sick leave they can.  They are in a little bit of a quandary and that number will only increase where people are unable to work or do very much, as was the case for many of us.  It is something that must be highlighted or addressed at some level because many people are just left floundering without income.  They are stuck.</p></speech>

I know many doctors working in conjunction with colleagues in other countries.  That is great.  The health service in the UK is doing research on dry macular degeneration, so there may be a light at the end of the tunnel, if you pardon the pun, when it comes to my vision.  Again, we do not know, although we live in hope of a breakthrough.  Having Michael J. Fox there leads to matters being highlighted.</p><p>We have heard that Lady Gaga's auntie has lupus, that George Bush's dog had lupus and stories like that.  We grasp on to the highlighting of conditions by such stories or if somebody mentions his or her condition in a television interview.  It makes people feel a little better if someone, nationally or internationally, mentions their condition, which highlights it a little more for people and makes them feel they are not alone.  It is a matter of bringing everything together along with the research.  I have always said to my doctors that if I can do anything to help by being the subject of medical research for them, I would do that.  I would not mind.  I want to help make this issue and everything better for people.</p></speech>

In order to provide for the smooth running of the meeting, I draw the committee's attention to a couple of housekeeping points.  If any member is acting in substitution for a member of the committee, he or she should notify the clerk to the committee now if he or she has not already done so.  Divisions will be taken as they arise and members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that pursuant to the Standing Order, he or she may move his or her amendment and request a division, but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.  That is in relation to those who are deputising.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p></speech>

Amendment 158 introduces section 653AM to deal with situations where nobody has come forward as the owner of a site that is within the scope of this tax.  This measure provides that where the owner of such a site does not register with Revenue the site may become the property of the State.  If an owner has registered with Revenue, Revenue will use its normal collection mechanisms to collect the tax and interest due.  This provision only applies where no owner has been identified.  It will only apply where the tax and interest owing and charged on the land exceeds 110% of the market value of the site.  Once the amount of unpaid tax and interest exceeds 110% of the market value, the first step is that Revenue will place a notice in<i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>setting out that this process is commencing.  After six months, if nobody has come forward and registered as the owner of the land, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can make an application to the High Court to have the site concerned made property of the State.  The High Court can then make such directions as it thinks are appropriate in relation to publication or otherwise before making the order sought.  While it is envisaged that the Revenue Commissioners will rely on this measure only in limited circumstances, its inclusion is an important tool in targeting non-compliance in circumstances where the tax due on a site within the scope of residential zoned land tax is not paid and the landowner is not forthcoming in meeting its obligations. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 131 and 133 place two additional requirements on owners of a site where they are making a submission to the local authority on either a draft map or a supplemental map.  These two additional requirements are, first, that the owner's submission includes a map from Ordinance Survey Ireland that clearly identifies the site and, second, the owner may be asked to provide evidence of ownership to the local authority.  Both of these additional requirements are necessary to ensure that the appeals procedure, where a landowner can appeal a decision of the local authority, can operate as intended. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 160 and 161 seek to provide for reports in regard to the RZLT.  On amendment No. 160, the Deputies may note that in setting the initial rate for this tax great care needs to be taken to get the balance right between it achieving its essential purpose of encouraging the release of land for home building purposes, but at the same time not being too penal that it runs the risk of being challenged in the courts.  If I were to apply a rate of 25% from the outset, it would change significantly the economics of making a return on capital invested in the land as a business asset and this could make the business model unviable, which would be counterproductive and damaging to the goal of meeting our house building objectives over the next number of years.  It is important to see how the tax operates and to then make an assessment as to whether it is working.  If it is not leading to an increase in land being released for housing purposes, I will have no hesitation in reviewing the rate, if I deem it likely that this will help the situation.  In summary, I believe the 3% rate is an appropriate rate to apply when this tax comes into force in two years' time, as I am of the view it will encourage landowners to either develop their land or sell it to others for development purposes.  In doing this, the supply of land available will increase.  This should be reflected in a stabilisation of land prices.  It is for this purpose, I cannot agree to the amendment seeking this report.</p><p>On amendment No. 161 and the Deputies' wish that I produce a report estimating the likely financial impact of the exclusions, exemptions, deferrals and abatements from the residential zoned land tax contained in this section with a view to removing any or all of them before the tax comes into effect my views are as follows.  In order for this tax to be effective it is necessary that there be exclusions, including, among other things, residential dwellings and their gardens, certain infrastructure or facilities including utilities, transport, and facilitates for social, community or recreational purposes, business premises in areas zoned for mixed use purposes.  Without these exclusions, we would be taxing land on which there was no possibility of any housing development taking place.  This would make no sense.</p><p>In regard to the issue of deferrals, the Deputies should note that these arise only in very specific circumstances such as, first, where a judicial review has been sought by a third party against the decision of a local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to a planning decision.  In my view a deferral is fair in such a situation as the matter is out of the control of the developer.  The second circumstance is in a situation where a person has commenced development of a site.  Since the purpose of the tax is to encourage developers to build on this land, it seems appropriate in my view to suspend the payment of the tax, which continues to accrue, for the duration of the construction period.  Should they meet their delivery commitments, then the tax will not be payable, but failure to do so will result in a proportional payment of the suspended tax for the part not completed.  This approach is aligned with the philosophy behind this tax of encouraging the construction of houses rather than as a revenue raising measure.  For that reason, I cannot agree to this amendment. </p></speech>

Some of it is quite straightforward and other parts are a bit more complex.  We will have another opportunity to look at it on Report Stage with the Minister's amendments and others.  I know we are restricted to three interventions or something like that, but I ask the Vice Chairman to allow a bit of back and forth to deal with this point.  I do not imagine it will take very long.</p> <p>  My first question is on the rate.  I heard what the Minister said about keeping the rate under review if it was required.  We know the problems with the vacant site levy and we argued with the Government that it should come under the fold of the Revenue.  Notwithstanding that, my question is as follows.  Under the vacant site levy at 7%, the owner of a piece of land that is currently valued at &euro;1 million is currently required to pay &euro;70,000 annually.  Under the provisions of this section of the Bill, that will no longer be the case.  How much will the owner now pay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00400"><p>If it is worth &euro;1 million, the owner will be paying &euro;30,000.</p></speech>

That is the concern.  The vacant site levy was raised from 3% to 7%.  There are many more issues with the vacant site levy regarding collection, implementation, local authorities and all that.  The rate was also raised because at 3% on a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, the &euro;30,000 that was being charged was not working and so it was increased to &euro;70,000.  Given the lead-in time for this tax, surely it should be considered at a higher rate.  My view is that it is not penal to have it at a 7% rate because others, including some in Government parties, have called for the vacant site levy to be significantly increased.  There is a very long lead-in period meaning that people who have vacant sites will know that this is coming down the line within a number of years, giving them the opportunity to act.</p> <p>  With that in mind, why does the Minister believe reducing the tax required to be paid on those sites will encourage the owners to develop them, given that they will be paying less than half of what they are currently paying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00600"><p>It is because of the difference in scale of the tax.  I will give the Deputy a sense of how broad we believe this tax will be in comparison with the current vacant site levy.  Currently, the vacant site levy is applied to 501 ha across the country.  My recollection is that it applies to several hundred properties.  Our estimate is that the zoned land tax will cover approximately 8,000 ha to 9,000 ha.  Therefore, it will be 16 to 18 times bigger than the current tax.  Whereas the current vacant site levy is one with which very few landowners interface, the residential zoned land tax will become a core part of how land is taxed if homes are not being built on it.  The reason is difference of scale.</p></speech>

I expect that several landowners will be surprised that they will be paying it.  Given that and given the fundamental difference in scale, I believe 3% is the appropriate starting point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00900"><p>I can understand some of the Minister's logic.  As the net is far bigger, with a lower rate we might be able to move some of these sites on.  However, it does not take away from the fact that by 2024, when this kicks in, the tax liability for sites where the owners currently pay the vacant site levy will reduce by more than half.  That is problematic because at that point, rather than being an incentive, it will be a bit of a disincentive compared with the trajectory it had been on.</p></speech>

First, as he knows because he has called this out, is the major challenge in collecting that tax in the first place.  He knows that because it is implemented via local authorities and it is not collected on the scale and with the speed we would want.  This tax will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  The other part of the argument is that this will go from a tax that a few people pay to one that many landowners will pay, and a difference in scale.  Returning to the example the Deputy gave of a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, there would be many pieces of land like that across the country.  The tax is being paid at 3% per year and will be collected every year.  That means by year three of the tax, 9% of the value of that land will be paid in tax.</p></speech>

What data has the Department collected on land value inflation over the last period?  What projections does it have over the next five to six years?  This means nothing if land values are increasing by more than 3%.  There is no incentive to do anything because people can just sit and ride it out if land values are increasing every year.</p></speech>

The landowner will be able to maintain 97% of the portion of the land value increase each year.  If the land value increases by more than 3%, there is a benefit for the landowner to do what is happening across the State, which is hoarding.  That is the problem here.  What is the rate of land value inflation in recent years and what are the Department's projections for it?  That is fundamental to this tax.</p></speech>

That is where I differ from the Deputy.  While I accept his point entirely that the disposal price of the land will increase, I believe the cash-flow impact of having to pay 3% on land that is increasing in value will be more significant than does the Deputy.  He is correct that the capital value of the land will go up, but the cash-flow effect of having to pay 3% on land that is going up in value will be considerable over time.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give a working example, from the Department, of land value inflation running at 5% to 10% on a percentage basis and what that will mean for the tax?  That would be helpful for the debate.</p> <p>  Again, my contention is that the middle of a housing emergency is not the time to introduce a tax, which will not come in until 2024 at the earliest or 2025 for other sites, at the lowest level.  This should have been done a long time ago.  The vacant site levy has not worked to the desired effect.  I will ask some other questions on this matter.  Why will the levy not be in place until January 2024 at the earliest? </p></speech>

What that means, specifically, is it will take until sometime next year to put together the land maps that will show land that is subject to this tax, in other words, land that has zoning enabling homes to be built on it that are not being built, land that is either serviceable or serviced and that is not contaminated.  We believe it would take a good part of the first half of next year for the local authorities to do that.  I have been advised there needs to be an appeals process put in place after that to allow the status of that land to be queried and possibly challenged.  That then requires a supplementary map to be produced, which will go into the following year, with the tax then being levied in May of the year after that.</p></speech>

The toing and froing in respect of the local authorities takes up a large section of the legislation.

If landowners do not develop, and if there is residential land in our towns and cities that is undeveloped, then they should pay 10% over three years.  They should probably be paying 10% in the first year.  We are in the middle of an emergency.  This is not the time to be thinking about the poor craturs who are hoarding land in the middle of our towns and cities.  This is a time to say, "Use it or we penalise you because you have had enough time."  We have been in the middle of a housing emergency for a while.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will respond to that but let me put my other questions in the interests of time.  They are just technical questions.  Chapter 2 concerns zoned serviced residential land and applies to land "solely or primarily for residential use, or "for a mixture of uses, including residential use".  We will have a situation where active farm land, which has a mixed-use purpose, will also be zoned for residential use because part of the farm is close to the town centre.  How does that work?  Is it the case that farmers will have to apply for it to be dezoned and so on?  Has there been consideration of the implications of how that will impact on agriculture?  If farmers are going to go and get land dezoned to solely agricultural land, is there is a process in place for them?  Are there any knock-on impacts on farmers being able to raise loans and so on and so forth in terms of land that will be devalued, even though they are using it for farming?</p> <p>  What happens to land subject to this tax, that is in scope and part of the final map, which is sold during the process, since the tax kicks in after a period?  How will the reasonable test outlined under the proposed section 653B(b), which is that the land is serviced or has access to services, operate?  My final question on this chapter is about Revenue's ability to engage.  I do not have the section in front of me but I am sure the Minister's officials will know it.  Revenue has the ability to point out to a local authority a site that was not included in earlier maps.  The local authority then has to make that provision in its final map.  That is fine if it is the middle of this process, which is that the local authority draws up a draft map, it goes to consultation and landowners are able to write in and make submissions or whatever.  For the subsequent map, Revenue, in the middle of that process, can point out a site that was omitted and, therefore, the local authority has to include it in the final map.  What if that omission is identified after the final map is published?  If I am correct, local authorities have to publish their new maps every five years.  Can those be captured within the five-year period?</p></speech>

In the case of the agricultural use of land zoned for residential purposes, the options will be to pay the tax, build homes on the land or change its zoning status.  One of the key reasons we need a run-in period for this is that a dezoning or rezoning process will be put in place by local authorities to allow, for example, a farmer actively farming land zoned for residential use to apply to change the zoning status of that land.  It will then be open to the local authority as to whether to grant that decision.</p></speech>

Are all these decisions under this legislation taken by members of the local authorities or by their executives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#C01900"><p>It is members of local authorities.  This is one of the things that needs to be fully confirmed as to how it will work because the zoning process for land at present, as the Deputy well knows, takes some time to do.  We will need to have a faster process for managing zoning appeals.  To be very explicit about that point, because it was an important reminder from my colleague, a landowner will have the right to appeal the zoning status of the land.</p><p>It would then be open to the local authority to make a final view on that.  I anticipate this will be a pretty active area over the next 12 to 18 months, which is another reason a run-in period is needed.</p><p> On the Deputy's question on what would happen if the land is sold, whoever owns that land would pay the tax each May.  To use the Deputy's example, if the land is sold, the new owner would pay the tax the following May.  It is an annual recurring charge.</p><p> Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on how we will deem if it is reasonable for land to be serviceable, that will depend on the local authority's evaluation of it taking account of the proximity of the land to infrastructure or how likely it is to be serviced in the near future.  That is the reason these maps will be fundamental.  We will rely on the local authority evaluation of that, in turn, for the Revenue Commissioners to levy the tax.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about a scenario where land is omitted on a map but the Revenue Commissioners deem it should be subject to the tax.  The maps would be reviewed each year once the tax becomes operational after the run-in period and then at each point in the year, the Revenue Commissioners would have the ability to recommend or note land that should be covered by the tax.</p></speech>

Will the Minister talk me through a working example of this?  I am not referring to the process of doing the maps, as that is clear in the legislation.  To take the example of my county of Donegal, there are well established towns but also small villages, which would have local area maps.  Will all the sites in all those villages be captured?  What is the definition of this?  For example, would it be if there are footpaths, lights and infrastructure in those villages and all the undeveloped land in them?  How would that marry with housing need in the area?</p></speech>

In theory, if the land has a zoning status that means housing should be being built on it and it would be subject to the tax.  We do not have a minimum threshold of an area of land to which the tax should not apply.  If there is any area in any village, to which the Deputy has referred, which meets the criteria of being zoned for residential use, serviced or serviceable, and uncontaminated, there will be a liability to pay tax on it.</p></speech>

I am thinking of villages in rural Ireland and within the control points, they are zoned for mixed use or residential purposes.  There would not be a density of development in those villages.  What would be exempt then would the curtilage of one's home.  The Minister said he would not be taxing where a house could not be built.  However, any other fields in those villages would come under the application of the tax.</p></speech>

Theoretically, if every single vacant site in a village were to be developed, there would not be the service capacity required for sewerage services or possibly water services, but there would be the capacity to develop further.  This is new legislation and it is important to have that mapped out.  The Minister mentioned the Department has done an assessment of the amount of land that would be captured.  It would be helpful if that was provided to us.  Do he have regional or county breakdowns of that?  The county development plan has a list of all the towns.  It is important landowners would know that X village would be subject to this measure.  As we are having this discussion, there is an impression this measure will impact on Dublin, Cork and the higher density areas but it goes way further than that.</p></speech>

The Deputy began his questioning by asking why can we not do this more quickly.  The reason we must have a run-in period, which the Deputy considers is too long, is to give these kinds of indications to landowners.  This will be a very broadly applicable tax and, in particular, time will be needed for the appeals process.  The reason we need a run-in period is the point the Deputy has just identified.  The scope and applicability of this land will be much broader than many people are currently aware of and to deal with the consequences of that, we will need time for an appeals process and a supplementary map.  That is why the run-in period is the length of time I am recommending.</p></speech>

The reality is that if a town is zoned for housing, it would be rare if a piece of land in the centre of that town would be unzoned.  Further questions arise on this issue.  We must examine the issue of housing needs.  The same tax will be applied to a person in a village in a rural community where there is a housing need as will be applied to those in certain areas where there is a major housing need.  We know there is a housing need everywhere.  That is reason this type of tax on developed land needs to be introduced.  The fact that it will be applied to land in a village at the same level as to a vacant site in the centre of Dublin could be problematic.</p></speech>

A key learning from the local property tax is that if we are to enforce a measure nationally, that it is important it would have a clear rate with few exemptions, and that is what we are doing here.  If we were to adopt a model of having a different tax for different parts of the country, that would undermine its effectiveness, pose a major challenge in implementing it and would give rise to a phenomenal number of anomalies that over time could run the risk of undermining the tax.</p> <p>  The Deputy's concluding questions are the reason we need the run-in period, of which he was earlier critical.  We need to allow for an adequate appeals procedure for landowners who may not be satisfied to be subject to this tax.  We need to allow them the time to act and to allow local authorities the time to deal with appeals submitted to them.</p></speech>

One of the exemptions noted in the explanatory memorandum is "...land which is zoned for residential use but is used to provide services consistent with a residential area, e.g. a corner shop".  If the Minister knows Galway city, I am sure he will be aware that we are plagued with vacant sites and have been for a long time.  Thankfully, we are now seeing movement on one of the biggest of those sites and that is good news.  Will that particular exemption only apply to a fixed premises?  There are mobile coffee vans popping up everywhere at the moment.  I ask the Minister for some detail on that.</p></speech>

For example, it would have to have a licence.  To bring to life the Deputy's point, let us say that we have a piece of land that is zoned for residential use, and in that piece of land there is a small section that Revenue deems is being used in such a way that it is important to the operation of commercial life within that community.  That small piece of land could then be exempt from the residential zone and the zoned land tax, ZLT, but if the local authority and the Revenue Commissioners deem that the rest of that land is not fundamental to that commercial use, that land will be subject to the tax.</p></speech>

In sporting clubs all over the country, the land is either zoned for recreational use or, in some cases, for residential use but might have a lease, which allows it to be used by GAA clubs, sports clubs or whatever.  In those circumstances, land used in that way will be exempt from this tax.</p></speech>

There were deferrals and so on for people on low incomes.  The Government wants to target land hoarders with this tax but given the broad nature of it and the fact that every village and town will be included, it may apply to people with very low incomes who might have a site that was left to them.  There is no doubt that they could dispose of that site but the tax might be liable before they could dispose of it, if it was left to them in a will, for example.  Is there any deferral option in such cases or how would they enter it with Revenue?  Do they just have to pay the tax-----</p></speech>

We are looking for a report on the vacant property tax.  The Government's Housing for All plan kicks the can down the road for another year on vacant property tax.  At the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in September, Department of Finance officials cited analysis by GeoDirectory which showed that in quarter 2 of 2021, there was 92,000 vacant properties.  Some 4.5% of homes lay vacant in June of this year.  Research shows we have the tenth highest vacancy rate in the world, which is a national scandal.  Dereliction and allowing properties to lie empty is an act of vandalism against the public good.  It can be seen in this city where apartments lie empty and in other areas where there is significant pressure in terms of housing need.</p> <p>  We were calling for a vacant property tax in 2016, as another lever that could be introduced to end the scourge of dereliction.  It has not been brought forward by the Government.  In 2017, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, argued for it in the context of that year's budget.  That was four years ago.  The Housing for All plan was published in September 2021, without any firm commitment to introducing a vacant property tax to penalise those who would allow residential properties to remain idle and unused.  It has committed to a data collection exercise.</p> <p>  The Minister and the committee will be familiar with my raising the issue of the need for a local property tax on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in 2018.  In response, the Minister cited the Indecon report from September 2018 arguing against its introduction.  Can the Minister now confirm he rejects the conclusions of that report?  Can he now confirm he does support the introduction of a vacant property tax?  Can he explain to the committee why he has not decided to introduce a vacant property tax in each of the past five years in which we have been calling for him to commit to one?  I ask the Minister to expedite the introduction of the vacant property tax without delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.553" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#F03700"><p>Amendments Nos. 162 and 164 would require the Minister for Finance to lay a report before the D&aacute;il on the introduction of a vacant residential property tax.  Amendment No. 162 would require that such a report be laid before the Houses within one month of the enactment of the Finance Bill, while Deputy Doherty seeks a report within six months of the passing of the Bill.</p> <p>  I have stated that the primary objective of any vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand.  However, before introducing such a tax, it is vital to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties and the reasons they are vacant. This is the reason the housing for all strategy includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.</p> <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 has accordingly enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the local property tax, LPT, return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-25.  The extended deadline for submission of returns was Wednesday 10 November.  The information on vacancy in the LPT returns, in respect of approximately 2 million properties, is currently being analysed by Revenue and together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and inform the design of a vacant property tax.</p> <p>  It is important to identify the reasons for vacancy and whether this is long or short term in nature.  There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.  Appropriate exemptions from any charge would have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.</p> <p>  I want to make it clear that it is my intention to introduce a vacant property tax.  However, the matter needs further consideration and the information Revenue will be collecting will be an input into what we will do, because we will need to come up with a tax which plays a role in encouraging and changing the use of vacant properties.  Once the information from the returns has been collated and drawing on other available information, we will be in a better position to design a vacant property tax and assess its merits and precise design.  As part of Housing for All, I will be treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves and will be looking at the introduction of a vacant residential property tax as early as possible.</p></speech>

That is a cop out.  The Minister does not have the data now, but he is saying he will bring in a vacant property tax.

I am not putting my own figures out.  I am saying that many of those properties are in areas of high need; I am not saying all of them are or that all of them can be used.  The reality is that of those 92,000 vacant properties, many of them are in areas of high need and they could be brought into occupancy.</p></speech>

Those figures would indicate that there is a low level of vacancy but behind every percentage point or fraction thereof is a vacant property that has the potential to be turned into a home.  As part of Housing for All I accept that a vacant property tax will be able to play a role.</p></speech>

There is data collection ongoing.  Revenue could have been asked at any point in time to collect that data and a revaluation of the local property tax was not needed to do that.  The Minister has not provided a commitment of when he will introduce this.  The housing crisis has gotten out of control and the Minister has been forced to do a U-turn on a position which he defended against, despite Sinn F&eacute;in calling for it for since 2016.  On that basis I will push this amendment to a vote.</p></speech>

I want to thank Deputies for the time and effort that has been expended over the last three days to scrutinise this Bill.  I thank the officials of the committee and my officials for supporting us in our efforts.  I want to acknowledge one official in particular, Rory O'Kelly.  Rory is the engine of getting the Finance Bill arranged, implemented and done every year.  He is the member of our team who is frequently seen with multiple binders and a large case that contains all of those binders.  Rory has supported many Ministers in passing over 20 Finance Bills and he is getting ready to move on to new pastures.  Before he does that I want to thank him for his tireless service and huge work at busy moments in the legislative year.  I thank Rory for all his effort in supporting many Ministers and this committee in its work since 2006.  I wish him good health and every success in the next phase of his life.  I wanted to recognise that.</p></speech>

They have always been cordial to us as an Opposition party over the years.  I want to add to what the Minister has said about Rory.  Twenty years is a long time and there have been a lot of ups and downs and twists and turns in Finance Bills during those years.  I want to be associated with the Minister's words and to wish Rory well for the future, whatever that may bring to him.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned a number of the amendments that will be brought forward on Report Stage, including the amendment on agriculture.  It would be helpful if a note were to be provided to us on that beforehand.  The decision taken by the committee not to introduce a guillotine or time motion was the right call.  We worked and co-operated well within the timeframe and I appreciate that.</p></speech>

Oireachtas members attending the meeting remotely should do so from within the Leinster House campus.  Remote participation from outside the campus is not possible by ruling of the House.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene.  Every second seat has been removed to facilitate social distancing and I ask people not to move chairs from their current positions.  An appropriate level of social distancing should always be maintained, during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for members' co-operation in that regard. </p> <p>  Regarding the rotation of speakers during the meeting, I suggest a continuation of the usual system of 15-minute slots, if that is agreeable.  Members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party will be followed by those of Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Representatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and the Alliance Party will be the next to participate, and they will be followed by Independents and members of Aont&uacute;.  They will be followed by members of Sinn F&eacute;in, again, the Labour Party and the Green Party.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Our engagement today is with Mr. Tim Dalton, commissioner, Mrs. Rosalie Flanagan, commissioner, and Mr. Geoff Knupfer, lead forensic scientist and investigator from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains, ICLVR.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome them to today's meeting.</p><p> I will now read the notice regarding privilege, which is universal to all our meetings.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given and should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should neither criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech which might be regarded as damaging to the person's or entity's good name.</p><p> Before I call our first witness, I would like to express on behalf of our Oireachtas committee our deepest condolences to the Currie family and to our committee colleague, Senator Emer Currie, on the sad passing of her father, Austin Currie, who was a member of Governments both North and South during his political life.  I propose that the committee writes to the Currie family.  As Chairman, I will write that letter on behalf of the committee to express our condolences if that is agreed.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of serving here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with the late Austin Currie, who was always a gentleman and a great advocate, and had a very long and noble political career.  I join with the Chairman and every other member of the committee in extending our sincere sympathies to his widow and to all the family, particularly our colleague, Emer.</p></speech>

I will now call our witnesses in the order they have indicated to the clerk that they will speak.  Mr. Dalton will be followed by Mrs. Flanagan and then Mr. Knupfer.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Dalton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting us to appear before this committee.  We very much appreciate the interest which the committee has shown in our work.  My name is Tim Dalton and I was appointed by the two Governments in 2018 as an ICLVR commissioner.  I am accompanied at the meeting by Commissioner Rosalie Flanagan, who was appointed earlier this year, also by the two Governments.  We are joined also by Mr. Geoff Knupfer, the commission's lead forensic scientist and investigator, who was a member of the ICLVR team that met this committee in January 2018.  Mr. Knupfer has, as the need arises, worked with the commission since 2005.  During this time, he has played a central role in all of the commission's work and we are grateful to him for his ready availability and for the skill and expertise he has always brought to the task.  With the Chairman's agreement, both Commissioner Flanagan and Mr. Knupfer will address the committee shortly.</p> <p>  At the outset, I would like to acknowledge the enormous contribution made to the work of the ICLVR by my predecessor, the late Frank Murray, who most members probably knew, and also by Ms Flanagan's predecessor, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, who has retired as commissioner.  Both men were members of the delegation which met this committee in 2018.</p> <p>  As members will know, the commission is one of the reconciliation outcomes of the Good Friday Agreement, which provided that it was essential to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence as a necessary element of reconciliation.  The commission was established on the basis of an intergovernmental agreement between the Irish and British Governments signed in April 1999.  That agreement was then implemented by means of legislation enacted in both jurisdictions.</p> <p>  One of the key features of our situation legally is that we are an independent and non-political body.  Our task, in a nutshell, is to locate and return to their families the remains of individuals killed and secretly buried by the IRA in the course of the Northern Troubles.  That is broadly between the early 1970s and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  Our job, as I have mentioned, is simply to search for, hopefully recover and return remains.  It is not our role to comment on other aspects of policy or practice relating to the Troubles.</p> <p>  Another key feature of our governing legislation is that it legally guarantees that any information given to us or to our agents in the course of our work must be treated as absolutely confidential and can be used only for the purpose of locating remains.  This is underpinned by provisions rendering information we receive inadmissible in evidence in criminal proceedings and by placing restrictions on the disclosing of information and further restrictions on the forensic testing of human and other remains that may be found.  It is important that persons who might have relevant information but might be reluctant to share it with us should know that this confidentiality rule is there and that it is strictly observed at all times since we were established.</p> <p>  Finally, we are happy to report the continuing support and co-operation of both Governments and of the police services on both sides, the contribution of the Department of Justice and Northern Ireland Office, NIO, personnel, the contribution of various experts and contractors we have engaged as needed over the years and the co-operation of people within the republican community who have guided us towards relevant information sources.  Mr. Knupfer will speak about the cases that have been successfully concluded and those that yet remain to be finalised.</p> <p>  The story of the disappeared is one of the most tragic of the Troubles and we are honoured to have the opportunity of attempting to ease the pain it brought by recovering remains and returning them to their families.  Once again, we are appealing for information that might help us complete our task, however insignificant that information may appear to be, and our earnest request is that this distinguished committee would lend its support to that appeal.  I will now ask Commissioner Flanagan to address the committee.</p></speech>

The global pandemic has had a major impact on many aspects of all our lives for almost two years now, including the need to be cautious about travelling and meeting others.  While I would very much have welcomed the opportunity to appear before the committee in person today, and it is disappointing to be unable to do so, I am most grateful that I can attend virtually instead and look forward to our discussion.</p><p>I am also grateful to my fellow commissioner, Tim Dalton, for setting out the role and purpose of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains and the ongoing efforts to complete our work.</p><p> As Mr. Dalton has said, I was appointed as the UK commissioner in January this year.  I was honoured to accept this appointment to such an important body and I hope to have the opportunity to contribute to the successful location of some or all of the victims who have not yet been found and to giving their families the chance to give them the funerals and burials they have so long desired.</p><p> While we have not yet been able to meet face to face, I have had a number of virtual meetings with colleagues since my appointment.  It goes without saying, however, that the work of the investigators has been greatly affected and progress hampered by the Covid-19 restrictions.  We are very conscious that the three people whose remains have not yet been located disappeared in the 1970s and those who may have information which can be of assistance to us are now likely to be in their 70s or older.  I hope sincerely that as we emerge from this period, we will see new information coming forward before it is too late.</p><p> As the committee knows, an important aspect of the work of the commission over the years has been meeting and supporting the family members of the disappeared, both those whose remains have been recovered and those for whom the search continues.  Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible for us to attend any events with the families this year.  It is something I hope we can do perhaps in 2022.</p><p> Members of the committee may be aware of the WAVE Trauma Centre which provides support and care to anyone bereaved, injured or traumatised through the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  WAVE provides particular care to the families of the disappeared.  I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the tremendous support that the WAVE organisation, and its CEO, Ms Sandra Peake in particular, have provided to the families over the years and continue to provide during the challenging circumstances of the pandemic.</p><p> In conclusion, I would reiterate the vital importance to us of new information and urge the members of this committee to take any steps they can to assist us in obtaining it.  I am pleased to hand over now to Mr. Geoff Knupfer, the head of our investigation team, to provide some further details about what has happened since the commissioners last appeared before this committee and to respond to any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

I understand that Mr. Knupfer will be with us momentarily, as he is rebooting his computer.  If he has not managed to do this yet we will commence our rotation of speakers, if that is in order, and we will bring Mr Knupfer in then when he is available, when the current contributor has finished.</p> <p>  I welcome the clarity which the presence of our witnesses is bringing to us here today.  In the first instance, in that any information given to our witnesses will be kept completely in secret and cannot and never has been used in any court of law, or for any other purpose whatsoever, other than in finding the remains of the victims.   I can understand, having met Mr. Oliver McVeigh recently in Belfast, along with our colleagues on the committee, how traumatic even after almost 40 years is that need for closure and demand for outcomes, as somebody out there must and does know what happened to those three men.  It is very sad and tragic.  The key point is that the conflict is over and there is no reason why anybody should fear giving information to the commission through the appropriate channels.  I believe Mr. Knupfer is present now and I will invite his submission in a moment.  The clarity that the commission is bringing to its search is very important.  As people are ageing, this does not mean that there are not people who can still come forward where they are under no legal pressure, or there can be no negative outcome by way of prosecution, in respect of any information that they may give.  There is also complete secrecy attached to such information.  It behoves all of the political parties and none represented here today that we call on everybody who is aware of anybody who may have any information, no matter how small that information may seem to them, in respect of how important that may be to help bring closure to families who do not have the opportunity to give their loved ones a Christian burial.  I invite Mr. Knupfer now to make his contribution, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.595" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff Knupfer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#C00300"><p>I thank Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, very much for the invitation to address today&rsquo;s meeting.  As the committee may be aware, the commission currently has 16 cases on its list of disappeared.  To date, 13 victims have been recovered, 11 by the commission, leaving only three cases outstanding at this moment in time.  They are: Joe Lynskey who disappeared in the summer of 1972; Columba McVeigh, who disappeared on or about 1 November 1975 and whose remains are believed to have been buried in Bragan Bog, County Monaghan and Robert Nairac, who was abducted from the Three Steps Inn, Drumintee, on 14 May 1977 and later murdered in Ravensdale, County Louth.  It seems probable that his remains are buried in that general area.</p> <p>  As the committee have heard from Commissioner Flanagan, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic across these islands has severely hampered the operation of the commission team for the past 18 months or so.  The travel of investigators to undertake face-to-face interviews and to visit potential sites was curtailed completely.  In fact any activity which could not be conducted from home virtually ground to a halt.  Thank goodness, hotels are now beginning to reopen and travel restrictions have largely been lifted.  I am relieved to report that things on the operational side of the commission are gradually returning to some degree of normality.</p> <p>  Around the time we previously addressed the committee in 2018, we were in the process of making plans to commence a further search of Bragan Bog in County Monaghan to try to locate the remains of Columba McVeigh.  This operation commenced in September 2018 but was suspended during the winter due to poor weather, restricted daylight hours and dangerous ground and working conditions.  Work resumed in the summer of 2019 and concluded in September that year.  Sadly, the remains of Columba McVeigh were not located.</p> <p>  Since the establishment of the commission in 1999 some 21 acres or 8.5 ha of Bragan Bog have now been searched.  I should add that we are entirely satisfied that Columba was murdered and buried at Bragan and that we have not been intentionally misled in that respect.  Unfortunately, his current whereabouts remain something of a mystery.  It raises questions as to whether or not this is the correct location within the bog or whether for some reason or other his body could have been removed from that location.  It would only have to be moved to, say, the other side of a track, and thus outside the search area, to entirely compromise the search process.  As ever, we would be pleased to hear from anyone who has any information on this case, however trivial they consider it to be, it could be the vital link we are missing.</p> <p>  Inquiries and research into the other cases of Joe Lynskey and Robert Nairac continue.  At this point in time, however, we have no fresh substantive information on either case sufficient to warrant a physical search.  In fact the latter case, that of Robert Nairac, remains the only one for which we have never had sufficient information to merit a physical search.  Again, we would welcome any information from the public on either of these cases.</p> <p>  We are particularly conscious that time marches on relentlessly.  We know that some of those directly involved in these events have passed away in recent years.  Others, we believe, might well be reluctant to engage because their families, friends or neighbours are totally unaware of their involvement in these sad events some 40 or 50 years ago.  Despite this we would urge anyone with any relevant information, to please contact the commission directly as a matter of urgency or, if needs be, indirectly.</p> <p>  This is an entirely humanitarian process and we really do need help to return these lost souls to their loved ones for Christian burial.  I remind everyone that since the inception of the commission in 1999, no one has ever been interviewed as a suspect, arrested, charged or convicted as a result of information that was passed to it on the disappeared.  It is well known that such information can only be used to recover and repatriate victims.  The commission is expressly forbidden by law to pass information on to other individuals or organisations.</p> <p>  In 2019, an anonymous donor put up the sum of US $60,000 by way of a reward for information which results in the recovery of one or more of the victims.</p><p>That reward has not been claimed to date.  Anyone who wishes to claim the reward must contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or <i>www.crimestoppers-uk.org</i>.<br/><br/>We are aware that a recent television drama, &quot;Bloodlands&quot;, referred to the work of the commission.  It is important to clarify that this was an entirely fictional scenario.  It did not relate in any way to any real commission case and the so-called &quot;technology&quot; deployed to locate human remains in the programme does not actually exist.  The commission was not consulted prior to or during the writing of this script.  However, we were made aware of the programme prior to its broadcast.<br/><br/>The commission is jointly funded by the Irish and UK Governments.  In order to limit the commission's operational costs, the commission does not actually employ any full-time staff.  A joint secretariat is provided by the staff of the Northern Ireland Office and the Department of Justice and other members of the commission work on a contractual basis or daily-rate basis only.<br/><br/>We continue to work very closely with the WAVE Trauma Centre.  We are most grateful for the assistance they provide to the commission in its endeavours but, more importantly, for the truly remarkable level of care and support they provide to those victims of the Troubles who are on their books.  We are indebted, indeed, to the CEO of WAVE, Ms Sandra Peake, and her staff.</p></speech>

I commend them on the important work that they are carrying out on behalf of the State, and also Mrs. Rosalie Flanagan, as nominee of the British Government.</p><p>I proposed, in 2018, that the commission would be invited to address this committee's predecessor.  I also proposed, this time, when we were drafting our work programme for this year, that the commission would be invited back to give us an update on its work.  That was to give us in a parliamentary chamber the opportunity to endorse the important work and the difficult task that the commission has been assigned and that, hopefully, some coverage of our proceedings, be it in the print or broadcast media, might create that extra awareness that is needed, the coverage would get to the people who have information and who have not yet passed it on, and finally, their consciences might get to them and they would pass on that information.  The three guests have outlined clearly that if a person passes on information it cannot be used for any other purposes and the Cathaoirleach outlined that clearly as well.  People who provide information will not be prosecuted in relation to any of their misdeeds or any other misdemeanours, if they carried out some.</p><p>I have been familiar with the work of the victims' commission since 1998 because the late John Wilson, the former T&aacute;naiste whom I had a very close working relationship with over many years, was the first person appointed by the Irish Government.  I had the privilege of succeeding him as a Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan when he retired in 1992.  At that time, without knowing the detail of any particular cases, I knew how difficult that work was from talking to John Wilson about it on a general basis.  I note those who succeeded him.  Mr. Bloomfield carried out admirable work, as did Mr. Frank Murray.  It is important that we recognise the work of the people who served in the roles previously as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were very many reprehensible, vile and heinous crimes during the era known as the Troubles but I suppose the case of the 16 disappeared really is absolutely reprehensible.  All murders, maiming of people and injuries inflicted on people are reprehensible but to abduct, kill and secretly bury persons and not have them returned to their families is beyond comprehension.</p><p>The task of the commission is to return to families the remains of persons killed by paramilitaries.  The least that anybody deserves is a Christian burial.  We can never emphasise enough how important it is.</p><p>We met Oliver McVeigh last week, as the Cathaoirleach said, Columba's brother.  Mr. McVeigh appealed again to anybody with information or any organisation that they have, to put it mildly, a moral duty to pass on any relevant information and as a committee, we totally endorse that.</p><p>From speaking with families that the commission has worked with over years, I know they very much appreciate the commission's method in going about its business and the dignified, gracious and understanding manner in which it carries out that work.  The commission is to be commended in that respect.</p><p>My purpose in suggesting that the commission come before the committee was, as I stated at the outset, to endorse publicly the important work of the commission and also to emphasise that the commission tasks are not yet complete, unfortunately.  What we would like to see is, obviously, the other three bodies returned to their loved ones.</p><p>Two of my colleagues, Senators McGreehan and Blaney, hope to be with us later.  They are attending the Seanad, which the Taoiseach is addressing.</p><p>As I stated earlier, John Wilson was appointed by the Government in May 1998, a month following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  That demonstrated the importance that the Governments at that time attached to this work because it was a month after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  What he was tasked with at that time was to review services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of victims of Northern Ireland violence.  John Wilson was appointed.  Mr. Bloomfield was appointed by the British Government subsequently to carry out that important task on behalf of both Governments.</p><p>The first report of the victims' commission, A Place and a Name, was published in July 1999.  In one particular comment in regard to the disappeared, it states:</p> <blockquote> 	Anyone with the slightest shred of information on the possible location of bodies should make this known to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains. </blockquote> <p>It is sad that today, at the end of 2021, we are appealing still for information so that the remains of innocent people murdered and buried in secret, and some of them abducted, murdered and secretly buried, have not yet been returned to their loved ones.  That sentence is as relevant today, unfortunately, as it was when it was written in July 1999.</p></speech>

I want to ask the members of the commission about some of the details of their work, if they do not mind.  I do not mind which of the commissioners chooses to respond based on how they organise their work.</p> <p>  Taking it through, where we have been to date, over the course of the Troubles there were 16 people disappeared.  The Provisional IRA has admitted responsibility for 13 victims, mostly in a statement issued in 1999.  One victim was admitted to by the INLA.  No attribution has been given to the others.  To date, the remains of 13 of the disappeared have been recovered, 11 of whom have been recovered through the commission's efforts.</p> <p>  I refer to the three victims to be located yet.  I note in Mr. Geoff Knupfer's statement the commission has some information about the late Mr. McVeigh.  Could they talk us through exactly where the commission is on each of them and on the previous instances, of the other pieces of information that came?</p><p>If possible, will he outline the way in which that information came?  Was it in written form or did it come via different communication?  How can we best understand how that work has been achieved to date?</p></speech>

What is the mechanism?  I am seeking some understanding of how it works.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.606" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff Knupfer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#E00400"><p>Some information comes directly.  As Mr. Dalton explained, it is difficult to talk about these engagements but some information certainly comes directly to us.  Other contacts come through intermediaries.  It is always a problem where we do not have direct access to the person who is providing information.  If it comes through a third party, there is a dilemma in not being able to ask the important questions, from our perspective.  As an example, if we are examining a grave site, ideally we would like to speak to the people who dug that grave.  They will know what the ground profile is like, what they encountered on the day, where they stood and what they saw.  This is the sort of information we cannot get through third parties or, if we do, it will have been diluted in some way.</p> <p>  An issue we encountered in one case, without going into details, related to where discussions occurred prior to information being passed to the commission. This was decided, effectively, by committee, with a group of people sitting around a table and arriving at a conclusion regarding the detail they would provide to the commission.  Unfortunately, in such circumstances, you tend to get the views of the loudest voice rather than those of the best informed.  These are the sorts of problems we have encountered over the years, although on other occasions, the information has been excellent.</p> <p>  Another issue relates to the time gap between the events and the searching today.  Memories fail or fade and, as I mentioned earlier, many people have passed away in the intervening years.  In one case, again without going into details, people we could have talked to had died and they did so without having contacted the commission or passing on information via a third party.  We urge anyone with any information, however trivial they believe it to be, to please contact us directly.  If they are not prepared to do that or cannot do that, we urge them to come through a third party.  We look forward to hearing from them.</p> <p>  This is entirely an intelligence-led operation.  We are not plucking bits and pieces out of the sky but rather are waiting for people to contact us, and we will respond appropriately to any information received.</p></speech>

Over the course of the commission's work, has it received a large volume of information about a number of cases or has it been consistently spread out?  Has it come in dribs and drabs or something more organised?  I am not sure whether our guests can talk about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.608" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff Knupfer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#E00600"><p>There was a statement in the early days, in 1999, where I believe nine cases were reported.  That has grown over the years and a further two cases were added to the list at various times.  That initial information has been enhanced or improved as the years have gone by.  It is really difficult to talk about this sort of detail, both because we are not allowed to and because I do not want to implicate anyone.  Much of the work has gone on through intermediaries who, on a few occasions, have provided direct contact with primary sources, that is, people who were involved in these events.  Often, however, information is passed anonymously and we do not know who these people are.  That is the frustration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.609" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#E00700"><p>I appreciate the constraints with which the commission operates.  I am trying to ask questions within that, as our guests will understand.  Last week, we had the opportunity to meet Mr. Oliver McVeigh, as the Chairman mentioned.  He was clear about how desperately he and his family want to find his brother, a subject of significant work on the commission's part.  He urged us, as public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas, to remind everybody to do everything they could to be of assistance with that.  He asked us to call on everybody, including all the political parties, to be clear that information, if it exists, should be provided to the commission directly and without delay to enable the search to continue.  Having met Mr. McVeigh and having had the opportunity to listen to him and the pain he, his mother and his family experienced and that he continues to experience in the absence of his brother, without the opportunity to give him a Christian burial or to begin to mourn the stages of death in the way a person might having gone through a burial, members of the committee want to take that opportunity.   It is our good fortune our guests happen to be appearing before the committee this week, given we met Mr. McVeigh last week.  It is important for me to take the opportunity to highlight that.</p> <p>  In light of Mr. Dalton's experience in the Department of Justice and his work throughout the period leading up to the Good Friday Agreement period, he has been engaged in reconciliation efforts for many years.  Will he speak to how important the resolution and recovery of bodies is towards the overall reconciliation effort, having regard, perhaps, to the many families he will have met during his work in its various guises?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Dalton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#E00800"><p>It is very important.  In the period leading up to the Good Friday Agreement, I was part of the back-up Civil Service team.  Every element of the agreement is relevant and important.  Without the little pieces in the agreement, some of which were more difficult than others, such as the release of a large number of prisoners and the constitutional changes, there would have been no agreement.  The reconciliation aspect was a core aspect.  I am not saying that without it, there would have been no agreement but every element of the agreement was significant and the fact reconciliation was included demonstrated at that time the importance everyone attached to it.  Of course, the people of Ireland voted for that agreement, which contained the element of reconciliation.</p> <p>  Like others on the commission, I have met families who have lost people in the conflict.  Some were disappeared, while others were not and simply lost their lives in the conflict.  Outcomes that enable them to recall their loved ones with dignity are important, and outcomes that do not, such as those that prevent them from having a burial and closing the sad chapter, remain painful.  It is difficult to think of this in terms of happiness but we have seen happiness in the faces of people who, after a number of years, have managed to find the remains of their loved ones.  It brings enormous relief and happiness.  It is not happiness in the sense of recovering alive someone who was lost but it produces a great deal of relief in families.  In the three outstanding cases, there is still great sadness.  That is why we regard it as an honour to have the opportunity to bring happiness to those people at long last or some measure of relief from suffering.  We too have met Mr. Oliver McVeigh and we are very aware of the pain his family are suffering.</p></speech>

All loss is difficult but it is a different kind of loss not to know where one's loved one is, or to think of him or her as lost.</p></speech>

The pain continues, which is the difference.  It is not a one-off event but remains for years.</p><p>It is rather like other situations with which we all will be familiar, such as the Stardust fire and so on.  When there is no resolution and, as is sometimes the case, when no remains are found, it is painful and remains painful.  That is why it is so important and why we plead for more information.  We hope that with members' support and the support of a body such as this committee, we will get more information.</p></speech>

Mr. McVeigh was clear that he hopes that, if information could come to light over this winter period, it could lead to an opportunity for further good-weather digs in the spring and going into the summer.  These opportunities are running out, so I think it is fair to say we are trying to draw attention to the issue.</p></speech>

Some of it has been forested over the years, while other sections remain as dug-out peat bog.  It is a vast area and we could not search the entire bog.  It would be completely impossible.</p></speech>

He raised the question the commission may not have been given the correct location and stated it is something of a mystery.  Does he mean the body may have been removed?  I do not know whether he wants to comment on that.  The implication is that while he is satisfied the body is there, there is a mystery as to what may have happened to it.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

Several sources have either directly or indirectly pointed to a specific area of the bog and it is that area we have searched, some of it more than once.  We are satisfied his remains are not where we were told they were.  That opens other avenues to consider, such as whether it is the wrong place or whether, for some inexplicable reason, although we are not suggesting this is correct, his body could have been moved in some way.  People have said in the past that if a body is moved by 100 m, it might as well be 100 miles or 100 km, given that if it is not an area we are pinpointing to search, we will never find it.  If, for example, somebody was using that land for another purpose and came across remains by accident, could he or she have moved them a few yards, meaning we will never find them?  This is pure speculation on our part.  We do not know and we cannot explain why Columba McVeigh's body is not where people told it was.  We are satisfied it is not there and we are looking for alternatives.</p></speech>

I believe Mr. Knupfer is a specialist in forensic archaeology.  Has that technology been exhausted, even for the wider area of the bog, which I appreciate from his commentary is very large?  Is there anything more we could, in a technological way, to locate the remains?</p></speech>

It comprises several square miles or square kilometres of bog.  From an archaeological point of view, we can separate out survey and search, two quite different matters.  A survey could involve, for example, walking and line-searching the bog for anomalies, the use of cadaver-detection dogs, geophysics or, most commonly, ground-penetrating radar.  At one time or another, we have used all these approaches on Bragan Bog, but when it comes to the end of the line, there is only one way to be 100% certain, namely, by physically searching the ground.  We have done that, as we mentioned, over 21.5 acres, an enormous area to search.  The bog is open, and if any members wish to inspect it at any time, we will be more than happy to host them on it.  It is a vast area and we could not contemplate undertaking such an exercise on the entire bog.  It is just too big.</p></speech>

We will visit at the appropriate time and in the appropriate manner, which he might specify.</p> <p>  The light detection and ranging, LiDAR, survey, which is carried out by aeroplane, can detect the presence of metals and differentiate the terrain under the surface to a not-insignificant depth.  Could such a survey help?</p></speech>

All these applications are complementary but, unfortunately, none of them will reveal exactly where the body is.  Were that there was something.  We looked at "Bloodlands" and thought what a wonderful piece of technology that drama series had come up with but, of course, that was make-believe.  We use all these applications.  In the past, LiDAR was very expensive because it had to be fitted to an aeroplane and the area surveyed by manned aircraft.  Now, we can do it with unmanned vehicles and they are improving the approaches we can use.  Unfortunately, LiDAR, just like infrared and the various other survey tools, will not give us the simple answer.</p></speech>

If it were possible for us, working with the commission, to write to that agency to have that done, would that make sense, assuming it has not been done?  Notwithstanding what Mr. Knupfer said, if it might be helpful, it could be another opportunity, at this late stage, to try to recover the body of the deceased.</p></speech>

By all means, we would consider it, although I am not an archaeologist by profession and I would clearly need to run it past our archaeologists.  We have used unmanned technologies in recent years as they have become available to us, but if there is anything Ordnance Survey Ireland can provide that we cannot get elsewhere, we would be delighted to take it up on any offer of support.</p></speech>

It will be interesting to see whether the commission will find benefit from it.</p> <p>  This meeting represents, as has been the case on many other occasions, an opportunity for the committee to speak with one voice, and I expect that to continue through the presentations and the responses to the submissions from the commission.  I extend a warm welcome to the commission members and thank them for their presentations and answers thus far.  On the work they have undertaken and continue to carry out, they and all those who have assisted them throughout this State need to be commended.</p><p>The issue of those who were abducted, shot and secretly buried by the IRA is a terrible legacy of the decades of conflict that we have come through.  That is very clear.  Sadly, it is not the first time it has happened in our history.  As we know, there are still issues dating back to the Civil War and the Tan War.  This generation of republicans identifies the wrong that was done and is trying to undo that wrong.  We have heard some talk today about how information has been passed that has led to the recovery of most, but not all, of the missing.  As a result of those efforts, 13 of the 16 people killed and buried by republicans have been recovered.  For me, it will not be good enough until everyone is recovered.  There are three who have still not been recovered: Robert Nairac, Joe Lynskey and Columba McVeigh.  The failure thus far to find them is not due to any lack of resolve or co-operation by republicans.  It is important that we use the committee and the stage we have today to appeal unambiguously to anyone with information, no matter how insignificant he or she feels it is, to make it available, as my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, outlined in his opening remarks.  The information could be vital to the work of the commission.  I urge people to bring it forward on the basis of confidentiality, as has been outlined in some detail.</p><p> Mrs. Flanagan referred to the work of WAVE in her statement.  I echo the fact that the timing of today&rsquo;s meeting probably could not be any better given what was, in my view, a very successful trip to Belfast.  WAVE is headquartered in my constituency, North Belfast.  The very powerful testimonies we heard from the Ballymurphy and Springhill families, particularly those we met at WAVE last week, add to the resolve of every member of this committee to do all that can be done collectively and individually to urge people to come forward and end the pain of Oliver McVeigh, which we noted last week, and the pain other families are going through.</p><p> Again, I commend the work of the commission and look forward to hearing the rest of the presentations, submissions and answers.</p></speech>

As many members have said today, we were at WAVE last week.  It was extremely moving to meet everyone, particularly Mr. Oliver McVeigh.  I cannot even imagine what it must be like for family members not to know the location of someone they have lost.  My experience was extremely moving and very upsetting.  I do not have any questions for the delegates.  More than anything else, I would love it if people came forward with information.  Coming forward is definitely the right thing.  Any small bit of information could be vital in locating the three people who are still missing after all these years.  I encourage anyone who has even the tiniest bit of information to come forward.</p> <p>  I commend WAVE on the phenomenal work it is doing.  Ms Sandra Peake, its CEO, has amazing energy.  I can only imagine the daily trauma associated with working with the families and dealing with it all.  It is heartbreaking.</p> <p>  I thank the delegates for their presentations today and the work they are doing.  Please God, the families will get information on their loved ones and find them.</p></speech>

To echo the words of Senator Black, their work is important.  As the delegates said in their submission, the work is humanitarian in orientation and important to the families of the victims and in achieving truth, justice and reconciliation.  The commission is certainly one of the more successful initiatives in achieving some reconciliation and comfort for the families in the wake of the Troubles.  We should all be learning from that.</p> <p>  The Chairman was talking about LiDAR.  Are there things that we, as members of a committee, can do to support the commission?  Are the things the two Governments can do to support the commission and that we could help to advocate?  What is it that we can do to help the delegates to continue the good work?</p> <p>  I would like to take a moment to springboard from the good work the delegates are doing to consider the issue of truth and justice in general.  The Independent Commission on Information Retrieval was part of the Stormont House Agreement in 2014.  Its aim was not judicial prosecution but to establish the truth, achieve reconciliation and give families the information they wanted about their loved ones to help with the grieving process.  While there has been detailed agreement regarding the Independent Commission on Information and Retrieval, we have never seen any legislation or progress on it here.  An agreement would require legislation in Dublin and also Westminster.  Any time I have asked about it, I have been told there is ongoing contact with Westminster.  The Irish Government should not be waiting for the British Government but should be progressing this ourselves.  Nothing is stopping us from carrying out our own pre-legislative scrutiny to make progress and from putting moral pressure on the British Government to act.</p> <p>  It is important to highlight the effect the British Government's approach in the form of a unilateral amnesty has had on communities and family members of victims.  It has been very upsetting and has caused more problems.  Again, we need to work with victims' families so we can have proper healing, truth, reconciliation and, ultimately, justice.  The commission provides an excellent example of that in practice.  It is a shame that we have not been able to follow through in other areas.</p> <p>  I will leave my little speech there and return to my original questions: is there something we can do to help the delegates with their work, and is there something the two Governments can do to help the commission with its work that we can advocate as a committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.633" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Dalton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#G00700"><p>I will take that question.  Both Governments have always been very helpful to us in our work.  We have never had the experience of being refused when we wanted to do something or get some equipment, or anything like that.  We have had significant support on that front.  Nevertheless, the suggestion made by the Chairman on affording another technological opportunity is very welcome.  If we wanted to do something like that, there would certainly be no resistance from the Governments.</p><p>In fact, we would get support because they have been supportive all the way through.</p><p> Anther thing I will say, in case I do not think to say it later, is that Mr. Knupfer has emphasised the amount of work that has been undertaken in the case of Columba McVeigh and all the excavations and so on that have taken place.  Having said that, we would not want anybody to think that that is the end of the road insofar as we are concerned in the case of Columba McVeigh or anybody else.  If we get any new credible information about Bragan Bog or about Columba McVeigh or anybody else from this point onwards, anything we have not had before, we will act on it and treat it seriously.</p><p> We are getting back to the same point.  What we need is information.  That is our most urgent requirement, and that is one way in which the committee can be of most assistance to us - by making it clear that information is what is needed to end what is a tragedy for the families who still have no idea as to what happened to their loved ones.  Well, they know what happened but they have not had access to the remains of their loved ones.  That is the primary requirement.  It is very heartening to us to hear members of the committee speak about all this.  Obviously, the committee has a great understanding of the suffering that has been experienced by the people concerned.  That is heartening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.635" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#H00200"><p>I do now know if any of our Senators have arrived yet.  If it is helpful, we can go into a second round.  I just want to see if I can try to draw a few of the threads together.  We should take up the invitation, at the appropriate time and under the appropriate circumstances, that Mr. Knupfer made that we visit the site of Bragan Bog.  Perhaps there are other appropriate visits we could do.  For example, Robert Nairac was murdered in my county, and I do not see why we should not visit a known location where there may have been evidence, if that makes sense.</p> <p>  Perhaps we could also agree that we will write to the Department.  I think Ordnance Survey Ireland - I can confirm that later on - has the LiDAR aeroplane.  Perhaps we could see whether it would be able to do a survey, provided that it makes sense to Mr. Knupfer and his technical people.  If that makes sense, we should do that.</p> <p>  It may be appropriate that we table a motion in the D&aacute;il, having listened to the witnesses' evidence today.  The clerk will look at the process but I suggest that we propose that perhaps the leaders of the parties will make statements on the matter.  It might be helpful to get the Taoiseach, the leaders of Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and Independents in to articulate the true purpose of the commission's search to recover these bodies and to give closure to the families.  Would that be acceptable to people?  I do not know if anybody else wishes to address the meeting now.</p></speech>

That would elevate our work on the committee and the appeals of our guests and witnesses on the importance of this issue.</p> <p>  Mr. Knupfer referred to the television drama "Bloodlands".  I did not see that programme.  Has it damaged or affected in any way the provenance, the authenticity or the good work of the commission?  Has it sent out a mixed message in any way that could damage its work and the appeal for information?</p> <p>  The commission gets on with its work and so on.  Does it get advice or has it got assistance from, say, the Department of Justice or some of the Government agencies in having a worthwhile information programme nationally, maybe in Britain as well if that is needed, to outline the absolute urgency of this?  As has been said, everybody is getting older.  I am sure it gets more difficult as every day goes on.  The memories fade and locations will be more difficult to search.  The work therefore gets more difficult with each passing day.  Apart from families and communities that have taken a particular interest and have been affected by the Troubles and that awful era of murder and mayhem, I do not know if there is a wide enough appreciation that we still have three families whose loved ones' remains have not been returned to them and that the commission's work is ongoing and of the utmost importance to all of us.  Should consideration be given to a higher media profile regarding the importance of this work and the need to make further progress as soon as possible in view of the time lapse between the awful abduction and murder of these innocent people?</p> <p>  Is Bragan Bog and the area that has been searched preserved or fenced off at the moment, or can people go about their daily business?  I refer to whoever owns the bog and visitors to that area.  Is there protection of the site or is it preserved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff Knupfer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021111800002#H00400"><p>I hope my list of those questions is correct.  I ask the Deputy to pull me up if I miss anything.</p> <p>  No, we do not think "Bloodlands" has caused damage.  What concerned us enormously at the time was whether people believed we might be passing information to the programme makers, which we certainly were not.  I think there were one or two discussions just prior to broadcast about names attributed to members of the commission portrayed on screen, and the programme makers very kindly removed those names.  There have been a number of documentaries on radio and television, in Ireland and beyond, covering the work of the commission, and in I think every single one we have made appeals for information and tried to explain that we are not remotely interested in what people did, other than if it would help us fine-tune the search process.  We always make appeals for information on the basis that we do not want to speak to third parties.  We would rather speak to the primary sources because that gives the best information we could possibly ask for.  I think all three of us have said today and in the past that witnesses have nothing to fear from talking to us.  We are not sure why people have not come forward.  We cannot explain it.  We know that there are other people out there who were involved in these events and have not come forward.  To appeal to them to do so is really as far as we can go.  As I said, why they will not speak to us directly we are at a loss to understand.  I do not think anybody is putting pressure on them not to do so - not as far as we are aware, anyway.  A member of our organisation leads on our media very proficiently.  He has done it for a number of years and makes a great job of it, but you can only make so many appeals before the broadcast media switch off and the print media say, "We have done all that before."  They are looking for something new, not a rehash of what we have done in the past.  That is a big problem for us.</p> <p>  Lastly, the Deputy mentioned Bragan Bog and whether it is fenced off.  No, it is not.  It is open to anybody who wants to go there, but it is a very remote and wild area.  It has its own microclimate.  There can be blazing sunshine in Monaghan town while on Bragan Bog, just nine miles or ten miles or perhaps 12 km or 13 km away, it could be doing anything from snowing to cracking the flags.  It is a very strange area in that respect.  There is a lot of forestry up there and plantations that have been planted since the 1970s and some harvesting goes on from time to time.</p><p>We try as best we can to manage that with the forestry authorities and they have been enormously helpful to us over the years.</p><p> I hope I have answered all the Deputy's questions there.  If there is anything else, I will gladly answer it if I can.</p></speech>

We know that innocent people were murdered and secretly buried in parts of Ireland and then the location of their remains were hidden from the families for decades and that in excess of 40 years later, we are still asking for where the bodies of people on this island are buried in order that we can give some tiny comfort to their siblings before they, too, pass on.  We know what people did.</p> <p>  Something that struck me in our trip last week, and some colleagues as well, was we met more groups then.  We met Mr. McVeigh.  We met Rev. David Clements, whose father, who was in the RUC, was murdered.  We met Mr. Alan McBride whose family were murdered in the Shankill bomb attack.  We met families of the Ballymurphy massacre who suffered enormous intergenerational trauma and families of the Springhill massacre.  All of those people really stuck with me over the weekend, and I am sure with colleagues as well.  I was thinking about Ms Irene Connolly and the late Ms Joan Connolly in Ballymurphy over the weekend and, indeed, Ms Jacqueline Butler from Springhill.  As we said to them at the time, you remember their faces.  You remember what their voices sound like.  You remember, when you have that personal connection.</p> <p>  Something that struck me also when we visited the WAVE Trauma Centre - which Mr. Knupfer has reference and which really is excellent, and we must commend Ms Sandra Peake, yet again, on her work - in particular, with Mr. McVeigh, was how alone he was, in comparison, in trying to articulate his voice on behalf of his brother and mother, to try to be heard and how different perhaps that was to some of the other experiences that we had had.  Although all of the people who met stuck with me, certainly, over the weekend, that sense of being more alone really stood out.  A D&aacute;il motion is an excellent idea to have, yet again, that opportunity, many decades later, to put on the record what we are asking people to do and how we are asking people to contribute information.  For the benefit of the record of the Oireachtas, I wanted to mention that.  As members of the committee, we had the good fortune, opportunity and privilege to meet people and to listen to them.  As we are doing that as public representatives, on behalf of our constituents, the very least that we can do is come back and relay that experience, and what that experience looked like and felt like, back onto the record of the Oireachtas so that people know what it was like.  I thought that comparative isolation really stuck to me and I certainly wanted to note it today.</p></speech>

Indeed, it was sad and moving to hear Mr. McVeigh's emotional contribution and his charge as well.  Mr. McVeigh wants the truth.  He wants to bury his brother.  People know where his brother's remains are and they are not telling him.  Mr. McVeigh has not got closure.</p> <p>  I do not know if anybody else wants to comment.  They should feel free.</p></speech>

As all of our witnesses have appealed for, I appeal to anybody with any shred of information, regardless of whether he or she thinks it may be totally insignificant.  I, again, give out the message about the confidentiality, that no information would be admissible in any criminal proceedings.  They are two messages that cannot be reiterated often enough.</p> <p>  In our capital city, when there is an event in Belfast each year, we should have some event that we should consider with WAVE when its representatives are here with us and maybe have it sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

The opportunities for activity have been limited but I have been more than impressed and overwhelmed by the comments and support members of this committee have given today both to the commission and, more importantly, to the families and especially those families who are still waiting to find their loved ones.  All of the actions that you have proposed and have been agreed by the committee are very encouraging, to me and to all of us on the commission I am sure, and will be to the families.  When I joined the commission it was from a humanitarian point of view.  The emphasis today has been on the humanitarian aspect of it and all that flows from it, such as the need for information, the need for additional assistance with searches, support from politicians and support for WAVE, has been underlying the humanitarian message.</p> <p>  It struck me when we were talking about the need for Christian burial of loved ones that many people, probably throughout the world but certainly on this island, have had the experience in the past year and a half of not being able to have a normal wake and burial of loved ones who have died from illness or in the normal way.  That has brought home to us a small measure of the experience that these families are having.  It is something that could be brought home more to people.  That might encourage people to come forward with information.</p><p>As has been said, it might encourage them to engage their consciences and help to bring information to Mr. Knupfer and the team and help us move things forward.  This is especially the case now if we are able to re-engage in searches and meet people.  I thank everybody for everything they have said and all the support they have given us.  I appreciate very much the opportunity to come before the committee to speak to it and to listen to what the members have to say.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that going to Belfast and meeting the families from Ballymurphy and Springhill and meeting victims in the WAVE Trauma Centre profoundly affected all of us.  As parliamentarians, we will do our very best.  I thank Paul Stephens, who did a fantastic job organising the visit to Belfast.  We met so many people in such a short period.

We are very much aware that our job is not complete.  We want to complete it and we are determined to complete it.  We will act on anything that is anyway credible in order to bring it to completion.  I must say it is extremely encouraging to hear committee members and get a clear understanding of just how deeply they all understand the importance of bringing a great sadness to an end, which is what we are all about.  It is encouraging to us.  Any help they can give in the way of encouraging people to provide information and the other suggestions made earlier will be extremely helpful.  My feeling, and the feeling of all of us leaving the meeting, is to be greatly encouraged to get on with our task.</p></speech>

I welcome all members to our public session.  I have apologies from Senators Eileen Flynn and Ned O'Sullivan.  The Ceann Comhairle of the D&aacute;il and Cathaoirleach of the Seanad have appealed to everybody in the parliamentary community to continue to follow public health advice, wear a mask and maintain social distancing.  I request that members, witnesses and staff use the wipes and so on.  Since I am the only member here in person, along with Senator Horkan, we will abide by the rules.</p> <p>  Before we hear from our witnesses, we have some committee business to attend to.  I remind members that they must be in the Leinster House complex in order to attend this meeting.  If any member attempts to participate from outside Leinster House, I will have to ask them to leave the meeting.  I would like to remind witnesses that as they are giving their evidence from outside Leinster House,.they may not have the same privilege as if they were in Leinster House.  They may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  They are again reminded that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or damage the good name of any person.  They must stop if I say they are breaking that rule.  </p> <p>  The first bit of business is approval of the minutes, which has been discussed already in a virtual private session of the committee.  The question is that we approve the minutes of the committee meeting held on 4 November 2021.  Can I take it that these minutes are approved?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is quite a mouthful.  I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and welcome him to the meeting.  Before we hear from him, I suggest that we publish his opening statement on the web.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Based on the evidence given by witnesses appearing before this committee since our first meeting over two years ago, including Traveller representatives, and visits by this committee to a number of Traveller accommodation and halting sites where we met many Travellers at their homes, it seems that the conditions that Travellers have to endure are far from ideal.  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, NTRAS, was launched in June 2017 to address some of the issues faced by Travellers.  It represents a whole-of-government approach and encompasses themes such as cultural identity, education, employment, health and accommodation, all of which are relevant to this committee.  We will be very interested to hear what happens next.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement after which we will have a question and answer session.  We will try to keep everybody to five minutes as we go along to get in as many questions as possible and finish within the suggested time of one hour.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.672" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#B00500"><p>Good afternoon, Vice Chairman.  I really appreciate the invitation from the committee to attend and discuss this really important matter.  I am joined by my colleagues in the Department, Ms Carol Baxter and Ms Janet Lacey.  I know many people on this committee have been engaging in working to support the Traveller and Roma communities over many years.  We can all agree that the Traveller and Roma communities have long suffered from negative stereotyping but also severe and systemic discrimination.  The Government is committed to ensuring full equality of opportunity for Travellers and Roma and to removing barriers to their full and equal participation in Irish life.  There has been progress on some of these issues and I will reference this in my speech today.  However, we are all here very conscious of a great amount more to do.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues.  It represents a whole-of-government approach, as the Vice Chairman said.  It brings Government Departments and agencies together with representatives of the Traveller and Roma communities and their representative groups in a focused and structured way on key issues.</p><p>The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS encompasses action on themes such as cultural identity, education, employment, health and accommodation.  I chair the NTRIS steering committee, which includes Traveller and Roma representatives.  Our most recent meeting was on 2 November.  The Government Departments' report to the committee on implementing actions uses a traffic light system that helps to identify delays in the implementation of actions.</p><p> A number of subgroups are in place, such as in relation to education, with the aim of ensuring that key actions get the attention they need.  Departments have responsibility for delivering actions under their areas of responsibility and for ensuring that sufficient resources are secured through annual estimates processes to facilitate those actions.</p><p> The programme for Government committed to a review of the strategy and I am committed to working with stakeholders to reviewing what has been achieved and to developing new approaches, as necessary, with a particular focus on implementation and measurement.  One of the key points to come out of my chairing of this committee is the need for a greater outcomes focus on the NTRIS successor strategy.  My Department is seeking proposals for an evaluation of the processes for implementation of three equality strategies, NTRIS, the migrant integration strategy and the national strategy for women and girls, all of which are concluding at the end of this year.  The timeline for receipt of proposals for that evaluation is early December and the review will be completed by mid-2022.  I have proceeded with an evaluation process that spans a number of equality strategies because I want to put the focus on implementation and on good practice.  The objectives of our equality strategies remain largely relevant.  The key challenge is to ensure better delivery.  That is a challenge that goes beyond NTRIS.  I want to identify potential good practice in some areas that can be transferred to others.  I also want to see how intersectionality can be addressed more coherently.  This issue in particular has been raised regularly at our NTRIS meetings.  We know, for example, that the issues facing Traveller women and girls are different from those facing Traveller men and boys.  We need to see in this context how the successor strategy to the national strategy for women and girls can work in tandem with NTRIS&rsquo;s successor strategy to deliver particular outcomes for Traveller women and girls, and similarly, for LGBTI+ members of the Traveller community with the LGBTI+ strategy.  Intersectionality must be a real focus in the new NTRIS.</p><p> I have decided that the current NTRIS steering committee will remain in operation during the review process and that my Department will continue to convene meetings of the committee.  Work will continue on implementing NTRIS actions, many of which remain very relevant.  We will continue to engage with the Departments and representative organisations to ensure that actions are progressed.  The strategy committee&rsquo;s role will also be pivotal in developing the consultation process and the content for the successor strategy.  NTRIS continues to be regarded as a blueprint for action to address the needs of Traveller and Roma communities.  In this regard, the successor strategy will not represent change for the sake of change.  I will listen very carefully to stakeholders to see what they advise on the changes needed.  If they favour updating NTRIS rather than launching into a wholesale change of it, I will very much take those views on board.  In that instance, the successor strategy would align closely to NTRIS.  The advice provided by Traveller and Roma organisations will directly shape the scope and focus of the next strategy.</p><p> My Department has an important funding role to support activities linked to NTRIS.  This year, my Department has provided &euro;4.9 million of Exchequer funding and a further &euro;700,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support Traveller and Roma initiatives.  Up to &euro;3 million is provided as core funding to specific NGOs.  This year, for budget 2022 I secured a 15% increase in funding for this area and the budget is now &euro;5.659 million.  We have also had a significant uplift in Dormant Accounts Funding, on which the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, worked very hard and particularly to direct additional Dormant Accounts Fund funding towards Traveller and Roma initiatives.  This year, my Department will receive &euro;940,000 in such funding, specifically for Traveller and Roma initiatives.  I am aware that other Departments will see a similar uplift.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, funding is provided across a range of Government Departments to support and address the specific needs of the Traveller and Roma communities.  In the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, for example, the Traveller-specific accommodation budget for 2020 was &euro;14.5 million.  I am aware that the committee has dedicated several meetings to the issue of Traveller accommodation and has heard from the Ombudsman for Children in relation to the No End in Site report.  We can all agree that the report made for incredibly difficult reading about the conditions on the site in question.</p><p> The annual HSE expenditure on Traveller and Roma-specific health initiatives is in the region of &euro;10 million, including &euro;350,000 on Traveller mental health.  The HSE has recruited two dedicated Traveller health posts to develop a Traveller health policy and to co-ordinate implementation of the Traveller health action plan.  My Department has provided additional funding and other supports to our partner Traveller organisations for the continued provision of necessary services during Covid-19 to the Traveller and Roma population, including in appropriate languages.</p><p> School attendance is a specific challenge for some members of the Traveller and Roma communities and I am aware that the Department of Education will be meeting with the committee later today.  My Department provides funding for a pilot programme to target attendance, participation, retention and school completion in specific Traveller and Roma communities.  Deputy David Stanton initiated this programme when he was the Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  The pilot team works together with parents, children and young people, schools, Traveller and Roma communities and service providers to remove the barriers impacting on Traveller and Roma children&rsquo;s attendance, participation and retention in schools.  The pilots are taking place in Galway, Wexford, Dublin and Cork.  The Out of the Shadows report, which was the baseline study on this pilot has just been published in the last few days.  I have not had a chance to read through the entire report but I have seen the summary.  Two aspects stick out for me, namely, the majority of Travellers felt unwanted in schools and their overall experience of the education system was "bleak".  That was the word used.  This is a real flag to us all about the importance of acting in this area, given that this is their view and their experience.  Members will be aware there is a commitment in the programme for Government to a Traveller education strategy that will look at early years, which falls under my Department; primary and secondary, which falls under the Department of Education; and third level education and further education, which falls under the Department of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  Work on this Traveller education strategy will be progressed by the education subgroup of NTRIS.</p><p> Employment is also an ongoing challenge in the communities.  My Department funds the special initiative for Travellers, SIT, to provide support for practical approaches to redressing the imbalance in Traveller under-employment, to support Travellers already engaged in the Traveller economy and to provide other supports, including training, to address the needs of Travellers.  The SIT funding includes support workers and assistance for employment and enterprise development.  There are currently SITs in seven locations around Ireland.  Additional funding has also been provided to Involve, a community organisation, to assist this.  The Pathways to Work Strategy 2021 &ndash; 2025 has a focus on those who experience additional barriers to entering work faced by those in the Traveller and Roma communities.  The strategy will, for the first time, set out specific commitments relating to the Traveller and Roma communities and will examine how to capture data on ethnicity.</p><p> The impact of the pandemic has led to increased stress and anxiety in the Traveller and Roma communities.  My Department funds both the Traveller Mediation Service and the Traveller Counselling Service.  This year, &euro;330,000 has been made available to the Traveller Counselling Service and &euro;240,000 to the Traveller Mediation Service.  One of mediation service&rsquo;s unique attributes is that it employs Travellers as mediators who have the necessary understanding of Traveller culture and who inspire confidence in Travellers to avail of the service.  There has been an increase in demand for the services and especially self-referrals from Traveller women.</p><p> My Department also funds the National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, which is working to empower Traveller women.  Additional funding was provided for community projects that support and promote leadership roles for Traveller and Roma women.  There is a need to enhance cultural awareness of Traveller identity and to create greater visibility of Traveller culture and heritage.  My Department has worked to advance this and has provided funding of &euro;100,000 for Traveller Pride Week to empower national, regional and local organisations to celebrate Traveller and Roma culture and diversity.</p><p>We are also progressing a project with the National Museum of Ireland to develop an online portal to Traveller culture collections.  This will see the creation of an online portal of objects, archives, photographs, recordings and other collections held in the national cultural institutions and a national folklore archive pertaining to Traveller culture or history.</p><p> The collection of data on Traveller and Roma participation in public service programmes and services is crucial to understanding the degree of access that Travellers and Roma have to various services and programmes.  We need disaggregated data, which is crucial for determining outcomes for Travellers and Roma.  Work has been undertaken within the NTRIS framework to develop an ethnic identifier, whereby Traveller and Roma participation in service programmes can be disaggregated and outcomes can be tracked.  This work is now feeding into a broader process, led by my Department and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, to develop a new equality data strategy, which will have a major impact on issues of race and outcomes for different racial groups in our society.  The equality data strategy&rsquo;s purpose will be to establish a cross-departmental framework for gathering data and standardising the classification of such data.  The strategy is being advanced under the auspices of the equality budgeting working group, jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is developing capacity within the public service to assess the equality aspects of budgetary expenditure.</p><p> I reiterate my commitment, and that of the Government, to supporting action to ensure that Travellers and members of the Roma community can participate fully and equally in Irish society.  As I said at the start, I am conscious that a major amount of work remains to be done.  I look forward to receiving the committee's report in due course, which I hope will also help to inform the successor strategy to NTRIS. </p></speech>

A question remains to be answered.  Funding is going into this strategy and committees and equality groups have been set up, yet the situation has not changed on the coalface.  That is the reality of it.  It is a question of how we transpose all these reports and groups to the reality on the ground.</p> <p>  Members of the committee visited the Spring Lane halting site in Cork on the basis of the Ombudsman for Children's report.  It would be an underestimate to say that it did not have a big impact on all of us.  Travellers have been living in those conditions for nearly 30 years.  Things are not changing quickly enough.  It is a slow process, which causes a lot of distrust in the community of officials, councillors and the powers that be.  Travellers are getting visits from people all the time, including Deputies, CEOs, officials and the ombudsman, and things still have not changed.</p> <p>  We visited Labre Park in Ballyfermot on Monday.  Travellers there have worked with council officials for 21 years to put a plan in place to upgrade the site.  It is not happening.  We have to find ways to move these blocks that are there all the time.  We also visited St. Margaret's halting site on Monday, which is a better site, but Travellers there got themselves organised and used the leverage of the super depot being built by the council right beside them.  They said that if the council was going to put &euro;100 million into that, they wanted a cut of it for a super site in the community estate that they live in.  It is just an observation that many things seem to be set up, but their implementation is not happening.  We have to get over that.  One criticism of NTRIS is that it has a lot of information but the implementation of it is not quick enough.</p> <p>  Some &euro;14.5 million was fully spent on Traveller-specific accommodation.  Is there a breakdown of where that Traveller-specific accommodation was?  Was it on a site in Galway or Mayo?  I received a report about a site in Mayo that has not had proper water or sanitation for the past 21 years.  It is a simple thing to get someone to go in to do the job that needs to be done in a way that is not piecemeal.  One thing I noticed from the feedback we got from much of the Traveller community is that someone is coming in and fixing a pothole, or a problem with a water connection or something like that, but no one is going in and doing the fundamental groundwork that needs to be done to facilitate everybody receiving proper water, sanitation, etc.  The Minister said that he expected the &euro;15.5 million in 2021 to be fully spent.  I ask for a breakdown of where that Traveller-specific accommodation funding has been spent.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the ethnic identifier system has been set up.  That will make a difference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.677" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#D00400"><p>I completely agree with the wider points the Deputy made on things not happening fast enough.  We are seeing high-level changes in policy, such as recognition of Traveller ethnicity.  We are seeing changes in that NTRIS is being introduced and adopted as an all-of-Government strategy, but we are not seeing enough substantive changes on sites and in people's lives throughout the country.  One reason for this is that NTRIS was designed in such a way that an outcome is achieved when a policy or law is changed.  If a new policy is adopted on education, then there is a tick and we are seen to be in the green, rather than having 50% more Traveller children finish secondary education.  It is key that we have measurable outcomes in the new NTRIS that we are able to start relating to.</p> <p>  That also ties in with the issue of data on equality, which the Deputy identified as key, and the fact that we are not measuring Traveller participation in, and use of, various public services alone.  The equality data will include data on people with different ethnic backgrounds as we are a much more racially mixed country now.  We need to bring in that data.  My Department is leading on that and working with the CSO on it.  I am always conscious that when I talk about something that is about to happen we are again pushing progress back further, but I think everybody agrees these abilities to measure are crucial.</p> <p>  We can ask for a breakdown of the &euro;14.5 million on the Traveller-specific accommodation from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I do not have that specific breakdown; it comes under housing.  I will touch on the Deputy's overall question about areas where we are not seeing progress.  Housing is one area where there has not been progress over the past ten years.  As she knows, a significant report was drafted by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  A programme board is now in place in that Department, which is looking at the report's 18 key recommendations and seeing how they will be delivered.  My Department also set up a programme board to draft and implement the White Paper on direct provision.  I see the use of a programme board that brings in people from outside the Department as a good technique to achieve significant change.</p> <p>  We all have to admit that Travellers have faced systemic racism in respect of the accommodation element.  Those of us who have been on local authorities know that there was huge resistance when we tried to bring new sites into areas.  It was not at council level but often from constituents.</p><p>When we voted to allow for Traveller accommodation, we encountered a significant pushback.  It is important that leadership be shown by politicians in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, civil servants in Departments, and councillors in both county and city councils.  We must make it clear that our Traveller community is part of our community.  It is essential that we provide appropriate accommodation for Travellers within our communities.  We will follow up on the question on expenditure in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

We have to turn that around.  If communities are to have the right services and accommodation, some serious work will have to be done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#E00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his kind words.  I thank his officials, whom I know well from many years chairing the NTRIS group.  I can empathise regarding many of the issues raised because I have been through this quite a bit.  I agree fully with the Minister with respect to the outcomes and the need to have a measurement in this regard.  The pilot project on education that was referred to is a way of achieving this because we know how many children are impacted.  It is relatively easy to see how that will develop.  I am interested in knowing when the pilot project will finish up.  I realise we are to have an official from the Department of Education in next.  What will the outcomes be?</p> <p>  The ethnic identifier has been kicking around for a long time.  It will be interesting to see where it is going and when it will be finalised.  I remember dealing with it for a couple of years, and it was always put off.  It is quite challenging.</p> <p>  There are 149 actions in the NTRIS.  How many have been completed?  I get what the Minister said about ticking the box.  That is a problem.  The steering committee has over 30 people around the table representing Departments, agencies, local authorities and so on.  Therefore, there are many people responsible, but ultimately accountability and reporting back in detail have been a challenge all the time.  That will need to be addressed.</p> <p>  The mediation service has been a huge success.  In the past, I had occasion to engage with the people involved.  The Travellers in prison initiative has also been a great success.  I was glad to see the horse project happening.  Maybe it should happen elsewhere.  How many of the actions have not been started yet?  How many are facing a substantial delay?  How many of the 149 have been completed?</p> <p>  What the Minister referred to earlier is typical of the NTRIS and perhaps some of the other strategies.  The Minister said he does not have the facts and figures regarding housing and must go to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for them.  He will find himself trotting off to that Department.  I am aware that the officials in the Minister&rsquo;s Department, and previously those in the Department of Justice, have worked very hard behind the scenes engaging with officials in other Departments to try to get information and updates and to ensure something substantial will happen, not just a box-ticking exercise.  There is an opportunity to proceed but I agree that there needs to be tightening up with respect to the outcomes and to making them truly measurable rather than box-ticking exercises somewhere along the way.</p> <p>  We are concerned about what is going on in the various accommodation centres.  I visited many of them when I was Minister of State.  They have not changed.  There is pushback in the community, from citizens and others, when there is talk of Traveller accommodation being established anywhere.  Councillors are very often blamed, but quite often they are just repeating what their constituents say to them.  There is a volume of work to be done in society with regard to the prejudice the Minister referred to.</p> <p>  I wish the Minister well with this.  It is extremely challenging.  We really need to sit on it with respect to all Departments, State agencies and local authorities regarding their responsibilities.  The NTRIS oversight committee can do a certain amount, but ultimately, because it has tentacles extending all over the place, it is very hard to follow every one of them and to ensure things happen.</p> <p>  That is my contribution.  I wish the Minister and his officials well in their work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.681" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#E00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I recognise the significant work he did in this area during his term of office.</p> <p>  On the 149 actions under the NTRIS, only two have not been started.  Therefore, there have been significant advances.  All the others have been commenced.  I just do not have the figure for how many are fully concluded but I will write to the committee after this meeting to give a breakdown, indicating the two actions that have not been started yet.</p> <p>  On the specific point on the education pilot programme, we have decided to extend the programme into a third year because Covid had a very significant impact on its operation.  I am aware from my engagement on the NTRIS and with a range of Traveller NGOs, with whose representatives I have regular one-on-one meetings and whom I meet at Traveller events, that there is genuine concern across the community about the impact of Covid and the attendance of Traveller children in schools.  Particularly when schools reopened in September 2020, there was a very significant drop-off in school attendance.  The remote schooling that worked so well for most families across the country probably did not work for the vast majority of Traveller families because they did not have laptops and unhindered access to Wi-Fi.  That is a major issue, including in the community.</p> <p>  The Out of the Shadows report, which I spoke about, very much acts as a baseline study of the five areas in which the pilot has been commenced.  It was published recently.  I hope it will be the subject of analysis and debate.  It will give us the baseline from which to measure the success of the pilot initiatives.  There will be an evaluation but it will take place after three years because Covid affected the operations so much.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct about data.  This issue will be difficult.  It has now been identified in so many other areas.  For example, the national anti-racism committee, established at the end of the term of the last Government and which is bringing forward the national action plan against racism, identified in its interim report the lack of ethnicity data as a key facilitator of racism in the country, because we cannot measure the impact of policies or their absence.  In a range of areas, the lack of information has been identified as a key problem.  I hope, therefore, that we can have developments in this regard.  Given my background, I am passionate about statistics and using data to drive good policy.  That is why I believe it is important to have a policy on ethnicity data.</p> <p>  The mediation service is a brilliant resource.  It and the Traveller Counselling Service are both, in their own ways, absolutely fabulous at helping to deal with conflict within communities.  We will continue to support them.  We were able to give them a little bit of extra support in the form of dormant accounts funding at the end of this year.</p> <p>  My officials have just texted me to say 16 of the NTRIS actions have been fully completed.  We will write to the committee with a full breakdown of the figures following this meeting.</p></speech>

We have all seen the different sites and we will see more.  We have been around for many years dealing with Travellers' issues.  However, not very much seems to have changed.  The standard at sites depends on the different local authorities.  The lack of spending by the local authorities has been well highlighted.  What actions is the Minister taking against some of these local authorities?  There is no doubt that, apart from the prejudice he mentioned in the ordinary community, there is an awful lot of prejudice in the local authorities.  I found a very big resistance over the years in certain cases.  Does the Minister have ideas or penalties to deal with this or do we have any actions that would put them on the spot?</p> <p>  The ombudsman's report was very damning in regards to Cork.  That has obviously kicked them a bit.  It is very strange that in the whole of Cork, whether it in  Cork county or city, there is not one horse project.  While I am not saying that is the be all and end all, many young Traveller kids are involved in horse projects.  They are blaming each other as to why there is no horse project in that one blames the county while the other blames the city.  This has to be dealt with and we cannot allow people to make excuses.  </p> <p>  In many cases, we go to Part 8 provisions to look for things to be done.  Are we pushing the managers to use the executive powers they have if things are not being dealt with?  There seems to be and has been for a long time a reluctance to do that.  What is the Minister's position on that? </p> <p>  My area has many schools in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, scheme.  From what was said, there is more money coming into the DEIS schools, and that the scheme will be expanded a bit, which is very welcome.  I would like to see what is intended in that regard.  Special education and other supports are provided for people who attend DEIS schools.  Breakfast clubs and homework clubs are very important in many cases and I would like to see a bit more put into them.  I have seen many times young children coming to school without having eaten breakfast.  They do not have anything but are going in and are expected to take part in school.  I would like to make sure that does not happen; it should not happen.  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the Dormant Accounts Fund, and I believe a figure of &euro;500,000 was mentioned.  I am not sure what that would do in practical terms.  Perhaps we need to look at expanding this and the Minister mentioned that he might be thinking of doing so.  What would that give us?  From an educational point of view, we need to look at putting as much money as we possibly can into improving services.  Whether children have to make their way to school or otherwise, we need to do that.  </p> <p>  The accommodation, obviously, is a major factor.  It varies so much.  We saw really bad accommodation in Cork.  We also saw it in Labre Park and in St. Margaret's as well.  There are plans in place and I have been dealing with St. Margaret's for years, which is a lot better than the other sites.  I have been going to meeting after meeting on accommodation, however. for more than ten years.  </p> <p>  Turnover in the council, which is quite common, is another factor.  New people are brought in and every couple of years there is a different person to deal with.  It is very poor on the part of local authorities.  This issue of accommodation has dragged on and it is very frustrating.  To add to it, there is no penalty imposed as a result of it being dragged out.  We have been promised three houses in Avila Park and the building of bungalows and a bay in effect in St. Margaret's.   We have had consultation after consultation, many meetings with the Travellers, with the local authority and in some cases with politicians.  We need to put the pressure on and things need to be better because things have not changed that much.  However, I am hopeful now, with the ombudsman's report, the Minister's interest, everyone pushing and this committee putting the pressure on.  It will be very important. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.683" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#F00200"><p>The Deputy has rightly highlighted that accommodation is central to resolving this issue and is one of the most pressing issues.  Accommodation, health, particularly mental health, and education are the probably the issues that come up most regularly and most strongly within NTRIS, with NTRIS committee meetings and with my own engagement with individual groups as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Ellis spoke about actions having been taken against local authorities and how we press local authorities to do more.  The work of the Ombudsman for Children in focusing on the Spring Lane site definitely has put a real focus on both the role of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and in particular on the role of the local authority in question.  I know because the Ombudsman for Children has engaged with my Department and has been critical of elements of my own Department in terms of direct provision.  However, we built a really strong relationship and it has a monitoring role but it is an ongoing engagement.  I hope we will see that same sort of engagement with Cork City Council in terms of the Spring Lane site.  </p> <p>  There are other ways in which pressure can be exerted on local authorities as well.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, was in with me a number of weeks ago and it has been conducting an engagement with each local authority across the country, asking it what are its policies and practices in respect of Traveller accommodation.  The commission has received replies from most of them and may be engaging in - I do not want to say a punitive process - a follow-up and monitoring process that can be escalated to a punitive process, if necessary.  That is going on at the moment and it might be interesting for the committee to write to IHREC and seek an update on that process.  I certainly found it interesting and they are following up at present.  The commission found that the policies and practices are incredibly diverse and different across our local authorities.  That is problematic itself because Travellers, obviously in terms of their nomadic lifestyle, can be engaging with a whole different set of policies, practices, and approaches in each of our local authorities.  </p> <p>  I absolutely agree with the Deputy in terms of the importance of horse projects as a clear manifestation of Traveller culture and as a practical step to teaching young Travellers how to look after their horses and how to avoid any animal welfare issues that may have been encountered in the past.  They are really worth supporting.  </p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the area of DEIS in the context of education and yes, we will see a very significant increase in spending on DEIS schools next year.  The committee will have the Department of Education appear before it next and its representatives probably will be able to speak to that in more detail.  I am delighted to see the overall increase in DEIS spending.  The Deputy spoke about the importance of homework clubs for young Traveller children and that is definitely something I would recognise.  </p> <p>  School-age childcare for Travellers is something that had been impacted by some of the measures around the national childcare scheme, NCS.  I announced a removal of one such measure in the budget this year.  I will not get into huge detail but it is this idea of wraparound hours, whereby hours spent in school were subtracted from the total number of hours that children could spend in after-school.  It basically meant that during term time, children from disadvantaged areas would not be able access after-school provision.  That will be changed from early next year because of the new funding measure that I introduced in this year's budget.  I hope that will have a significant impact on after-school services in a range of disadvantaged communities and in particular in the Travelling community.</p> <p>  A key point is access to preschool for Travellers.  As we all know, there is the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme with two years of free preschool.  I do not have the figure to hand right now but there is a difference of about 10% or 15% between participation of the settled community and participation by the Travelling community in ECCE.</p><p>Immediately that gap in education is established before the first day of primary school, so part of the Traveller education strategy I spoke about earlier will be to ensure higher levels of participation by Traveller children in the two-year free preschool ECCE programme.  That is a key priority for me which I can follow up in my Department.</p><p> On dormant accounts, it is what it is but it is a good additional stream of funding, particularly for more discrete projects.  For example, next year there will be funding of just short of &euro;1 million, at &euro;940,000, to fund measures to address conflict and mental health issues in the Traveller community, a Roma adult education and training project, targeted resources to support young people from the Traveller community to join and be active members of their local Comhairle na n&Oacute;g and Traveller and Roma community education posts supports addressing the impact of Covid-19 on participation, retention and progression through the education system.  Those are the four discrete projects my Department will be funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  It is a useful way to guide money to a particular project for the short to medium term, rather than the long term, and perhaps use it and assess whether the project was successful and whether it got the outcomes we spoke about earlier.</p></speech>

Deputy Mitchell is next and I am after her.  If we keep it tight, there might be time left to go around very briefly for a one-minute round of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1464" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#G00300"><p>I will ask the questions together so we can get through them more quickly.  First, am I correct in reading from the Minister's opening statement that he hopes to have the review completed by June 2022?  I wish to follow up on what Deputy Ellis was discussing.  There are many figures and amounts in the opening statement.  The Department has over &euro;5.5 million and &euro;3 million of that is going to NGOs.  Can the Minister give us a breakdown of the &euro;2.5 million?  He probably will not have it to hand here, but perhaps he could forward the breakdown of that &euro;2.5 million to the committee.  To what types of projects is this money going?</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the special initiative for Travellers, which is welcome.  I am a little underwhelmed that it is only seven locations.  Can the Minister tell the committee where the seven locations are and whether there are any plans for expanding the initiative?</p> <p>  I wish to echo what Deputies Joan Collins and Ellis said.  We visited the Spring Lane site last week and it was very depressing to see it.  As the Minister with responsibility for children and equality, what type of engagement is he having with the council regarding Spring Lane and monitoring the work that is going on there?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.687" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#G00400"><p>Those are specific questions for the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.688" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#G00500"><p>The review I spoke about that will be completed in June 2022 is a review of the effectiveness of three of our current equality strategies - NTRIS, the national strategy for women and girls and the migrant integration strategy.  It is to look at where they have been successful, what parts of them have not succeeded and the issues of intersectionality and how the three equality strategies can better address those issues.  That report will help to feed into the design of the NTRIS successor strategy.  However, we will not be waiting until that report is done to do anything else.</p> <p>  As I said, the steering committee for the existing NTRIS will continue to meet.  I agreed at our last meeting that we will spend the majority of the next meeting focused on hearing what the groups want to see in the next NTRIS.  We have NTRIS and in the programme for Government there are commitments to a number of strategies in specific areas, such as an education strategy, an employment strategy and a health action plan.  I want to get an understanding of how the overarching NTRIS will operate with these more sectional things as well.  There is no point in us being laden with this strategy and that strategy.  We cannot spend all our time writing strategies because what we need is implementation.  That is the focus, so I want to hear from those groups about how they see those different elements operating.  They wanted a Traveller and Roma education strategy in the programme for Government and we included that.  They wanted an employment strategy and we put it in.  However, I need to understand how they see that working with the overarching strategy.  It may be that we have NTRIS as the overarching strategy and we have, perhaps, action plans in specific Departments that will set out, for example, how the seven objectives in NTRIS that are relevant to my Department will actually be delivered and what the measurements of that delivery will be.  Again, I want to be guided very much by the Traveller groups in how all that happens.</p> <p>  Regarding the expenditure in the Department, we can send that to the committee.  However, &euro;2.2 million of that &euro;5.5 million goes to core Traveller funding, that is, core funding for the major Traveller organisations.  Some &euro;480,000 goes to the education pilot programmes we spoke about earlier, which Deputy Stanton introduced.  A total of &euro;700,000 goes to other NGO core funding.  Those are NGOs that are not solely Traveller NGOs but that work substantially in the Traveller field.  The special incentive for Travellers accounts for &euro;440,000.  There is core Roma funding of &euro;116,000, a Roma employment project for &euro;400,000, a Roma inclusion project for &euro;200,000 and then &euro;125,000 for Traveller Pride and Roma Day.  Then we had &euro;200,000 for specific Covid-19 needs.  We can send the information to the committee, but that is an update on the 2021 spending.  Obviously, we have not assigned all the subheads yet for 2022, but it was &euro;4.9 million for 2021.  Next year we will have &euro;5.5 million, and we can send those figures to the committee.</p> <p>  As regards the special incentives for Travellers, I might write separately to the committee on that.  I do not have a huge overview of why there are only seven there.  Again, initiatives like that have to be developed across other Departments.  Obviously, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment would be significant in terms of supporting employability.</p> <p>  Regarding Spring Lane, I remember a Green Party convention in Cork - it must be 11 years ago - at which the Spring Lane group presented to us.  The images are very similar to the images we saw when the Ombudsman did his report.  Regarding my engagement in this, it has been discussed in NTRIS.  We use our position in NTRIS to engage directly with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to get an update on its progress there and its progress on wider Traveller accommodation.  With the Covid pandemic, I have not been out and about as much as I would like but I hope to be in a position to visit Spring Lane when I am on a visit to Cork at some point.  Continued engagement to highlight the issues here from both a Traveller equality point of view and a children point of view is important to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#G00600"><p>Thank you.  We must keep a focus on what we are trying to achieve, the big scene.  Often we can get lost in the detail.  Our objective has to be to build strong, equal, vibrant Traveller communities.  Racial attitudes are incredibly negative towards Travellers and I have not seen any improvement.  Equality issues are challenging every day.  Accommodation, whether it is halting site or Traveller-specific, is not being dealt with.  On the private market Travellers find it incredibly hard to get the housing assistance payment, HAP.  For example, 50% of the homeless in Galway city are Travellers even though they are a very small percentage of the population.  We know all the statistics about educational disadvantage; we could sing them now if we could sing.  We know about employment, or lack of employment.  We know that the health outcomes are horrendous.</p> <p>  I have the view, and I say this about many problems, that if meetings, structures, reports and evaluations actually changed the world, the world would be well changed by now and we would not be facing the same old problems.</p><p>I will make the following specific points.  Is it time we measured our results on the ground?  Can we measure the actual improvement, year by year in, for example, accommodation, health, employment and so on?  Should we spend more time getting down on the ground and finding out the Traveller community's perspective on the improvements they see in their lives?  Having worked in a wide variety of areas, I am aware that people are fairly forthcoming if there are improvements.  That is my first question.  Are we measuring the inputs and the reports, as the Minister said, or are we measuring the actual outcomes for the community we purport to be targeting with assistance?  </p><p> I am interested to hear the Minister's view on the following matter.  He might outline whether he has a lead role across all Departments to bang heads together on delivery.  Does he have, for example, the same powers as the Minister with responsibility for the islands traditionally had from 2002 onwards?  The Minister with responsibility for the islands had funds and responsibility for things that might normally fall under the remit of other Departments, for example, transport services, including ferry services, or the building of piers on the islands.  That was done directly by the Department with responsibility for the islands.  That would be the equivalent of the Minister having the function to provide housing for Travellers.  The Minister in that Department had funds to disburse across other Departments at will, as long as those other Departments were delivering.  Does the Minister have a role as head of the lead Department, with the funds to go with it, to ensure this gets done or are we still depending on egging along each Department and local authority, and nobody is in control if those Departments do not take action?  Would it be better if more funds were channelled centrally through one Department and one Minister had primary responsibility for making sure of delivery?  My two questions are whether we measure actual improvements from the bottom up and whether we should change the structure at the very top so that the Government, which is answerable to Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann, would have somebody with a primary role in this area with the funds to support them.  Money controls a lot in this State.  It is important that such a Minister would have control of those funds.</p></speech>

I and, more important, the groups representing the Traveller and Roma communities, believe that the approach adopted has been too focused on inputs, as the Deputy said.  There have been many inputs to Traveller and Roma policy in recent years.  That represents an amount of progress from a time when this entire area was completely ignored, which it was ten or 15 years ago.  There is a lot of focus on the area these days.  We cannot measure tangible outcomes because the processes to do so are not in place.  Even in their absence, I think we know from talking to Travellers and Roma that they are not seeing the tangible improvements in their lives.  We cannot measure but, even without measuring, we know anecdotally there has not been progress.  In order to get real achievement, we need not to be measuring anecdotally, we need to be measuring with real statistics and that is why I am focusing on putting in place the ability to capture that data.  That is why, in the successor to the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, we are going to put a focus on those measurable outcomes.  We will have to discuss what they are.  We want to make them easy to measure although we do not want to create a whole bureaucracy around measurements because that gets us away from essential delivery.  Having key metrics is going to be important.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether I have a lead role in banging heads.  My style is not to bang heads.  I try to work with people, as much as possible.  However, I do not have the lead funding role the Deputy described was in place for the Minister with responsibility for the islands.  I have a reasonably small budget for Traveller supports, as I outlined earlier to Deputy Mitchell.  I have a role through NTRIS and the steering group.  I use my role to hear what Departments are doing.  I then engage with Departments where I feel additional pressure or engagement are needed to achieve outcomes.  For example, I have bilateral meetings with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on a range of issues that span our Departments, from domestic, sexual and gender-based violence to support for refugee accommodation and support for children who are leaving care.  Traveller accommodation is one of the issues we discuss in those meetings.  Is it the best way to go?  I do not know the answer to that question yet.  We always need to look at how we can strengthen deliverables across Government, particularly in areas where responsibility can end up falling across a number of Departments.  The origin of my Department was a feeling that responsibility for children's issues, outside of education, was spread out across too many Departments.  That is why those issues were centralised in my Department.  That is what we are doing currently in terms of disability.  There was a sense that responsibility for disability was stretched across too many Departments and that is why issues have been taken out of the Department of Justice and will be soon taken out of the Department of Health and centralised in my Department.  We hope that will see better outcomes for persons with disability.</p> <p>  I am conscious that local authorities have experience and expertise to deliver housing.  I keep an open mind as to who should have oversight for Traveller-specific accommodation.  All I can say is that I am very conscious that, as a country, we are not doing enough to improve outcomes for members of our Traveller and Roma community.  I am absolutely committed, as the non-governmental organisations in the sector know, to improving those outcomes.</p></speech>

Those local authorities are certainly not using their experience but we will say no more about that today.

I am particularly interested in youth services.  We did a lot of work on the national youth justice strategy.  I am wondering about the actions and interests concerning youth services and engagement with teenagers, in particular teenage Travellers, that pertain to the Minister's Department.  Perhaps the Minister would give us an update.  I think some of the actions in the strategy relate to youth services.  What progress has been made in that regard?  Youths and teenagers, in particular, are vulnerable, especially where mental health is concerned, in these times.</p></speech>

We had a private meeting earlier that Senator Flynn attended.  She made the point that accommodation is key to everything else coming together.  Accommodation would build the morale of the Travelling community and that of the children on the sites.  It would build the morale of the communities around those sites.  It would be like the working-class areas of Coolock 20 or 30 years ago, when they had a bad name.  At that time, if you put Coolock down as your address, you never got a call from an employer.  We have to concentrate on accommodation.</p><p>That will lead to better mental health, better education and children having more respect for their communities.</p></speech>

As we have seen over the years, when revisiting issues on Traveller sites innumerable times, especially regarding accommodation and education, there are issues when we take our foot off the pedal.  I agree that we need to make sure we have robust monitoring.  That is key to keeping an eye on the local authorities and the actions taking place.</p></speech>

Deputies Joan Collins and Ellis made a point about the importance of accommodation when addressing stability and security for Traveller families all over the country, living in low quality accommodation, whether social or private housing.  It creates significant instability for them and their children and impacts on all other elements of life.  I take the Deputies' point about accommodation and monitoring.  They have my commitment that we will engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage about the measures it is undertaking to improve housing for Travellers.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanton might have seen that I recently launched the Traveller participation framework.  We had a group of Traveller children from youth services in Government Buildings.  We had fun at the fountain that day.  They were delighted to be in Government Buildings and to see the Taoiseach's office from where we were.  We support the participation and the voice of young Traveller people, especially in existing participation frameworks such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, so that their voices can be heard.  Another outcome is the Traveller participation and leadership strategy, which is funded by my Department.  It identifies young leaders within the Traveller community and supports their personal development so that they can continue to develop as leaders of the community.  UBU Your Place Your Space is a central targeted funding mechanism for youth services in my Department.  It has initiated a number of Traveller-specific services.  A Roma-specific service recently opened in Roscommon.  We secured a &euro;5 million increase in overall funding for youth services.  I hope that some of that will benefit the Traveller and Roma communities.</p> <p>  I apologise.  I have to run.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I am delighted to extend a warm welcome to the witnesses for the second session.  From the Department of Education, I welcome Ms Mary Cregg, principal officer in the social inclusion unit, and Mr. Brendan Doody, assistant chief inspector.  We have to be strict about time because we are running over.  I ask the witnesses to stick to ten minutes for their opening statement between them.  We will then take questions from members.</p></speech>

My name is Mary Cregg and I am principal officer with responsibility for social inclusion in the Department of Education.  My colleague, Brendan Doody, is assistant chief inspector in the Department.</p> <p>  The Department recognises that while improvements in Traveller educational outcomes have taken place in recent years, educational attainment among Travellers continues to lag significantly behind that of the general population in Ireland.</p><p> Analysis of retention data in the Department shows that close to 90% of Travellers progress to third year of post-primary schools.  There has been an increase in retention to junior certificate, with 68% to 70% of those entering school in 2014 or 2015 completing junior certificate in 2017 and 2018, compared with 65% for those entering in 2010 and completing junior certificate in 2013.</p><p> The percentage completing leaving certificate remains low at 22%.  It is known that a significant number of Travellers avail of options to continue education in Youthreach centres or avail of further education routes.</p><p> It is important that examples of good practice and innovation in schools, and in ancillary support services, are harnessed to improve the educational experience of Traveller pupils.  The committee has asked for information on the pilot projects that have been put in place as one of the actions under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  An update has been supplied in the Department's submission.</p><p> The pilot projects are only one of a number of developments that are aimed at supporting educational outcomes.  A key objective of Traveller education policy in recent years has been the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision.  Funding for segregated Traveller provision has been incorporated into overall school and other funding streams in order to provide supports for Traveller pupils in mainstream schools.</p><p> Budget 2022 has allocated the largest ever increase in funding for the DEIS programme to tackle educational disadvantage.  The budget provided an additional &euro;18 million in 2022 and &euro;32 million in 2023, which will enable an expansion in 2022 of the programme to further schools.  Not all Travellers attend DEIS schools and additional supports are available in all schools to support students with additional needs.  These include special education teachers, special needs assistants and supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p> A Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, has been put in place to help schools mitigate the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on student learning loss and well-being arising from the periods of school closures in 2020 and 2021.  Provision is being made for up to &euro;52 million in extra teaching hours for schools.</p><p> Under the 2022 dormant accounts action plan, funding of &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Department of Education to oversee projects that tackle educational disadvantage for Travellers and Roma.  The Department supports inclusive education for all and actions that will ensure that the school setting is a more welcoming environment for all our students, including Travellers.  All schools are required to engage in a self-evaluation process.  School self-evaluation involves reflective inquiry leading to action planning for improvement that is informed by evidence gathered within each school's unique context.  The process enables schools to use this evidence to identify meaningful and specific targets and actions for improvement that focus on teaching and learning practices.  It enables them to create and implement improvement plans, measure their progress and identify their achievements.</p><p> By reflecting on what teachers teach and how they teach it, and on what pupils learn and how they learn, school management and teachers become aware that certain aspects of the education they provide are effective, and that improvement is needed in others.  For example, in situations where attendance rates are problematic, schools have been advised to consider the extent to which current teaching approaches support good attendance.  A similar approach has been advised where retention rates are lower than national averages.  In addition, in DEIS schools this may also involve working towards ensuring improved partnerships with external agencies such as the school completion programme.</p><p> The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice promotes the provision of a whole-school approach to supporting well-being.  It is an approach that has been found internationally to produce a wide range of educational and social benefits for individual children, and young people, including increased inclusion, greater social cohesion, increased social capital and improvements to mental health.  Work is under way by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, arising from an audit of the curriculum in respect of Traveller culture and history.  This is being done with a view to developing opportunities for teaching about Traveller history and culture, and developing resources for use in schools.  The NCCA is also due to commence work in 2022 on a review of the intercultural guidelines for schools.  This will further facilitate schools to create an inclusive environment, including for Travellers.</p><p> While progress is being made, we still have work to do to as Traveller students continue to experience disadvantage in the area of education.  My colleague and I are very happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

I also thank Dr. Doody for his attendance.</p> <p>  I was around when the pilot projects were initiated and I am glad to see they are ongoing.  Earlier, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth noted there had been problems due to Covid.  I ask the delegation to give an overview of the projects.  What exactly is happening on the ground?  How do Traveller children experience these projects?  What are the people involved actually doing?  We have home school community liaison people on the ground and others.  I ask the delegation to paint a picture of what difference the projects make for young Travellers, their families and schools.</p> <p>  Ms Cregg mentioned Youthreach.  The local training initiatives are another area that young people go into when the system, as I say, fails them.  I ask the delegation to comment on Youthreach, local training initiatives and those other pathways.  We have heard from time to time that not everybody, not just Travellers but other students in the mainstream, find the academic leaving certificate as we know it at present to be the best way to go.  There are other pathways and I ask the delegation to comment on them.  How do these pathways assist and support Travellers and some others to find additional pathways to qualifications, jobs and so forth?</p></speech>

They identified what they saw as the main issues that they felt needed to be tackled.  The goals identified included supporting students; improving the learning experience for students; supporting parents; supporting schools to improve attendance, participation and retention; developing linkages with community and other services; and to consider gathering data and assessment in order to have an evidence base that would inform future policy.</p> <p>  In terms of what is happening on the ground, each team has a home school community liaison officer and an educational welfare officer or school completion worker.  Each team has two members of the Traveller or Roma community working as a team on the ground in the four sites of Dublin, Cork, Wexford and Galway.</p> <p>  The initiatives that are put in place are planned at the outset of the year.  We recognise that there are regional variations.  We also recognise that there is local knowledge among the Traveller representatives in the various areas about the specific issues that might have an impact on attendance and education.  They differ across the various areas and, on that basis, the teams try to be as innovative as possible.  The teams involved have identified certain initiatives that they have trialled to see what does and does not work.  Part and parcel of that is to consider this in an overall context and ensure that operational and practical supports are provided to parents.  By practical things, I mean assisting parents in navigating how to use the communication tools from schools, building relationships and understanding the culture and being the bridge between the Traveller community and the schools.  That is one of the things that schools have seen as one of the key benefits of this collaboration.  We also bridge links to community supports.  Obviously Covid has had a huge impact on the normal school environment.  Certainly the pilot teams were of huge benefit during the Covid period in terms of maintaining that connection with schools for the pupils involved.</p> <p>  There is a lot of practical work on the ground.  There has been the development of resources that have been used locally in the schools.  These resources were developed in conjunction with the Traveller organisations.  There is also the introduction to Traveller culture and history within schools.  That building of understanding is probably the key element that the informal feedback has given to us at this point in time.</p></speech>

Has the use of the restricted timetable been diminished?  We have spoken about this issue previously because we are very concerned.  I ask the delegation to comment on homework clubs as well.  Have homework clubs been tried?</p><p>I have visited a few of those homework clubs and I thought they were very impressive.  They help young Travellers to get ahead of the posse, by having their homework done and having an understanding in order that when they go into school the next day, they know what is going on and are up with or maybe even ahead of their peers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Cregg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#L00200"><p>Deputy Stanton will be aware of the previous engagement on reduced school days.  The Department published guidelines in September which will come into effect in January.  One of the issues with reduced school days was that there was no formal reporting mechanism.  From 1 January, all schools will be required to notify the Tusla education support service when a reduced school day is put in place.  We are aware of some situations in which a reduced school day can be a positive intervention, such as when a child has had a bereavement or might need to reintegrate into the school on a transitional basis for other reasons.  We certainly wanted to balance making allowance for those sorts of situations with ensuring a reduced school day did not apply as a disciplinary measure or was not something that prevented a child from attending school.  That has been a significant development.  With regard to the Deputy's question on the gathering of data and to what extent they would have been in place, the data on the pilots will be gathered as part of a formal evaluation for which we will shortly be going out to tender.</p> <p>  NTRIS has strong links with homework clubs and while we would not necessarily want to be setting up homework clubs under the NTRIS pilot, we want to ensure that children have access to where necessary.  In Dublin, the pilot has strong links with homework clubs that are supported by City of Dublin ETB such as the St. Margaret's homework club pilot.  I know the committee has visited the St. Margaret's site as well.  In Wexford, students are directly accessing homework clubs in six of the schools.  In Tuam, homework clubs are running in some of the schools and evening study and homework clubs in the secondary school.  There are links with homework clubs and that has been seen as one of the initiatives in use for the pilot.</p> <p>  Youthreach is now under the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I do not have the specific detail on that, but under the DEIS plan, schools in the DEIS programme will be specifically asked to focus on transitions and to look at linking in to those alternative pathways.  However, the Department wants to encourage children staying within the mainstream system and being afforded the same opportunities at an equal level with other children across the system.  Where that is not possible or where children are not in a position to continue in mainstream education, alternative pathways are available to them, Youthreach being one of them.</p></speech>

I was curious about the work under way in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, arising from the audit of the curriculum, on Travellers' culture and history.  Is there any scope in that for training for teachers, to teach them best practice in dealing with Travellers?  Is that part of it?  Many teachers are very well in tune but are there special training programmes for them to bring them up to speed on that?  The other big concern I have had for a long time is the percentage of people going on to leaving certificate level.  It is approximately 22%.  It is not far off that in my area and it is very worrying.  Do we envisage any better ways of increasing that?  You see people who are going to higher education like that.  Do we have programmes there to supply them with computers or otherwise?  Is there any extra help?  They would not use Zoom that much.  However, if they were to use it for education, can we do something like that, when it comes to higher education or trying to bring people on?  Maybe that would help.  St. Margaret's has the homework club and it is going well, because I have spoken to them several times.  That is an example of how well it is working.  It is often difficult to gauge the outcomes but, by all accounts, they are quite good.</p></speech>

This is very important work the Department is supporting.  A full-time education officer is assigned to the NCCA who is a Traveller and has been doing significant work in this area.  Broadly speaking, the initiative in the NCCA seeks to develop upon the audit, which was published by the NCCA in 2009, providing research and information on aspects of Traveller history and culture, gathering examples of practice and work from early years, primary and post-primary, that will support teachers in their work and also identifying resources and initiatives available to support teachers and practitioners.  The NCCA is not itself responsible for training but the work being done by it feeds into the professional development service for teachers, which informs the work that happens in the classroom.  The NCCA is also doing intercultural guidelines for schools.  These were previously published approximately 15 years ago, but will be updated in 2022, given the changes that have taken place in the interim.  That will also inform the continuing professional development for teachers.</p> <p>  There are a range of continuing professional development, CPD, initiatives, based on the concept of inclusive education, which have been introduced in recent years.  CPD in social, personal and health education, SPHE, at primary and post-primary is continuing and through this, teachers can address teaching children respect for and appreciation of human and cultural diversity through the SPHE curriculum, for example.  There will also be changes in initial teacher training.  I will defer to my colleague, Dr. Doody, on that.  I will also ask him to address the leaving certificate.</p> <p>  Higher education falls under the remit of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, but the underlying question is on ICT provision.  The Department supplies funding to schools, which in turn can provide supports to students.  Moreover, the Department will receive funding of &euro;50 million under the national recovery and resilience plan and the details of that scheme will be announced shortly.  There are ongoing efforts on that but the key piece is maintaining the links with schools, between the schools and the pupils.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#L00500"><p>Both Deputies have referred to the importance of homework clubs, which are key and integral elements of a young person's experience and should be as widely available as possible, as we know.  I have a personal preference.  We have significant experience of schools providing after-school clubs, rather than just the homework club, where the homework is attended to.  Some of the best examples of provision I have seen in schools, especially in the DEIS context, are where the provision is categorised as after school.  Yes, there is a homework element to it and it is critically important the young person gets that advanced leg-up in completing the homework.  However, there are also great opportunities for other elements of a broader learning experience to be provided.  We have seen schools where computer programming was provided in the context of an after-school club.  Sport and recreation elements, arts activities and a whole range of things like that are critically important for all learners and especially for Traveller and Roma students.</p><p> One of the best examples I came across had an unintended consequence, which is important to reference.  The school delivered an after-school club that ran until 5.15 p.m., and the unintended consequence of that among the parent body was that for the first time some of the parents, and the mothers in particular, felt empowered and enabled to go out and seek employment.  When I met a group of parents from that school, they said that this after-school provision that was made available to their children had enabled them to go out and get jobs.  In that community, they might be the first in several generations to get employment.  That was a very important element of provision in that school which was working well.  The homework club is important in and of itself, but it is part of a much broader package of supports for young people and there are possibilities that can be expanded in that set-up.</p><p> I have been involved with Youthreach since our very first involvement in 2005.  The learner in Youthreach has changed considerably in many respects in that intervening period.  In 2005, which was the very first time the inspectorate visited Youthreach settings for inspection purposes, we came across young people who had been excluded from school.  There is no other way of dressing it up.  In crude terms, they had been kicked out of school.  Youthreach was a very good safety net for them and remains so for many young people today.  However, what we have now is a lot of young people who are opting in to Youthreach.  In other words, they seek it out.  They face challenges in navigating their way through the post-primary system and, as Ms Cregg said, the challenge facing schools and the Department is to ensure that the capacity of all teachers and schools at post-primary level is maximised such that all learners experience an inclusive education experience.</p><p> On training for teachers, there are 350 teachers seconded to the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST.  The latter is the body that is charged with delivering supports and training for teachers and it does it on a range of fronts and areas, at primary and post-primary levels.  As new programmes and training are developed, the teachers can avail of a range of supports in that regard.  It is not limited just to the PDST.  One of the most significant education reforms in many years, as we are probably all aware, is the junior cycle.  The junior cycle reforms, which have taken place and which are now being embedded in schools, are supported by the junior cycle for teachers support service.  That is separate to the PDST but it is very specific to supporting post-primary teachers who operate at junior cycle level to embed the key skills of the junior cycle programme.</p><p> As the committee is probably also aware, senior cycle reform is a live issue in the Department of Education and for the Minister.  It will seek to build on the revised approaches to learning in the first instance that arise in the junior cycle.  The junior cycle places the student at the centre of learning and therefore removes the extent of the emphasis that has been heretofore placed on the terminal exam.  It is about new ways of working and facilitating the development of those keys skills around managing yourself, managing communications and being literate, numerate and so on.  Nobody knows at this point when exactly the senior cycle reform will be a live issue in our school system.  There is a lot of work being undertaken at the moment to support senior cycle reform internally in the Department.  My sense is that it will seek to build on the junior cycle reforms that are in place.</p></speech>

Ms Cregg stated that 90% of Travellers progress to third year in post-primary schools but the number who actually do the junior certificate is under 70%.  My understanding is that students do their junior certificate after three years.  This means that between going into third year of secondary school and actually completing it, we are losing 20%.  Then percentage sitting the leaving certificate is 22%, which is down another 48%.  My question is twofold.  First, can the witness confirm that those figures are correct?  Does the percentage drop to 22%, from 68% or 70% and 90% in under four years?  The second part of that question is about how that compares with the settled community or society at large.  What retention rates from junior certificate to leaving certificate have we got in that regard?</p> <p>  Ms Cregg also mentioned the additional allocation of &euro;18 million to DEIS schools in 2022 and &euro;32 million in 2023.  However, that is not really Traveller-specific.  Have we any measure of how much of that funding actually goes to Travellers, or is it just a global figure?  There were cutbacks in Traveller-specific education provision back in 2011 and 2012.  Does the Department have any idea how much money was there in that period?  There was a specific allocation that disappeared out of the education system.</p> <p>  Some &euro;500,000 has been provided by the dormant accounts fund to oversee projects tackling educational disadvantage for Travellers and Roma.  Exactly how will that &euro;500,000 be used to tackle that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.718" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Cregg" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#M00700"><p>There is a lot in that.  I will try to address all the Vice Chairman's questions but forgive me if I miss something along the way.  On the statistics, the figure of 68% to 70% retention to junior certificate is correct.  Enrolment in third year is in or around 90% but not all of those children will progress to do their junior certificate.  However, many of these children do progress and there has been an increase in progression over the years to both fifth year and sixth year.  For example, of those who entered secondary school in 2015, around 65% of boys and 69% of girls progressed to fifth year.  The progression rates to sixth year, although well below the national levels, have increased over the time.  Of those children who entered school in 2014, 30% of boys progressed to sixth year, relative to 24% in 2010, and 50% of girls progressed to sixth year, relative to 42% in 2010.  There has been an increase in progression over that four-year period.  However, the retention level to leaving certificate of 22% is significantly less than the overall national average, which would be approximately 91.5%.</p><p>It is important to look at the increases that are there albeit that they are small but there are positive improvements.  Obviously, there is a lot more work to do in that regard.  </p><p> A question was asked about the dormant accounts funding, which is relevant in that context.  A figure of &euro;500,000 has been allocated to the Department of Education.  It is intended that &euro;100,000 of that will be for transition supports to be provided by Tusla education support services in that high-risk area of the transition between junior and senior cycle and that &euro;400,000 will go to local community engagement projects building on what we have seen to date as building those relationships.  The actual determinants of that scheme will be published in due course.  That is the breakdown of the &euro;500,000.  That is not to say that &euro;500,000 is the only investment from the Department of Education in education supports for Travellers.</p></speech>

The &euro;150 million of expenditure on DEIS across 884 schools will increase &euro;180 million.  This will enable the expansion of DEIS to additional schools.  Some work is being done regarding the model and the communication of the model but what we have tried to do is examine, and this was outlined as part of the original DEIS plan, how we identify those students who are most at risk.  What we are trying to do with DEIS is to make sure that where there are high concentrations of students from backgrounds of educational disadvantage, we encompass them within the DEIS model.  Since we record Traveller ethnicity in schools, we will, in time, be able to show how much of the DEIS funding and how the DEIS model are targeting Traveller students.  We know that at the moment, about 50% of Travellers attend DEIS schools.  We would be able to specify that but the DEIS model involves looking at where there are high concentrations of people within an individual school.</p> <p>  A reference was made to 2011 and changes in the way resources were allocated within the Department.  There were changes in how resources were allocated so resources were subsumed into the overall mainstream allocation along with the changes to segregated Traveller education overall.  Since 2011, there have been significant increases in the assistance put in place within the system.  In September 2021, 17,846 special needs assistant posts were in place with an additional 158 provided by the end of December 2021.  This will result in over 18,000 special needs assistants.  Details of &euro;9.2 billion in funding were announced in budget 2022.  This represents an increase of 81% in the number of special needs assistants provided since 2011 when there were only 10,575 in the system.</p> <p>  Budget 2022 also provided for an additional 145 special education teachers, bringing total provision to 13,765.  This represents an overall increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated since 2011 at a time when there were only 9,740 teachers in the system.  An additional 980 posts are provided for in budget 2022, of which 620 will provide additional support for children in mainstream schools.</p> <p>  It is important to look at this in the context of how supports were allocated within the system.  Rather than taking things away, we have incorporated the supports that were available within the system into the mainstream system.  We have also allowed schools the flexibility and autonomy regarding special education teachers to designate those teachers to those students deemed to need the support most.  I will allow Mr. Doody to expand on that.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021111800002#N00400"><p>I am long enough in the Department to remember when we had 350 special needs assistants in our entire system and there was a feeling we might need 500.  Next year, we will have 19,000 so there has been an enormous increase in the resource.</p> <p>  From the inspectorate's perspective, when we go into schools, what we want to see schools doing is applying the key principles underpinning the allocation model for special education resources.  There are two principles that trump all others.  The first is working towards meeting an identified need.  We have moved away from labelling on the special education side of the house.  Up to 2017, one needed to have a label to get any additional support or resource in a school.  That was felt to be the wrong way to approach things.  Therefore, the allocation model in 2017 changed completely to ensure that schools were given the resources based on a profile that would enable them to meet the needs of the children who most need support.  It is about focusing on the identified need of the student.</p> <p>  The second requirement is key to all provision in school.  The child with the greatest level of need should get the greatest level of support.  That is the key principle underpinning the special education teacher allocation model.  I should clarify that we are talking about children with special and additional needs.  We are not just talking about children with a visual impairment or autism.  The resource that is available to assist the school in meeting the broad range of needs but also the needs of children who have bobbed to the surface in terms of their needs and the presentation of those needs.</p> <p>  The Covid learning and support scheme, CLASS, is an additional measure put into the system.  It recognises that at the moment, there are children who may not previously have needed additional support and may have been just fine in terms of their engagement with learning, teachers and their peers but who, arising from their experiences of Covid. require additional support.  We have put considerable additional resources into the schools such that they can work towards meeting the needs of children who might not have previously needed those additional supports or where a higher level of need is evident.</p> <p>  The principles that underpin the set allocation underpin the class programme as well.  All of the additional programmes we put out into the system over the past 18 months to assist students with additional needs have been underpinned by those key principles.  It is based on autonomy and the Department recognising that schools are better placed than we are to provide help tailored to their own context and student body.  We have provided the resource and support and put a significant amount of work into giving guidance in the form of documents to support teaching and learning for children with special educational needs and guidance for children who are most at risk of educational disadvantage.  We have put specific guidance into the system for young people attending Youthreach settings.  The same principles underpin all of those.  A school or centre of education needs to have a mechanism in place that will readily identify those young people with the greatest level of need and the resource should follow that particular need.</p></speech>

If islanders or Gaeltacht people, who are distinct communities, had that rate of disadvantage, we would focus specific extra funding in those areas.  What we are talking about here is something that is available to everybody according to his or her need, which we all agree with, but we know there is a community that because of social attitudes, etc., needs extra help.  I was around the system in 2010.  I was not there in 2011 or 2012 as I was a backbencher.  My memory was that we were cutting back at that time and the money was taken.</p><p>How much in extra resources was subsumed into the system, or disappeared, which was my memory of it?  We were all cutting back at that stage.  How much did that cost?  It is not that we should have continued with what it was being used for then, but I am just curious about how much money was specifically for this community, which seems to be at a massive educational disadvantage compared with all of the communities in Ireland.</p></speech>

It does not include those who take the leaving certificate in other settings.  For example, we have seen an increasing trend of students in Youthreach.  In 2013, there were 109 students in Youthreach compared to 28 who entered in 2010.  It is important to reference that the 22% figure is for the completion of the leaving certificate within the mainstream education system.  I can come back to the Vice Chairman with specifics on the supports, but there is a Traveller-specific capitation, which is an enhanced capitation for Travellers that still exists within the system at a cost of more than &euro;1 million.  This continues to exist post 2011.  Prior to 2011, there were resource teachers for Travellers in certain schools, but Travellers were not counted when we were looking at how we allocated teachers within DEIS schools.  We were looking at the Traveller pupil within the DEIS school, but allocating resources based on the number of Travellers.  Those Travellers are now counted as part of the pupil contingent within DEIS schools and those resources are still allocated through the DEIS programme.  I can come back to the Vice Chairman with the figures.</p></speech>

At some of these clubs the children get food also when they go there, they have fun and they learn beyond the curriculum and their homework.  I fully endorse what he said and I support that kind of activity, which is brilliant.  There is an add-on that parents are able to go to work because they do not have to mind children, and this is a bonus.  I say well done on that and anything we can do to support that initiative should be done.  I thank Mr. Doody for clarifying and expanding on it.</p> <p>  Will Ms Cregg comment on the NTRIS and the various actions and responses of the Department?  I understand that some actions are for the Department Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  Can I assume that they are all covered at this stage?  I am especially interested in two actions, one of which relates to anti-bullying, which I believe is No. 18, and the other is the Traveller education strategy, which was to be reviewed and some work was to be done on that way back in 2017.  Perhaps she can outline where both of those are at.</p> <p>  Can Ms she also give us any indication about the transition from primary education to second level education?  Is there any dropout at that stage?  There may not be, but it would just be interesting to know.</p> <p>  She mentioned the numbers who go on to Youthreach, further education, and apprenticeships after doing the junior certificate, and I thank her for that.  Is there a tracking mechanism in place specifically for Travellers so that they do not end up doing nothing, which would be a big concern of ours if they were?</p></speech>

The Department commissioned research from the anti-bullying centre in DCU, which examined the effectiveness of the Department's anti-bullying procedures for Traveller students.  That research is being finalised for publication.  It does not reflect the prevalence of bullying within the system.  There were only a small number of Travellers who responded to say that they had experienced bullying within the school system.  The findings also indicate the experience of how schools reacted to it, both positive and negative.  That research is being finalised for publication.  One of the key aspects that came through from it, which reflects the data and the statistics, is that Traveller children and their parents generally reported a positive experience in primary school but more difficulties as teenagers went through post-primary.  This is not unexpected.<br/><br/>On anti-bullying measures, the Department is commencing a review of its anti-bullying action plan from 2013.  This review will take account of developments and relevant research, including the baseline research from a NTRIS pilot.  It will also take into account research that has been done by DCU.  A lot of time has passed since 2013.  The review will also give detailed consideration to recommendations contained within the Oireachtas joint committee report on school bullying.  This will involve consultation and collaboration, including with various representative groups.  The Department's inspectorate is currently prioritising the monitoring and gathering of information about the implementation of anti-bullying measures in schools, which complements this work.  This will help with the overall piece of promoting a positive school culture and climate. <br/><br/>On the Traveller further education strategy, I believe that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, referred to this in his earlier engagement with committee.  We will work with the Departments of Children and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.<b></b>The original report and recommendations for a Traveller education strategy were put together in 2006.  We are completing a review of what has happened in the interim.  This will inform what we will look at, in conjunction with the feedback from the Traveller representative groups and in the context of where we are at right now.  There are gaps still.  We know that 22% making it to leaving certificate level in mainstream schools is simply not in line with what happens with the rest of the population.  We must look to see what are the issues that need to be addressed and targeted, in a systemic way, to ensure those completion rates are improved.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked about the primary to post-primary transition rate.  The Departments retention reports look at those children who entered into post-primary and then made it to the leaving certificate.  There is no composite report on primary to post-primary rates.  The primary online database and the post-primary online databases, POD and P-POD, were introduced around 2016.  Prior to that, Traveller education statistics were gathered in an aggregated fashion and, therefore, it is not possible to track.  Certainly, as part of the work we will engage on as part of the overall NTRIS, we will look at the need for disaggregated data.  We now have Traveller ethnicity as a self-identifier within the primary and post-primary online databases, so the facility is there now to look more closely at what we can do with the data we have.  Interestingly, we are aware from a NTRIS pilot that a lot of the students do not self-identify as Travellers.  That is something that we would want to examine to ensure that Traveller students are proud, and we would want to investigate the reasons behind involuntary self-identification.  We are not forcing anybody to identify as a Traveller but we would like to reach a stage where people felt they would be proud and willing to self-identify as a Traveller within the system.<br/><br/>The primary to post-primary transition piece is something that we can look at.  From previous data I am aware that the transition rate had increased steadily.  It had been quite poor at one stage but it had increased, from figures in previous submissions to previous Oireachtas committees.  At the moment we do not have a retention report.  That is certainly something, in the context of disaggregated data, that we can look at.</p></speech>

The committee may be aware that we have an inspection model of DEIS provision in schools.</p><p>One of the DEIS themes is transitions and so on.  One of the common experiences perhaps ten or 15 years ago was to ask schools about how many of their pupils had progressed to post-primary level, for example.  Typically, the primary school principal would say that they had all transferred and progressed.  One would not just tick the box, but it would be at that level.</p><p> We now have a far more nuanced understanding of transitions and we are very keen to push the notions of schools building on learning as an essential element of an effective transition.  In the past, where one had the primary school being supported in the transition phase to go up to look at the science labs and whatever in the post-primary school, we are now pushing schools towards the concept of where that was fine, necessary and important, but it is more about how would one support, for example, the English or maths subject teachers to build on the learning that has occurred for primary school students.</p><p> In some of our programmes, the school excellence fund-DEIS programme, for instance, we have good examples of cross-sectoral learning becoming embedded in schools.  I can think of one example where a primary and a post-primary school have developed a cross-sectoral approach to the development of mathematical skills.  This should, in turn, support more effective transitions.</p><p> With specific reference to Traveller and Roma students, I highlight the fact that we held a transitions seminar for teachers earlier on this year.  Ms Cregg might agree with me on this.  It was the most positively received continuous professional development training engagement I have come across in my time in the Department and there were 700 teachers in attendance.  The overwhelming response to the seminar was very positive, partly because we had Traveller and Roma students telling their stories around engagement with learning and the critical importance of the one good person.  This is not to say that the rest of those in the schools were not good people, but this referred to the one good person who latched onto and identified their ability, supported them and so on as they made those transitions.  It is pretty important that we have that more nuanced understanding.</p><p> Very briefly on bullying, Ms Cregg referred to the fact that the inspectorate is focusing on the issue of bullying between September and Christmas as we conduct a series of incidental inspections.  It is also important to note that the chief inspector has been very keen - this will happen from January onwards - on whole-school-type evaluations.  These involve whole-school evaluations, DEIS inspections, etc.  There will be a clear statement as to a school's work in supporting anti-bullying measures in the school.  We have questions on existing surveys of parents and of students themselves around bullying in the schools.</p></speech>

Today's meeting is about obtaining an overview of the role of the Irish Coast Guard.  Our purpose is to engage with representatives from the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard to discuss this role.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome from the Department of Transport, Ms Deirdre O&rsquo;Keeffe, assistant secretary, Mr. Liam Keogh, principal officer, and Mr. Phil O&rsquo;Flaherty, principal officer; and from the Irish Coast Guard, Mr. Eugene Clonan, acting director, and Mr. Niall Ferns, manager.  Our guests are welcome and I thank them for accepting our invitation at such short notice.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely, outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Members and witnesses have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  If attending in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect yourself and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I strongly advise the practice of good hand hygiene and to leave at least one vacant seat between you and others attending.  You should also always maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting.  Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting except when speaking.</p> <p>  I call Ms O'Keeffe to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

Let me begin by introducing the team here today.  My name is Deirdre O&rsquo;Keeffe and I am the assistant secretary with responsibility for maritime transport in the Department of Transport.  I am accompanied this morning by Mr. Eugene Clonan, who is acting as director of the Coast Guard, by Mr. Niall Ferns, who is a manager in the Coast Guard, and by Mr. Liam Keogh and Mr. Phil O&rsquo;Flaherty, who are principal officers in the Department, with responsibilities in the area generally.</p> <p>  I will make a brief opening statement to explain how the Coast Guard fits within the Department of Transport and the national search and rescue system generally.  Mr. Clonan will then make an opening statement providing an overview of the Irish Coast Guard, as requested in the meeting invitation.  </p> <p>  I will begin with how the Irish Coast Guard fits within the Department of Transport.  The Coast Guard is a division of the Irish Maritime Directorate, which comprises all the parts of the Department that deal with maritime transport.  Our mission is a safe, sustainable maritime transport sector which will facilitate maritime transport services and the safe use of the maritime environment, meet our international obligations and domestic needs, deliver a world-class emergency response service and promote and protect Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests as an island nation.  A key element of this is an effective maritime emergency response across the three areas of search and rescue, maritime casualty and pollution response.  Mr. Clonan will go into more detail on each of these areas in his opening statement. </p> <p>  In July 2019, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport published a new national search and rescue plan aimed at placing Ireland at the forefront of international best practice in the area of search and rescue.  The general aim of the plan is to make our search and rescue services better and safer for all those involved.  As part of this work, a new National Search and Rescue Committee was established to provide strategic co-ordination, guidance and leadership for search and rescue in Ireland.  A key aim was the rebalancing of the previous maritime-centric search and rescue framework to encompass land and air search and rescue more comprehensively. </p> <p>  The Irish Coast Guard operates within the general framework set by the national search and rescue plan and is a key participant in the deliberations of the National Search and Rescue Committee.  The Irish Coast Guard has been engaged in a considerable programme of change over recent years.  This programme, which is continuing, is designed to provide a safer and more effective search and rescue service to all concerned, both those members of the public who may benefit from the service from time to time, and the members of the Coast Guard organisation, whether full-time employees or volunteers, who are involved in providing the service.  While the programme will provide a better and safer service for all concerned as it rolls out, the roll-out of the programme itself, like any organisational change programme, provides some challenges, both for those involved in rolling it out and those affected by it.  </p> <p>  In recent weeks, members will have heard of disharmony among some volunteers in one of the Coast Guard volunteer units on the Irish coast.  We would like to reassure members that the Coast Guard, both head office staff and local management in the area, have been working tirelessly to address the problems experienced in this unit and will continue to do so, with a view to restoring the service in the area as quickly as possible.  Members will be aware that Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton undertook to provide further mediation in this regard on an urgent basis, and indeed the mediator, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, has already been appointed.  Plans are in hand for his meetings with the volunteers early next week.  </p> <p>  It is also worth pointing out that the 900 or so Coast Guard volunteers around the Irish coast, who do heroic voluntary work on behalf of the Irish people, have several channels available to them to make their views, positive or negative, known to their local volunteer management or to management generally.  This is because their views from the ground are extremely important to inform decisions and developments in the area.  In particular, the volunteer representative organization, the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, represents all 900 volunteers through a committee including both elected volunteers and their local management.  This group, which has been in place for some 20 years, was reviewed at the request of the volunteers in recent years to be even more responsive to the concerns and suggestions of volunteers.</p> <p>  The Coast Guard is a significant buyer of products and services.  For this reason, a review of the Coast Guard procurement process, as part of the organisational change programme, has been under way for some time.  This review has identified some shortcomings in the Coast Guard&rsquo;s procurement processes and actions have been taken, particularly in the areas of staffing, training and new protocols over recent years, to address these.  There are also a number of legacy issues which we have been tackling and will continue to tackle over the coming months to ensure that any gaps or deficiencies are identified, rectified and, where necessary, dealt with.  Our aim is to ensure that all procurements are conducted in accordance with all legal and administrative arrangements to ensure that the correct procedures are followed.  Our monitoring, compliance, awareness and education frameworks are being improved as we seek to ensure that the smallest procurements are treated with the same rigour, thoroughness and attention to detail as the largest procurements. </p> <p>  I would also like to take the opportunity to mention the final report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, into the Rescue 116 air accident, which was published recently.  Once again, I want to extend the Department&rsquo;s heartfelt sympathy to the families of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick, Captain Mark Duffy, Mr. Ciaran Smith and Mr. Paul Ormsby, who were close working colleagues of many members of the Irish Coast Guard.  The Minister has already confirmed that the Department fully accepts the recommendations contained in the report.  Given the size and complexity of the report, the Department will require some time to fully examine in detail the report&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.  However, it will respond to the chief inspector of air accidents in respect of each safety recommendation addressed to the Minister in advance of the deadlines set.  </p> <p>  I conclude my opening statement and will pass to Mr. Eugene Clonan, who is acting as director of the Irish Coast Guard, to present his opening statement. </p></speech>

This is an excellent opportunity to engage with the committee on what we do, the work programme ahead of us and the challenges we face as Ireland&rsquo;s search and rescue, ship casualty and pollution response service.  Before taking questions from members, I would like to take a few minutes to set out the international context of our work, the overview of our remit, our organisation and the challenges we face.</p> <p>  The International Convention for the Safety Of Life At Sea, SOLAS, relating to search and rescue services, provides that each contracting government undertakes to ensure that necessary arrangements are made for distress communication and co-ordination in its area of responsibility and for the rescue of persons in distress at sea around its coasts.  The Coast Guard's role is to discharge Ireland's search and rescue, SAR, obligations by implementing the national SAR plan and the national oil spill contingency plan for all incidents occurring in the maritime domain, or as otherwise requested by SAR authorities in other domains, such as on land, in the air or indeed at our next door neighbours in the UK.  Under the framework for emergency management, the Coast Guard is nominated as one of the State's principal emergency services, along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the fire service and the ambulance service.  The framework assigns the Coast Guard responsibility for co-ordinating the response to marine incident outside port limits, except in the case of search and rescue, when all marine areas including ports are under its remit.  </p> <p>  On marine pollution, we have a suite of legislation, the Sea Pollution Acts 1991 to 2006, under which the Minister for Transport has appointed officers of the Coast Guard as authorised officers to enable them to carry out their duties in cases of maritime casualties to prevent or minimise damage from pollution where these casualties pose a threat of major harm to the coastline and related interests. The Sea Pollution Act also implements the framework for the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation. OPRC, which establishes measures for dealing with marine pollution incidents nationally and in co-operation with other countries.</p><p>The Sea Pollution Act requires a national oil spill contingency plan, along with county council and port authority contingency plans, in accordance with the regime set out in the International Convention on Oil Pollution Prepardness, Response and Co-operation, OPRC.  This includes risk assessments exercising.  Additionally, European Communities (Vessel Traffic Monitoring and Information System) Regulations 2010, gives the Coast Guard powers to act in maritime casualties and ships requesting a place of refuge.  The Coast Guard also provides a maritime assistance service to vessels at sea in need of assistance.  <br/><br/>I will talk about where we are today.  The organisation stands at approximately 82 full-time staff at five locations around the country and approximately 900 Coast Guard volunteers at 44 locations, all of whom are working together to save lives at sea and protect the marine environment from maritime casualties.  Earlier this year, the Coast Guard intervened in a number of marine casualties, most notably the <i>MV Lilly B </i>off Hook Head.  In 2020, the Coast Guard responded to 2,600 incidents.  <br/><br/>The Coast Guard attaches particular attention to what it categorises as lives saved, which means assistance provided that prevented a loss of life, severe risk to life or protracted hospitalisation.  In 2020, the Coast Guard recorded that 391 individuals were categorised as lives saved.  In quarter three of this year, the Coast Guard responded to 1,089 incidents and saved 121 lives.  <br/><br/>Actions included co-ordinating incidents in the search and rescue co-ordination centres at Dublin, Valentia and Malin, deploying on scene; rescuing persons in distress; training and exercising with other principal emergency services; managing and supporting the Coast Guard volunteer units; maintaining the marine radio infrastructure; procurement and management of stores and services; providing assistance to other mariners and the public; supporting the Department's work to keep essential goods moving; and supporting the HSE during the pandemic.<br/><br/>In performing our responsibilities, we provide a variety of services.  We provide the marine radio distress listening service; we co-ordinate search and rescue, SAR; we monitor maritime traffic within the traffic separation schemes off Tuskar and Fastnet lighthouses; we provide a marine assistance service; we monitor the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ, for ship casualties; we provide a national marine radio network for sending out safety messages and navigation warnings; we operate the automatic identification system with transponders for aircrafts that are accepted for ships; and we provide support on request to statutory agencies, bodies and emergency services.  <br/><br/>To carry out these functions, the Coast Guard is organised into four sections.  I will start with Coast Guard operations.  We have three rescue co-ordination centres, RCCs. which are based at Dublin, Valentia and Malin Head.  These centres are responsible for listening to the stress frequencies, responding to 999 calls and for search and rescue co-ordination.  They provide maritime safety broadcasts such as weather and navigation warnings, respond to ship casualty operations and investigate pollution reports.  The current staffing complement of operations are 57 staff members, which includes 51 members to maintain a 24-7 watch coverage at these three centres.  Although there are 57 staff members, at each of these three centres there are three people on watch 24-7; it takes that number of staff to maintain that standard of manning.  <br/><br/>To respond to the marine incidents on the coast, the RCCs have a number of resources to call upon, including the Coast Guard rescue helicopters.  Coast Guard helicopter services are provided under contract by the company CHC Ireland, operating a fleet of Sikorsky S-92 helicopters out of four bases in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford and Sligo.  Helicopter services are on 15 minutes' notice by day and 45 minutes' notice by night.  In 2020, they were called out 781 times.  In quarter three of this year, which was a busy period for us, there were 315 missions, of which 137 were search and rescue in the maritime area and 55 were medical evacuations from offshore islands.  With search and rescue inland, we responded with assistance from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 78 occasions.  We also assisted the National Ambulance Service on 19 occasions. <br/><br/>Another service we can call upon to assist us in search and rescue is the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, RNLI.  The RNLI is categorised as a declared resource to the Coast Guard which means that each individual station can be directly requested to respond to individual incidents.  The RNLI maintains 38 lifeboats on the island of Ireland and is manned by volunteers.  In 2020, we called it out 783 times.<br/><br/>We have 44 Coast Guard units around the coast, and in 2020 we called on them 1,270 times.  Their basic function is search on the coast, and some of them have a boat rescue function, a cliff function and they have unmanned aerial vehicles, UAV, that is, drones, for aerial searches.  <br/><br/>The Coast Guard units and supports section is responsible for the management, resourcing and training of the volunteer Coast Guard units.  The volunteer units provide local maritime emergency response.  There are 44 Coast Guard units around the coast, made up solely of volunteers from the local communities.  There are approximately 900 volunteers in all.  The Coast Guard units provide a coastal search capability on the shore.  In addition to the coastal search, some units are trained to provide cliff rescue, boat rescue and also UAV search capability, as I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>The Coast Guard units are also available to enhance community resilience during emergencies such as Storms Emma or Ophelia, in supporting the principal response or principal emergency services.  The volunteer units are managed by the Coast Guard units and supports section, which includes six staff on the coast managing the volunteer units directly and four staff in Dublin, supported by a further seven staff from the maritime strategy and governance division in the Department.  Each Coast Guard volunteer unit is composed of a volunteer officer in charge, OIC, deputy OIC, training officer, equipment officer, administration officer and education officer.  That is how they are organised.  The complement of each unit ranges from 12 to 25 volunteers, depending on their range function.  <br/><br/>The engineering and logistics section manages the radio communications infrastructure in the communication centres and also the radio aerial infrastructure around the coast to maintain marine VHF and HF coverage in the search and rescue region.  VHF channel 16 and HF frequencies are used for distress listening and calling and working channels; that is what the radio network is for.  The engineering section also manages the Coast Guard stores in Blanchardstown.  There are nine staff employed in this area with another two staff in the pipeline.  <br/><br/>The Coast Guard safety, quality and compliance section's responsibility is to integrate all Coast Guard processes into a single management system, thereafter called the quality management system, QMS. Once established, it will ensure the Coast Guard operates in compliance with each QMS component.  Doing so aids in ensuring operational consistency and provides Coast Guard stakeholders and those at the receiving end of SAR services assurance that the organisation is being managed in accordance with best practice in both safety and service delivery.  <br/><br/>The Coast Guard's success depends largely on the goodwill of volunteers from the RNLI and from its own Coast Guard volunteers to give of their time and become professional responders in maritime lifesaving situations.  In return, the Coast Guard provides its volunteers excellent training and equipment to carry out that task.  <br/><br/>Recent tragic accidents have been difficult for the organisation.  We mourn the loss of close and valued colleagues and friends.  I would like to take this opportunity to extend again our sympathy to the families of Rescue 116 and to Mr. Bernard Lucas and family.  We are also compelled to honour their memories by delivering a world class search and rescue, maritime casualty and pollution response services.  <br/><br/>I hope this provided a quick overview of who we are and what we are about.  I am more than happy to take questions from the committee. </p></speech>

I understand that is an option afforded to the witnesses, but a lot of what we will hear about today is about the geographic, and indeed, the operational disconnect that people feel there is with the Irish Coast Guard.</p><p>The Irish Coast Guard is headquartered on Leeson Lane, Dublin 2.  That is a long way from Doolin, Kilkee, Valentia and the various other Coast Guard stations, and therein lies one of the problems.  There is a disconnect.  It would be far more helpful if the witnesses had been here this morning.  In this very room yesterday, we had representatives from the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society sitting here.  Given that Leinster House is located only around the corner from the headquarters of the Irish Coast Guard, it would have been significant if the witnesses had appeared in person.</p><p> One of the main matters I wish to focus on this morning relates to the Doolin Coast Guard station, which, regrettably, is closed at the moment.  There are two issues at hand, in respect of one of which we are hopefully on a pathway towards some resolution.  I refer to the internal personnel and HR issues.  I was delighted to see Kieran Mulvey appointed as mediator.  Several of the members here would have been looking for that.  Last week, I met with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  I am glad to hear that mediation will begin on Monday next at 6 p.m.  I encourage all volunteers who are active or have left to engage with the process.  Mr. Mulvey is skilled and competent and he has a track record of unlocking very difficult impasse situations.  I hope that he can made inroads on that issue.</p><p> There is another personnel issue, not just within the station but also between it and headquarters in Dublin.  I want to address that for a moment.  Recently, the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association, ICGVRA, was established.  It is headed up by a man named John O'Mahony with whom I have been in regular contact over the past few days.  This organisation has been set up for many reasons.  One of those reasons is that "Irish Coast Guard members are afraid to raise issues in coast guard units, or with management, for fear of retribution by way of disciplinary action".  That is very worrying.  Much of the media focus and public discourse has focused on what could be an internal problem at Doolin Coast Guard station, which, I believe, will be ironed out.  However, the quote I just read into the record signifies that there are far deeper problems and that these run on a vertical axis from headquarters right down not just to Doolin station but to all the spokes of the wheel, namely, all stations.  I have heard repeatedly over the past week that there are not just problems in Doolin, rather, there are problems in each Coast Guard station.</p><p> There are two things I wish to hear from Ms O'Keeffe and her team this morning.  First, will she immediately recognise and engage with the ICGVRA?  The latter has levelled some serious allegations and concerns.  We need to recognise that organisation, bring it into the fold and engage with it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has agreed to meet with individuals, but I am of the view that this representative organisation needs to be recognised today and met as a matter or urgency.  From what I have been hearing over the past week - and this is not personal, this is the organisation we are talking about - there appears to be some form of organisational rot at play.  I propose to the committee that there be an independent and urgent inquiry into how that vertical axis from Irish Coast Guard management down to stations works, and that we also look at the failures of the Department of Transport.  There are a number of background contexts to this, namely: the Rescue 116 report, which we debated in the D&aacute;il Chamber last night; there is the issue relating to Doolin; and there are issues at Coast Guard stations throughout the country.  The committee needs to agree to seek an independent inquiry into these issues and how the organisation functions.</p><p> Ms O'Keeffe referred to measures the Irish Coast Guard is taking to transform the structures and the stations throughout the country.  She stated: "While the programme will provide a better and safer service for all concerned as it rolls out, the roll-out of the programme itself, like any organisational change programme, provides some challenges, both for those involved in rolling it out and those affected by it."  I wish to highlight a few ways that this is manifesting itself at local level.  In Doolin station, there have been resignations in the past three weeks.  Those involved are not people who took resigning lightly.  They are highly valued, highly skilled individually.  Collectively, there is more than 170 years of experience at that station.  Some of the competencies they have always fulfilled have been diluted in recent weeks.  Some of them are now scratching their heads wondering what is the point of the unit existing and what is the point of serving there in light of some of the competencies that headquarters has taken from them.  They can no longer use the reinforced steel girder in their station that they previously used for climbing training.  They used to attach ropes to it and use it as a climbing and descending mechanism.  They can no longer use a bolting system when they climb in the Burren.  That has also been taken from them.  Some part of the Cliffs of Moher are out of bounds - and I could not believe this when I heard it a week ago - they cannot go near them.  They can no longer scale cliff sections while tethered to the rescue jeep.  Most alarmingly, the Kilkee lifeboat cannot launch beyond the bay area.  This appears to be on foot of a decision taken by the Irish Coast Guard directly in response to the tragic death of Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas in 2016.  That manifested itself locally last summer when two young people who went out swimming went missing in the water and the Coast Guard unit could not leave the bay area.  It fell to local fishermen and boaters to go out beyond the bay area in their vessels to look for them.  That is ineptitude, not on the part of the volunteers but on the part of the management, which took these competencies and skills that the volunteers have been able to fulfil-----</p></speech>

The volunteers there live locally and have a response time of minutes.  The other stakeholders who now provide cover are too far away.  Kilkee coast guard unit is 55 km away, Ennistymon fire brigade is 18 km away and the Civil Defence in Ennis is 32 km away.  Most worryingly of all, the Aran Islands lifeboat which, operating in average sea conditions, takes a full hour to launch and be at sea.  The Doolin launch time is approximately 15 minutes.  The 12 volunteers who remain at Doolin are highly skilled.  There are many competencies they can still fulfil.  I ask that, in the interests of public safety, the station be reopened as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

This has been in place for 20 years or so, but in 2018, at the request of Coast Guard volunteers, the terms of reference were reviewed to enable better representation for all the volunteers and the Irish Coast Guard.  There are elected members of the volunteer organisation on that committee now, as well as local management.  That organisation has been in place for some time.  As I understand it, the Minister of State's office has been in touch with the organisation the Deputy mentioned.  The Minister of State has renewed her commitment to keep in touch with all of the volunteers.</p> <p>  There are a range of other ways in which the volunteers can have their issues, whether positive or negative, reflected to local management and to management more generally in head office.  In response to something Deputy Crowe mentioned at the beginning of his intervention, I might ask Mr. Clonan to give some sense of how the organisation is organised at local level right around the coast because it is important to say that there is representation right around the coast.  The organisation has a range of procedures whereby Coast Guard volunteers can have their views, whether positive or negative, reflected to management, whether it is their local management or management more generally.  This is because we are concerned to ensure that any comments, whether positive or negative, are reflected and can be dealt with in the best possible way.</p> <p>  What was the second question?</p></speech>

In light of recent developments, for safety reasons, the team concerned had to be taken off the board.  This was done for very good safety reasons, for the volunteers and for the public they serve in a very selfless and heroic way.  This was a proportionate response having regard to the significant ongoing attempts by the Coast Guard to address the unfortunate differences that have existed in this particular unit for a number of years.  The action was taken to ensure the safety of the volunteers themselves.  It was also in compliance with search and rescue assurance obligations set out in the national search and rescue plan.</p> <p>  This does not mean a service is not available in the area.  All the other Coast Guard units, shoreline and cliff rescue services remain in place, along with the four search and rescue Coast Guard helicopters.  The RNLI, the community rescue boats and the Naval Service will continue to assist, particularly in those areas of greatest risk, until all the issues have been resolved.</p> <p>  I reiterate that with the appointment of the mediator, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, and with that work moving on quickly to the early part of next week, we hope those issues will be resolved.  The team will go back on the board when it is safe for the volunteers and the community they serve to do so.  We are working as hard as we can to ensure this happens as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I want to put that on record.  We have been working with them for the past 30 years and more.  The Coast Guard units on the coast have gone from strength to strength but functions have increased.  The basis of our operation is the  Coast Guard code, which sets out what we expect from volunteers and what volunteers expect from us.  Operating in the marine environment is hazardous, particularly in what we ask the volunteers to do.  We ask them to go out and rescue people who have got into distress.  To enable them to do that job we have a safety management system to keep them safe.  None of my people nor any volunteers are sent out to harm themselves.  The policies and procedures are in place to protect and keep them safe.  In all the training volunteers receive from search and manual handling to cliff work and bolt work, they have to complete a myriad of courses to acquire the qualities-----</p></speech>

I want to know why the climbing training facility at Doolin Coast Guard station and the use of the bolting system in the Burren are no longer available.  Volunteers can no longer descend cliffs for a long rope rescue, scale a cliff while tethered to a jeep or launch the Kilkee lifeboat beyond the bay area.  That amounts to a dilution of the duties.  What happens at the moment if someone stumbles on the footpath at Kilkee cliff is that any good Samaritan can help.  However, if someone has the misfortune to tumble over the edge of the cliff, nobody in the county, whether the Coast Guard or anyone else, has the competence to carry out a rescue because of the dilution of duties.</p></speech>

In regard to geographical restrictions on the boat in Kilkee, they have been removed for some time now.  The D-class vessel has been fully operational in Kilkee since August 2020 and the Delta RIB has been fully operational in Kilkee since July of this year.  In regard to access to certain parts of the cliffs around the Cliffs of Moher, we received a report approximately a year ago and we have been working with the stakeholders.  Concerns were raised about safety in particular zones around the Cliffs of Moher and we have been working through our safety, quality and compliance section, the county council and the local stakeholders to deal with that.  However, it is still deemed in appropriate for volunteers to go into parts of the cliffs.</p> <p>  As regards the steel girders, we have been working with the Office of Public Works to put in place a programme for servicing and inspecting the girders to allow people to train inside.  Volunteers' competencies have not been reduced as a result of this.  They are inspected annually through a log book where they are required to do eight exercises in cliff per annum, and that requirement remains in place still.  The bolting system is specific to approximately six or seven teams around the coast.  The limestone around the Cliffs of Moher and the Doolin area proves problematic in terms of driving stakes into the ground.  We have been working with Doolin Coast Guard on bringing in a new system and using the Doolin team as an initial team for it.  However, but part of the older system has now become obsolete.</p> <p>  The Coast Guard has never tethered to vehicles.  Our system is to tether through stakes or a bolt system.</p></speech>

The vehicle was kitted out for that purpose.  I conclude by thanking the witnesses.  There is something wrong when volunteers are resigning from an organisation.  The higher echelons are paid to manage it and, as I said earlier, the disconnect is very apparent.  The committee must seek an independent inquiry, with the Rescue 116 case in mind and also to address what is happening organisationally with the Irish Coast Guard.</p></speech>

We will take everything on board and consider it as a committee.</p></speech>

Much of what we want to elicit has already been addressed.  I ask Ms O'Keeffe or Mr. Clonan to try to characterise for us the relationship between them, as the central edifice of the Coast Guard, and the volunteers.  There are representative groupings and organisations.  Will they speak for a minute to how they characterise that relationship and where it is at rather how it should be?  There are issues in Doolin, which we know about them and are public.  Are there issues elsewhere?  What is their understanding, insofar as they have one, of the situation in Doolin and how it arrived at that position?  Accusations will be made by all sides when such a critical juncture is reached.  There are interpersonal and HR issues on the ground.  A mechanism is, hopefully, now in place but there were previous attempts to address the problem.</p><p>There is a negative view in the region that the Coast Guard did not move quickly enough to address these issues when they were raised and did not find an appropriate solution.  Notwithstanding having put in some level of mediation, it does not seem to have been adequate and appropriate.  The view is held strongly in the area that, while it was an indication that the process had failed, it should not have got to the standing down of the unit or taking it off board, and that the Department should have taken more appropriate action at an earlier stage for the obvious reason that the work that the volunteers on both sides of the divide here do is highly valued.  The people on all sides are highly valued.  The work that they do is highly valued.  They are skilled.  They are trained.  They give of their time for their community.  We need to understand the process that the Department deployed when these issues arose first, which is quite some time ago; why the process that the Department deployed was not robust enough to resolve the issue; and if Ms O'Keeffe has any thoughts or views on how the Department might improve were that issue to arise elsewhere.</p><p> I would like Ms O'Keeffe to be more clear, if she could, following on from my colleague's questioning, as to why the decision to stand down the unit was taken.  There is a recognition that 11 or 12 who are still there have skills and competencies - maybe not as extensive as what was there heretofore - that could still be deployed.  Ms O'Keeffe might answer those and I will save my couple of minutes for an intervention afterwards.</p></speech>

I need to be clear about this.  The volunteers are the backbone of the service that is delivered by the Irish Coast Guard around the Irish coast.  These are 900 or so people who give up their time selflessly to serve people who may find themselves in difficulties, by and large, in the sea or on the coast.</p></speech>

That is clear.  What efforts are made on an ongoing basis to engage with or to have some level of polling of how the volunteers see the Department?  We could all bring in volunteers we know who would take a different view as to how they feel they are treated.  What active methodology has the Department to ensure that they feel satisfied, comfortable and happy?  How does the Department measure that?  I know where the Department is coming from, but how would they see it?</p></speech>

Can I say that we are very concerned to make sure we engage fully with Coast Guards very often?  In particular, can I just mention that as part of the programme of organisational change that the Coast Guard is currently engaged in, the Coast Guard was awarded an accreditation by the Great Places to Work organisation.  Leading up to that, the Coast Guard undertook a survey of the volunteers as part of that.  The survey reported really high levels of satisfaction, trust and confidence in the management of the organisation - higher than for many similar organisations.</p> <p>  If the Senator will allow, I will now pass to Mr. Clonan who has much more detail of the process that goes on there.  Mr. Ferns may well have something to say at the end of that as well.</p></speech>

First of all, the volunteers, as the assistant secretary says, date back with the Coast Guard.  We have a very close relationship with the volunteers on the coast.  Each function has to be exercised.  For search function, it is once per month.  For cliff, boat and drone function, it is more irregular.  We have coastal unit sector managers on the coast who visit the teams regularly to assess how they are getting on in training and to assess the need and how they are getting on internally within the unit - talking to the officer in command, OIC, about the education and training.</p></speech>

I am interested in understanding how we arrived at that position.  I am not doing so to apportion blame but to try to understand if there are learnings from what happened so that it is not repeated elsewhere.</p> <p>  I want to understand the relationship and engagement between volunteers and the Irish Coast Guard.  How does the Coast Guard manage to maintain an understanding of where these volunteers are at?  How is that engagement worked out?</p> <p>  I also raise some wider issues on the size of the Irish Coast Guard versus a coast guard of a similar jurisdiction, with a similar land mass, similar seas to be covered, a similar population, etc.?  The witnesses spoke about numbers being around 83 permanent staff.  That seems a small number to me, although I appreciate that other agencies are involved.  Are we trying to operate on a shoestring?  Should we invest more and have much greater engagement with volunteers?  There are 900-odd volunteers, which is a large number.  Are we investing enough or are we stretching ourselves too thinly?  If so, does that lead to some of the issues that have arisen?</p></speech>

The three questions were to provide a summary of the Doolin issue, outline the relationship with volunteers and how we maintain it and describe the state of the Irish Coast Guard, if I can put it that way.</p> <p>  On the question on Doolin, I will first say that we have 44 teams and, in general, every team is working fine.  Our communications to the teams are managed by a coastal unit sector manager.  I believe I was at this point when communications broke down earlier.   The sector manager regularly visits the teams.  We have an officers in charge, or OIC, conference once a year where all the OICs are brought together for a weekend.  This is an in-house event where we get to know the volunteers.  We also have sector meetings in the six sectors to see how things are going and we have a newsletter.</p><p>We have various means of communicating with the teams.</p></speech>

We bring six teams together, for example, in Cork.  They come in for the day.  We are with them all day.  We have a series of things to say.  They have a series of things to say.  Generally, it is getting a briefing on how are things on the ground and how are things getting on.  The same applies to the OIC conference.</p> <p>  The CUAG is an extremely important group that we have.  I will explain how it operates.  We are joined at the hip with it.  There are nine members.  They are voted in.  There is a representative of the cliff team.  There is a member representing the boat teams.  There is a member representing the search team, the ordinary volunteer and the different grades.  There are nine members.  We meet them on a very regular basis.</p> <p>  For anything we are inputting into the Coast Guard, such as new equipment, personal protection equipment, PPE, training and incidents, we set up technical advisory groups.  If we want to buy vehicles, for example, we set up a technical advisory group to advise us on that so that the procurement process involves them.  It involves them for PPE.  It involves them for anything that we are doing.  It is not a customer relationship.  They are us and we are them.  When we are doing something, we do it with them, if you follow me.</p></speech>

We have a number of units around the coast and we will have industrial relations issues.  We have the volunteer code.  How we do our business, how they do our business and the relationship, and the disciplinary procedure, etc., is in there.  We have a safety management system, and we have how to organise standard operating procedures, SOPs, etc.</p> <p>  With the relationship and the industrial relations issues, we have had four disciplinary procedures in place in the past five years for 900 people.  Those resulted in no higher than a verbal warning or a written warning.  That is for 900 people.  We had four dismissals - two this year and two last year.  The code sets out what is a major infraction, for example, fraudulent activity and non-adherence to SOPs.  The list is there.</p> <p>  Generally, we had 3% turnover in the volunteers in the past three years.  In the energy industry, such as ESB, it is 10%.  For retail, it is 60%.</p> <p>  Doolin is one of our flagship teams.  It is a very busy team.  They have four elements: search, cliff, boat and drone.  If I was to say when things started to go wrong, I suppose it goes back to 2020.  I am very wary of where I am and I do not want to make things worse.  I do not want to name names, nor will I do that.  It started there.  It festered.  One of our OICs left and we have another OIC there.  That person is doing a great job.  In May 2019, that person came to us and said that we were having problems there.  What did we do?  There is a sense that we did not do anything and that we were slow.  We immediately engaged with them.  I have detail here but I will not go into it.  It sets out month by month for the last two years where we have engaged with it.</p></speech>

We have been working through that.  There is a big reform programme going on there.</p> <p>  With my staff, with my people and with my stakeholders, I cannot just draw up a plan and say, "Okay, lads, this is what we are going to do."  That is not the way you do it.  Basically, I did a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis of what we needed to do, what resources we have and where we are going.  With the staff and with our own people, I partnered with the great place to work programme.  We are on our second survey at present.

Basically, the questionnaire looks at three headings: trust, credibility and fairness with the management.  They are asked specific questions on that, and also on pride and respect with their colleagues, and then there are open questions.  That questionnaire went out.  Compared to the industry standard, we do quite well to the extent that we were awarded a great place to work.  That is nice.  At the end of the day, it gives me, my managers and the volunteers a sense of where we are in the state of play and where they are in the different teams.  Where there are IR issues in the teams, you can see where it is dropping down in those areas.  They are the areas we are working with more strongly.  It gives us a good indication of where we are going, that I am not driving it too fast or it is not going too slow, and it is working.</p></speech>

Even when they are responding to incidents, if the incidents are going too high and, as volunteers, they are responding infrequently, I need to look at that too.</p><p>They are volunteers and the backbone of our organisation.  I do not want people to burn out.  We know the implementation of safety management systems and more processes has an administrative burden on a team.  We are considering how to manage or deal with that.  Volunteers join up to put on the gear, get into a boat, climb a cliff and take part in searches.  That is why they join.

I have lost my Internet communication.  I was trying to access the terms of reference.  Certainly its overarching role is to represent.  The wording that is used is that it is representative of all functions, volunteers and geographic areas.</p></speech>

I have met volunteers past and present and there is a very low ebb.  Morale is at rock bottom.  Problems that emerged in Doolin have been allowed to fester unchecked for many years.  That unit has been taken off the board.  Mr. Clonan has to step up and recognise there is a problem and that what is there at the moment is not working.  These people in these units in communities volunteer their lives on a 24-7 service and give of their time but they feel they are being stonewalled, not listened to by management, bullied and harassed.  We now see the establishment of an independent representative organisation for volunteers.  I think the Coast Guard should recognise it, engage with it and listen to it.  I have met people from Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Clare and Galway who are involved in this and they all have the same message.  They are really concerned about an organisation they love.  They see it falling apart before their eyes.  They are screaming for this to stop.  All they want is proper engagement.  I do not believe that is there.  It is not delivered through an advisory group, which is what the Coast Guard has at the moment.</p> <p>  There are 12 volunteers in Doolin.  They are highly committed people.  They want that unit back on the board.  They can do it.  What is the precedent for stepping them down?  Has the Coast Guard stepped down other units with 12 fully competent people who are able to deliver services on the ground?  All the time they are off the board, they lose their skills and cannot train.  They cannot keep their competency level up.  That is the reaction of the Coast Guard.  I absolutely welcome the appointment of an independent mediator.  Everyone in this room has advocated for that to happen and I wish Kieran Mulvey well in that difficult task.  What precedent has the Coast Guard used previously to step down a unit with 12 fully trained and competent people who want to do the job?  What precedent was used to step down that unit?  Will Mr. Clonan please answer?</p></speech>

The Doolin unit has been having problems for several years.  Six members resigned and there are 12 left.  Based on what I have been told, my belief is that the interaction within the team is not safe.  The 12 members we are talking about are not safe to go out because of the issues that have arisen as a result of the internal conflict that is there.  That is where we are at.  I will not have people going out to sea or climbing cliffs if I do not have confidence in them doing so safely.  I am protecting myself and I am protecting them, but mainly them.  We have had the loss of Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas.  I do not want us to have such a loss ever again.  That is where we are at.  We have a situation in Doolin that, in my belief - and that is what I work off - is not a safe situation to allow to continue.  That is why they were taken off the board.  Until that assurance is got, that is the way it will be.  I am not in the business of sending people out onto cliffs or in boats and putting them in harm's way.</p></speech>

That is our basic objective and policy.  There are some very old buildings in use by the Coast Guard, some of which we are trying to upgrade, maintain and improve.  We have a building programme.  The focus at the moment is on Greystones and Westport.  Both of those will start construction early in 2022.  There are other projects around the coast.  Some of the existing buildings are called rocket houses and, as I am sure the Senator is aware, they date back to the 19th century and do not provide the necessary accommodation to house 24-7 response units.  Some new building projects are urgently required in those areas in terms of health and safety.  In regard to any specific building project, Mr. Clonan might be better qualified to answer a question on a specific project.</p></speech>

The opening statements give testimony to the number of call-outs, the number of lives saved and we must be grateful and say thanks.  Our job today is to ensure the mission statement in terms of the safety of the maritime transport sector and the obligations and responses to look after and protect those who are charged with doing the call-outs.  It is important, and the Chairman touched on it, that if there is an issue with staff and local management then there must be a process whereby you can go one up or one aside in terms of a dispute resolution.  The important thing here is that we must ensure that the coastal unit advisory group is inclusive.  I cannot stress enough that it be inclusive and that it engages properly.  Kieran Mulvey will do a good job, as he has done in the past.  I would not want to pre-empt his outcome but one of the things I am sure he will come back with is that aspect of engagement.  It is all about the issue of grievances and complaints.  Again, I thank everybody involved and our witnesses today.  We all appreciate what is being done and what people in their care do every day.  We are very grateful.  It is our job to ensure they are funded and that the support structures are in place and collectively it is our duty to make sure that the equipment and training are up to speed and is proper.  If we learn anything from Rescue 116, there must be accountability and transparency and there needs to be scrutiny and oversight.  That is important.</p></speech>

This is my first opportunity to say this following the report on the crash of R116.  I add my voice to the condolences for Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith.  I would also add my voice to those condolences for Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas.  That just shows the nature of the work the Coast Guard does and its importance.  As for the report, there obviously needs to be follow-through on those recommendations.  Beyond that, we need to look into those protocols and how we operate in regard to catching mistakes, particularly those mistakes that were mentioned earlier about the air navigation difficulties.</p> <p>  We are dealing with this situation.  I do not want to repeat what has been said and even if we do not get into the rights and wrongs of it, if we are talking about Doolin it would be fair to surmise that we are here on the basis of what was at least a HR failure.  We can talk about the rights and wrongs of the new organisation, the ICGVRA -  it does not exactly roll off the tongue - and we can talk about CUAG and whether its terms of reference mean it is a representative organisation.  It is fair to say, however, that a significant number of people have been in contact with all of us who do not believe it is at this point in time.  There has been a systems failure and a communications failure and an inability to deal with these HR issues.</p><p>Mr. Clonan stated himself there have been failures and difficulties over the years, even in Doolin.  We all accept Kieran Mulvey has been appointed and that he has a difficult piece of work to do which he needs to work through, but what we need to get from that work are learnings on how we operate into the future.  Some of the material that has been put into the public domain and in front of us concerns not only those HR issues and difficulties.  Obviously, there is the material relating to R116.  The question is whether we have the ability not only to have a fit-for-purpose system to deal with the three areas of search and rescue, maritime casualty and pollution response, but beyond that, a system that is fit to check and catch mistakes as they happen.</p><p> Sometimes an analogy is made with the airline industry, which was bad for many years.  The industry discovered the best approach was to create almost an amnesty for those who had been involved in near collisions or whatever so that they could come forward with the information, from which learnings could be made, protocols could be changed and the system could be made better.  Sometimes we look for a head when it is already too late.  We need a system that will catch mistakes, will give us the best bang for our buck, and one that is about saving lives.  Will Mr. Clonan comment on that?</p><p> Mr. Clonan spoke about audits.  I was going to ask if there is a need for an audit across the board to ensure we have a system that is fit for purpose and has the protocols in place for catching HR and safety issues.  Mr. Clonan spoke about ongoing audits.  Will he provide some more information on that?</p></speech>

The audits are operational audits.  From the point of view of HR issues, I get a report on the number of grievances, complaints or disciplinary procedures.  I have set out the details relating to the past five years.  When I meet with the 44 volunteer team leaders as a group, I sit in a room with them and have tea or coffee.  I am a very approachable person.  If there is an issue, they will tell me.  I have not heard of any such issues.</p></speech>

I also do not want to get into a "he said, she said" situation.  I accept that would be unfair.  I am interested in the process and putting in place a better process in future that catches such issues.  We are talking about volunteers who do serious work, combined with the management the witnesses have to do.  We need something that works.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.904" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Clonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111800002#M00400"><p>I agree.  The coastal unit advisory group, CUAG, is the first port of call.  It links into the volunteer community to determine if there are issues.  From what has been reported in the media, it is clear there are issues.  From my perspective, I need to get a sense of that.  However, in the sampling, polling, questionnaires and engagement on whether it is a great place to work, it is not coming through.  If there are issues, I want to know about them.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy's point about the airline industry, search and rescue is maritime and aviation.  I sit on the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, and International Maritime Organisation, IMO, joint working group on search and rescue, which includes safety.  The whole thing about aviation safety is a just culture.  We are implementing a just culture within the volunteers and our organisation.  I should be able to go down and talk to a person.  That person should be able to tell me about mistakes that have been made.  For example, he or she should be able to tell me that when he or she put the trailer onto the hitch, it came off and hit something.  I want to know about such incidents, not as part of a blame culture but to find out how we can fix it and ensure it does not happen again.</p> <p>  On continuous improvement, a report is produced on any of the incidents we attend, detailing what happened and lessons to be learned.  In the past 19 months, with our new safety management system, we have implemented a deviation management process.  When a possible deviation from the process is brought to our attention, we stop and investigate from the point of view of finding out what happened.  It is not about a blame culture; it is about finding out what happened and making it good.  I believe we have had 25 such deviation incidents in the past three years.  They are reducing in number as the just culture gets more established.  That is how we manage it.</p></speech>

Any time I go round the teams, it is about ensuring there is dignity and respect at work, a safe place of work and a just culture.  I am a friend to the volunteers, but I am also their manager, if the Deputy follows me.  It is that relationship.  I do not step over that.  We have a professional relationship with the volunteers and there is respect and openness on both sides.  We have our values.  We got the volunteers and the full-time staff together and asked them what the values of the Coast Guard are.  We have the Civil Service values.  The values the staff voted for are respect for one another and pride in what we do.</p></speech>

From 2017 to date, there has been a 20% increase in staff numbers.  I am introducing a phased increase.  I approached the management board in 2017 or 2018 and said that to implement the recommendations and do the work required, I needed to build the Coast Guard.  However, if a lot of staff had joined the organisation at that point, it would have tipped it.  There are three members of staff in the safety, quality and compliance section, comprising a safety officer, compliance officer and a person in charge.  The operations section has been readjusted.  The next section we are looking at and reviewing is the Coast Guard unit and support section, which is the section that supports the volunteers on the coast.  The staff members there know that, because I have told them.  They can see it.</p></speech>

With the additional staff mean that some of those issues will be dealt with?  I was worried when I heard that volunteer staff cannot do specific safety work.  Who does?</p></speech>

As the Chairman said, we are here because these HR issues have been raised with us.  If the Coast Guard needs more staff to run the organisation and it needs outside knowledge or a consultant to ensure there is best practice in communication and dealing with the grievances, then that is vital.  I welcome what the witnesses said about the safety audits and the operational issues.  There needs to be an audit of the protocols for communication and to deal with the HR issues.  If we can resolve that it will benefit everyone and bring us closer to a fit-for-purpose organisation that does the vital work.</p></speech>

My first question is to Ms O'Keeffe.  I understand she is soon to depart from service in the Department of Transport.   I hope that she does not feel as though she has been thrown under the bus today.  Can she confirm that the Department does not have internal expertise in the area of aviation?  I understand it advertised for an aviation expert.  The closing date was December last year and the Department has still not appointed an aviation expert.</p> <p>  I refer to the maps used by CHC.  I understand the maps were scanned to feed into the navigation system and the scanning left the maps a couple of inches short, which left Blackrock Island out of the system.  Who is responsible for oversight there?  Does Ms O'Keeffe accept that the IAA has no statutory obligations with respect to the SAR group and that is part of the forthcoming Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020?   </p> <p>  I believe the families should be encouraged to take legal advice as to which jurisdiction they will go to to resolve the loss of their loved ones.  Families have been left without an income as a result of what happened.  All agencies involved, including the Department of Transport, the Irish Coast Guard and the IAA need to reflect -----</p></speech>

I have a damning list of what has being going on in the service.  In 2014, there was an accident at Inch.  The Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, report was not produced.  With regard to the Kilkee tragedy, people in Kilkee tell me they were warning that there was a likelihood of a fatality because Coast Guard management would not listen to them.  Regarding the crash of Rescue 116, the personal locator beacons apparently did not work when the crew went into the water.  That was in 2017.  </p> <p>  I return to Ms O'Keeffe for a moment.  I am trying to understand why the Exchequer paid a private company &euro;7.5 million to retrofit the cockpits of their helicopters and buy night-vision goggles that are still in the possession of the Coast Guard?  Why is that training is not completed today almost eight years later?  </p> <p>  Returning to the Coast Guard, in 2020, there was a judgement against Ireland because the MCIB did not conform with the independence requirement.  I refer to scrutiny again.  There was a failure of oversight.  Captain Steve Clinch wrote a review.  That report has not been published.  The Comptroller and Auditor General produced two reports that were absolutely damning.  Mr. Clonan said that his trainees come in as probationers and are trained to a standard.</p><p>How is that standard certified?  Who certifies it?  What agency certifies it?</p><p> With respect to the allegations of bullying and harassment, Mr. Clonan stated that the organisation has the Coast Guard code.  He said the Coast Guard has engaged with the GAA on the drafting of that code with respect to volunteers.  Did the Coast Guard engage with the volunteers?  Did it bring volunteers together and run that code by them?</p><p> As for dispute resolution, where there is a dispute, full-time members of the Coast Guard have access to legal services.  Do volunteers have access to legal services, and does Mr. Clonan know if they can avail of the Workplace Relations Commission when it comes to a dispute?</p><p> Going back to my colleague's questions about the CUAG, the CUAG is not a representative group.  I come from a trade union background.  If you want a representative group, that representative group has to be something like the ICGVRA, which has now come together and which will be recognised by a trade union or employee representative body.  Whether Mr. Clonan likes it or not, sooner or later the Coast Guard will have to engage with that group.  I understand that Mr. Clonan has always been willing to engage with volunteers.  My question to him is who is stopping him from engaging with that group.  If it approaches him as a representative group, will he, as the acting director of the Coast Guard, engage and negotiate with it and try to resolve the issues that exist?</p><p> Going back to Ms O'Keeffe, why is Mr. Clonan still acting director?  Why has he not been appointed to a permanent post in the organisation?</p><p> I deeply respect the work the Coast Guard does but it needs to engage with volunteers.  One clear example of it not doing so is outlined in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the purchase of vehicles.  It is clear from that report that there was no engagement with volunteers, and that is simply not good enough.  Volunteers, as Mr. Clonan well knows, have to feel they are part of the family and feel they have a voice.  I believe that a lot of what we are looking at today is as a result of a lack of a voice.  It should be remembered - and I ask Mr. Clonan to pass this on to his people - that bullying and harassment are offences against the person, and at some stage somebody will take an action against his organisation.  He is only one man.  He is here in the hot seat today and I feel somewhat for him, but he has answered the questions put to him well and defended his organisation.  I would like him to get out on the ground and fix the problems that are there.  I believe he is committed to doing that and I would like him to do it urgently.  If there is something impeding that, from his point of view, he should come back to the committee and we will work on it.</p></speech>

The nub of what the Senator asks is, in respect of the establishment of a representative body, whether it has been possible to locate the terms.  Has it been possible to print and circulate them?  If the Coast Guard has a representative group that comes together, why will it not recognise that representative group?  I refer to the ICGVRA.</p></speech>

We have only one question here: how did this happen?  It is all very well saying the Department is changing its systems.  We have a fiduciary duty as public representatives to get value for money for the public purse.  Two things happened here.  A contract for &euro;160,000 was put out to tender so no business case had to be made to the Department.  Then the value of the tender ballooned nearly tenfold to &euro;1.4 million and it still did not get approval from the Department.  Not only that, but the trucks that were bought were grossly inadequate, so the contract fails on every account.  I have read the report.  I still have not got an answer from anyone as to how this happened.  Mr. Clonan, it was on your watch.  You were deputy chief of the Coast Guard at the time.  How did this happen?</p></speech>

I did so because people within the service were aware of what had happened and came to me with their complaint.  This is all part of a system that is just broken.  As I could not get answers, I went to the Comptroller and Auditor General and asked him to have a look at this.  I was absolutely shocked by what came back.

You all need to do it.  The question is how did that happen.  Mr. Clonan does not have that answered yet.  To Ms O'Keeffe, I note that answer needs to be arrived at quickly by the Department on behalf of taxpayers.  They are paying your salaries.  They are paying our wages.  We are having this meeting because of the volunteers up and down the country.  We accept the work the Coast Guard does and we will support it with extra resources.  Ironically, the Coast Guard wasted the bones of &euro;1.4 million of taxpayers' money on something top management clearly were not aware of.  Mr. Clonan was not aware of it.</p></speech>

I would have thought that at this stage, between Mr. Clonan and the Department, some form of disciplinary action needs to take place here, to forensically find out how this happened.  It is not good enough for them to come in to us and say they will take on board what the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying.  I brought this up today and in fairness, Senator Craughwell initiated this whole process.  This is damning for the Irish Coast Guard and even the procedures within the Department for overseeing what the Irish Coast Guard is doing.  What allocation of funding does it get from Ms O'Keeffe's Department every year?</p></speech>

Doolin has been referred to by many members from Clare, including Deputy Cathal Crowe, Senator Dooley and Deputy Carey.  When I look at the whole situation, a lot of the issues have been touched on.  Is there any organisation in the State such as this whereby there are only 82 full-time staff to 900 volunteers?  It seems to be a ratio that I am not aware of anywhere else.  Many of us are in political parties where volunteers are volunteers.  They do an amazing job but it is a voluntary role.  They are presumably working in other jobs.  Perhaps some of them are retired or whatever.  Is it an organisation that can continue to have such a ratio of only 82 full-time people versus 900 volunteers?  Is it fit for purpose going into the 21st century, with all the issues it is facing?  I note the organisation has a pollution response service, which I did not know about.  It responds to maritime casualties and has a search and rescue service.  It seems to be getting involved in on-land search and rescue as well as coastal activities.  Is this the best way forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.1082" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111800002#Q00600"><p>The ratio of full-time staff to volunteers is something we keep under review on an ongoing basis.  In the previous discussion about this and about the future resourcing of the Coast Guard, it is also worth mentioning that there have been increases in full-time staffing of the Coast Guard in recent years in response to changing demands in the system that need to be met by the Coast Guard.  Some years ago, the organisation was a lot smaller.  The need for additional resources was identified and those were provided.  In the same way, the need for additional resources has now been identified again.  We had a discussion on the resources already so I will not go through it again.  Is the organisation fit for purpose?  We keep it under review all the time to ensure it can discharge the functions it needs to discharge.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that 391 lives were saved in 2020.  It can never be forgotten that this service is there.  Is it more difficult to get volunteers?  We spoke earlier about a churn of people coming and going and so on.  I am not sure whether that was in relation to full-time staff or volunteers.  Does Ms O'Keeffe have an indication of whether these are volunteers with ten, 20, 40 or 50 years of service?  Are they staying a long time or is there a big churn of people?  As and when the economy picks up, it will presumably be harder again to get volunteers involved.</p></speech>

I will pass to Mr. Clonan or Mr. Ferns in a moment to give more detail.  The units actively recruit the volunteers.  They have experienced no difficulties in getting people from their communities who are willing and, indeed, are very keen to enrol in the Coast Guard, and then enter the training programme to become full members of the volunteer cohort.  Despite the challenges of the past two years with Covid, units have continued to enrol new members and advance team training throughout that period.  We are frequently privileged to give long-service medals to members of the volunteer corps who have served for considerable periods in the Coast Guard.  I wish to take a moment to acknowledge that service, to acknowledge the people who continue to come forward and to acknowledge the people who have continued to serve for very long periods in the Coast Guard.  I will pass to Mr. Clonan or Mr. Ferns who will provide figures on that.</p></speech>

In the past three years, in actual fact 121 volunteers have moved on.  There is always a passing-through of volunteers.  People join and they go on probation and they last for a year.  People join and spend maybe five, ten or 20 years in the organisation.  Following on from Ms O'Keeffe's piece, we had an extensive roll-out of medals and we presented some 50-year medals which, for somebody to have given that much of his or her time, is fairly impressive.  There has been a net increase of 79 volunteers in recent times.  While 121 have moved on, 200 have joined.  Having looked at the numbers, we do not have an issue recruiting volunteers into the units as there has actually been a net increase of 79.</p></speech>

In terms of the fit between all the different bodies, there is the volunteer sector, the RNLI, the Coast Guard helicopters and the community inshore services, and the Coast Guard now has a role against pollution.  Obviously, the Coast Guard is doing work.  The RNLI is doing similar work.  The Coast Guard calls on the RNLI and I presume the RNLI calls on the Coast Guard or its helicopters.  Is that the best fit?  Is there duplication in what the RNLI is doing?  I am not taking away from anybody's activity.  Would it be better if they were all part of one organisation, not that I am trying to get rid of one or the other?  Is there an element of duplication going on between the RNLI, the Coast Guard, community inshore services and so on?</p></speech>

What is in fact happening is that the rescue services are co-ordinated by the Irish Coast Guard.  I will again pass to either Mr. Clonan or Mr. Ferns to give more detail on how that is done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.1088" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Clonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2021111800002#Q01200"><p>To take up from Ms O'Keeffe's comments: there is no duplication.  I look upon it as a three-legged stool.  The centre is the rescue co-ordination centre and, of the three legs, one is the RNLI, one is the Coast Guard helicopter service and one is the Coast Guard unit volunteers.  Search and rescue is bigger than that.  It is about shipping.  Most of our rescues involve inshore swimmers.  There is the recreation industry, fishing and what we call solo ships.  When a distress call goes out, it is incumbent upon the vessels to assist.  When something happens, all those other resources come in, in addition to the assistance from the Navy and the Air Corps.  That is how it is done.</p> <p>  In relation to other countries, the UK has the RNLI and Her Majesty's Coastguard service, which comprises of volunteers.  It is the same in Maritime New Zealand.</p></speech>

For this reason, a review ... [was] under way for some time.  This review has identified some shortcomings ... and actions have been taken, particularly in the areas of ... to address these.  There are also a number of legacy issues which we have been tackling and will continue to tackle over the coming months. </blockquote> <p>How long is this going on?  It seems this whole issue has been going on for years.  Ms O'Keeffe said &quot;Our aim is to ensure that all procurements are conducted in accordance with&quot; but that does not mean that is happening.  She is saying that her aim is that it will happen.  When will the organisation be at best practice level in terms of procurement?</p></speech>

As a consequence of that report, a number of changes were made.  We have focused in recent years on applying more staff resources and more training, and in adjusting our procedures to ensure we perform to the best of our ability.  In case I gave the impression, this is not a future tense issue.  We have been doing this for some time.  These procedures, training and new systems are already in place.  All procurements are at present going through all these.</p> <p>  When I refer to the future, I say that this should continue into the future.  If further strengthening needs to be done in the future, we will do it.  There are a number of legacy issues that we are dealing with and will continue to deal with.  These new procedures, structures, training and staffing have been in place for some time.  I will pass to Mr. Clonan in case he has anything to add.</p></speech>

She stated the aim is to ensure monitoring, compliance, awareness and educational frameworks are being improved as the Department seeks to ensure the smallest procurements are treated with the same rigour, thoroughness and attention to detail as larger procurements.  This suggests the big stuff has been dealt with but the smaller stuff has yet to be dealt with.</p></speech>

This covered all aspects and not just the technical system.  The TAG 07 system is the one we operate.  We have been using it since about 2010.  When we did the risk assessment we identified various pieces with which I was not happy.  We needed to manage the risk of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.  It is a risky operation and everything needs to be in place.  When we looked at it what I said essentially was that procedures, verification on audits and working with suppliers of equipment needed to be looked at.  I met the officers in charge of all 17 cliffs units.  I told them where we were at and what we needed to do.  It involved a series of measures rather than just one measure.  We did a risk assessment throughout the organisation and we picked the measures to take after which everything else would be acceptable.  We worked very hard to get the service back on board.  It happened on approximately 12 March.  Our ultimate aim was that through external verification and an operational readiness audit of all of the climbing teams they would be back on the board.  They were pretty much back on the board by approximately June.</p></speech>

I am struggling to square this to be honest.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on this.  I hear what the Coast Guard and the Department are saying in terms of it being a great place to work with a relatively low number of disciplinary actions and dismissals.  There is a significant programme of change and involvement with the coastal unit advisory group, CUAG, and there have been various meetings.  I have worked in various organisations and I have a level of training.  Political parties have volunteers.  I have never seen or experienced with any organisation what I am hearing about the Coast Guard throughout the country.  Not just in Doolin but around the country there is a very different picture.  What I am hearing from the witnesses and the management team is that they are not seeing it.  This, in and of itself, is a red flag to me.  It should also be a red flag to Mr. Clonan and the management team.</p> <p>  I represent a political party.  There is a broad political spectrum on the committee.  Every one of us is hearing the same thing and it is the worst picture although not in terms of the language used.  It reflects a terrible environment for volunteers and workers across the board.  They speak about widespread bullying, a dilution of services and people being afraid to speak out for fear of recrimination.  They are literally seeking medical support for mental ill-health.  This is deeply concerning.</p> <p>  This cannot be explained away with a process of change.  From the perspective of this committee, we cannot ignore it.  We cannot explain it away.  It has not been explained in what we have heard.  Does Mr. Clonan hear this?  Does it concern him?  Does he have a plan?  Some of what I hear is that there is a disconnect and a failure to engage.  Whatever Mr. Clonan may say about the processes and the level of engagement it is not enough.  There is a failing within it.  Does Mr Clonan hear from the representative group that has been established and other quarters in the way we have?  We can share this information with him in a particular way.  People tell us they do not want to be associated with the comments because of a fear of recrimination.  It is very important that Mr. Clonan and the management team hear it and respond to it.  What does Mr. Clonan have to say on this?</p></speech>

I am trying to build a just culture.  Anybody in the Coast Guard unit who has a fear to speak out is not in the Coast Guard I want to be part of and they should not be part of it either.</p></speech>

Internally within the organisation, going through all the structures we have, I am not getting those noises.  I am getting it from the outside, but it is not specific.  I need to hear the specific nature of it to understand.  I have spoken to the people that are on the VRA and I know them.  I know the majority of volunteers.  I do not know why the VRA has been set up.  Most of the volunteers are retired, but there are still issues there that they are holding and that need to be resolved.  I am very concerned.  We want openness and to reassure volunteers that it is open, that there are no recriminations.</p></speech>

Mr. Clonan must accept that issues have arisen and that, as public representatives elected by the people, we must take them on board.  It is a body of work that we will continue with.  We will be coming back on the issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Mr. Ferns is to send us the terms of reference of the advisory group.</p></speech>

We want to feed into the process in order that the Irish Coast Guard is very much fit for purpose.  It involves 900 volunteers, and it is vital that the system functions in an efficient way because it saves lives.  It is something that we will take into consideration as a committee.  We will follow up with the volunteers and we will come back to both the Coast Guard and the Department and other groups in terms of our deliberations on the matter, which we very much take on board.</p></speech>

Further to the previous speaker, I am afraid I have heard the same things, both from constituents in Clare, which I represent, but also from current and former members of the Coast Guard across Ireland, not limited to Clare, more than 100 miles from Clare, with regard to the fear of recrimination and fear of speaking out and a certain disconnect.  The witnesses might not perceive the disconnect, but I have been told of a disconnect between volunteers on the ground and management, which they feel has no understanding of where they are coming from or what they do.  That must be addressed.</p> <p>  There were HR difficulties in Clare which have been very well ventilated for some time.  A HR firm was sent to deal with them.  If I am correct, Mr. Clonan was a naval officer.  If there was a dispute between crew members on a naval boat, am I right in saying that a commanding officer would ultimately deal with the issue?  It would not be a case of letting it fester and, having gone back to base, engaging a HR firm and sending someone to talk to those involved.</p> <p>  The Coast Guard is a volunteer unit.  I question the management structure but perhaps it is by necessity.  We have a naval officer and a civil servant.  I am pleased they are here.  I do not wish to personalise it.  There seems to be very little input from the volunteers on the ground that are relied on to put their lives at risk.  In looking at the structure, objectively, I see that there is a disconnect.  We have volunteers and almost the officer class &ndash; the civil servant and the naval officer &ndash; and there is very little connection between the two.  Perhaps that is something that is not within the remit of the witnesses.  They are doing the job they were appointed to do, but it is something that we need to look at.  How do we make sure that the volunteers on the ground are represented in management?  In the Garda, one can join, go to Templemore and go right up to the top.  Likewise, with the navy, one goes in as a commissioned officer and can go right to the top.  In the Coast Guard there is a feeling that volunteers are just there to put their lives on the line, but they are never going to be in senior management positions.</p></speech>

I spoke to Mr. Clonan about a liaison with the volunteers.  That is something that must be considered intensively.  Consultants are being brought in.  The committee will deliberate on today's proceedings and make its own recommendations.  We will have to engage directly with the volunteers as well.</p> <p>  Does Deputy McNamara have a specific question?</p></speech>

Does he accept that the structure of the Coast Guard needs to change to make sure that the volunteers, or former volunteers, have a greater role in management so that there is not such a huge disconnect?  I do not want to use a disparaging First World War analogy.</p></speech>

I am not discounting it.  Reference was made to the word "disconnect".  I do not think we have a disconnect with the CUAG, but obviously something is going on.  On whether volunteers can be part of the full-time structure, at the moment we are not structured to allow a volunteer to be a member of staff.</p></speech>

That is the substance of what we are getting.  That is something we want the witnesses to take on board.  We will continue with our deliberations.</p></speech>

I suggest a confidential recipient, somebody independent of the Coast Guard, perhaps a senior counsel or retired judge to deliberate on the issues outside of the organisation.</p></speech>

When a person goes through a disciplinary procedure, he or she goes through an appeals process, which again is internal.  If an employee is not satisfied with the appeals process, he or she has other ways of appealing through the labour court, for example, but volunteers do not have that route.  I have looked at that with my HR hat on.  The question is whether the HR company can provide that route in an independent, confidential way.  I did not talk to all the volunteers about this, but the view is that it was not a sufficiently independent process.  I agree with what has been said.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the sacrifice of the crews of Rescue 116 and Rescue 111, which crashed in 1999, as I did in the D&aacute;il last night.  Again, I express my sympathies to their families and the family of Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas. </p><p> The responsibility for the leadership of the air-sea rescue service rests with Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe.  She will be well aware of the recent citations of bravery given by the Ceann Comhairle to the crew of Rescue 117 for the saving of seven lives off the Haulbowline in March earlier this year.  That could not have been achieved without the expertise of that crew.   There is also the fact that we have a heavy lift helicopter in Waterford.  Ms O'Keeffe will understanding the need to have those services and having the resources based in Waterford.  Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe will also be aware that within the Department of Transport a commitment was given by the last Minister to provide &euro;350,000 per annum in stopgap funding while an application is being made by Waterford local authority through An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the extension of the runway.  The Department has now rescinded giving this &euro;350,000 this year.  At the same time the Department has also announced that &euro;126 million in regional funding will be allocated to all other regional airports in the country.  Can I ask for a quick response on this, because I have three safety questions to which I would also like a response?  Can Ms O'Keeffe explain to me the rationale of her Department to reduce money to the sum of &euro;350,000 that support the Rescue 117 service in Waterford?  The Department donated &euro;126 million in capital supports and other funding to all the other airports in the region.  Meanwhile, we understand that a tender is also now in question around the country for the new application tender for the national air-sea rescue service.</p></speech>

I would point out that we have a valuable service in the south-east region.  An airport is under threat simply because of the lack of funding.  It is breathtaking.  As I said last night, the figure of &euro;350,000 that is needed to support our services in Waterford has been rescinded, while the figure of &euro;126 million has been allocated to the rest of regional aviation centres across the country.</p> <p>  I have three other questions.  I will pose all three questions together.  The first question is on the application of night-vision goggles which have been supplied, fitted and trained to the Sligo rescue helicopter.  I understand it is happening in Shannon.  It has not happened in Waterford yet.  When is this going to be completed?  These night-vision goggles are only approved for helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS, activity.  They are not approved for search and rescue activity.  Would Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe please tell us why that is the case?  How is that going to be overturned?  These are needed for night-time flying activities.</p> <p>  Second, what framework documents has the Department put in place similar to the UK Civil Aviation Authority's CAP 999, which basically provides a governance and framework for the operation of helicopter activity?  Has the Department of Transport done this?  Has the Irish Aviation Authority done it?  If they have not done it, why not?  When are they doing it? </p> <p>  The third question is on what came up in the report.  Does the Department now acknowledge a need for a nationally-based, fixed-wing aircraft, either in Shannon or Dublin, to provide all of the activities that are needed for top flight cover, for patient transfer and for pollution monitoring?  I understand that at present we are paying significant money for a Medevac plane in Ireland which is stationed for patient transfers.  We could potentially be using that within a new tender.  The money can certainly be found.  Does Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe accept that there should be no discussion about having a helicopter doing top flight cover when it can only be on scene for half an hour, when an airplane could provide up to seven or eight hours of top flight cover?  Is the Department looking at this?</p></speech>

Again, I am not in a position to give detail on these.  However, there are people in the room who would be able to answer them.  I will pass the question on night vision to Mr. Clonan.  He might talk about fixed-wing aircraft at the same time.  Then, Mr. Flaherty might deal with the Flight 999 question, if he can.  We might go to Mr. Clonan first.</p></speech>

We spent &euro;4.3 million in modifying the aircraft in 2013.  We spent approximately &euro;500,000 in 2015 on the 24 sets of night-vision goggles.  The training will cost &euro;4.1 million.  We have paid out &euro;1.7 million so far.  We started training.  We awarded the contract for training in late 2018.  The training started soon after that whereby training instructors travelled to simulators in Norway.  That came to a halt during Covid-19 the following year.  The training is progressing slowly because we want to keep the service running when planning training.  Doing night training can interfere with the service because it takes helicopters off the board.  Training takes place in winter.  While it can be done in summer, the opportunity will not be there to do so.  One gets most of the training done in winter.</p> <p>  On the night vision, this is the first time the regulator in Ireland has approved night vision for a commercial operator.  We have got to the stage where for commercial air transport Sligo was approved.  They are continuing to train the other bases.  At the moment, we are at the stage where we want the regulator to approve night-vision imaging systems, NVIS, for search and rescue.  It is pioneering within Ireland to do this.  The structures are not there.  The IAA is putting structures in place. </p> <p>  To give the Deputy an indication, the manuals have to be approved, the training has to be approved, the aircraft had to be approved, and there will be on-site inspections.  It is not a case that they can turn up to do their driving licence and come away again.  At the moment, I have been ensured by CHC Helicopter and the IAA that the approval for search and rescue NVIS is almost there.  That is as far as I am at the moment with it. </p></speech>

It is an extremely important point for air-sea rescue.  It started in 2018.  I accept that there are difficulties around training.  I accept that there are difficulties with Covid-19.  However, in light of the Rescue 116 report and what we now know, we cannot afford to be delaying this any longer.  Surely, all efforts should be made to get this done in the next number of months.  I accept the training issues and operational issues, but this can be done if the will is there.  I think the problem is that the will needs to be demonstrated.</p></speech>

She will have been following the committee&rsquo;s work on this matter.  A review was initiated and carried out by Captain Steve Clinch.  It was submitted to Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s Department in July.  Where stands that report?  What are the Department&rsquo;s intentions regarding publishing it and implementing its recommendations?</p> <p>  Does Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe have a comment on the piece of work that was done by the barrister, Ms Roisin Lacey, back in 2010?  Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe might have a copy of that draft heads of legislation.  It looked at the fundamentally flawed constitution of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  We, as a State, ended up in the Court of Justice of the European Union about it for three or four years.  We eventually had to take officials off that board.  Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe will be fully familiar with that.  Could she update us on Captain Steve Clinch&rsquo;s report?  When will it be published?  Can she give us a roadmap of when the recommendations will be implemented? </p></speech>

As members are aware, the Bill, which went through pre-legislative scrutiny in this committee some time ago, is scheduled to commence in the D&aacute;il next week.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny, the Minister offered to commission an independent review of maritime accident investigative structures in Ireland.  The report has been received by the Department.  It is currently subject to legal advice.  Members will appreciate that I cannot comment any further at this stage.</p></speech>

Does the Department or the IAA have something in place?  The CAP 999 document is on governance and standard operating procedures for helicopter search and rescue services.  I also asked Ms O'Keeffe to set out her personal opinion on the use of a fixed-wing aircraft for search and rescue services.</p></speech>

It has sent these to the Department for consultation.

These committee meetings are being held on foot of volunteers making direct contact with us.  We should not forget the phenomenal work they do.  The five most recent tragic deaths, those of Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas and the crew of R116, Dara Fitzpatrick, Mark Duffy, Paul Ormsby and Ciar&aacute;n Smith, remind us that real people's lives and families are involved.  We are all working on the same team.  It is not personal.  We have a body of work to do.  We will now follow up with the volunteers and other groups.  We will be making our own recommendations.  We will follow up with the Department on the extra staff it has looked for.  There must be a volunteer dimension to any business case.  It must not only be something that works, but something that works through a partnership model.  The fact is that there are 17 Irish Coast Guard units at the moment and 900 volunteers.  By definition, volunteers must be central to the operation.  Many of the volunteers who are coming to us do not feel that is the case.  That needs to be rectified.  We, as a committee, are willing to work with the Department and the volunteers in that regard.</p> <p>  We wish Kieran Mulvey well in his role but Mr. Clonan would have to admit that the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the 17 trucks is scandalous.  You can phrase it however you want, but this is &euro;1.4 million of taxpayers' money spent without going through the proper public procurement processes.  It never left the walls of the Irish Coast Guard.  It never went to the Department.  It would never have been picked up on had it not been flagged to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  </p> <p>  There is a lot of work to be done with the Irish Coast Guard.  I believe the witnesses have acknowledged that.  We will have further deliberations, follow up and make our own recommendations.  I thank the witnesses for today and for making the quick trip across on the bike.  Even in light of Covid, meeting in person makes a great difference.  We all want to reach the same ends but we need a frank exchange of views.</p></speech>
