The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  I ask members and all others in attendance to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of Covid-19.  They are strongly advised to leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending the meeting physically and to use the sanitisers provided.  They should maintain an appropriate level of social distance and masks should be worn at all times, except when speaking.  I ask people to co-operate with these measures.</p> <p>  Members participating remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.</p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine: the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 32 - Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and, from the 2020 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the accounts of the public services, chapter 6 re Covid-19 restart grant schemes.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment: Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General; Ms Pauline Mulligan, head of corporate services division; Mr. Declan Hughes, head of indigenous enterprise, SME and entrepreneurship division; and Mr. Cathal O'Gorman, finance officer.  From the Department of Public expenditure and Reform, we are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Georgina Hughes-Elders, principal officer, and Ms Jessica Lawless, assistant principal, from the Department the of Enterprise, Trade and Employment Vote section.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute their microphones when not contributing in order that we do not pick up background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards references speakers may make to other persons in their evidence.  As the witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Vice Chairman to ensure the privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if the statements of a witness are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, that witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that such a direction is complied with.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions under Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> To assist our broadcasting service and the Debates Office, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question has not been directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name the first time that he or she contributes.</p><p> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. S&eacute;amus McCarthy, to make his opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#B00200"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 32 Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicates gross expenditure of &euro;1.76 billion was incurred in 2020.  This represented an increase of 89% over the 2019 level of expenditure, due mainly to the provision of funding for Covid-19 related schemes.  In a number of expenditure areas, the level of funding provided for Covid-19 related spending was significantly more than was actually required in the year.</p> <p>  The 2020 spending was distributed across three expenditure programmes of varying size.  The largest expenditure programme was in jobs and enterprise development.  This accounted for &euro;1.3 billion, or 72% of the total spent in 2020.  Key areas of spending under the programme included &euro;652 million for Covid-19 related business restart grant schemes which was routed through Enterprise Ireland; &euro;192 million in other funding for Enterprise Ireland including its normal programmes; &euro;198 million provided to the IDA; &euro;79 million for local enterprise development; &euro;48 million transferred to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and just under &euro;25 million transferred to Microfinance Ireland, to fund various business loan schemes. </p> <p>  Expenditure on the innovation programme in 2020 was &euro;414 million, which was similar to the level of spending in 2019.  This included spending of &euro;332 million on the science and technology development programme; &euro;24 million on the programme for research in third level institutions; &euro;24 million on subscriptions to international organisations; and &euro;19 million for the &lsquo;disruptive technologies&rsquo; fund.  Expenditure on the business regulation programme was &euro;77 million in 2020, again, similar to the 2019 expenditure level.  This funding supported the direct operation by the Department of certain regulatory functions including the Workplace Relations Commission, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Companies Registration Office and the Patents Office.  Funding was also provided from the programme for independent bodies, such as the Health and Safety Authority, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.</p> <p>  Receipts into the vote amounted to just under &euro;50 million in 2020.  These substantially relate to fees for services operated by the Department, including employment permit fees in respect of foreign workers; Companies Registration Office filing fees; and trade mark and patent fees.  Receipts also include retained staff pension contributions, both from the Department&rsquo;s own staff, and the staff of agencies under its aegis.  The surplus remaining unspent at the year-end was just over &euro;182 million.  The Department secured the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;106 million in unspent capital funding to 2021.  The balance of &euro;76 million was due for surrender to the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The appropriation account records the cash transactions related to the vote in the year of account.  In addition the vote has incurred a contingent liability arising from the operation of a number of credit guarantee schemes.  This is explained in note 2.9 to the account which indicates that, at 31 December 2020, the Department&rsquo;s maximal exposure under the guarantee schemes was &euro;80 million on outstanding loans totalling &euro;113 million.  This was up from a maximum exposure of &euro;5 million at the end of 2019 on outstanding loans of &euro;30 million. </p> <p>  As outlined in chapter 6, small to medium businesses received grants from Vote 32 totalling around &euro;633 million in respect of interruptions to trading as a result of Covid-19 related restrictions in 2020.  The schemes were operated and funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, with the payments being made by the relevant local authorities. The funding was routed to the local authorities via Enterprise Ireland.  The purpose of the grant was to assist businesses with costs arising from the restrictions.  Under the scheme provisions, businesses were invited to self-declare their eligibility.  Conditions of the grant included that the business was a commercial enterprise operating from a premises liable to local authority commercial rates; had incurred, or expected to incur, a 25% or more loss of turnover between April and June 2020; intended to retain staff on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and committed to remain open for trading or to reopen.  Businesses were not required to explain how the money was to be used, and vouching for the manner in which the grants were applied was not required.  </p> <p>  A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls.  One of these is the completion of post-payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received.  The conditions of the scheme were such that a significant number of businesses were likely to qualify for the financial assistance available.  Nevertheless there is a risk that claims were submitted and paid where the prescribed conditions were not met.  The Department signalled at the outset of the scheme that reviews of eligibility for the grants would be undertaken, but these have not yet occurred.  As a result, there is no basis of assurance about entitlement of grant recipients to the amounts paid.  At the time of completing this report the Department was in the process of procuring an independent audit of the scheme.  Subsequently, the Department plans to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the scheme.  </p></speech>

I am pleased to be here before the committee this morning.  The Chair has introduced my team and her thank her for that.</p> <p>  As members know 2020 was a year like no other and Covid-19 had an immediate impact on the Department, on the economy and on our citizens, while dealing with Brexit at the same time.  Our budget, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, increased hugely to &euro;1.95 billion which was double our allocation of &euro;977 million in 2019.  This allowed us to roll out significant and targeted supports for enterprise, including the restart and the restart plus grants, the sustaining enterprise fund, the Covid products scheme and the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  It also allowed us to significantly expand other supports such as the working capital and future growth loan schemes and the Microfinance Ireland Covid loans scheme.  In addition we responded with a large number of non-fiscal measures in areas of company regulation, health and safety, workplace relations as well as new advisory supports.  One of the most significant measures was the restart grant scheme.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report, grants to the value of &euro;640 million were paid to enterprises of which &euro;633 million was paid out by ourselves and &euro;7 million by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The local authorities were used to specifically and quickly get that money out to businesses and we provided those businesses impacted by the pandemic with modest amounts of cash.  The aim was to meet the additional costs that all firms incurred due to Covid-19 and to preserve, in particular, economic activity in our country.  It was delivered in conjunction with other Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment.  </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report makes two specific recommendations on auditing and evaluation.  The Department accepts both recommendations and is committed to implementing them.  I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched, and in particular the need to have them available as urgently as possible.  I am very pleased that those schemes, after a Government decision in early May, relaunched on 22 May, which took huge effort by the officials of the Department, and others.</p><p>Apart from the restart schemes, we also rolled out other measures.  Some &euro;98 million was allocated for the sustaining enterprise fund, which assisted 340 businesses to stay in business and contribute to the recovery of our economy.  The online retail scheme was hugely successful.  The business planning voucher, the enterprise centres and the Brexit ready for customs grant were all very important.</p><p> Enterprise Ireland had an overall net loss of 872 jobs but created 16,500 new jobs, with 65% of those jobs based regionally.  IDA Ireland also got specific grant aid for Covid.  That scheme has considerable potential for us into the future.  Notwithstanding the pandemic, IDA Ireland continues to win new investments, with 246 new investments secured last year and 20,000 new jobs.  I am pleased that half of those went to regional locations, which is one of our policy aims.</p><p> The local enterprise offices were very important.  We increased their funding by 170% last year.  The business continuity voucher scheme supported more than 12,000 businesses at a cost of &euro;20 million.  The trading online voucher scheme would, in the recent past, have involved 1,000 vouchers annually.  Last year, vouchers were sent to 13,000 recipients to allow companies to go online.  That was hugely successful for small businesses.  I am delighted to report that employment in that regard totalled 35,000 at local level.</p><p> We also responded significantly in terms of liquidity to business, which was a considerable factor, particularly at the time when banks were not lending.  We provided almost &euro;50 million for the Covid and Brexit working capital loan schemes and the future growth loan scheme.  Those schemes included 3,000 loans to businesses, worth &euro;548 million.</p><p> Probably the most significant was the Covid credit guarantee scheme.  In the first four months it was open, 1,890 loans were given out to a value of &euro;98 million.  The scheme has continued to grow strongly.  We are now at almost 8,000 loans with a value of just over &euro;550 million.</p><p> Microfinance Ireland was key.  It was the first agency to market with a Covid loan fund in March 2020 and 1,300 firms availed of it.  That involved a six-month interest and repayment holiday, as well as reduced interest.  It supported 3,000 jobs.</p><p> We also looked to innovation.  I will later touch on the disruptive technology fund, which funded 43 innovative projects.  We see that as the future for Ireland.</p><p> Apart from direct financial supports, we established a call centre and provided guides for business and a whole range of communications material.  Legislation was to the fore.  We changed company law and employment rights.  We recently introduced a new examinership-lite process, the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, to assist our small and micro companies.</p><p> The Health and Safety Authority is important. It is at the forefront of workplace safety.  It developed the Return to Work Safely Protocol and has revised it several times since.  We are working on it now.  It also took on a new role as the lead agency in co-ordinating compliance right across Government.  All of our agencies and bodies, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Workplace Relations Commission, the Companies Registration Office and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement played vital roles.  They adapted their services.  They were agile and flexible.  They responded, postponed regulatory requirements and provided advice.  </p><p> While the challenges of Covid remain, the reopening of our economy and the return to the workplace has allowed our businesses to get back trading and to remain in business.  Unemployment has fallen from a high of 31.5% in April 2020 to 7.9%.  We are not where we were before the pandemic but we certainly feel that our supports have been key to achieving this progress.</p><p> I note that, with the exception of &euro;6 million provided to the Department at the end of 2020, all of the additional funding was expended solely on business supports.  There were no additional administrative or staffing resources incurred in the Department.  These schemes were developed and delivered under enormous pressure by staff in the Department with our offices and agencies.  The combined efforts were such that we were able to deliver in a timely and efficient manner.  I must put on my record my thanks for the commitment and dedication of those teams.  I am happy to take any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00300"><p>At the outset, I wish Deputy Stanley well in his recovery.  I thank Dr. Quinn for being here.  She has outlined a couple of the key points around the gross expenditure of the Department and its growth in 2020 in comparison to 2019 as the Department reacted to the situation around Covid-19.  Looking at the restart grant, there seems to be quite a number of concerns around the whole process to test eligibility and the effectiveness of its implementation.  That has caused some concern.  The restart grant was important for many businesses and provided them with the financial support they required to reopen.  One could argue that many businesses which felt outside the criteria for that support needed it while others which may not have needed it received the support.  I will ask a couple of questions about the restart grant.  How did it come about in terms of the Department's operations?  How did the notion of providing this type of support arise on day one?  Could Dr. Quinn outline that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00400"><p>I absolutely will.  It arose as a result of many of the meetings we had with stakeholders at that time.  Our advice to Government was that companies were really struggling.  They were struggling to provide the type of Covid equipment that would allow them to remain open.  They were struggling with their banks.  They were struggling with their cash flow because many of them had closed due to Government restrictions.  There was an immediate need to cover fixed costs and the cost of opening, reopening and adapting their businesses.  One of the conditions we were very keen on and that was built into the scheme was that companies would maintain employment.  That was an important factor.  We did not want to wipe out a whole range of small companies.  There are approximately 250,000 small companies in Ireland.  Very many of those are sole traders so they did not come into that scheme.  We were intent on trying to maintain employees in their jobs.  Many of the sole traders qualified under other schemes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00500"><p>I will interrupt to build on a point that Dr. Quinn was making.  She mentioned there are approximately 250,000 businesses that fit the bill.  In terms of the support scheme, an original estimate expected approximately 80,000 businesses to take up the support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00600"><p>That is right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00700"><p>According to information we have received in briefings, there were approximately 57,500 applications.  Some 49,300 had been approved to a value of approximately &euro;195 million.  Would Dr. Quinn explain the gap between the estimate and the uptake?  What does she feel is the rationale as to why that happened?  As I have said, many businesses that were deserving of support did not receive it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#C00800"><p>Our estimate was based on the knowledge we had at the time.  We processed over 109,000 applications between the two schemes.  We spent a lot of time with the sector and explaining the schemes to them.  Under the criteria, companies had to be rate payers to qualify.  They had to have a turnover of less than &euro;5 million.  We were aiming this at small businesses and, in the first round, it was for companies with 50 or fewer employees.  It was aimed at the small business sector.  We expanded that in the second round, the restart plus grant.  Eligibility was expanded to include companies with 250 employees because we picked up from our feedback that companies were struggling.  We expanded the scheme to cater for that.  It was based on self-declaration and we made it simple.  We are quite satisfied that the companies which applied were eligible under the criteria we were maintaining.  A huge number of people are listed as small businesses but work in the construction sector or are sole traders.  They came under other schemes organised by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>Just to cover F&aacute;ilte Ireland and bed and breakfast establishments, the latter was another sector that felt excluded.  From our perspective, we were satisfied that we had a scheme that was easy to apply for but that was rigorous in its intent.  We are satisfied, therefore, that we hit the market and that we reached the cohort that we were trying to reach.  There were 57,000 applications in the first round and we approved 85% of them.  Not everybody who applied qualified.  That is a really important point.  Then we had 65,000 in the second round.</p></speech>

She will be aware that I do not have the luxury of time.</p> <p>  In the context of the process relating to the restart grant, the Department's service level agreement with the local authorities provided for the review of the restart grant scheme when approvals across 31 local authorities reached more than &euro;200 million.  Approximately two months after its introduction, the scheme was replaced by the restart grant plus scheme.  In terms of that process, why did it negate the requirement to complete a review from the Department's point of view?  Dr. Quinn outlined that there were some teething problems and issues.  She referred to tourism.  I was going to use that example because there were many non-rate paying businesses there which were excluded that perhaps should have been given that support.  In my view, their exclusion was a great shame.  Many businesses fell by the wayside as a consequence.  On the fact that the Department stated that the process negated the requirement to complete a review, would Dr. Quinn mind outlining to us why that happened?  Does Dr. Quinn think that was proper practice, from an accounting point of view, in the context of the amount of public money involved?</p></speech>

That was our concern at that point.  One needs to bear in mind that this was done under enormous pressure.  The aim was to get the funding out to businesses quickly.  From our perspective, we reviewed on a weekly basis.  We sat down and looked at who was gaining and who was not, and that allowed us to adapt the scheme, as the Deputy pointed out, for other cohorts very quickly.  In the normal course of events, it would take us more than a year to design and roll out a scheme like this.  We did it in a matter of weeks.  I am quite satisfied that the review kept control of the numbers and that we were plugging gaps.</p> <p>  I would also mention again that we adapted it on a number of occasions for various counties that went into lockdown, such as Laois, Offaly and Kildare.  We did extra payouts for the wet pubs at the time in Dublin and Donegal.  In fact, it was a constant review that we were doing to pick up where there were needs.</p> <p>  We were satisfied, as we went in.  Again, we worked very closely with our stakeholders, both in terms of the regular retail and enterprise forums we have.  We were picking up what was happening on the ground.  Obviously, the local authorities were extremely important to us.  They are on the ground and they know exactly what is happening.  That allowed us to adapt and review as we went along.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall review we have committed to doing, it is important to state that we could only carry it out when the scheme was up and running and we had the experience of it.  If we were to review those on an ongoing basis, I can tell the Deputy that businesses would still be waiting for the money.  The latter was not our aim.</p></speech>

Credit is due in many ways with regard to the work the Department has done.  There have obviously been flaws and issues, however, and the job of this committee is to identify them and to try to the processes involved.  That said, we have to acknowledge that there was a lot of very hard work done rapidly to try to help businesses out.  Nobody here disputes that, but, obviously, our duty is to scrutinise both the accounts and the direction of the Department.</p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to use some of the time I have as follows.  Obviously, where we are now compared with where we were two months is very concerning in the context of the situation with Covid.  Can Dr. Quinn give us any outline from her Department's point of view?  What is the Department planning at present in terms of what may come down the line?  Could Dr. Quinn see us going back to a previous situation?  Is the Department making contingency plans for potentially looking at businesses being forced to close again?  Obviously, we have seen that there will be additional restrictions imposed on the nightclub industry.  That is a considerable worry to many businesses at present.  Has the Department got contingency plans in the event that that should arise because of the unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of this pandemic that we are battling?</p></speech>

When we were designing these schemes and reviewing them, members of the committee and, in particular, the Oireachtas gave us great feedback and helped us on the way there.  I want to acknowledge that.</p> <p>  We keep Covid on our management board agenda on a weekly basis.  Every scheme is under review.  We will obviously look at all contingencies as they develop.  That is obviously working right across Government.  I am on the Covid oversight group, and we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  Many of our schemes are still available to companies.  In fact, all of our loan schemes are still there.  We are still working.  We are looking to extend some of the schemes where we can.  Some of them are part of our EU funding requirements and, again, we keep them under review.  I would say to the Deputy that absolutely everything remains open to us in how we respond.  I take his point.  Covid has certainly had an impact, and we are looking at some challenges for certain sectors.  Some of them come in under the hospitality sector and, again, we will continue to support our colleagues in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on that.</p></speech>

There is an opportunity here for the Department to look at the geographical breakdown in terms of the different local authorities' administrative areas and examine the ability to work with areas where the Department feels that there are teething problems that we need to be dealt with.  If we are going to be dealing with a situation - I hope it does not happen, but it would be prudent for us to plan in this direction - whereby businesses may be forced to close again because of Covid restrictions, then I am of the view that this should be the subject of close scrutiny and analysis by the Department.  Depending on where a business is located, and in the context of the remits of certain Departments, it is not fair that it would not be given the same level of support that colleagues in other local authority areas would be when money is being drawn down from the national schemes.  I am not having a dig at my own local authority - to be fair to Cork County Council, it has been excellent to deal with - but this matter has been raised to me by other elected representatives from across the country.  It can be seen from the data and the analysis that are available to us, as public representatives.  Would Dr. Quinn reply on that point, please?</p></speech>

Clearly, there are fewer enterprises in some local authority areas than there are in others.  Obviously, Cork is a key one and it has many enterprises.  Our regional action plans, which we are working on at present, are key for the Department.  They allow us to take a cross-agency approach at regional level.  We rely heavily on colleagues in other Departments and in the industry sector who head up those plans to keep us in the loop on them.</p> <p>  Certainly, from our perspective, we keep this matter under review.  There are other schemes.  When we did the restart grant, it segued into the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the schemes run by Revenue, which are really important for businesses too.  We have used the money we were allocated in our budget.  If there is more money next year - again, that forms part of the overall review of schemes - we will look at the schemes.  We will also do that in terms of our carryover as well.</p> <p>  From the perspective of the local authorities and their roll-out of the scheme, as already stated, we do review.  We also have, really importantly, the local enterprise offices at local authority level.  They are available to roll things out.</p> <p>  We would have to dig a little bit deeper into the point the Deputy is making.  Is it simply that there are fewer businesses in the areas in question as opposed to it being an issue with the roll-out?  Our feedback from the local authorities was that they were rolling it out.</p></speech>

There is one other key question I want to ask.  The Department has oversight of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, which have quite large budgets of more than &euro;1 billion and &euro;280 million, respectively.  Many areas in the Cork East constituency, which I represent, and in other parts of the country that are outside of the greater Dublin area suffer from high unemployment and do not have sources of local employment.  I refer to the town of Youghal, from which I originally come.  Deputy Sherlock is beside me, and Mallow is in a similar situation, as are Fermoy and other towns in our constituency.  They are crying out for investment from IDA Ireland.</p><p>Is there room for improvement in terms of IDA Ireland locating in regional towns and trying to bring investment out of Dublin into the regions for more balanced regional development?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#E00200"><p>It is one of our policy aims, and one the Government has charged us with, to ensure regional balance.  IDA Ireland has been successful in regional balance in recent years.  I mentioned that more than 50% of all jobs are now outside of Dublin.  I will mention a number of features.  First, IDA Ireland runs the regional action plan.  That takes a regional approach and is led by businesspeople in the regions, which gives us a good oversight role.  Enterprise Ireland's latest figure is that more than 60% of new jobs are being created outside Dublin.</p> <p>  We do not tend to think about a particular area, for example, Youghal, which the Deputy mentioned.  We tend to think of it as a region because there are opportunities for people to commute and travel.  We focus strongly on the region and to the forefront of our policy and aim is to have regional balance.  I should say, particularly from the IDA Ireland side, that companies coming into Ireland make their own decisions.  Quite often, they want to be beside an airport, water source or other feature, depending on their needs.  We cannot control that but we encourage them by providing regional sites.  IDA Ireland purchases advanced sites.  We have advanced manufacturing coming up in Limerick and we try to work that closely on a regional basis which provides a basis for companies to come in, create employment and take up opportunities in other areas outside Dublin.</p></speech>

It is nice to see some familiar faces from my old Department.  I am delighted to have the opportunity to pose some questions.</p><p>I will stay on the Covid-19 restart grant schemes.  In that context, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated:</p> <blockquote> 	A grant scheme that relies on self-declaration should have a number of key controls.  One of these is the completion of post payment checks to ensure that claimants had satisfied the conditions of the scheme and were accordingly entitled to the payments they received. </blockquote> <p>The Secretary General stated: &quot;I should emphasise that any consideration of the oversight of the restart schemes must have due regard to the circumstances in which those schemes were designed and launched&quot;.  We have to try to reconcile the two.  It would be useful to articulate in concise terms how the Department intends to answer the questions posed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is widely acknowledged that money flowed into businesses quickly and it was a responsive scheme in that regard.  However, questions have been posed and it would be useful to understand the timelines for any review or what such a review would look like.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  It is important that the Comptroller and Auditor General made two recommendations.  We fully accept them.  The first concerns the audit of the scheme.  We have commissioned an independent audit company to carry out an audit on that as recommended.  We have had some delay with the company because it has not been able to support a full team but we expect that early in the new year.  That is the first part of the audit.  The other part is important as well and concerns looking at the impact of the scheme.  We plan to perform an evaluation which will look at the longer-term impacts in terms of whether it achieved business survival and job protection and its impact on the public finances.  They are important questions for us to be able to stand over, not least in case, though hopefully not, of future schemes of this nature.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is important that we make sure public money is spent correctly.  There is no question of that.  We kept the criteria simple.  We did it through the local authorities so we knew every business was a rate payer and, therefore, a bona fide<i></i>business.  That was important.</p></speech>

We allocated a certain amount to each local authority, but that changed over time depending on businesses.  It was a funding review concerning who had funding and whether we could release funding from one local authority that was not using it to another that had a greater demand.  It was that type of ongoing review.</p></speech>

When it was adjusted, in August I think it was, the Department said there was no need for that review at the time.  The reform scheme was meant to trigger a review upon payment of &euro;250 million but, despite &euro;633 million being paid, the review has not been carried out to date.  It seems there is little justification for that.  Revenue oversaw the temporary wage subsidy scheme and it had safeguards in place despite the short notice.  As a result of that, Revenue was able to recoup payments made to businesses that should not have qualified.</p><p>Why was the Department unable to put in place similar safeguards in the same period?</p></speech>

Online companies are available to Revenue.  We did not have that.  One of the conditions for our scheme was that companies had to declare a 25% drop in expected turnover.  That was not possible to ascertain at that time, apart from companies that had closed.  It can only be determined afterwards whether companies experienced a 25% drop in turnover.  As I mentioned at the beginning, if that kind of check was done at local authority level for companies that had closed, it would have required an army of staff.  We did not have the online data, which were available to Revenue.</p></speech>

Those reviews were worth nothing because they were not thorough.

I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General about his opinion of the practice of setting up a scheme based entirely on self-certification, and whether it would have been prudent to carry out those scheduled reviews according to the Department's service-level agreement.</p></speech>

The comparison with the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, is interesting.  As the Secretary General said, Revenue has a much better database, so it was in a much better position to address the challenge of getting the money to the businesses that needed it.  Participation in TWSS was known to Revenue.  I certainly support the Department's idea that there should be a review but there were practical difficulties once it came to do the review.  It would have been difficult for the Department to assemble the data.  I understand that the data about individual cases were lodged with individual local authorities.  Even the sectoral analysis of which types of businesses were being supported, the scale of the businesses, and so on, would not have been in the Department's possession at the time.</p> <p>  I do not want to be overly harsh in my assessment of what the Department did.  Neither do I want to suggest that many of the businesses were not entitled to the money.  I think it is likely to be found that many of these businesses were entitled to it.  The difficulty is that opportunistic people may have been able to tick some of the boxes and get money which was never really intended for them.  We should look for lessons for situations where something like this has to be done in the future and identify where there is scope for sharing of information or the best place to locate a funding scheme of this type in an emergency.  Does that address the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

I still think there was a lack of prudence in carrying out the scheduled reviews.  Things that could have been picked up on were not.  Why have it in the Department's service-level agreement if it is not going to be adhered to?  It is part of the Department's service-level agreement but nothing was done about it.</p></speech>

I apologise for missing the opening remarks.  I was in the Chamber.  I apologise if I am going over old ground.  I think the Department's response to an intense crisis in a short time was exemplary.  I acknowledge the questions of my colleagues about reviews and ensuring that public money was spent wisely.  I note what the Comptroller and Auditor General said a moment ago.  I think it is right to say that the majority of businesses applied because they needed the funding to keep their companies afloat or in abeyance for the period of the pandemic.  The feedback that I have got has been positive.  The engagement by the Department was excellent.  I will start from that basis.  It is important that we review the money and the various grants.</p><p>God forbid that we are in another similar situation and we have to respond quickly.  We are obviously going to need to learn from the various situations and the grant systems we put in place.  The local enterprise offices, LEOs, were excellent and the fact we had that local network and an ability to channel money out to businesses, some of which we had been engaging with already, was very important.  I commend all the local authorities and other organisations on their work.</p><p> In the Department&rsquo;s briefing note, at part 3, on page 16, a point of interest to me was the funding in regard to the European Space Agency.  How much is Ireland contributing to that?  I note that, in 2020, 87 Irish companies were under active contract with the European Space Agency, representing a 45% increase in activity since 2016, which is very good to see.  Some &euro;13.3 million in contracts was won by Irish industry from the European Space Agency just last year.  Will Dr. Quinn comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.69" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#G00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words and I will certainly relay them back.  The Deputy mentioned the LEOs and we certainly had huge impact from them.</p> <p>  To turn to the European Space Agency, as the Deputy knows, the purpose is to build a base of innovative Irish companies to develop space technologies, but it is for commercial exploitation in the global space and related markets, and that is very important to us.  We have seen increased export sales and employment, and we have made additional money available to them.  The point we make is that when we send money into the European Space Agency, the companies get contracts to the value of what we invest, so it is a very important approach for us.  More recently, we saw &euro;13 million won by them.</p> <p>  The number of companies has grown by 60% in the past five years.  It is small.  It is up from the 55 companies we had in 2015 and it is now at 87, but they are key, niche companies.  The important part about them is that because they engage across with the IDA sector as well, quite often there can be partnerships and other areas we can then exploit for Ireland to be at the leading global edge on innovation.</p> <p>  For us, where we have additional funding, we have put it in there.  In 2020, for example, three Irish companies were selected by the European Space Agency to develop solutions on satellite and satellite systems.</p></speech>

Is that an annual set amount or does it change?</p></speech>

The annual figure that we provided this year was &euro;18 million.  We then allocated an additional &euro;1.5 million so, again, that was an additional investment by Ireland.</p></speech>

In terms of the restart grants, in particular the restart grant plus, does the Department have a timeframe for when the review might be carried out and how it might be carried out?  Will it be done at a local level through the LEOs or through the funding organisations, or will it be done through the Department?  When will it be done?</p> <p>  My second question, which is not related to the Covid grants, is in regard to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspectors.  This is covered in part 4 of the briefing note from the Department, which was very helpful and very informative.  There were 10,295 workplace inspections and investigations carried out in 2020, with 9,135 inspections which addressed occupational safety and health issues.  Given our discussion earlier about the number of premises that were not open during 2021, how many inspections were carried out?  I know the HSA was involved in many of the health and safety checks in certain industries over the course of the pandemic.</p></speech>

We are outsourcing the audit.  We tendered for it in July, we had three proposals and we awarded the contract in September.  We expect that to be run from the Department but it will most definitely involve the role of the local authorities and engagement with them.  On the timeline, the awarded contractors have had some delays but we are expecting it early in the New Year.  When that audit part is done, we will then commence the evaluation.  As other Deputies have noted, the evaluation is very important for us from the learning perspective in terms of how we might do this in the future.  I cannot give the Deputy a definitive date but we are expecting the audit to be finished by the end of February.  That will allow us to move straight away onto the evaluation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#G00800"><p>The audit will examine that and give us conclusions, and we then have to examine all of that, if there are negative findings.  There are obviously procedures available to us, if need be.</p> <p>  To turn to the Health and Safety Authority, the Deputy asked specifically in the context of Covid and more broadly.  In Covid, the HSA initially started off with a relatively small staff and we needed to expand the inspectorate for Covid.  The HSA took on the lead role in co-ordinating other resources.  We now have inspectorates working collectively from the Workplace Relations Commission, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Education and any of the Government agencies that have an inspectorate.  The environmental health officer is very important.  In total, there are about 700 inspectors now working on the protocol as part of their normal inspection duties.</p> <p>  For the HSA, more than 15,000 investigations and inspections were carried out but, overall, there were in the region of 50,000 inspections of Covid compliance.  It is a huge task.  In the context more recently of the reopening of the night sector, they have been out at 11 p.m., 12 midnight and 1 a.m. doing inspections, so both the number and the time at which they inspect has changed.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

In addition, because it is a huge part of their work, it is important we mention other areas of inspections they do as well, such as farm inspections.</p></speech>

I think there was an original provision of &euro;2 billion for this line of support.  Close to two years into the operation of the scheme, we have reached a quarter of the provision.  It did not need to be a target but it needed to be there for businesses when they looked for it.  Did Dr. Quinn get feedback at any stage from business about difficulties with the banks?  Businesses complained to me, and, I am sure, other to Deputies, about undergoing a long, slow process and the worst thing for any business is a slow "No" after many months of engagement with a bank.  Was that feedback received in the Department?</p></speech>

Part of the response we took was to expand the amount of lenders in the scheme.  Where before we had the pillar banks, we have now included other sources like the credit unions.  We have 15 credit unions working with us to provide the funding.  I take the Deputy's point about the &euro;2 billion in lending but it is a contingency fund.  It is not to say the &euro;2 billion should be drawn down or that there is a fault in the scheme if it is not.</p></speech>

It is not a target, as such, but what you would be watching for though is if you were hearing from businesses that it is difficult to get it.  The original figures show that there was a very slow drawdown at time when you would have thought it might be most needed.  It is worth keeping under review.  The most important thing is that it is there for businesses.</p> <p>  Credit unions were brought in, which was a good thing.  Was that after difficulties or frustration were experienced with the pillar banks?  That was reflected, possibly, back to Deputies from SMEs throughout the country.  What was difficult?  Why was it necessary to do that with the pillar banks receiving such support from the State in other ways?</p></speech>

We heard that feedback.  As I mentioned, we meet regularly with our enterprise forum and it was a feature that came up.  Partly as a response to that, we tried to expand.  Hence the credit unions' involvement, which we see as a positive.  Last year was particularly difficult for businesses, and they simply were not lending.  In comparison with other EU countries, our SME sector tends to borrow less.  We have studied it at various times and the Department of Finance did a review on it recently.  For us, it is about making sure the funding is available and accessible for companies.  That is our aim.  As the Deputy mentioned, we got that feedback from her and other Deputies.  That is why we moved to adapt and grow it.</p></speech>

I will refer to one of the challenges highlighted by business initially.  The scheme was well flagged throughout that first summer of Covid.  I think it was introduced in September 2020 and business was waiting for it, notwithstanding the EWSS, CRSS and other supports.  One of the criticisms was that it was there to finance Covid-related debt as opposed to non-Covid-related debt.  If a business had taken on significant commercial loans to redevelop or refurbish the business or whatever it happened to be, the refinancing of those loans was coming due and this scheme was not available to help refinance that debt, which needed to be serviced in order to continue to operate, particularly with reduced revenue.  Did the Department get that feedback?  How did it adapt to that?</p></speech>

We had other offerings available to people who needed them.  It was specifically for Covid and it was EU funding, so there were criteria that businesses could not refinance their loans.  It was because the offering under this was better than other products.  It was not there to allow everybody to refinance.  It was focused on the exigencies of the pandemic, and we operated on that basis.  I take the Deputy's point that because of people's circumstances they were hit with something that was not expected but the scheme-----</p></speech>

That is the difficulty when you are trying to design a scheme within EU parameters and those relating to the Department.  The reality for business is if, for example, a hotel has been redeveloped over the previous three years and the business has that debt and is capable of refinancing it based on normal returns, revenue and trading, that changes because of Covid.  It has not incurred the debt because of Covid but is unable to pay it because of Covid.  It cannot refinance the debt because it is not covered in that way and it employs 80 or 100 staff who are at risk, notwithstanding the other schemes, which are insufficient to cover that level of financing.  From a business and operational perspective, how do we address that?</p></speech>

That would have been a competition area if we had refinanced bad loans<i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i>others.</p></speech>

They were simply not interested.</p></speech>

It is just to have an overview and an understanding of it.  Another issue, which probably is not to do with the accounts, relates to page 23 of the Department's Covid-19 and Brexit planning document, specifically the permits section of the Department and delivering employment permits.  I understand the Department concentrated on the health sector, which I very much appreciate, and any interaction I had with the Department in regard to that sector was brilliant and immediately taken care of.  However there are other sectors, such as the road transport sector, which has been applying for an employment permit for four stipulated countries and I am told the process has taken between six and nine months.  There is the added difficulty whereby the Department must correspond with the Department of Transport in regard to the driving licence, but Dr. Quinn will have heard and noted, particularly of late, that there is an even further difficulty and crisis within that sector.</p> <p>  Will Dr. Quinn outline for me how she correlates with the Department of Transport to try to speed up the process?  I note the Minister of State, Deputy English, said the quota requirement has been removed.  However, as Dr. Quinn will be aware, because she probably has more insight, that does nothing for the recruitment process because we are talking about countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia and South Africa.  They were not able to obtain 380 employees.  They only filled 180 permits from those jurisdictions, so removing the quota is of no benefit.  What is required here is a look at the jurisdictions.  Dr. Quinn might outline what her Department has prepared on that front.</p></speech>

We have an EU driving licence system, yet we cannot seem to get the RSA to make a move on that.  What I have been hearing from colleagues, Deputies and people within the sector is that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has no difficulty granting the permits; the difficulty is with the licensing sector.  Surely in this day and age and the crisis in which we find ourselves, bearing in mind we have the ongoing Brexit process, and God knows where it is going to end up, Covid-19, and the haulage fraternity has kept the country going, should there not be collaboration and joined-up thinking between these Departments to ensure that sector can operate properly?</p></speech>

I have a concern in regard to the region.  Last week the Department of Transport was before the committee.  In the south east there are Waterford Regional Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The previous Government granted funding of &euro;15 million to Waterford Regional Airport which was to be combined between the local regional councils, with the balance to come from the Department of Transport.  I heard last week that money is no longer on the table.  However, Waterford Regional Airport is in the process of a planning application to extend the runway.  Rosslare Europort, as we know, has had an exponential increase in traffic of 400%, and yet not one shilling in Government funding has come from any Department, except from the Office of Public Works, OPW, which provided housing for the regulatory agencies such as customs.  As Rosslare is now without a doubt the country's most important piece of strategic infrastructure and the regional airport is not far behind, will Dr. Quinn identify for me what is required from a regional perspective to attract the investment?</p></speech>

All of them include our agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices.  What we are looking for is opportunity.  I take the Deputy's point that the port is very important in the context of Brexit.  As the Deputy knows better than I do, the airport has plans for development.  We try to pull together what is specific and what is a draw for the particular region.  It is clear that Waterford benefits from a port and airport but it is a whole-of-government approach as well-----</p></speech>

There was one transaction where a total of &euro;27,000 was paid in both interest and compensation for late payment.  What was the size of that bill to begin with?</p></speech>

It was not a situation that I could in any way stand over.  As soon as it came to my attention, we paid the bill immediately.  We did a review internally.  Even after that, I asked our head of internal audit to take it on and to do a separate review of all of our procedures to ensure that this could not happen again.  In his report to me and to the management board, he noted that it was an exceptional case and that it was not indicative of any wider problem.  However, we did review our compliance across all of our payments.  We found that we are pretty much average across other Departments.  We only had one late payment, for example, in 2019.  The figure in that case was &euro;3,000.  We accepted all of the recommendations that the auditor put forward around segregation of duties, financial procedures and records management.  We accepted everything in that report.</p></speech>

I want to ask some questions about the vacancies there.  It is an important office.  It will be moving to a new office.  I think it is due to do so in the new year.  The legislation is certainly going through the House at the moment.  It may well have just concluded, although I am not sure what stage it is on, or if it is before the Seanad.  One of the issues with the underspend was to do with recruitment of staff.  Where is that now?</p></speech>

In technical areas such as the IT side and the cyber side the pay rates in the private sector are difficult for us to match.  We have had a significant number of different appointment processes.  There is one ongoing at the moment with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement for specialist skills.  There has been an increase.  They have changed not just the legislation - as members are aware, that is going through - but even prior to that, we changed the roles within the office.  It is far more technical now with specialist skills than was the case previously.  At the end of 2020, there were 43 staff engaged in the ODCE, including nine members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The figure for the previous year was 41.  We are working on it.</p></speech>

Obviously, that cost has increased since.  That was the collective cost over a couple of decades.  If you do not pay, it is not all going to fall within this particular area, but some of it will.  We pay for this one way or the other.  It is far better to take a preventative approach rather than a reactive approach.  An organisation such as this, with real teeth, is very important.  I think we are missing the boat in terms of embedding bigger powers, including the right to arrest and things like that, but that is a policy area.  Has a business case been made in respect of the staffing issues?  If the Department cannot get certain grades of workers and is competing against the private sector, has a business case been made in respect of particular skill sets?</p></speech>

It is not just in the ODCE; it is across a range of areas.  We are currently being more successful because we tend to be more attractive in times when the economy is at a lower ebb, and then <i>vice versa</i>.  We have considered it and made special arrangements.  Staff in particular grades might start further up the scale.  Obviously, we work closely with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when we look to particular sanctions for particular jobs.  At this point, we have had a significant amount of work done to increase, for example, the number of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the organisation in particular.  As the Vice Chairman is probably aware, its representation is due to increase from nine to 16.  These discussions are ongoing and we are very keen that, as a new statutory agency commencing its work, it must have the resources it needs to take on this new role.</p></speech>

I can provide an update in terms of staffing because those discussions have been going on for a long time.  I met with all of the team a year ago.  My understanding is that the existing staff and their expertise will continue to be available.  My apologies - I am backtracking now because I have to reflect back on our previous discussions.  They will stay for two years and within that period we will work with them to see if there are options they wish to consider further.

No more than other bodies, the WRC showed a significant amount of agility and moved very swiftly to hold online hearings.  That was a change in business.  Some individuals did not want to do online hearings.  There was a whole range of issues, as the Vice Chairman can well imagine, that had to be developed in terms of setting that up.  The same was true in the case of the Labour Court.</p> <p>  In terms of the caseload, first, it had a significant number of calls, with more than 50,000, but in terms of the remote hearings the number was low initially, with an 85% objection rate.  However, that has since changed as people have become more familiar with the technology.  My understanding is that almost 2,000 adjudication hearings were held in 2020 but that is less than half the number held in 2019.  That is on the adjudication side.

I understand local authorities had the information in terms of who the rate payers were and how the scheme was structured.  I, too, got a lot of compliments from people who said it was the difference between staying afloat and going under.  I understand there was speed associated with that, but that does not mean there should not be care.  I think Dr. Quinn fully accepts that.</p> <p>  As regards the lessons or takeaways in terms of not leaving good things that happened during the pandemic behind us, will there be a different relationship between the LEOs and the Department?  Is it envisaged that there would be a different role or is there anything being considered from that point of view?  Are new datasets being gathered?

I take my hat off to them.  They worked fantastically.  At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a proposal to take them out because it was thought they would not be needed.  I think all present are aware we fought very hard to make sure they stayed where they were.  I refer to the relationship and, as the Vice Chairman stated, how we approach this matter.</p><p>We are always keen to blend and make sure that the LEOs are closely aligned with Enterprise Ireland, which they are.  We are keen to grow that and make sure that it is successful.  We have seen 130 companies transfer from LEOs to Enterprise Ireland.  We are trying to make sure that there is a seamless approach.  People start small, locally, but then have the capacity to grow and scale.  Our approach is-----</p></speech>

Creating a job through IDA Ireland, for example, costs approximately &euro;5,900.  I will come back to the Chair about the cost for creating a job through a LEO.  The difference between them is the earnings capacity.  The average IDA Ireland job has an earning capacity of approximately &euro;78,000 and Enterprise Ireland has a capacity of &euro;54,000.  The earning capacity of a job created through Enterprise Ireland is 32% of the average and a job created through IDA Ireland is 90% above the average.  The earning capacity of jobs created through LEOs tends to be lower, since start-ups are involved.  From our perspective, they should be focused on and grown, because they are in every part of the country and have been successful.  They created 5,500 jobs last year.  That is a great credit to them during the pandemic.</p></speech>

We have charge of the skills needs in the economy and employment permits.  Twice a year, we run an in-depth assessment of what skills are in the economy and what skills are needed, when considering employment permits.  We do not do that ourselves.  We do it collectively across Government, working with colleagues.  We do not necessarily always have the data for some of those skills, including related to transport, but we expect our colleagues in the Department of Transport would have it.  In the same way, we would not assess health needs, but we would certainly expect our colleagues in the Department of Health to know.  We do a review twice a year.  Based on that review, the Minister decides what sectors are open or not.  The Department of Transport would be part of that review.  We encourage people to come to the table with the needs as identified.  From an enterprise perspective, we would certainly have a view that transport is important.</p></speech>

This is where the issue seems to be.  As I said, there are two defined issues.  One relates to licensing and the other to the employment permit itself.  With the current system for granting permits, the sector is unable to access employees satisfactorily.  Outside that, no other jurisdiction has agreed a licence with Ireland.  The Ukrainian licence is accepted in other EU jurisdictions, as I pointed out.  The IRHA is becoming frustrated that nobody seems to be collaborating on these two aspects.  I am assuming, or at least, I have been told that the association has made representations to both Departments.  It may not be to Dr. Quinn but to the Minister.  I will check that and I will follow up with Dr. Quinn.  It is a simple issue to resolve, which we do not need to get into a crisis over.  I have to follow up on it, with what I know about it.</p> <p>  I have a question about proof of eligibility for schemes.  There were defined eligibility criteria for the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, but when we moved on to the restart grant schemes, I do not believe that eligibility criteria were set down.  Am I right about that?</p></speech>

In the case of the restart grant scheme, the Department did not specify the proof that may be required to confirm eligibility for the restart scheme.  Therefore, it may be difficult to verify the claims paid.  Does that effectively give an out to those who were not eligible?</p></speech>

If it is okay, I will bring in my colleague, Mr. Declan Hughes, because there have been a number of questions about how we reviewed this between the scheme ending in July and the August scheme.  On the commercial side, a company had to be a ratepayer, have turnover, and have a self-declaration, which I think is what is causing some concern.  We were not in a position to assess that at that time.  They had to commit to retain employees on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  That commitment was made, but we would not have been in a position to verify it at that point in time.  Deputy Verona Murphy asked how we will run the review and why that was not done in July.  I think Deputy Munster asked about that too.  I will ask Mr. Hughes to speak on this.  He was in charge of it at the time and might be able to help the committee more.</p></speech>

It will look at the applicants.  There will be spot-checks across local authorities and sectors.  It will look specifically at the declarations that were made.  It was a self-declaration, but it was clear to the individuals that they should retain those records and that they would be subject to further checks.  That will be part of the evaluation.  It is about the turnover levels, the sectors that they were in, the TWSS etc.</p></speech>

Essentially, we asked for a self-declaration relating to accounts.  When it came to the small business assistance scheme for COVID, SBASC, that we subsequently launched, and we had more time to develop it, we asked that individuals upload their accounts.  That is the type of proof we will be seeking when we go back to do the spot checks in respect of the accounts that were held at the time.  As they were on the rates system, the local authorities knew the business and the size and scale of the business.</p></speech>

They are known to the local authorities and the local authorities have a relationship with them either in terms of existing rates payments or outstanding rates and so forth.  It is on that basis we will be working on those.  Where there may be reclaims or other issues arising we will deal with it through the local authority system.</p></speech>

There were a number of parties involved in the assessments.  In many cases it was the rate officer together with the finance unit and, in some cases, with the local enterprise office, which would have known those businesses and perhaps were involved in the verification as well.  However, as I said, it will be an independent audit.</p> <p>  To come back to the service level agreement, SLA, it specifically provided that we would undertake the review at &euro;200 million.  The scheme was launched in May.  By the middle of June we had allocated &euro;38 million.  At that stage, in the negotiations for the programme for Government and with feedback from Members of the Oireachtas, we were already in the middle of a review.  We assigned an assistant principal officer as an additional member of the team to undertake a review.  It was not an independent external review as envisaged in terms of the evaluation.  That review then fed into the redesign of the scheme for restart plus, which was launched as part of the July stimulus.  That came in early in August.  Restart grant 1 was to run until the end of August and it would have been completed but it was subsequently overtaken by restart grant 2.  We never reached the &euro;200 million for restart grant 1.</p></speech>

Is he on the call?  There is nobody indicating yet so I will ask a few further questions.  To pick up on the point about permits and the critical skills, and this question is for Dr. Quinn, has the critical skills list been updated or is it being updated?  I understand it dates back to approximately 2006, and things will have changed.  I could be wrong about that, but that is my understanding.  I am getting queries from sectors such as construction and healthcare for permits for people from outside the EU.  It may well be an issue with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Transport would be the other area.  Is the critical skills list being updated?  The last time I looked at it with regard to construction, it was architects as opposed to plumbers.  That is the type of query I am receiving.</p></speech>

We do it twice yearly.  Most recently, on the construction side, for example, almost all construction jobs are now eligible for a permit, and that includes pretty much all construction.  They have been reviewed and are included.  It is probably distinguishing between the critical skills and the general employment permits, and the new ones in the construction sector have come in under the general employment permits scheme.  Also, I should mention that we have an expert group on future skills and there is the skills and labour market research unit in SOLAS.

Often they are recruited as care assistants in nursing homes and the like.  My feedback is that the experience one gets is of a very high level of skill.  However, they are not included.  Is there any consideration of that type of thing, where there is no equivalence in the recognition?</p></speech>

We brought in almost 4,500 nurses since the pandemic, but they would be registered according to the registration that is required by the Department of Health.  The Department of Health would have to revisit the equivalence for people who do not match our skills.  That has not happened as far as I am aware.</p></speech>

That may well have been to do with vacancies.  The offices are the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Health and Safety Authority and other offices.  The agencies are, by and large, the bigger number with 1,700.  What is the vacancy rate across all three?  If you do not have it, will you provide it to the committee?  What is the rate of people who are out sick?  I am looking for the non-Covid rate.  It may be that 2019 is a better example of that.  Regarding maternity cover, is there a plan for maternity cover?  In too many organisations there are gaps in the full complement of staff and often there is no maternity cover, sometimes in critical areas.</p></speech>

They are the civil servants.  The agencies, the IDA and EI, are recruited separately within their recruitment processes.  There is no problem getting the committee those data.  From the Civil Service perspective, vacancy tends to be at around 3%.</p><p>Our sick leave has gone down during Covid for a variety of reasons.  I suspect it is because people can work from home.  From what I mentioned earlier, it is clear that our productivity levels, I am proud to say, have gone through the roof.  I am very pleased with that.</p><p> On the point the Deputy made about maternity cover, we are very positive in terms of replacing people who are on maternity where necessary.  As the Deputy knows, the general practice is that such people are not replaced, but we look on that very much on a job perspective basis.  Where somebody is in a priority area, we replace that person.  We sometimes carry that vacancy somewhere else or we increase our staff budget to replace that person for a while.  It is very much on a needs-must basis.</p></speech>

It is one of the reasons the hybrid model may well be a positive we need to take from the pandemic, rather than just dwelling on the negatives of it.  It is good to hear about the maternity cover because we hear from people who say that they are coming back to work but their desk has a pile of stuff on it.  It is all the more reason it makes it unattractive to come back.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point the Comptroller and Auditor General just made, but I will ask Dr. Quinn about the Department's general oversight of the Microfinance Ireland, MFI, loans.  Dr. Quinn said in her opening statement that in the relevant period, especially through the Covid pandemic, Microfinance Ireland supported 1,300 businesses supporting close to 3,000 jobs.  From the Department's perspective, how does it monitor the key performance indicators, KPIs, and the performance of Microfinance Ireland?  How does all that sit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.231" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01100"><p>Interestingly, Microfinance Ireland is coming more closely back into the Department, which is a change we are working on.  We would certainly monitor closely.  We have a senior official on the board of MFI, which gives us very good insight into the data and operation of the organisation.  We also keep a very strong watching brief.  MFI has to give us details of approvals of loans.  Again, we always have a liaison team assigned to each of our agencies to monitor their performance, the drawdown, where the spend is and where money is not being spent.  We also receive a quarterly performance report from each of them, which the management board examines and assesses if there are areas of concern.  Does that the answer the Deputy's question sufficiently?</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Murphy, covered some of this previously.  I appreciate the Comptroller and Auditor General's point about coming back to it later.</p> <p>  I will go back to the point we discussed at the outset, which was the review of the restart grant.  I know that body of work - the major review and not the more ongoing work - is yet to be done in the Department.  What does Dr. Quinn believe that review is likely to generate?  What is her sense of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.233" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01300"><p>My sense is that we put a lot of money into the economy at a critical time to support businesses.  I would be very surprised if we find a high rate of abuse of that scheme because of the criteria that were set in terms of commercial rates, businesses closed and 25% turnover.  Until we see the full data, which we obviously will, I would say we set the criteria sufficiently high while at the same time making sure that people were able to get access to the funds quickly.  It was always that balance between the public finances and the code when we were trying to achieve good.</p> <p>  We had never done this kind of scheme before.  It is perhaps something we will look at as part of the review.  We had to find operators that were close to the ground and we picked the local authorities.  It was done in an emergency.  It was not one I would have stood over if I was asked to roll out a scheme to support businesses.  It was done in an emergency.  It achieved what we wanted it to achieve.  I look forward to the evaluation because there will be huge learning.  If this happened again, is it the Department that does it?  Should we have rolled it out directly via the local authorities?  There were all these questions at the time.  When I look back, we put our hands up and said we would manage and do it because somebody had to do it at the time.  There was such pressure on those small businesses.</p></speech>

However the review goes, I know the businesses in my constituency that needed the grant got it.  Even where they were not aware they were eligible for it and then became aware and went back, they still got it.  It was the difference between surviving and not at many stages.</p></speech>

The areas we had very much focused on prior to that were the traded and export sectors.  It was new for us too and we have learned a lot as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01800"><p>It is interesting Dr. Quinn should say that, because most people in Ireland are employed by much smaller enterprises, in many respects.  On some of what Dr. Quinn said, for example, on hairdressers, I was in touch with them through Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, and they were hugely concerned about the emergence of an even stronger black market in their sector and what that meant.  As a group of employers who were largely female entrepreneurs hiring largely, but not exclusively, female staff, with all the pressures they were already facing plus a stronger black market economy and how to counter that, I would have thought it was probably a good thing for the Department to be more closely linked with that kind of very on-the-ground retail business.</p> <p>  One of the things I worried about at the time was the risk regarding insurance costs or insurance hikes.  We have seen very strong inflationary pressure in the economy, in the past six months in particular.  There are international forces at play in that.  A big force are the direct cash transfers made to businesses and individuals throughout the pandemic period.  Will the Department look at some of those broader effects, or if they are linked effects, in the course of its review as well as the actual operation of the scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021111800002#P01900"><p>We will certainly look at the broader impact as well.  There is no doubt we will be looking at the impact of the pandemic, what we did and what we could have done, for a long time to come.  Insurance was certainly a factor.  As the Deputy knows, the T&aacute;naiste chairs the insurance group.  The bit we have in it is the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  We have had some very good results there in terms of the judicial guidelines and the work we did collectively across the Government.  We have an interest in anything that affects enterprise.  It might not necessarily be ours, but we do have a very strong cross-government approach.</p><p>Even to take the example the Deputy raised about the black economy, with regard to the hairdressers, we would have had detailed discussions with the Department of Social Protection, feeding back some of that comment as well.  Again, while we do not always have the levers ourselves, we do have a strong voice.</p></speech>

She said that, in other circumstances, it might have taken a year to put a scheme of that kind together.  We saw the same quick delivery of schemes in the Department of Social Protection with the PUP and CRSS.  For the future, is there some timeframe between three weeks and a year, given we might have learned that we can do things more aggressively in the future?</p></speech>

It is certainly our aim to be flexible and to respond as quickly as we can, but always bearing in mind the need to ensure that the public finances are correct and that people get what they are entitled to and not anything else.  That is some of the discussion we had earlier and it is an exercise that we will try to make sure we conduct.  I hope that as part of the evaluation, if not necessarily of the audit, elements of that will come through to us.</p></speech>

In Dr. Quinn's Department, it is very important to be responsive immediately to all of the different parts of the economy and its different sectors, and perhaps this will be considered in the evaluation.  Of course, our good friend, Mr. McCarthy, has a very important role to play but speed and responsiveness are key in responding in such a small, open economy with the different pressures it faces.  Let us hope it ends up being that little bit speedier.</p></speech>

Given our conversation in regard to work permits, while I am not long elected, I have been voicing concerns about work permits since being elected.  In Wexford, we are currently experiencing a huge deficit in regard to CAMHS staff recruitment.  It took three years to find an applicant to accept the senior child psychologist position.  Now, we are in a position where, for 12 months, the HSE has been advertising for a dietician and there is no applicant to take the position.  There are 549 families who have been granted a home care support package but we do not have the employees in the private sector, who could make the provision of services available to the HSE, or within the HSE itself to deliver those home care support hours.  This year&rsquo;s budget was lauded because home care support hours were increased by 1.5 billion hours and funded, which hugely increased the hours.  However, the hours cannot be delivered so, essentially, the funding will never be used.  I hope Mr. Hughes understands me.  I am just asking where all of that comes back to his Department with regard to finding somebody to deliver those job specs.  We need to bear in mind a home care support package is generally for applicants over the age of 66 who probably have long-term illness or are in serious need of short-term care.</p></speech>

Essentially, for healthcare occupations, the supply and demand side is led by the Department of Health, working with SOLAS.

As the Secretary General mentioned earlier, there is engagement, whether it is with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of the meat and dairy sector, the Department of Health or the Department of Transport.  All of the sectors would have had an input to that review which was done recently and published at the end of October.  The Secretary General talked about HGV drivers, agricultural workers, horticultural workers and so on.  That was all fed into that review process, which was undertaken by the Department and informed by the expert group on future skills needs.  It is not my area directly but that is the position.  We would be happy to brief the Deputy separately on it.</p></speech>

Perhaps the issues I want to raise have been raised so I hope our guests will bear with me.</p> <p>  I thank the Department for the work done in a very difficult 24 months and for the progress it made in retaining jobs and helping to create new jobs.  With regard to a review of jobs over the last five years, we spoke in the last meeting about value for money and retention of jobs.  Has an analysis been done by the IDA and the Department in regard to job creation where support grants were provided in order to find out, five years on, what number of those jobs are still in place and whether we got value for money for the grants paid out in different areas?  Has detailed analysis been done on that by the Department in the last few months?</p></speech>

We would obviously keep an ongoing review of all of the agencies and their performance, the jobs created, where they are created and where they are lost.  It is ongoing but we check at particular times because all grants that are given by the IDA or Enterprise Ireland for any jobs sustained are repaid if those jobs subsequently do not materialise or the company is lost to Ireland.  We would keep those records in detail.</p></speech>

For example, for any year of the last five years where grants were provided, what percentage of those jobs are still in place and what percentage have not lasted more than 12 months, two years or three years?  Have we any kind of detailed analysis of that?</p></speech>

I do not have it to hand but we certainly would have that type of analysis available to us.  It has to inform all of our future planning in terms of the sectors we concentrate on.  We have had a number of reviews over the years, not least the public spending review of the impact of our supports on our enterprise agencies.  I can certainly make that available to the Deputy after the meeting.</p></speech>

Is there an 80% or 90% retention, or is it less than that?</p></speech>

If we look at the growth in our agencies, we are now at 257,000 jobs in IDA companies and more than 230,000 jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies.  They have been huge growth areas and, even with the pandemic, those numbers have gone up substantially since last year.  I would say to the Deputy - again, without the data - that it would be a very high number in terms of retention.</p></speech>

There are certain key areas where we have difficulty in filling jobs.  I know the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was involved with the meat industry through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In the healthcare sector, for example, we have a difficulty in the nursing home care area.  Have there been discussions with the Department of Health in dealing with that?  I just came in at the end of Deputy Murphy's question so this may have been dealt with.  In the private nursing homes, there are about 23,000 residents, so a fairly substantial number of staff are needed.</p><p>Quite a number of people who worked in the area have retired for very genuine reasons.  The home care area in Cork and Kerry run by the HSE is something for which we cannot bring in people from abroad to deal with and the number of workers in the area has reduced from 1,800 being available to provide home care down to 1,400 in the past 12 months.  Therefore, we see challenges in that area.  As there are also particular challenges in the nursing home area, what engagement has occurred with the relevant Departments on the matter?</p></speech>

Last year we did three, again because of Covid-19 and its impact.  We are very much guided by the individual sectors and the Department of Health is clearly very important.  More broadly, we must always achieve a balance between those who are on the live register, creating jobs and bringing in people.  It is the type of evidence we expect from Departments.  I mentioned earlier that last year, for example, we prioritised the healthcare sector in particular because of the pandemic and we brought in over 4,000 nurses in 2020.  We also brought in over 4,000 doctors to support our colleagues in the health sector.  We had over 9,000 employment permits just in the health sector alone that came in 2020.</p></speech>

My understanding from nursing homes is that they have had a very poor response from the Department of Health on this type of assistance.  We have seen an increase in nursing staff and doctors but not in care assistants or in other areas.</p></speech>

These may not be skilled jobs, perhaps.  If the Department of Health comes to us to make a case and provides evidence that those skills are not available in the nursing homes sector-----</p></speech>

Do any substantial changes need to be made in view of the fact that Covid-19 has brought huge changes?  There is also the issue of the UK no longer being part of the European Union.  Should we be exploring new avenues as a result?  As we are the only English-speaking country within the European Union, are there further opportunities to grow jobs that we should now be using, with policies being adopted accordingly?</p></speech>

We are exploring all possible options.  It is one of the main selling points now used by IDA Ireland in any of its promotional and marketing opportunities that we are the English-speaking member of the European Union and in demonstrating the talent and skills we have.  That is built in very strongly to its message.  From our perspective, we must look to other opportunities.  We have seen much from companies here gaining access and changing supply chains as a result of perhaps no longer being able to access companies in the UK.  It is a very fluid position now and we see it as a major advantage.  There is a major opportunity for companies but there is a tricky bit for them first if they want to move to other markets.  For our companies, the English-speaking UK is a near and good market.  Enterprise Ireland is very strongly focused on growing out the capacity of the sector across Europe and more broadly, as well as inward investment.  We see that as a major potential advantage and one we are all working on collectively.</p></speech>

The first is from the Donegal Education and Training Board and relate to 2020.  That received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The financial statements from the Ombudsman for Children's Office also received a clear audit opinion for 2020.  </p> <p>  The 2020 accounts for Ciste Pinsean Thithe an Oireachtais ar fad c&oacute;lta&iacute;, the pension fund for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The 2020 accounts for the Longford and Westmeath Education and Training Board received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The 2020 financial statements for Microfinance Ireland, the provision of additional funding for which was mentioned during the meeting this morning, received a clear audit opinion.  However, I draw attention to note 9 in the financial statements.  It discloses that there was a provision charge for 2020 of &euro;11.4 million in respect of bad and doubtful loan debts.  At the end of 2020, the total of specific and collective provisions for loan bad debts amounted to &euro;13.3 million on outstanding loan advances totalling &euro;30.2 million.  What a provision is doing is looking at the quality of the loans and anticipating that losses will be incurred in the future.  That is a significant increase in the provision in the year, largely because of additional lending to businesses that were operating in a Covid environment.  It is anticipated there will be a higher level of losses incurred as a result of that.</p> <p>  The final set of accounts presented are the annual financial statements for Science Foundation Ireland for 2020.  There is a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

Agreed.  As usual, the listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that have not been flagged for discussion for the meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee's web page.  Five items of correspondence have been flagged in this category.</p> <p>  I will move to consider correspondence from Accounting Officers, Ministers, or both, and relating to follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 872B was received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, dated 5 November 2021.  It provides information requested by the committee arising from the fact that the Revenue did not accept certain recommendations in the committee's most recent report on its engagement with Revenue.  The committee asked Revenue to clarify to what extent it can investigate the financial and sectoral implications of a voluntary PAYE system agreed by Revenue and courier firms in March 1997, as well as a copy of the 2019 European Commission inspection report on the control strategy for customs values and repayments.  I have flagged this item for discussion, as have Deputies Carthy and Stanley.  I suggest we hold it over until next week as I know it is of interest to Deputy Stanley.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 873B is correspondence from Ms Marie-Claire Maney, chairperson of the Tax Appeals Commission, dated 8 November 2021.  It responds to the committee's request for information relating to tax settlements between the Revenue Commissioners and Perrigo.  The chairperson states that due to its statutory obligations around the confidentiality of appellants, rather than any reluctance to respond to oversight, the commission cannot provide such information.  The chairperson goes on to detail the relevant statutory provisions, stating that if a settlement is agreed at any stage before the commission makes a determination, the appeal is treated as having been withdrawn and the parties need only notify the commission of the settlement.  As such, the commission has no role in the tax settlement agreed between Perrigo and the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  The chairperson also provides an update on the current status of the top ten appeals by quantum.  The most recent update was provided for our meeting with the commission on 8 July.  It is worth noting that the aggregate quantum of tax under appeal has reduced from &euro;4.5 billion in January 2021 to &euro;1.55 billion on 8 November 2021.  We have also requested detailed information from Revenue relating to this settlement, which is due today.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Carthy and I have flagged it.</p> <p>  No. 874B is correspondence from Ms Cliodhna Guy, interim chief executive officer of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, dated 8 November 2021.  It provides further information requested by the committee about the installation of CCTV cameras at racecourses.</p><p>The interim CEO states that it has concluded the evaluation of the tenders for the installation of CCTV systems in racecourse stable yards, and that the board continues to work to the previously stated timeframe for installation to be completed at each racecourse prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  The interim CEO also notes that the cost of the system is considerably higher than what had been allocated by Horse Racing Ireland previously and on that basis the matter is currently with the Horse Racing Ireland board for approval.  It is proposed to note and publish the item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Deputy Imelda Munster and I flagged this item, but I do not think she is present.  It would be useful to get a breakdown of the cost of the new system to include the installation costs and an update pack when the sanction to the purchase is granted.  I presume it will do that, but it would be no harm for us to request it.</p><p> No. 875B is correspondence from Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 8 November 2021 in which he provides information on updated arrangements for public bodies presenting their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General and, following their audit, the arrangements for laying them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It arises from a 2018 report of the last Committee of Public Accounts, which highlighted the inconsistency in the obligations of when public bodies must present their financial accounts to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.</p><p> The new arrangements, as set out in Circular 24 of 2021, require that, unless otherwise specified in legislation, annual accounts should be presented to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit no later than three months after the close of the financial year.  As the accounts are laid before the Houses and brought to the attention of this committee by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the circular also removes the need for audited bodies to arrange for copies of audited accounts to be submitted to the committee.  This requirement was not being complied with in the majority of cases in any event.  In most cases, once the Comptroller and Auditor General has certified accounts, the accounts must be laid before the Houses within three months.  Members will be aware that this committee has a standing agreement to write to any bodies that are late in laying their audited accounts before the Houses.  However, this circular, as was the case with the one it replaces, includes a requirement, at paragraph 9, that the clerk to this committee be notified where there is an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits.  In practice, this is not being done.  If it were, it would remove the need for us to write to bodies to request explanations for late laying of accounts.</p><p> It is proposed to note and publish the item, to thank the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for providing the updated circular and to request that it remind Departments of the requirement to inform the clerk if statutory accounts are being presented later than the specified time limits and to explain the delay.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I hope our consistent following up where accounts were late had a role in putting that onto a more formal footing.</p></speech>

The Secretary General states that in September the Minister for Foreign Affairs requested that the Department undertake a review of the role and appointment of special envoys, and make specific recommendations on how future appointments will take place through a competitive process.  The terms of reference are included.  The Secretary General states that the report arising from the review will go before Government at the next available opportunity and that the Minister&rsquo;s intention is to publish the report following its consideration by Government.</p><p>Regarding expenditure in the Department&rsquo;s accounts relating to special envoys, almost &euro;70,000 was spent on travel and subsistence in 2020.  The Secretary General clarifies that no remuneration was paid to special envoys in 2020.  However, in recognition of their work as special envoys he states that it was decided to pay each of the six retired special envoys an <i>ex gratia</i>payment of &euro;5,000 per year for each of the two years of their work on the campaign.  While the Secretary General states that one of the special envoys waived this <i>ex gratia</i>payment, it was paid to the other five retried staff in January 2021, totalling &euro;50,000, which was &euro;10,000 each.  Special envoys who were then serving staff of the Department, the then Minister and the then Deputy did not receive any remuneration for their roles as special envoys.</p><p>It is proposed note and publish the item and request a copy of the report once it is published, as well as the basis for the <i>ex gratia</i>payments to special envoys.

The term &quot;<i>ex gratia</i>&quot; just refers to the fact that there is no scheme in place under which the payment is made.  I think it has no bearing on the taxability of it.  I will check it and come back to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I do not think it is appropriate to state that no remuneration was paid and then state in the same paragraph that an <i>ex gratia</i>payment amounting to nearly &euro;100 per week was provided.  This again highlights the need for a structure in respect of the concept of special envoys and the process involved because it all appears to be incredibly <i>ad hoc</i>, as was prominent for a period.</p></speech>

Obviously, that is self-explanatory.  I again ask the committee to agree to make those inquiries.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 881C is from Mr. Tadhg Daly, chief executive officer of Nursing Homes Ireland, dated 9 November 2021.</p><p>It requests an update on the implementation of the recommendations in our report regarding the examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 110 - Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Fair Deal Scheme), which was published in January.  One of the recommendations was that the value for money review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme be published without delay.  It was initiated by the Department of Health in March 2018 and was due for publication in March 2019.  Over two and a half years later it has still not been published.  We looked for an update on this review and on the report concerning the costs and timeline for the national children's hospital from the Department on 18 October and issued a reminder earlier this month but have not yet received a response.  It is proposed to provide Nursing Homes Ireland with the updates the committee has received in respect of the implementation of its recommendations and to advise that the Department of Health will appear before the committee on 16 December.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Deputy Munster flagged an item of correspondence.  We could hold it over.  That is probably the fairest thing to do, so she has an opportunity to address it.  If we can move on to the work programme, it is agreed until the end of the year.  We previously agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November.  It is suggested that we do so next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Does any member wish to raise anything in respect of the work plan?  We will be coming back to it next week anyway.  Is there any other business?  I take it there is not.  We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until Thursday, 25 November, when we will engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p></speech>

In order to provide for the smooth running of the meeting, I draw the committee's attention to a couple of housekeeping points.  If any member is acting in substitution for a member of the committee, he or she should notify the clerk to the committee now if he or she has not already done so.  Divisions will be taken as they arise and members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that pursuant to the Standing Order, he or she may move his or her amendment and request a division, but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.  That is in relation to those who are deputising.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p></speech>

Amendment 158 introduces section 653AM to deal with situations where nobody has come forward as the owner of a site that is within the scope of this tax.  This measure provides that where the owner of such a site does not register with Revenue the site may become the property of the State.  If an owner has registered with Revenue, Revenue will use its normal collection mechanisms to collect the tax and interest due.  This provision only applies where no owner has been identified.  It will only apply where the tax and interest owing and charged on the land exceeds 110% of the market value of the site.  Once the amount of unpaid tax and interest exceeds 110% of the market value, the first step is that Revenue will place a notice in<i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>setting out that this process is commencing.  After six months, if nobody has come forward and registered as the owner of the land, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can make an application to the High Court to have the site concerned made property of the State.  The High Court can then make such directions as it thinks are appropriate in relation to publication or otherwise before making the order sought.  While it is envisaged that the Revenue Commissioners will rely on this measure only in limited circumstances, its inclusion is an important tool in targeting non-compliance in circumstances where the tax due on a site within the scope of residential zoned land tax is not paid and the landowner is not forthcoming in meeting its obligations. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 131 and 133 place two additional requirements on owners of a site where they are making a submission to the local authority on either a draft map or a supplemental map.  These two additional requirements are, first, that the owner's submission includes a map from Ordinance Survey Ireland that clearly identifies the site and, second, the owner may be asked to provide evidence of ownership to the local authority.  Both of these additional requirements are necessary to ensure that the appeals procedure, where a landowner can appeal a decision of the local authority, can operate as intended. </p><p>Amendments Nos. 160 and 161 seek to provide for reports in regard to the RZLT.  On amendment No. 160, the Deputies may note that in setting the initial rate for this tax great care needs to be taken to get the balance right between it achieving its essential purpose of encouraging the release of land for home building purposes, but at the same time not being too penal that it runs the risk of being challenged in the courts.  If I were to apply a rate of 25% from the outset, it would change significantly the economics of making a return on capital invested in the land as a business asset and this could make the business model unviable, which would be counterproductive and damaging to the goal of meeting our house building objectives over the next number of years.  It is important to see how the tax operates and to then make an assessment as to whether it is working.  If it is not leading to an increase in land being released for housing purposes, I will have no hesitation in reviewing the rate, if I deem it likely that this will help the situation.  In summary, I believe the 3% rate is an appropriate rate to apply when this tax comes into force in two years' time, as I am of the view it will encourage landowners to either develop their land or sell it to others for development purposes.  In doing this, the supply of land available will increase.  This should be reflected in a stabilisation of land prices.  It is for this purpose, I cannot agree to the amendment seeking this report.</p><p>On amendment No. 161 and the Deputies' wish that I produce a report estimating the likely financial impact of the exclusions, exemptions, deferrals and abatements from the residential zoned land tax contained in this section with a view to removing any or all of them before the tax comes into effect my views are as follows.  In order for this tax to be effective it is necessary that there be exclusions, including, among other things, residential dwellings and their gardens, certain infrastructure or facilities including utilities, transport, and facilitates for social, community or recreational purposes, business premises in areas zoned for mixed use purposes.  Without these exclusions, we would be taxing land on which there was no possibility of any housing development taking place.  This would make no sense.</p><p>In regard to the issue of deferrals, the Deputies should note that these arise only in very specific circumstances such as, first, where a judicial review has been sought by a third party against the decision of a local authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in relation to a planning decision.  In my view a deferral is fair in such a situation as the matter is out of the control of the developer.  The second circumstance is in a situation where a person has commenced development of a site.  Since the purpose of the tax is to encourage developers to build on this land, it seems appropriate in my view to suspend the payment of the tax, which continues to accrue, for the duration of the construction period.  Should they meet their delivery commitments, then the tax will not be payable, but failure to do so will result in a proportional payment of the suspended tax for the part not completed.  This approach is aligned with the philosophy behind this tax of encouraging the construction of houses rather than as a revenue raising measure.  For that reason, I cannot agree to this amendment. </p></speech>

Some of it is quite straightforward and other parts are a bit more complex.  We will have another opportunity to look at it on Report Stage with the Minister's amendments and others.  I know we are restricted to three interventions or something like that, but I ask the Vice Chairman to allow a bit of back and forth to deal with this point.  I do not imagine it will take very long.</p> <p>  My first question is on the rate.  I heard what the Minister said about keeping the rate under review if it was required.  We know the problems with the vacant site levy and we argued with the Government that it should come under the fold of the Revenue.  Notwithstanding that, my question is as follows.  Under the vacant site levy at 7%, the owner of a piece of land that is currently valued at &euro;1 million is currently required to pay &euro;70,000 annually.  Under the provisions of this section of the Bill, that will no longer be the case.  How much will the owner now pay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00400"><p>If it is worth &euro;1 million, the owner will be paying &euro;30,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00500"><p>That site is currently being charged &euro;70,000 to try to encourage its development or sale for development purposes and yet there is a reduction here.  That is the concern.  The vacant site levy was raised from 3% to 7%.  There are many more issues with the vacant site levy regarding collection, implementation, local authorities and all that.  The rate was also raised because at 3% on a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, the &euro;30,000 that was being charged was not working and so it was increased to &euro;70,000.  Given the lead-in time for this tax, surely it should be considered at a higher rate.  My view is that it is not penal to have it at a 7% rate because others, including some in Government parties, have called for the vacant site levy to be significantly increased.  There is a very long lead-in period meaning that people who have vacant sites will know that this is coming down the line within a number of years, giving them the opportunity to act.</p> <p>  With that in mind, why does the Minister believe reducing the tax required to be paid on those sites will encourage the owners to develop them, given that they will be paying less than half of what they are currently paying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00600"><p>It is because of the difference in scale of the tax.  I will give the Deputy a sense of how broad we believe this tax will be in comparison with the current vacant site levy.  Currently, the vacant site levy is applied to 501 ha across the country.  My recollection is that it applies to several hundred properties.  Our estimate is that the zoned land tax will cover approximately 8,000 ha to 9,000 ha.  Therefore, it will be 16 to 18 times bigger than the current tax.  Whereas the current vacant site levy is one with which very few landowners interface, the residential zoned land tax will become a core part of how land is taxed if homes are not being built on it.  The reason is difference of scale.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00700"><p>I understand that.</p></speech>

I expect that several landowners will be surprised that they will be paying it.  Given that and given the fundamental difference in scale, I believe 3% is the appropriate starting point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#B00900"><p>I can understand some of the Minister's logic.  As the net is far bigger, with a lower rate we might be able to move some of these sites on.  However, it does not take away from the fact that by 2024, when this kicks in, the tax liability for sites where the owners currently pay the vacant site levy will reduce by more than half.  That is problematic because at that point, rather than being an incentive, it will be a bit of a disincentive compared with the trajectory it had been on.</p></speech>

First, as he knows because he has called this out, is the major challenge in collecting that tax in the first place.  He knows that because it is implemented via local authorities and it is not collected on the scale and with the speed we would want.  This tax will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  The other part of the argument is that this will go from a tax that a few people pay to one that many landowners will pay, and a difference in scale.  Returning to the example the Deputy gave of a piece of land worth &euro;1 million, there would be many pieces of land like that across the country.  The tax is being paid at 3% per year and will be collected every year.  That means by year three of the tax, 9% of the value of that land will be paid in tax.</p></speech>

What data has the Department collected on land value inflation over the last period?  What projections does it have over the next five to six years?  This means nothing if land values are increasing by more than 3%.  There is no incentive to do anything because people can just sit and ride it out if land values are increasing every year.</p></speech>

If the land value increases by more than 3%, there is a benefit for the landowner to do what is happening across the State, which is hoarding.  That is the problem here.  What is the rate of land value inflation in recent years and what are the Department's projections for it?  That is fundamental to this tax.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#C00100"><p>No, I do not.  That is where I differ from the Deputy.  While I accept his point entirely that the disposal price of the land will increase, I believe the cash-flow impact of having to pay 3% on land that is increasing in value will be more significant than does the Deputy.  He is correct that the capital value of the land will go up, but the cash-flow effect of having to pay 3% on land that is going up in value will be considerable over time.</p></speech>

Will the Minister give a working example, from the Department, of land value inflation running at 5% to 10% on a percentage basis and what that will mean for the tax?  That would be helpful for the debate.</p> <p>  Again, my contention is that the middle of a housing emergency is not the time to introduce a tax, which will not come in until 2024 at the earliest or 2025 for other sites, at the lowest level.  This should have been done a long time ago.  The vacant site levy has not worked to the desired effect.  I will ask some other questions on this matter.  Why will the levy not be in place until January 2024 at the earliest? </p></speech>

What that means, specifically, is it will take until sometime next year to put together the land maps that will show land that is subject to this tax, in other words, land that has zoning enabling homes to be built on it that are not being built, land that is either serviceable or serviced and that is not contaminated.  We believe it would take a good part of the first half of next year for the local authorities to do that.  I have been advised there needs to be an appeals process put in place after that to allow the status of that land to be queried and possibly challenged.  That then requires a supplementary map to be produced, which will go into the following year, with the tax then being levied in May of the year after that.</p></speech>

The toing and froing in respect of the local authorities takes up a large section of the legislation.  It again speaks to the fact that, in some cases at least, this tax will not come in for another four years.  This is not the time to introduce it at a low rate.  We will bring forward amendments regarding that.</p></speech>

The effect will begin to become apparent once landowners realise they are due to pay this tax.  I believe they will take action before the point of payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#C01400"><p>That is the key point.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#C01600"><p>That is fine.  If landowners do not develop, and if there is residential land in our towns and cities that is undeveloped, then they should pay 10% over three years.  They should probably be paying 10% in the first year.  We are in the middle of an emergency.  This is not the time to be thinking about the poor craturs who are hoarding land in the middle of our towns and cities.  This is a time to say, "Use it or we penalise you because you have had enough time."  We have been in the middle of a housing emergency for a while.</p> <p>  I am sure the Minister will respond to that but let me put my other questions in the interests of time.  They are just technical questions.  Chapter 2 concerns zoned serviced residential land and applies to land "solely or primarily for residential use, or "for a mixture of uses, including residential use".  We will have a situation where active farm land, which has a mixed-use purpose, will also be zoned for residential use because part of the farm is close to the town centre.  How does that work?  Is it the case that farmers will have to apply for it to be dezoned and so on?  Has there been consideration of the implications of how that will impact on agriculture?  If farmers are going to go and get land dezoned to solely agricultural land, is there is a process in place for them?  Are there any knock-on impacts on farmers being able to raise loans and so on and so forth in terms of land that will be devalued, even though they are using it for farming?</p> <p>  What happens to land subject to this tax, that is in scope and part of the final map, which is sold during the process, since the tax kicks in after a period?  How will the reasonable test outlined under the proposed section 653B(b), which is that the land is serviced or has access to services, operate?  My final question on this chapter is about Revenue's ability to engage.  I do not have the section in front of me but I am sure the Minister's officials will know it.  Revenue has the ability to point out to a local authority a site that was not included in earlier maps.  The local authority then has to make that provision in its final map.  That is fine if it is the middle of this process, which is that the local authority draws up a draft map, it goes to consultation and landowners are able to write in and make submissions or whatever.  For the subsequent map, Revenue, in the middle of that process, can point out a site that was omitted and, therefore, the local authority has to include it in the final map.  What if that omission is identified after the final map is published?  If I am correct, local authorities have to publish their new maps every five years.  Can those be captured within the five-year period?</p></speech>

In the case of the agricultural use of land zoned for residential purposes, the options will be to pay the tax, build homes on the land or change its zoning status.  One of the key reasons we need a run-in period for this is that a dezoning or rezoning process will be put in place by local authorities to allow, for example, a farmer actively farming land zoned for residential use to apply to change the zoning status of that land.  It will then be open to the local authority as to whether to grant that decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#C01800"><p>Is that an executive decision or a reserve function of the local authority?  Are all these decisions under this legislation taken by members of the local authorities or by their executives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#C01900"><p>It is members of local authorities.  This is one of the things that needs to be fully confirmed as to how it will work because the zoning process for land at present, as the Deputy well knows, takes some time to do.  We will need to have a faster process for managing zoning appeals.  To be very explicit about that point, because it was an important reminder from my colleague, a landowner will have the right to appeal the zoning status of the land.</p><p>It would then be open to the local authority to make a final view on that.  I anticipate this will be a pretty active area over the next 12 to 18 months, which is another reason a run-in period is needed.</p><p> On the Deputy's question on what would happen if the land is sold, whoever owns that land would pay the tax each May.  To use the Deputy's example, if the land is sold, the new owner would pay the tax the following May.  It is an annual recurring charge.</p><p> Regarding the Deputy&rsquo;s question on how we will deem if it is reasonable for land to be serviceable, that will depend on the local authority's evaluation of it taking account of the proximity of the land to infrastructure or how likely it is to be serviced in the near future.  That is the reason these maps will be fundamental.  We will rely on the local authority evaluation of that, in turn, for the Revenue Commissioners to levy the tax.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about a scenario where land is omitted on a map but the Revenue Commissioners deem it should be subject to the tax.  The maps would be reviewed each year once the tax becomes operational after the run-in period and then at each point in the year, the Revenue Commissioners would have the ability to recommend or note land that should be covered by the tax.</p></speech>

Will the Minister talk me through a working example of this?  I am not referring to the process of doing the maps, as that is clear in the legislation.  To take the example of my county of Donegal, there are well established towns but also small villages, which would have local area maps.  Will all the sites in all those villages be captured?  What is the definition of this?  For example, would it be if there are footpaths, lights and infrastructure in those villages and all the undeveloped land in them?  How would that marry with housing need in the area?</p></speech>

In theory, if the land has a zoning status that means housing should be being built on it and it would be subject to the tax.  We do not have a minimum threshold of an area of land to which the tax should not apply.  If there is any area in any village, to which the Deputy has referred, which meets the criteria of being zoned for residential use, serviced or serviceable, and uncontaminated, there will be a liability to pay tax on it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-11-18a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2021111800002#D00600"><p>How could a local authority do that?  I am thinking of villages in rural Ireland and within the control points, they are zoned for mixed use or residential purposes.  There would not be a density of development in those villages.  What would be exempt then would the curtilage of one's home.  The Minister said he would not be taxing where a house could not be built.  However, any other fields in those villages would come under the application of the tax.</p></speech>

The local authority will have to form a view as to whether that land is capable of being serviced.  That is the criterion it will have to consider.</p></speech>

Theoretically, if every single vacant site in a village were to be developed, there would not be the service capacity required for sewerage services or possibly water services, but there would be the capacity to develop further.  This is new legislation and it is important to have that mapped out.  The Minister mentioned the Department has done an assessment of the amount of land that would be captured.  It would be helpful if that was provided to us.  Do he have regional or county breakdowns of that?  The county development plan has a list of all the towns.  It is important landowners would know that X village would be subject to this measure.  As we are having this discussion, there is an impression this measure will impact on Dublin, Cork and the higher density areas but it goes way further than that.</p></speech>

The Deputy began his questioning by asking why can we not do this more quickly.  The reason we must have a run-in period, which the Deputy considers is too long, is to give these kinds of indications to landowners.  This will be a very broadly applicable tax and, in particular, time will be needed for the appeals process.  The reason we need a run-in period is the point the Deputy has just identified.  The scope and applicability of this land will be much broader than many people are currently aware of and to deal with the consequences of that, we will need time for an appeals process and a supplementary map.  That is why the run-in period is the length of time I am recommending.</p></speech>

The reality is that if a town is zoned for housing, it would be rare if a piece of land in the centre of that town would be unzoned.  Further questions arise on this issue.  We must examine the issue of housing needs.  The same tax will be applied to a person in a village in a rural community where there is a housing need as will be applied to those in certain areas where there is a major housing need.  We know there is a housing need everywhere.  That is reason this type of tax on developed land needs to be introduced.  The fact that it will be applied to land in a village at the same level as to a vacant site in the centre of Dublin could be problematic.</p></speech>

A key learning from the local property tax is that if we are to enforce a measure nationally, that it is important it would have a clear rate with few exemptions, and that is what we are doing here.  If we were to adopt a model of having a different tax for different parts of the country, that would undermine its effectiveness, pose a major challenge in implementing it and would give rise to a phenomenal number of anomalies that over time could run the risk of undermining the tax.</p> <p>  The Deputy's concluding questions are the reason we need the run-in period, of which he was earlier critical.  We need to allow for an adequate appeals procedure for landowners who may not be satisfied to be subject to this tax.  We need to allow them the time to act and to allow local authorities the time to deal with appeals submitted to them.</p></speech>

One of the exemptions noted in the explanatory memorandum is "...land which is zoned for residential use but is used to provide services consistent with a residential area, e.g. a corner shop".  If the Minister knows Galway city, I am sure he will be aware that we are plagued with vacant sites and have been for a long time.  Thankfully, we are now seeing movement on one of the biggest of those sites and that is good news.  Will that particular exemption only apply to a fixed premises?  There are mobile coffee vans popping up everywhere at the moment.  I ask the Minister for some detail on that.</p></speech>

For example, it would have to have a licence.  To bring to life the Deputy's point, let us say that we have a piece of land that is zoned for residential use, and in that piece of land there is a small section that Revenue deems is being used in such a way that it is important to the operation of commercial life within that community.  That small piece of land could then be exempt from the residential zone and the zoned land tax, ZLT, but if the local authority and the Revenue Commissioners deem that the rest of that land is not fundamental to that commercial use, that land will be subject to the tax.</p></speech>

In sporting clubs all over the country, the land is either zoned for recreational use or, in some cases, for residential use but might have a lease, which allows it to be used by GAA clubs, sports clubs or whatever.  In those circumstances, land used in that way will be exempt from this tax.</p></speech>

There were deferrals and so on for people on low incomes.  The Government wants to target land hoarders with this tax but given the broad nature of it and the fact that every village and town will be included, it may apply to people with very low incomes who might have a site that was left to them.  There is no doubt that they could dispose of that site but the tax might be liable before they could dispose of it, if it was left to them in a will, for example.  Is there any deferral option in such cases or how would they enter it with Revenue?  Do they just have to pay the tax-----</p></speech>

We are looking for a report on the vacant property tax.  The Government's Housing for All plan kicks the can down the road for another year on vacant property tax.  At the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in September, Department of Finance officials cited analysis by GeoDirectory which showed that in quarter 2 of 2021, there was 92,000 vacant properties.  Some 4.5% of homes lay vacant in June of this year.  Research shows we have the tenth highest vacancy rate in the world, which is a national scandal.  Dereliction and allowing properties to lie empty is an act of vandalism against the public good.  It can be seen in this city where apartments lie empty and in other areas where there is significant pressure in terms of housing need.</p> <p>  We were calling for a vacant property tax in 2016, as another lever that could be introduced to end the scourge of dereliction.  It has not been brought forward by the Government.  In 2017, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, argued for it in the context of that year's budget.  That was four years ago.  The Housing for All plan was published in September 2021, without any firm commitment to introducing a vacant property tax to penalise those who would allow residential properties to remain idle and unused.  It has committed to a data collection exercise.</p> <p>  The Minister and the committee will be familiar with my raising the issue of the need for a local property tax on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill in 2018.  In response, the Minister cited the Indecon report from September 2018 arguing against its introduction.  Can the Minister now confirm he rejects the conclusions of that report?  Can he now confirm he does support the introduction of a vacant property tax?  Can he explain to the committee why he has not decided to introduce a vacant property tax in each of the past five years in which we have been calling for him to commit to one?  I ask the Minister to expedite the introduction of the vacant property tax without delay.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 162 would require that such a report be laid before the Houses within one month of the enactment of the Finance Bill, while Deputy Doherty seeks a report within six months of the passing of the Bill.</p> <p>  I have stated that the primary objective of any vacant residential property tax would be to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase to meet demand.  However, before introducing such a tax, it is vital to have a sound understanding of the quantity, locations and characteristics of long-term vacant properties and the reasons they are vacant. This is the reason the housing for all strategy includes an action for my Department to collect data on vacancy with a view to introducing a vacant property tax.</p> <p>  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2021 has accordingly enabled Revenue to collect certain information on vacant properties in the local property tax, LPT, return forms submitted by residential property owners in respect of the new LPT valuation period 2022-25.  The extended deadline for submission of returns was Wednesday 10 November.  The information on vacancy in the LPT returns, in respect of approximately 2 million properties, is currently being analysed by Revenue and together with information from other available sources, will be used to assess the merits and inform the design of a vacant property tax.</p> <p>  It is important to identify the reasons for vacancy and whether this is long or short term in nature.  There may be genuine and acceptable reasons for vacancy such as refurbishment work, the temporary absence of the owner for medical reasons or pending the grant of probate for a deceased person&rsquo;s estate.  Appropriate exemptions from any charge would have to be considered in addition to acceptable periods of vacancy.</p> <p>  I want to make it clear that it is my intention to introduce a vacant property tax.  However, the matter needs further consideration and the information Revenue will be collecting will be an input into what we will do, because we will need to come up with a tax which plays a role in encouraging and changing the use of vacant properties.  Once the information from the returns has been collated and drawing on other available information, we will be in a better position to design a vacant property tax and assess its merits and precise design.  As part of Housing for All, I will be treating this matter with the seriousness it deserves and will be looking at the introduction of a vacant residential property tax as early as possible.</p></speech>

That is a cop out.  The Minister does not have the data now, but he is saying he will bring in a vacant property tax.

I am not putting my own figures out.  I am saying that many of those properties are in areas of high need; I am not saying all of them are or that all of them can be used.  The reality is that of those 92,000 vacant properties, many of them are in areas of high need and they could be brought into occupancy.</p></speech>

Those figures would indicate that there is a low level of vacancy but behind every percentage point or fraction thereof is a vacant property that has the potential to be turned into a home.  As part of Housing for All I accept that a vacant property tax will be able to play a role.</p></speech>

The point at which to introduce this tax is after a local property tax revaluation that will provide information that will be of help in dealing with this.</p></speech>

There is data collection ongoing.  Revenue could have been asked at any point in time to collect that data and a revaluation of the local property tax was not needed to do that.  The Minister has not provided a commitment of when he will introduce this.  The housing crisis has gotten out of control and the Minister has been forced to do a U-turn on a position which he defended against, despite Sinn F&eacute;in calling for it for since 2016.  On that basis I will push this amendment to a vote.</p></speech>

I want to thank Deputies for the time and effort that has been expended over the last three days to scrutinise this Bill.  I thank the officials of the committee and my officials for supporting us in our efforts.  I want to acknowledge one official in particular, Rory O'Kelly.  Rory is the engine of getting the Finance Bill arranged, implemented and done every year.  He is the member of our team who is frequently seen with multiple binders and a large case that contains all of those binders.  Rory has supported many Ministers in passing over 20 Finance Bills and he is getting ready to move on to new pastures.  Before he does that I want to thank him for his tireless service and huge work at busy moments in the legislative year.  I thank Rory for all his effort in supporting many Ministers and this committee in its work since 2006.  I wish him good health and every success in the next phase of his life.  I wanted to recognise that.</p></speech>

They have always been cordial to us as an Opposition party over the years.  I want to add to what the Minister has said about Rory.  Twenty years is a long time and there have been a lot of ups and downs and twists and turns in Finance Bills during those years.  I want to be associated with the Minister's words and to wish Rory well for the future, whatever that may bring to him.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned a number of the amendments that will be brought forward on Report Stage, including the amendment on agriculture.  It would be helpful if a note were to be provided to us on that beforehand.  The decision taken by the committee not to introduce a guillotine or time motion was the right call.  We worked and co-operated well within the timeframe and I appreciate that.</p></speech>
