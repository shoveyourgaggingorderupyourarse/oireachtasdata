Apologies have been received from Deputy Munster.  If attending in the committee room, which everyone is this morning, or from the precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19, which I hear is back again.  Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  We engaged last week with the Health Service Executive to examine, in the context of its 2021 financial statements, mental health-related expenditure in community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.  This morning we will examine the HSE's 2021 financial statements in more detail, including expenditure on ambulance services.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the HSE: Mr. Stephen Mulvany, interim chief executive officer; Mr. Damien McCallion, chief operations officer; Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, chief financial officer; Mr. Robert Morton, director of the National Ambulance Service, NAS; and Professor Cathal O'Donnell, clinical director of the NAS.  We are also joined from the Department of Health by Mr. John O'Grady, principal officer, and Mr. Keith Comiskey, principal officer.  The witnesses are all welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, I may direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, introduced the HSE's 2021 financial statements at last week's meeting.  This is on the record and was circulated to members.  Before we proceed, I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if he wishes to add to his opening remarks from last week.</p></speech>

He is back in a different position today.  We might say he is in the hot seat.  It is detailed in the letter of invitation that he has five minutes for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#A00900"><p>I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss expenditure on emergency services, particularly ambulance services, in the context of the HSE's financial statements 2021.  The Chair has identified the colleagues who are here and introduced them so I will not repeat that.  As requested by the committee, we submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting a briefing note that provides information and a detailed breakdown of HSE expenditure on the NAS.  At last week&rsquo;s session, we provided in the opening statement an overview of the annual financial statements for 2021 and the financial outturn.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks today to the following matters.</p> <p>  The NAS operates from over 100 locations throughout Ireland and its services are delivered by over 2,000 staff members.  The NAS operates under the HSE&rsquo;s performance accountability framework, which sets out the means by which the service is held to account for its performance in relation to access to services and the quality and safety of those services.  The clinical governance of NAS is provided by a full-time clinical director who is supported by a number of other senior clinicians.  The NAS received a budget allocation for 2021 of &euro;202.1 million, representing approximately an 8% increase when compared with 2020.  The actual expenditure for 2021 was approximately &euro;202.9 million, which included Covid-related services.</p> <p>  This expenditure saw the NAS responding in 2021 to over 366,000 emergency 999 and urgent calls; transporting approximately 24,000 intermediate care patients; more than 1,000 aero-medical and air ambulance calls; 2,047 calls via the NAS critical care retrieval service; and the delivery of mobile swabbing and vaccination services in relation to Covid.  Other key activities progressed in 2021 included implementation of the out-of-hours cardiac arrest strategy; continuing development of alternative care pathways - hear and treat or refer and see and treat or refer; a new service commencing in Connemara; supporting implementation of the strategy, a trauma system for Ireland; and improvements to the NAS critical care and retrieval service for adults, children and neonates.</p><p>As of August 2022, NAS expenditure is in the order of &euro;131.7 million against a year-to-date budget of &euro;133 million.  The full year allocation of budget for the NAS is of the order of &euro;202.6 million.</p><p> Based on the outputs of a capacity and demand analysis commissioned in July 2021 and new developments set out in the NAS draft strategic plan, the current NAS workforce plan recommends 2,161 additional staff across a broad spectrum of roles that would be required to meet the future needs of the service.  Given the scale of workforce growth required over the coming years, it is expected to take up to ten years to effectively double the workforce.</p><p> In 2022, 62 graduate paramedics have commenced work and the NAS expects to recruit up to 180 student paramedics and 90 emergency medical technicians by year end.  For 2023 recruitment planning, a submission has been made to recruit up to a further 192 student paramedics across NAS programmes starting in January and September 2023, as well as growing educational capacity by opening a fourth campus in 2023 in the south of the country.  In addition, in 2023, recruitment competitions are planned for 50 medical emergency controllers and 25 intermediate care operatives.</p><p> Last winter, the NAS put in place a capacity action plan which sought to engage with all of the capacity that is available in Ireland, including remobilising all of the community first responder schemes that had unfortunately been stood down in March 2020 due to the Covid pandemic.  The service engaged with voluntary ambulance organisations and the private ambulance sector as part of the contingency plan for winter.</p><p> The HSE continues to invest and develop our urgent and emergency care systems.  There was significant investment in capacity and people in the past 18 months.  We are in the process of preparing the national service plan, which will include the NAS plans for 2023.</p><p> Despite the challenges of recent years, the continued investment by Government in the HSE in the National Ambulance Service is contributing to progress on the shift to reorient healthcare away from a hospital-centric model.  Recent measures are particularly evident within the NAS in the areas of ehealth, telemedicine, and community-delivered care and service integration, that is, community paramedicine, pathfinder programmes and alternative pre-hospital pathways.  The NAS is currently finalising a strategic plan for the service that will provide a roadmap for the continued development and enhancement of the service.</p></speech>

I just want to touch briefly on the cyberattack of last year and specifically the individuals whose data may have been exposed.  Have they been informed by the HSE that their data was incorporated into that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00400"><p>In my first address as CEO, it is important that I acknowledge all the hard work of all the healthcare and social care services staff across the system during both Covid and the criminal cyberattack.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s point, as I understand it, there is a significant volume of work that is progressing so we that can get to the point where we can appropriately communicate with those individuals who need to be communicated with.  We are very anxious to do so in a way that does not cause unnecessary upset.  We are conscious that it is taking longer than people might expect.  However, the volume and complexity of what we are dealing with is substantial.  We are engaged with the Government data protection officer, DPO, to make sure that we are seen to and are doing this in an appropriate way.  I do not believe, specifically, we have made any direct contacts yet with individuals around the data.  However, I understand that is in the near future.  As I said, it is a complex task to be approached appropriately.</p></speech>

Is that days, weeks or months?</p></speech>

I can get the Deputy an update on that; I do not have the specific detail as to when that process will compete.  However, as I said, it is a process that we are heavily engaged in and investing in.  We are also making sure that we are engaged with the DPO on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00700"><p>Mr. Mulvany mentioned a complex process.  I do not think anyone would dispute that.  We can all appreciate that would be the case and that a number of steps will need to be taken in response to it.</p> <p>  My difficulty is getting an understanding of what step is informing those people whose data may have been exposed.  It clearly was not the first or even the second.  Where down the line is it?  What does Mr. Mulvany envisage has to be done before we get to the point where people who are affected are informed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00800"><p>It cannot be the first or the second step.  There are a number of steps to be gone through in assessing the data.  Does Mr. McCallion want to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00900"><p>I can add to what Mr. Mulvany said.  We stood up a team who will be making contact with people, so all of that part of it is in place.  The scoping out of those who need to be contacted is what is being closed off at the moment.  As the Deputy said, it is complex in relation to just being precise about who needs to be contacted following the attack.  As he can imagine, trying to work that through is complex.  That is the piece that is being closed out at the moment.  In addition, there are ongoing discussions with the DPO and others just to make sure that the process is fully robust and when we start that process off, it is clear in how we deal with people who may concerned as a result of it.  It is, as Mr. Mulvany said, getting closer, but there are just a number of final steps around that scoping and making sure we are clear what that contact is.  The teams have been stood up and are ready to move once we need to move.  We utilised some of the resource that we had in the pandemic in terms of contract tracing.  We reassigned some of those people so that we will have a team ready to go once we clarify the scope of it and some the legal and other data protection issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B01100"><p>I do not have a final figure on that at the moment.  That is still a work in progress.  There are decisions to be made on some of the groups.  I do not want to throw out a number that is not correct.  We are trying to finalise that.  However, it is a substantial number of people who will need to be contacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B01200"><p>Are we into the tens of thousands?</p></speech>

We can redeploy people to that to strengthen it up based on what the final numbers will be.</p></speech>

Have any or all of those who have been affected been rated at this point?</p></speech>

It is self-declared but there is a pathway one has to follow.  As I said, we have to follow that and we are in conjunction with the data protection officer.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to comment on what those ratings are.  That information will be available in the future.</p></speech>

They detail the kind of costs that the organisation experiences.  There is an element in them and also in the annual report of which they form a part that shows larger care groups and it will show acute hospitals and national ambulance services.  That type of detail is not published in the AFS as it is not part of the policy.

The AFS follows a certain format that has been set out by the Minister.  Unless the Minister chooses to change it, it will not change.  We provide supplementary information within the annual report, of which the AFS is part, and we can certainly look in the future to calling out ambulance service financial information.

The balance is a range of other vehicles, including intermediate care vehicles that are used for interfacility transfers and rapid response vehicles.</p><p>There are 90 specialist vehicles or specialist equipment carriers, most of which were procured during the Covid period.

After that, for the duration of their shift, they are a mobile resource.  The aforementioned locations are reporting posts.  Essentially, the allocation of vehicles is based on the shift patterns in each location and those shift patterns are determined by local demand.  If we take the example of Letterkenny, there might be four crews while in Cavan, Monaghan there might be three crews.  The vehicles are assigned based on the workload demand and the rostering demand, with a view to making sure that there is always latent capacity of about 40%.  Of the 340 vehicles we have, there would not be any more than 180 or 190 in use at any given time.  That is to make sure there are sufficient vehicles available for the oncoming crews.  The oncoming crews need separate vehicles and we also have to have backup vehicles available.</p></speech>

The capacity review highlighted the fact that we have a huge capacity gap but we already knew that.  Indeed, that is on the record of this committee from September last year.

This year we have ramped up recruitment explicitly.  There has been a massive public campaign with a particular focus on student paramedics and intermediate care operatives.  That has been very successful.  We started three groups of 30 student paramedics between 6 September and 19 September and we will start three more groups on 19 December as well, with a view to them commencing the degree programme in January.  As the CEO has mentioned, we have a finite capacity for placements in education at the moment.  In his opening statement the CEO mentioned the fact that we want to develop a fourth educational campus.  At the moment we educate paramedics in Dublin, Ballinasloe and Tullamore but over the next three years we propose, subject to Estimates, to expand that capacity into Wexford, Cork and Sligo so that we can effectively double our educational capacity to meet the future workforce needs.</p></speech>

We did not have enough ICU beds but thanks to the significant investment in permanently strengthening the health service in recent years, we have increased that number.  We are still hovering at just under 300 ICU beds which is not enough.  We know that.  We need more beds than that and it is our intention to put in place the infrastructure and train and recruit the very specialised staff that we need as quickly as we can.  In fairness to the Government, we have been supported to do that in terms of new service developments, including in ICU.  In the last three years about &euro;1.7 billion worth of investment has been made and we are working hard to recruit all of the extra staff----</p></speech>

It has its very distinct geographical catchment area and we have ours.  Obviously, that crosses over quite a bit.  There is an issue around call taking and dispatch that is ongoing and about which we have concerns.  I do not have responsibility for the specifical geographical operations.  My colleague, Mr. Morton, may have more information on that.</p></speech>

That station provides most of the services in that area on behalf of the National Ambulance Service but as Professor O'Donnell said, we also work very closely with Dublin Fire Brigade.</p><p>There is a lot of blurring of boundary lines and interactivity on a daily basis.  We speak to colleagues in the Dublin Fire Brigade usually at around 3 o'clock every day.  There is a pass-over of calls and a checking-in with one another to see who has capacity and then the sharing of resource where possible.</p></speech>

If a person suffers a stroke or is involved in a car accident or, God forbid, some other sort of incident anywhere else apart from the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, they have dual cover under the NAS and the Dublin Fire Brigade.  Both resources can be called on at any given time.  I understand this has been rumbling for a number of years but where does the HSE stand on resolving this?  There is not the same equitable service in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area as there is elsewhere in the Dublin region.  It is an anomaly that has been ongoing for a long time.  Does the HSE have an update on this?</p></speech>

The rest of the country has one ambulance service as does south county Dublin.  The longer-term plan, from a capacity development perspective, is to relocate Loughlinstown ambulance station.  Where it is currently, it is hemmed in by residential growth.  There is a need to grow services and capacity in the south Dublin area.  We have a significant growth pattern in Bray, an area that is often served by the Loughlinstown station.  We are planning to have new capital development somewhere at the bottom of the M50 area in which to grow services in that whole area generally.  We have a range of services operating there, including pre-hospital emergency care services and intermediate care services, as well as a motorcycle response unit.  By way of a support to the services in south county Dublin, as St. Vincent's is a model of a large tertiary receiving hospital, many of our resources that will feed into St. Vincent's will often respond to calls while travelling back down the N11.  There is a longer-term plan on the part of the NAS to grow services in the south county Dublin.</p></speech>

That will leave the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area with one service whereas the rest of Dublin enjoys two services.  As I do not have enough time to delve into it today, I ask him to send on a note on the future plans for the NAS in the Dublin region, specifically the south-east area.</p> <p>  I refer to an issue relating to the 2021 statement that also relates the 2020 financial statement, which is the storage of protective suits.  The figure of &euro;1.25 million spent on the storage of those suits jumped out at me.  I understand from reading the documents that some of these suits will not even be used.  Why was the HSE not able to store those itself?  Why would it incur such a cost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#D00500"><p>I will give a bit of the background first.  The Covid pandemic was the equivalent of a global storm and, as we know, after every storm there is an element of a clean-up required.  The volume of personal protective equipment, PPE, in storage was immense to the extent that we had to contract significant additional external storage to manage the logistics around it, which was essential in keeping staff at work and keeping them as safe as we could.  I again acknowledge that staff put themselves in harm's way, in many cases.  The reason we ended up with so many protective suits was because of that particular time.  It should be borne in mind that most decisions around purchasing PPE and ventilators, etc., were made in March and April 2020.  As we sit here today behind a wall of vaccines, we all feel somewhat different about things now compared to how we felt then.  Back then, we did not know if vaccines would be available and, if they were, when they would be provided.  Europe was identified as the centre of the pandemic in March 2020.  That is not an excuse; that is by way of context.</p></speech>

We would have bought a different type of full-bodied gown.  At the time they were not available, these protective suits were acquired at a significant cost, as everything was at that point.  Subsequently, we acquired the appropriate gowns.  We have not had a use for these and have had to store them.  We have been seeking an appropriate alternative use for them, which has proven more difficult than we would have expected.  We have ended up having to store them at a cost.  More recently, we have rationalised the storage bringing more of it in-house.  We are storing less of it.  We are using less PPE and can move it on.  This is one of those legacy issues that we have not fully closed out and we need to do that, which we accept.</p></speech>

The figure of &euro;42.5 million was provided for the procurement of ventilators, and according to the financial accounts of 2021, I understand &euro;12.1 million of that amount was recovered.  How is the recovery of that money proceeding?</p></speech>

The amount between the &euro;81 million and &euro;103 million was paid to normal suppliers through normal delivery with an average price of &euro;37,000 or &euro;38,000 in line with sanction.  Most of the ordering decisions were made in March and April.  We deliberately ordered more than we needed on the basis that it was the only way to get them.</p></speech>

To date, we have received value on just over &euro;50 million of it, approximately 60%.  We have either got a refund or, in one case, we received PPE to the value.  Of the rest, we have not got value for approximately 10% and we will not get direct value for the health service.  That amounts to approximately &euro;8 million.  Some &euro;6.6 million of where we have not got direct value, we donated to five large medical schools in India and they have certainly got value out of it.  However, we accept it was not a direct value to the Irish health service.</p> <p>  The balance is approximately &euro;22 million, half of which we now have in payment plans or we are looking to finalise payment plans where we have gone through a legal or an arbitration plan or a bit of both.  Of the remaining &euro;10 million, we are about to enter a legal arbitration process.  We think our case is good.  We have to win the arbitration and then get a payment plan.  We are not saying we will get that &euro;22 million but we are pursuing it in the interest of the State.</p></speech>

I refer to the annual report and appendix No. 4 starting on page 100.  The second MRI machine for St. Vincent's is extremely welcome and it is good to see it included under the projects completed and operational by the end of 2021.  I was struck by a completion delay until after 2021.  The report refers to a lease agreement for a primary care centre.  My understanding was that the HSE owned many of the sites in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6 area, but it states that it is by lease agreement on page 102.  I do not expect Mr. Mulvany to have that information to hand, but he might furnish that to the committee after today's meeting.</p> <p>  Page 103 refers to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is based in CHO 6.  Phase 1 is complete while phase 2 is ongoing with discussions under way between the Department of Health and the HSE.  I also note there was a 35-bed unit with possible use by acute services, which does not fall under phase 1 or 2.  It is welcome nonetheless.  I ask that information on that be furnished to the committee.  It relates to the refurbishment of an existing vacated building.</p> <p>  I refer finally to appendix No. 5 on page 106 of the annual report.  It struck me that the attendance of members at some of the subcommittees is quite low.  What will be done about that?  Is Mr. Mulvany satisfied with the attendance of the members of the committees, including the audit committee and the performance and delivery committee and others?  If not, what will be done to rectify that?</p></speech>

If we send two vehicles, it depends on the clinical criteria of the call.  In the case of a cardiac arrest, for example, we send two resources as a matter of clinical requirement, to make sure there are three to four practitioners or responders on scene.  That is the only circumstance where we send two vehicles.  We never send two vehicles because of a mechanical issue.</p></speech>

I do not mean to say these are gold standard targets, but these are the targets we aspire to and we need to increase capacity to make that a practical reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#E01100"><p>That is basically it.  Delivery of targets is a feature of a match between capacity and demand.  Demand far exceeds capacity and, therefore, we are not able to meet the targets.  On the 19-minute target, there is a growing question mark about the relativity of those targets.<br/><br/>Professor O'Donnell is developing the realm of clinical key performance indicators, KPIs - in other words patient outcomes.  I will give a brief example to articulate that point, then hand over to Professor O'Donnell.  For a patient in Dingle who experiences a stroke, the nearest ambulance is Dingle ambulance station but that ambulance might be dropping off a patient or <i>en route </i>to Tralee, as the main receiving hospital.  The ambulance will not get there in 19 minutes because it is at the end of a peninsula but, in real terms, that will not change the outcome for that patient.  The target is 19 minutes but the key target for that patient is to get to a hyperacute stroke unit within four and a half hours of the onset of symptoms.  We are moving to a clinical, rather than response-time, way of thinking about it.  That is not just in Ireland, but in a general global setting.  I ask Professor O'Donnell to comment on the development of alternative KPIs.</p></speech>

It is a good question.  Ambulance response time targets are a blunt instrument for measuring the capability of an ambulance service.  They are easily understood, intuitive and make sense.  If I dial 999, I want an ambulance to come quickly.  That is reasonable, but a 19-minute response time over the breadth of clinical presentations we see often does not impact on patient outcomes.  From a clinical perspective, we are more interested in how we can improve the patient's acute healthcare need there and then.  We send two highly trained clinicians on a call.  If they get there within 19, 20 or 15 minutes of a person having a heart attack or stroke or with a broken leg, that is a blunt instrument in measuring success.</p> <p>  We currently measure four clinical KPIs.  There is cardiac arrest, when your heart stops.  We measure the proportion of patients we get to an emergency department where we have restarted the heart prior to arrival.  That is one point on that patient's clinical journey.  We compare favourably internationally on that one.  This year we have introduced three new ones.  Two are related to stroke care, which Mr. Morton mentioned and which are very important.  One is on pain relief.  If you are in pain and we come out to you, how good are we at relieving your pain?  We have a further suite of these that we will continue to add to in the coming years.</p></speech>

We went back and looked at this.  International experience was similar.  First, people were slower to call 999, particularly in the early stages of Covid.  They did not want to go to hospital because they were afraid.  They had a pain in their chest and stuck it out.  That was a bad decision for them and it went on.  In the early stages of Covid, crews had to put on PPE on arrival at scene.  That took time</p></speech>

A number of reviews were carried out as part of the high earners review.  Our audit and risk committee sought some extra assurance around the area of high earners.  It looked specifically at the top of the organisation and found no issues in terms of high earners.  When we look across the organisation, and we looked at salaries over &euro;300,000 that go across services and in fairness, relate mostly to consultant staff, we found some issues.  It is important to provide some context before we get into any of the detail.</p></speech>

We have very able and dedicated consultants.

Often services were seeking to balance providing a service and managing patient risk with those.  We have established a process to go around the country and identify and log all those practices.

Our audit and risk committee is also considering in the audit plan for next year extending below the &euro;300,000 threshold to see if there are any issues.

From its review of financial statements, does Mr. Mulvany feel that section 39 bodies are in a good financial position?</p></speech>

Some have small surpluses they have built over the years.  Remember that there are about 2,000 organisations funded under section 39.  At the top end, the organisations referred to by the Deputy are typically north of &euro;3 million.  Some of them are under financial pressure while others are under less pressure.  Sometimes it relates to whether they have had to provide residential services and how they have been able to respond to regulation in recent years, which has put pressure on our own services.  While we say in the first instance that it is a matter for the boards of the voluntary organisations, we are aware of our role in that too.  If you look across the larger section 39 organisations in the disability sector, a number have financial issues while others are in a reasonable position or have moderate surpluses.</p></speech>

Without these agencies, the HSE would not be able to deliver services on the ground.  It is very important that we continue to support them to ensure we can deliver services locally.  Western Care Association in County Mayo is a significant provider of intellectual disability services and without it, the entire service would fall to pieces.</p></speech>

Not all section 39 bodies are the same but as the Deputy noted, we rely on the larger organisations just as much as we rely on any of the services and they provide services as good as and sometimes better than other parts of the service.  We are aware that pay parity is a very significant issue.  Many of those organisations would have had links to what we call the consolidated salary scales pre-recession.  We are aware of and concerned about what would be a shift from section 39 organisations to section 28 organisations that can recruit because they have the consolidated salary scale.  It is not an issue we can yet solve but it is one we recognise because we do value and rely significantly on a number of those section 39 organisations.</p></speech>

The Department and the Minister intend that it will be included.  It may turn out to be more practical for the Department and some of those agencies to work directly and not put them through a private process because it involves another public body as well and the HSE would not add any great value to that.  I know the Minister is looking at ways to see can some of those payments, including those to the fire brigade, be accelerated.</p></speech>

Does the HSE believe it has the correct value for money from section 38s and section 39s? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#G01200"><p>It is difficult to generalise.  The most important thing to say is that we rely on and hugely value the service provided by section 38s and section 39s.  In some cases, we can and do learn from them.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>  As I see it, there are two aspects to the relationship, in governance terms, with section 38s and section 39s.  One is those organisations themselves and their internal governance, and whether that is appropriate.  While we are not an innocent party in that, it is largely a matter for them and their boards.  The other piece is the management of our relationship with those section 38 and section 39 organisations, which gets much more difficult when we get to the bigger volumes of section 39s, remembering that we fund more than 2,000 organisations.  We recognise that we had a problem and we still have elements we are working on.  We have nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, around the country and have established what we call contract management support units in each of those nine organisations.  Most of them are now fully staffed and up and running.  Their job is to assist local management to be able to keep on track of that relationship management with the organisations.</p></speech>

For intellectual disabilities in particular, and in the Cork area specifically, it essentially came to a situation where those people in receipt of HSE funding were not able to accommodate children with special needs.  The education and training board, ETB, stepped in and opened special schools there.  In addition, there is resistance to providing respite care to those children who are no longer registered in section 39 organisations because they are now registered for schooling in the ETB.  That is a classic example, from my perspective, of how an organisation that is being funded is taking its own direction rather than direction from the State.  Governance is about internal processes but it is also about responding to the direct demand of the State.</p></speech>

That relationship around services for residential provision, education and social care services between ourselves and other Government agencies is a complex one, as the Deputy knows.  Progressing disability services is one of the ways we are trying to improve that.  Clearly, in the Deputy's example, there may be tensions as to how well or not it is working.  We are aware many of our section 39 organisations and, indeed, our own services, have been under pressure to provide sufficient residential capacity, particularly as we had a very positive experience as regards improved regulation over the years.  The issue is it has not been possible for the investment to keep up with that and we have lost a level of capacity.  We know we have challenges in providing residential accommodation to people.  That is an accepted point.  I do not know if Mr. McCallion wants to make any comment.</p></speech>

That is very clear when there is a private operator but sometimes, when there is a voluntary operator, that same call is not made.  It is a policy issue maybe rather than a matter for Mr. Mulvany.  I sometimes feel we do not subject section 39s to the same level of scrutiny regarding value for money.  I ask for a note from the representatives to respond to the committee regarding some of the issues raised in that 2016 report about how the HSE is responding to concerns raised.</p></speech>

The relationship is one we are working on, and need to work on, but there is a lot of engagement around individual client needs, accommodating additional clients and equality around what is being provided to existing service users.  That is an ongoing process between every CHO, every disability service manager and the section 39s they are funding.  Whatever about the formulaic, monthly, performance-type meeting, day in, day out our managers and placement co-ordinators are engaging with voluntary providers about the quality of service people are getting, or are trying to get people access to services.  It is a collaborative partnership thing.  Sometimes, voluntaries do not have the flexibility they used to have in the past - maybe that is a good thing - to provide accommodation or services.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulvany talked about a contract unit.  On a broader level, a report by Catherine Day was commissioned by the Department some time back on voluntary bodies and how they work with the health sector.  The Deputy might recall it.  A consultative forum was set up under that, where we have representatives.  Apart from contract management and the formal side, that is all about trying to see how we work better together.  We will always use voluntary organisations - Mr. Mulvany mentioned a figure of 2,000 - from the big voluntary hospitals through to the small service provider in a remote area, inner city area or wherever, that is providing a vital service.  A lot of work is trying to get us in a room together to look at how we actually work better together at a practical level both in terms of the ethos and principles of how we work, apart from on the ground-----</p></speech>

One of those is where we allocate new staff and new students.  We have changed our policy this year, which has actually helped our recruitment strategy, to allocate all new staff to a base within 45 km, at a maximum, of where they live.  For existing staff, we are currently implementing a new staff transfer policy to give people the opportunity to move to a base within 45 km of where they live.  We think that will support retention because it has been a big issue that our trade union partners have consistently brought to our attention.</p></speech>

On the role of the NAS, there are other private operators it is competing with as a potential employer.  That degree of flexibility is very important.</p> <p>  I am jumping around here; I often think we should have a standing committee of public accounts just for the &euro;23 billion the HSE spends, but that might fill the representatives with horror.  I will come to the issue of non-compliant procurement.  A process was carried out, which was a self-assessment exercise, to determine the level of non-compliant procurement.  Within that, I was alarmed that compliance assessments were not completed in respect of 13% of the procurement expenditure, when the scoping exercise was carried out.</p><p>That was either because a manager responsible for the expenditure could not be readily identified or the manager failed to respond to the exercise.  That is quite alarming when we are looking at a process to establish non-compliant procurement.  Would our guests respond to that in the time remaining?</p></speech>

We are now moving into quarterly assessment, which is progress.  While it is self-assessment, there is also an element of independent sampling as an insurance.  Yes, the 13% is a concern.  We are following it up although I do not have details as to where we have got to.  We do not find it acceptable, as the Deputy does not.  We will always have some level of non-completion but that level is higher than we would expect and higher than we want.  We have assumed it is all non-compliant.  Some of it might actually be compliant but we have had to assume it is non-compliant.  We will chase it down.</p></speech>

I wish to start with the ambulance service and I thank our guests for the briefing document in that regard.  In the document, there is reference to &euro;9.1 million for Dublin Fire Brigade.  That represented 15.75% of the breakdown of non-staff costs.  Is there a contract in place?  Is there a service level agreement in place for the role that Dublin Fire Brigade plays?  Are there any penalty clauses if, for example, the service is deemed to be unsatisfactory?  It looks as if that equates to almost 16% of the national funding for the ambulance service.  Is that correct?  From whose budget comes the cost of the replacement fleet?  Is it Dublin City Council?  Perhaps our guests would start by answering those questions.</p></speech>

The current arrangements are grounded in a 1993 review.  The fire brigade, through section 25 of the Fire Services Act 1981, deliver fire and ambulance services as a statutory authority in its own right.  It does not deliver those services on behalf of the ambulance service or on behalf of the HSE.  Arrangements emanated from the 1993 review of ambulance services.  As a result of that review, we make a contribution towards the running of the cost of the ambulance service because otherwise we would have to deliver it.</p></speech>

I will move to another area.  The annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General includes a chapter in respect of the management of clinical indemnity.

The estimated outstanding liability is &euro;3.4 billion.  That is decided on a pay-as-you-go basis.  I understand the Minister must provide that is done on that basis.

That should go without saying.  We are supposed to be at a point where there is open disclosure when there has been an accident.</p> <p>  Representatives of the State Claims Agency were before the committee and we discussed trying to get a mediated settlement whereby there is acceptance that there was an injury and fault involved.  During that engagement with the agency, it was interesting to hear that there appeared to be a change in the practice during the pandemic when the courts were not available to prosecute some of these cases.  There was a greater use of mediation.  Are there mechanisms in place to ensure that happens?  The evidence seems to suggest that settlements are quicker and less costly because there are fewer legal costs.  Why did it take a pandemic to make that change?  Is that change being maintained?</p></speech>

We work closely with the State Claims Agency in that regard and it is helpful to us.  The agency provides a service to the Government and Government bodies in respect of managing claims under its own statute.  It is not doing that for us.  It is doing it because the Oireachtas has asked it to do so.  In my experience, the agency does that very well.  It always seeks to get to an appropriate resolution.  That may not be the experience of individual families.  The court process is what the court process is.  The Deputy would have to ask the State Claims Agency as to why Covid may have brought about a change.  I would say it was a matter of practicality with regard to the courts, even though the courts did operate remotely during the pandemic.  As to whether that situation has continued-----</p></speech>

That will include the legal costs.  It was the non-availability of the courts that appears to have brought about this change.  We need to pursue this matter separately and we may have to look at this chapter in its own right because I am not at all satisfied that this is working in the way it should be.</p><p>Obviously, Mr. Mulvany is acting CEO of the HSE.

The evidence is that, thankfully, the incidence of those claims, those tragedies for families, is the same in Ireland as it is in other developed countries.  The incidence of claims is not necessarily the issue; rather, it is the operation of the courts process and the legal process.  We engage with the State Claims Agency in that regard but there is only so much of that we can influence.</p> <p>  As to the value, obviously the State Claims Agency is, in effect, part of the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department of Finance.  The fact that it is not on the balance sheet of the HSE does not mean there is not an awareness all the way up to central government of those amounts, and they are very serious amounts.</p></speech>

Last week, we extensively considered capital spending in Cork-Kerry CHO and I was assured that the service users who are in 24-hour assisted living at Owenacurra and Garnish House had been fully communicated with regarding the closure of Garnish House and the move out of there.  In the meantime, I have been contacted by families who say that is not the case.  I am not sure whether that is just a breakdown in communication but I would like to get more information on this.  The witnesses do not have to take my word for it; the <i>Irish Examiner</i>this week published an article on the matter written by Cianan Brennan.  Last week, the HSE stated that &quot;staff and clinicians talk directly to service users at Garnish House on a constant basis about their future plans&quot;.  However, the family of a Garnish House resident stated &quot;The only communication we (my relative and my family) received regarding my relative&rsquo;s move from Millfield House to Garnish House came on the evening of the move in April 2020 via a short phone call from ... Millfield House&quot;.  Another communication I received from a family states:</p> <blockquote> 	We asked both the Garnish House staff and the clinical team as recently as last week for information.  On pointing out that a recent PQ response ... [to a question I tabled] stated that Garnish would be vacated by the HSE in early 2023, the Garnish House staff and clinical team stated that they have not been informed of this.  The uncertainty of the past two and a half years has led to a deterioration in our relative&rsquo;s mental health. </blockquote> <p>My time is running out and I do not want to use it all on this issue but the clear answer to this issue is to find out exactly what the communication has been.</p><p>In the email I received from the chief officer in the CHO he states:</p> <blockquote> 	In this context, there is and has been on-going discussion with residents of this high support service, to ensure that they are aware that the service would be moving at some stage, though we would not have a finalised decision on its location.  This discussion would be more in the context of keeping service users aware of the temporary nature of the service location rather than in any greater detail and not to detract from their own individual plans of moving forward to a more independent living model suitable to their needs.  Once we are clear on the service relocation plan, the clinical team will be engaging with each service user once again in more detail on the specifics. </blockquote> <p>I am reading this into the record on purpose.  The email continues:</p> <blockquote> 	The commitment is made that the service will transfer from Garnish House by the end of Q 1 2023.  There will be full communication with service users around the details of the service transfer in advance. </blockquote> <p>I know we discussed the matter last week but these are incredibly vulnerable people.  We know that Cork-Kerry CHO's idea of lots of time in advance is, at best, three months, because that is what it did in the context of Owenacurra.  These people have been living there for a very long time.  I would love for the HSE to come back to me and explain exactly what the communication has been.  I do not want to say that what we have been provided with is muddy but there is not a huge amount of detail from the CHO on exactly what the communication with these people was.  There should be a log.  If a clinician speaks to a family member, he or she makes a note of that, as is best practice.  If the families are saying one thing but the HSE is saying another, the way to move forward and get rid of that grey area would be for the HSE to simply set out exactly how it has been informing residents and their families.  I acknowledge that the CHO has been careful to state here that it does not wish to discuss individual residents.  I am not asking for anyone's name or PPS number or anything like that; I just want to understand how the testimony of the HSE is so at odds with what the families are telling us.  That is really important in the context of people being moved from their home of more than a decade.  I am not asking for answers to be provided today but I am asking the HSE to take the matter away and see if it can come up with actual information.  The information that has been provided so far is fuzzy.</p></speech>

That was why Owenacurra was so great - it was like a home.  I take the point made by Mr. McCallion and I thank him for it.  He is correct, but it seems that some of the staff were not aware of the plan for Garnish House, so they would not have been able to communicate that on a low level with service users.  From what the families are telling us, it seems the staff did not know.</p></speech>

I will keep my eyes peeled for more communication.</p> <p>  In the two and a half minutes I have remaining, I will ask a quick question for clarity on the debt that is in question.  I do not want to say it is owed by the HSE to Dublin City Council, given that the witnesses say it is not owed.  As a former member of Dublin City Council, this is something that I did not realise.</p><p>There seems to be an acceptance within Dublin City Council, DCC, that this is owed.  Obviously, the HSE is at odds with that.</p><p> Can I just understand this a bit better?  The HSE awards the council &euro;9.19 million per year to run the service.  The debt that is outstanding, which is at question here, is now at the figure of &euro;116.8 million.  Within that context, the chief executive, Owen Keegan, has also made the point recently that costs have risen steadily, in line with the cost of everything else over the last couple of years.  The council suggests that the cost of the Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, emergency ambulance service is expected to reach approximately &euro;26 million.  For my own clarity, are we not accepting that all of that figure of &euro;116 million is a debt that is owed?</p></speech>

I want to move onto an issue that I raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday, which is in relation to the level of claims against the HSE and where we are with that issue.  The amount paid out for the level of claims in 2021 was &euro;461 million.  That was paid out by the State Claims Agency.  Not all of that figure related to healthcare but, as I understand it, the bulk of it was.  As the figure in the previous year was &euro;372 million, that is an increase of &euro;87 million.</p> <p>  In relation to the estimates, it is my understanding that were everything settled in the morning for all claims against the State, the figure would be approximately &euro;4.2 billion.  However, the figure for the healthcare sector is approximately &euro;3.4 billion.  We have dealt with the issue of insurance.  It is in the context of dealing with the insurance Bill yesterday that I raised this issue.  We made major changes to many areas of insurance over the past ten or 15 years but we have not really made any major changes as to how we process and deal with things when incidents do arise.  No matter how careful people are within a hospital setting, errors do happen.  What we try to do is try to reduce them as much as possible.</p><p>Has any analysis been carried out on what can be done to reduce the level of errors and hence the level of claims?  Where an error arises, should we be far more proactive in dealing with it than the current system appears to be?  Unfortunately, the HSE is getting caught up by post mortems, inquests and so on.  I am thinking of the idea of having an overall review of how we can deal with this in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#M00200"><p>There are two parts to this.  The first, which the Deputy raised and is the most important, is trying to make sure we are managing the risk and reducing it for patients and service users.  We are very significantly focused on that.  The State Claims Agency, in fairness, has given us great assistance in that.  We seek to focus on making sure that we log and report incidents and that we investigate them, seek to learn the lessons and respond.  Specifically, in the case of a subset of the incidents that are driving a disproportionately large amount of the annual payment that the State Claims Agency makes and we reimburse - the catastrophic birth cases - we have established under the chief clinical officer a separate central team which works with maternity units when they have these tragic cases to see what can be done differently and what lessons can be learned.  That is despite the fact that the incidence of those catastrophic cases, which are individual personal tragedies for the families involved, is in line with international norms for developed western economies.  We still would like to reduce it and reduce it further.</p> <p>  The second part is that the State Claims Agency, under its own legislation, is the indemnifier for the State.  As well as providing risk management support to us, which is excellent, it also has to seek to progress the claims.  We discussed that with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It does not itself control the legal process in which it operates.  I understand that there are efforts to streamline elements of that legal process.  The evidence to us is that the increasing level of costs appearing in our accounts for reimbursing the State Claims Agency and the increasing noted contingent liability around future costs of claims are not being driven predominantly by the volume of claims increasing or the severity of claims.  They are being driven by the legal process and increases in the cost of processing, completing and paying out claims.  It is not the piece that we predominately can influence but the piece that relates to the legal process.</p></speech>

Can we manage it in a better way while making sure that where errors are made, people are adequately provided for?  Is it not time to review the whole process rather than having what we have now where claims can go on for long periods of six, seven or eight years before they are finalised?  Do we now need to look at that overall picture?</p></speech>

I am not an expert but as I understand it, there is an interdepartmental group in which the State Claims Agency is involved that is doing just that and looking at the overall operation in this area.  It is largely in the courts process or not necessarily the courts but how redress is sought and provided, which is currently predominantly through the courts process, although there are alternatives that may need to be used more.  The work the Deputy is talking about is going on.  The HSE is involved indirectly through its engagement with the State Claims Agency but it is a matter for the State Claims Agency, a number of Departments and the Courts Service how that operates.  I agree with the Deputy that it is something that needs attention.</p></speech>

It goes back to the issue of children who suffered as a result of thalidomide.  While they got compensation, it was in no way adequate in real terms.  I have heard of a number of cases where substantial compensation was paid out and within a very short period people passed away unfortunately.  There is a huge variation.  Is there a need to be proactive in trying to reduce further the level of errors that arise by checking all the systems, whether in smaller hospitals or very large ones, and at the same time, looking at how we can expedite the processing of these claims?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#M00800"><p>Yes, I agree on both fronts.  We are and do put significant energy into reducing and minimising the impacts of clinical incidents, acknowledging, as the Deputy said, that they will always arise.  They are very difficult for patients and can also be very difficult for staff and we need staff to be supported as well as to be assisted to make improvements, where they can be made.  Not every critical incident or adverse incident can be avoided but some certainly can.</p> <p>  Returning to redress, periodic payment orders is the language used to refer to a process where there is not just a single large lump sum paid but payment is made over time.  I understand they have been and are in use.  There is work on those orders within the overall courts process.  I do not know exactly what it is.  That is something the State Claims Agency would keep us briefed on periodically.  The notion of moving to a different form of redress payment mechanism and hopefully, over time, to less adversarial methods of getting redress are all in that mix, as I understand it.</p></speech>

That is a huge slice of the HSE budget.  There are more than 2,300 of these organisations and it is not physically possible to audit every one of them.  They obviously have proper systems in place.  In any one year, how many of the 2,300 organisations' accounts would the HSE go and review?</p></speech>

Over 93% or 95% of it is provided to a relatively small number of very large organisations.  I would guess it is less than 100.  There are a number of ways by which we review and engage those organisations.  Our internal audit division will go out, put boots on the ground and visit a certain number of section 38 or section 39 organisations in any given year.  It may be between 30 and 50.  I may have the figure wrong but I can check it.  Separately, depending on size, we get a certain amount of information every year, including annual accounts, although we do not get audited accounts from every one of those organisation.  It depends on the size and if they are below 50,000.  We get their audited accounts, we have a review process and above a certain size we ask them to provide a summary or precis of that financial information so that we can see and track through the HSE's resource going into the organisation.  As we said earlier, we have established across each of our nine CHOs what we call conflict management support units to try to help the local services to deal with that volume of interaction with a greater number of those organisations.

I am just asking that every effort be made.</p> <p>  I will revert to the ambulances.  Last year, I think, at a meeting of the committee, I raised with Paul Reid the issue of dynamic deployment and the fact that a number of ambulances were quickly deployed from, for example, County Laois or County Offaly to Wexford or Waterford.  When they are three quarters of the way there they are told that an ambulance has arrived on the scene and told to turn back.  Not only is time lost, but that also leaves parts of the midlands without a service.  I have heard reports of this from different parts of the country.  On the second occasion I raised this with Mr. Reid and pressed him on it, he said that the HSE was looking at the geographical situation, that there may be a case for geographical limits and that there were working groups looking into this along with the unions, which I know about.  This may be a question for Mr. Morton.  What is the current situation?  Has the HSE come down on a figure for that?</p></speech>

That was in response to capacity challenges.  We had to balance what we wanted to do against patient safety.  Obviously, once a limitation is put in, there is always the possibility of not reaching a patient.  However, what we have reached a conclusion on is that we have set a limit of 80 km.  That basically balances patient risk against staff well-being.  We have been working on that for a considerable period of time and it seems to be working well so far - broadly, anyway.</p></speech>

Mr. Morton is an expert on this matter, whereas I am not.  This is his everyday job.  It seemed to me, however, that it was becoming a real problem, particularly given that the service is running at about 54% capacity.  We have little over half the number of ambulances and staff we need.</p> <p>  I will turn for a moment to the recruitment targets.  There are 2,161 staff at the moment.  I think it was said that the HSE needs around 850 extra staff to stand still, that we really need to double staff and that to do so would take ten years.  I am looking just at the recruitment for this year.  How many staff has the HSE recruited into the service this year?</p></speech>

In September we recruited 90.  Then we have a plan to recruit around 90 more.  It depends on people passing Garda clearance, but we expect to recruit about 90 in December of this year as well.  We have also recruited 60 emergency medical technicians, who work in our intermediate care service and support our ambulances.  That is the kind of profile of recruitment we are working to this year.</p></speech>

We would have to grow our fleet in the out years, but right now we probably have one of the better fleet profiles of most of our comparators around the globe.  We are in a very good place.  The HSE has invested a lot of money consistently over repeated years.  The Department has been very supportive of our fleet replacement programme over a number of years.

Is that the direction of travel?  Is there a move away from the private?  I know that on social media there is a lot of rubbish that makes a comparison which is not like for like.  Obviously, private services do not deal with critical incidents and so on, so we cannot compare like for like, but is the direction of travel in terms of the service to stay with the publicly owned HSE National Ambulance Service ambulances?</p></speech>

HSE policy is to continue to develop our own intermediate care service.  Equally, however, one of the valuable lessons we have learned from Covid is that there is always a need to have access to surge capacity.  Private ambulance companies and voluntary organisations have ably provided that surge capacity, particularly in supporting patient flow between hospitals.  There is a place for the private ambulance sector, but the HSE's policy is basically to develop our own intermediate care service.</p></speech>

The staff are more highly trained, maybe, than years gone by.  Like a lot of other things, time moves on.  The feedback from the public generally is very good, and the workers in the service are very dedicated.  Talking to them, the one thing that always comes across, although they might complain about this, that or the other, is their dedication to doing the best for the patients.</p><p>I will ask about a more local issue regarding County Laois.  County Offaly has three ambulance stations.  I have no argument in that regard.  There is one beside Ofalia House, one in Birr and one in Tullamore.  We have one in the middle of Laois, which is a good location because it is a rounder county; it is not as strung out as Offaly.  There has been a significant population increase in the northern part of the county, however.  Are there plans to locate an ambulance base there?</p></speech>

Graiguecullen in the south east, for example, is well supported by County Carlow.  Roscrea supports the south-west to some extent.  Certainly, there is a need to look at services in the Portarlington and north Laois area.  We are examining that at the moment.  We are looking at the area that was the M8 corridor down to Durrow and Cullahill.  We are currently working with Kilkenny County Council to procure the old fire station in Urlingford with a view to setting up an emergency dispatch point that would then service what was the old N8 corridor; places like Cullahill across to Castlecomer and Durrow and areas that are not particularly well-served by Portlaoise.  It is quite a distance away in the event of an emergency.  That is what we are working on at the minute.</p></speech>

What properties are vacant at the moment?  Some of them might be health centres that are no longer in use, some may be houses that were bought to provide services or some may be facilities that have been owned by the HSE for some time.</p></speech>

There are properties that could be used and converted in my own area.  Mr. Mulvany might send me a note on that, including properties the HSE has bought but that have not yet been put to use.

Again, we are a long way away from where we need to be on that.  On an EU comparison with many other countries, we were at approximately 50% or just above that.  Capacity seems to be the issue.

The facilities are needed and so is the space.  They are very specialised.  Then, a certain number of consultants are needed to run intensive care lists, particularly to run a certain number of beds.  It will, therefore, be a combination of those factors.  More typically, it is getting the suitable space and particularly the expert nursing staff.</p></speech>

At the moment, the plan is to be up around 320 beds by the end of this year and there are further developments from there.  Some of those are tied to capital and staff.  The one advantage we have now is that we know exactly where they should be and how they should be developed.  We can forward details of that plan to the Chairman.</p></speech>

We can see that from the ambulance figures.  Unfortunately, the situation arises where an ambulance with a patient inside arrives at the door of the emergency department and there are no critical care beds.  There are bottlenecks, which I presume this is adding to.  It would be welcome if that happened because that would be an increase of nearly 40 beds.</p></speech>

Is that working the way it should for consultants who are on those 80:20 contracts, that is, 20% of their work being carried out in the private sector and 80% in the public sector?

The consultants are, some would say, the most powerful group within a hospital, and we have a shortage of them.  I do not want to be hard on consultants because they do a very difficult job and they are highly skilled.  We and our families are all dependent on them.  In terms of the important management decisions, however, is it Mr. Mulvany's sense that consultants in this State have a greater influence or greater control over how hospitals are run than they should have?  Is that a concern of his?</p></speech>

The key point is that hospital managers and CEOs have to manage - they are leaders.  Leaders need followers, however, so they need to make sure their clinicians, non-clinical employees and all their staff are being brought with them.  Therefore, yes, our consultant colleagues have a huge impact.  In some cases, that may be problematic and the consultant body itself will tell us that.  We are no different from any other part of the world in some of that.  There will always be areas where clinicians may in some cases overstep the mark or where managers may not fully be doing what might be expected of them.  It would be too simplistic to say it is an overall general concern, in fairness.</p></speech>

Each hospital has a chief executive and an executive management team with a clinical director, director of nursing and other associated disciplines.  We are trying to promote clinical leadership.  There are programmes to encourage clinicians to come forward into those roles because that is how we bring about change.  We need to have good executive leadership, as the Chairman said, alongside good clinical leadership, be it nursing, added health professionals, consultants or medical staff.</p><p>We are actively trying to encourage more clinicians to come forward into those clinical leadership roles.</p></speech>

We do not disagree with that but I am saying we have made progress.  We definitely have more to do and we are focused on doing more.  We are, for example, turning that annual self-assessment, which we managed to do for the first time only in the past two years, into a quarterly self-assessment, with the first two quarters of this year to be done by the end of October.</p></speech>

The newspaper article pretty much said that the costs for providing the service have risen steadily and the cost to the Dublin Fire Brigade emergency ambulance service is expected to reach just less than &euro;26 million.  As we know, the amount that has been allocated from the HSE is &euro;9.19 million, so there is &euro;16.55 million in running costs for the service.  Mr. Owen Keegan said:</p> <blockquote> 	Anybody else would have withdrawn the service long before now.  But there&rsquo;s a huge commitment among the staff, and I think it&rsquo;s important that we will support them.  And we&rsquo;ve done that and the HSE have exploited that to the hilt. </blockquote> <p>That was the article.  Is it costing Dublin City Council more to run its ambulances than it is costing-----</p></speech>

Third, it is not really appropriate for two public bodies to effectively engage in a kind of dispute by me trying to respond to that.  We have already said we would disagree with the CEO, Mr. Keegan, on some of the figures.  We believe a resolution is required and we know that does not involve ourselves.  As a final point, we actually do not know.  We told the committee, and the director of the Ambulance Service has said, that the contribution we are making is broadly in line with what we understand to be our costs.  The city council's costs are its own costs and they intermingle to some extent.  The service it has, which is a great service, is a fire brigade service with an ambulance component.  Again, let us remember that the key thing to be resolved in all of this is the integration of call-taking and dispatch, because that is a quality and safety issue.  The rest is money, and the money is important.  We do and we will engage with Owen Keegan but I do not think that across the floor of a committee chamber is the way to do it.</p></speech>

That is under the local government auditor.</p> <p>  I will move to a different topic, which is the cyber attack.  Some &euro;657 million over seven years is the cost of implementing the PwC recommendations.  Obviously, some of the things that happened can be rectified reasonably quickly.  We were told there was no single person responsible and no documented recovery plan, the patching updates were not effective, there was a single antivirus product, antivirus signatures were not updated and 30,000 machines were on Windows 7.  Some of those issues are pretty basic.  Have the most immediate aspects been dealt with and how will that plan work out?  I presume the HSE has moved away from Windows 7 at this stage.  Have some of those more exposed and easily fixable aspects been dealt with at this stage?</p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany might also deal with the number of people who have been identified.  Has the HSE identified every one of the people who are likely to have had their information disclosed or accessed during that attack?  Many people have yet to be notified.  Does Mr. Mulvany have a ballpark figure for that?</p></speech>

Our board has a committee governing the overall monitoring of the implementations of these recommendations.   The low-hanging fruit and the priority stuff is getting that additional focus.  The number of Windows 7 licences is down from over 40,000 to less than 10,000.  They are only on systems where we are in the process of replacing those systems so we do not rely on Windows 7, but we do have clinical systems that-----</p></speech>

It is not Windows 7 in itself; it is the fact that the applications are on that.  There is a plan to try to migrate that or to replace those as quickly as possible to remove Windows 7, and that is basically where we are at, but there are old applications that our services are entirely dependent on for operation, and that is what we are trying to ramp down as quickly as possible.  Good progress has been made on that already because, as the Deputy said, that is one of the risks identified.</p></speech>

We have asked ourselves how quickly we can tell people because we want to tell people so they would know, but we do not want to cause unnecessary angst to people.  That is our aim.

I have two quick questions.  The first is a question I ask of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a lot.  I am interested in the key performance indicators, KPIs, and understand an ambulance service will always look at its indicators based on how may calls it takes and how quick it is.  However, I am interested in whether the service, bearing in mind it is the first point of contact in often quite traumatic situations, is investing in training around diversity, human rights and civil rights.  It is something the Garda has taken on board and started to train up staff on.  What kind of recognition is there in the service of the need for that?  I am aware the service did good work as part of the Covid-19 roll-out and doing mobile sites in the Travelling community.  That is the kind of area I am interested in.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  I am looking at the annual report and the financial statements from 2021 on the National Ambulance Service and there are a number of areas like the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy and things like the enhancement of alternative care pathways.  Will the service give us a general approach to how that aligns with the reforms of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

On the area of equality, diversity and inclusion we are looking to our colleagues in the UK, who have done quite a lot of work on this area.  Our head of HR is engaging with that broader network to understand what the sector is doing over there and what lessons we can bring and embed in our workforce thinking as well.  That is something we are actively doing.</p></speech>

If I can have a very quick follow-up question on that, are they talking to stakeholders in Ireland, for example the Travelling community, new communities in Dublin or whoever it might be?</p></speech>

Obviously we engage through our broader HSE family network as well and there is a broad range of contacts there but on an ambulance-specific workforce, given we have a highly-moblie workforce that engages with all sorts of vulnerable people from a broad range of backgrounds we also need to look at diversification of our own workforce as well because quite frankly-----</p></speech>

We have a health psychologist now as part of our education team so we are rolling in that direction, as it were, but our head of HR is very much focused on it this year.</p> <p>  The second question was on the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy and alternative care pathways.  The two things we are doing, which the CEO mentioned in his opening statement, is hear and treat and see and treat.  We are looking at ways to offer services to patients in the community or at the point of contact.  We have developed a clinical hub and I might ask Professor O'Donnell to talk about the clinical aspects of in a moment.  The hub tries to provide a meaningful clinical solution for patients at the point of contact, as distinct from having to send an ambulance, which is not necessarily always the right thing to do.  An obvious example is when somebody dials 999 with a broken toenail.  They may be alternate pathway of care we can offer to that patient in those circumstances.  The out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy is based on the sudden task force report from 2007 that has been Government policy since then.  It says every uniformed responder in Ireland should be contributing to a reduction in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest mortality.  That involves the fire services, the Garda, community first response schemes and the Irish Coast Guard.  That strategy is focusing on embracing all those organisations and we have 12 organisations around that table that are actively involved in progressing that strategy, which is funded this year to the tune of about &euro;650,000, and all that money will be expended on that.  Some of that is around placing automated external defibrillators, AEDs, in the communities.</p> <p>  I ask Professor O'Donnell to touch on the clinical hub aspects.</p></speech>

The traditional ambulance model where someone rang us and we went out to them in an ambulance with two paramedics and brought them  to hospital, unless they  told us they did not want to go, is the historical model and not nuanced enough for modern healthcare.  We have an aging population and a much more complex healthcare system.  What we are currently doing, and what we are going to build on to do in a much wider fashion, is identify patients who have low-acuity healthcare needs and try to address their healthcare needs in the community close to them so they do not have to go to hospital.  That is good for the patient first of all, it is good for the hospital given the capacity issues we have in the hospital service and it is good for us because of capacity issues we have.</p> <p>  We have a couple of different threads to that.  The one Mr. Morton mentioned is the clinical hub.  We have had clinicians, that is, doctors and nurses, in our ambulance control centre for the last couple of years.  We plan to increase that very significantly.  We recently reached an agreement with Tallaght University Hospital for it to provide us with the clinicians, clinical leadership at consultant level and then nursing staff too.</p></speech>

It has been referred to very strongly in contributions by other members but the importance the NAS has across every constituency in the country cannot be understated.  All I can tell the officials about is what is happening in my own area and unfortunately the reports are not good.  Recently, we had an incident in east Cork where a gentlemen who was waiting over 90 minutes for an ambulance died.  I have dealt with other consequences for people who have been waiting well in excess of an hour.  The consequence of course was the person who was waiting for the ambulance is now deceased.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a recurring issue.  Our existing ambulance service staff, especially those in the HSE Cork-Kerry region, are working exceptionally hard.  I know many of them and they are good people but they will say themselves they are under huge stress.</p> <p>  Something I find completely unacceptable is that when it comes to arriving at the hospital, staff must remain with patients and this effectively disallows them from leaving places like Cork University Hospital and other emergency rooms to go back on the road and get back out there to help people.  It is a profoundly flawed system.  That is the question I put first and foremost.  From a cost perspective, what is the HSE planning to do to allow a quicker turnaround time for ambulance crews who arrive at a hospital with an extremely sick patient and who want to get the patient into the hospital and leave?  I am hearing many reports of crews who are being left in the hospital caring for patients, which is something they should not be doing, quite frankly.  It is a huge concern because the knock-on impact is that ambulance crew will not get to another patient who needs them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#R03200"><p>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of the ambulance service.  I was lucky enough to visit the Tallaght control centre on my first day and it was great to meet the staff.  The atmosphere of caring, quietly efficient teamwork was very impressive.  I will get to meet an ambulance-based crew tomorrow.  We agree ambulance handover times at hospitals are a significant problem.  We are working with hospital staff.  It is about changing mindsets.  We must remember the hospital staff themselves are under significant capacity pressures, which we are trying to alleviate.  It is also about working with them so that we are all thinking of the patient who could be at the side of the road needing the ambulance.  It is a complicated problem that is not straightforward to solve but it is about supporting everyone to get to that same place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#S00100"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Absolutely, it is probably the single biggest clinical risk we face at the moment.  Working closely with all of our colleagues across the acute hospital sector we collectively realise the implications of offload delays and the clinical risk this presents, which is the patient lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance because it is parked at a hospital somewhere.  The solutions are complex.  Some of it is down to capacity in the hospitals and in the ambulance service.  We are focused on working with our acute hospital colleagues to try to streamline the process of handing over patients, and looking at measures we can take <i>in extremis</i>.  Part of that is how we prepare for the forthcoming winter period.  For example, Professor O'Donnell is involved in a high-level group along with other clinicians looking at what are some of the process solutions we can put in place.  From our perspective, we are looking at measures around improving the local escalation arrangements between local National Ambulance Service, NAS, managers and local hospital managers.  We are looking at models such as fit to sit, where we must take a deep look at ourselves and ask ourselves whether every patient who attends an emergency department needs to go in on a stretcher or are some patients clinically suitable to sit in a chair, which would release the ambulance to get out back out to another patient.  We are also looking at cohort arrangements whereby we can have one crew looking after more than one patient, to release another ambulance.  These are the kind of <i>in extremis</i>measures we need to look at as part of our own contingency planning.  It is very high on our radar but the solution will not lie in the acute hospital or the National Ambulance Service looking at it in isolation.  We must look at it together.</p></speech>

This issue has not occurred just today or yesterday.  It has been going on for a number of years.  It is starting to seriously worry me now and, while I do not mean to be parochial,  in my area we are seeing a collapse in SouthDoc services.  I am getting repeated calls from people telling me that they can get through to SouthDoc.  This causes issues and knock-on impacts on whether or not ambulances should be called. Then, when ambulances are called the waiting times are far too long.  This is happening as a consequence of the issues outlined, and as I have outlined, in that they are not being released quickly enough from the hospital.</p> <p>  Surely it is not that big of an undertaking for the HSE to put in place a task force to look at this over six months, and to get teams in place at hospitals to receive the patients so that the ambulance crews can get back on the road.  That is all it is going to take: a couple of nurses and a couple of doctors.  We are all aware of the recruitment shortages in the HSE at the moment, but I do not believe it would have an adverse knock-on impact on the entire national healthcare system to put those staff into the busiest hospitals in the country.  It all boils down to the fact that ambulance crews should not be sitting in hospitals caring for patients.  They should be out on the road trying to rescue people who are in circumstances where they need the help.  It is unacceptable that this is going on in this day and age.</p> <p>  From my knowledge and from what I am hearing in my area it seems to be deteriorating.  That is a serious worry.  Is the provision of funding for a task force something that the HSE would be willing to undertake or look at, and that we would have period of time to look into this issue, with a time limit to come back with some findings to the Government?  Is this on the cards with the HSE?  I cannot take anything that the witnesses said to me today at face value.  I do not believe there was any commitment in anything they said.  Would Mr. Mulvany consider that?</p></speech>

Mr. Morton mentioned that there is a group already in place focused on this issue between hospitals and the ambulance service.  The core of the issue with regard to staffing is that we have put extra funding in for safer staffing in our emergency departments and our hospitals.  We also discussed at the committee recently, and the Deputy has mentioned, the challenges around staffing in the context of recruiting nurses and doctors in emergency departments.  As Mr. Morton has said, some of the measures that have been set up with the ambulance service are to try to mitigate those pressures that continue on our emergency departments.  Part of the winter plan is looking at those measures.  It is not just in the ambulance service because, in fairness, the challenge is not just there.  It is in the hospital on the one hand as well as trying to grow the capacity in the ambulance service.</p> <p>  We are under pressure.  We spoke to the NHS last night and they are equally under huge pressure on this issue of ambulance turnarounds.  The causal factors are partially down to the current increased demand going into the winter.  This is why that group is in place to look at solutions in the short, medium and longer term, and also looking at crisis solutions, as Mr. Morton has set out.  Mr. Morton might want to respond on that.  I want to be clear to the Deputy that there is a group focused on this.  We see it as a huge issue for our performance, for safety, for the release of ambulances, and for patients.  There is a group focused on this for our hospitals and ambulance services.  A collective solution needs to be found.  It is a challenge in lots of healthcare systems at the moment, unfortunately, coming out of the pandemic where we are seeing a lot of pressures on emergency departments.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's concerns and what he has said about getting confidence on it.  We can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to try to find solutions that will address it.  It is not a simple fix.  I just want to be clear on that.  We are trying-----</p></speech>

It is a difficult thing to do.  Anything that involves deploying a medical team does not have a simple solution.  This must be raised, however, and I will give a recent example.  A person in east Cork recently had to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance to come from Carlow.  I will not give any further breakdown, but that person is now dead.  I will leave it to the experts to make their assumptions but it is my understanding that perhaps the person could have been helped if they had got to the hospital on time.  This is extremely worrying.  It is just not good enough.  It is wholly unacceptable that ambulances are being pulled from the middle of Leinster down to Munster in east Cork, and particularly when we have hospital only 45 minutes up the road.  There are most certainly ambulances waiting there to be discharged.  There is an enormous urgency around this issue.  I would hope that in one years' time when the witnesses are before the committee again that improvements would be made by then.  I accept that Covid was exceptionally difficult for everybody but I remind the witnesses that this issue was there before Covid.</p> <p>  All of us here acknowledge the extraordinary work done by the people in the National Ambulance Service.  We are very grateful to them.  They are under enormous pressure.  It is just not good enough from the HSE quite frankly.</p></speech>

Perhaps the HSE will come back to the committee with the definitive position on that.  The figure of &euro;25 million worth is a significant sum of money.  Surely there is a use for that across the health sector.  That needs to be questioned with the manufacturers.</p> <p>  With regard to PPE.  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimates the impairment charges of &euro;374 million, and these are recognised in the 2020 financial statement.  In 2021, the HSE incurred further impairment charges of &euro;109 million.  That is a total impairment of &euro;483 million.  It is a substantial sum of money.  I understand, and it has been explained a few times in this committee by the Health Service Executive in relation to why a lot of stuff must be procured quickly, that saving lives was the priority.  At the same time, it has turned out that a lot of the PPE purchased was not suitable, fell short of standards, or maybe was more than we needed.  In the situation that we were in, obviously people have to play it safe.  The figure of &euro;483 million is a substantial sum of money.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvany will respond to that.</p></speech>

Again, going back to conditions that were in place at the time, about which we do not need to remind people, all of those decisions were made largely in March or April on all the orders.  On the technical piece of it, the vast bulk of that &euro;483 million over two years, which was the &euro;109 and &euro;374 impairment charges, the vast bulk of that was a price impairment.  There is a level that was obsolescence and there is a level that was storage, but the vast bulk of it is price.  This means that we had a choice.  Back in March and April 2020, we could have said "We will buy less now in the hope that we will be able to buy more later, on which there was no certainty, or that we will get it at a better price".  We were just not prepared to do that arbitrage or that gambling.</p></speech>

This was a price impairment.  We did not buy it to resell it.  We bought it to use it.  This is simply a technical piece: if it is worth less at the end of the year before one gets to use it, one charges it to the year.  It is not an impairment of something that is going to be resold.  It is not because it was the wrong size or that it was not fit for purpose.  It is none of that.  That is now on the record of the House and I just need to correct that.  It was not the case.  This was price impairment.  We balanced the financial risk, which was substantial, against the risk that we would not have enough PPE to keep our staff coming to the service.</p></speech>

We and all of Europe were caught in this situation.  We were at the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic and we understand that and the work that was done to counter that.  What we are saying to the HSE now, however, is that whatever the main equipment and sanitiser is, that this receives serious attention, in terms of trying to use it.  Other services possibly might acquire this equipment, as in the case of India which I have no argument with, because this was a worldwide pandemic and a better use was found for it.</p> <p>  My other question-----</p></speech>

That is a separate discussion about the hand sanitiser, which we will do everything to address.</p></speech>

One of the reasons for this was that it was a sellers&rsquo; market at that point in the spring of 2020.  One of the reasons, in turn, was that it turned out that we did not have any indigenous sources.  Many people have raised with me the question as to how we arrived at a situation, not just in Ireland, but in Europe, and in particular western Europe, where we do not make masks, hand sanitisers, gowns or protective suits.  What has been done now because I would not like to see the country caught again?  Because of international travel now, the world is a smaller place.  I am not an expert on this but the Spanish flu became an epidemic mainly in Europe.  It did not travel as far and travelled more slowly.  Many of us thought that perhaps Africa would be very badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic but it turned out that the virus did not reach parts of Africa because, from a development point of view, cars were not as available and people do not move as far.  Many localities in Africa, apparently, remain, thank God, fairly Covid-19-free.  My point is to ask what is happening now and what is being done now to ensure that we have indigenous supplies of PPE when we need them.  Perhaps the Department and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady might answer my question here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#T00600"><p>In the first instance I will answer and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady can come in then.  We have bought a substantial amount of masks, in particular, from indigenous suppliers but we had an element of indigenous supply prior to Covid-19.  The issue was that the volume of PPE required pre-Covid-19 and post-Covid-19 was incomparable.  The Chairman is completely right in that this is one of the lessons to be learned and it is being learned.  There is a European-wide agency looking at future preparedness.</p></speech>

There has been development of indigenous supply.  As I understand it, our HSE colleagues have advised that a great deal of current expenditure on replenishing stocks is coming through indigenous suppliers.  That has been built up with support from the Department of Health and from other Departments.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also involved, so I believe that lessons have been learned.  I am not across the detail of this or have it in front of me.</p></speech>

It is hard to prepare for every emergency but if one thing emerged from that pandemic, it showed that western Europe was caught out and we need to be more prepared in future.</p> <p>  I have a couple of final questions.  On home care, the budget and the number of hours have been increased, all of which are welcome.  We want to try to keep more people at home.  There are problems arising in the nursing home sector which clearly point to this.  The demographic trend is that people are living longer and they want to stay at home.  Some 99 out of 100 elderly people will say that they would prefer to be kept in their own home for as long as possible.  </p> <p>  I understand there are problems with recruitment.  The service is provided directly by HSE staff, by what used to be termed home helps and by agency staff.  As an observation, based on my own contemporaries, the agencies have a job in retaining staff and perhaps the HSE does too.  On the issue of costs, and in answer to parliamentary questions I have submitted over the years to which I have often had difficulty in getting a direct answer, where it might take a couple of parliamentary questions, these replies confirm that agency staff cost more to the HSE than directly-employed HSE staff.  This was contained in the answers I received on three occasions over the past 12 years.  On that issue, how much effort is being put into recruiting directly-employed HSE staff for home care?</p></speech>

If we were appearing before the committee three years ago, members would have been correct in informing us that they had seen letters where people were waiting because of funding.  That has now been substantially eliminated.  Now we have people waiting, unfortunately, because we need to get caring staff to go out and care for them.  This is just as big a problem if one is waiting, but is one we are seeking to recruit for.</p></speech>

I understand that there are three different types of services.  First, there is a public one, which is the PRSI service, whereby some people get cover if they have a certain class of PRSI and are entitled to certain treatments.  The second is the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, which is the medical card scheme.  The third one is the school service.  I am trying to understand what is happening in the three of those.  I am saying here today that the school service is not available in the part of the planet I inhabit; it is not available in Laois.  Every time HSE representatives appear before the committee, I will say the same thing to them because this has to be fixed.  There is no primary school dental service in County Laois and it is patchy in County Offaly as well.  Children who have gone right through that system, are almost at the end of the secondary school system and are 17 years of age, have never seen a school dentist or public dentist.</p> <p>  I am saying directly to our witnesses that on its budget, the Committee of Public Accounts and I want to know that if the Department of Health takes up a significant amount of money for the budget over at the Miesian Plaza - I would argue for as much money as possible going there because running the health service is expensive - that we will see a service at the other end.  What is happening in between?  If we are relying on private providers, why are we not offering a career path here to train, recruit, encourage and educate people into these positions?</p><p>This must be sorted.  The DTSS has collapsed also.  It is non-existent.  There is no DTSS.  The HSE is negotiating with hundreds of businesses.</p></speech>

No one has said to the Minister for Health or to the Minister for Finance that they are putting too much money into it.  I know these issues are hard to fix, but a start must be made somewhere.  Could Mr. Mulvany say what the funding is on a national level for dental services?  Could he tell me what it is per CHO?  I do not want to be parochial, but I am trying to get my head around what is happening.

Agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings for today's meeting?  Agreed.

We will then go into private session to report on our engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The first item is minutes from the meeting dated 29 September 2022, which have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters regarding the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, they will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  I will move on to accounts and financial statements.  Some 56 sets of financial statements and accounts, including appropriation accounts, were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas between 26 and 30 September 2022.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening the floor to members.</p></speech>

This is effectively a dormant account.  There are no transactions on it, and it received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The next couple are subsidiaries of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann - Greyhound Racing Operations Ireland Limited for 2021, which got a clear audit opinion; Abergrove Limited got a clear audit opinion for 2021; and Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium Limited got a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Also related to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust.</p><p>The account for 2021 received a clear audit opinion.  No. 6 is the Ciste Pinsean Thithe an Oireachtais, Comhalta&iacute;, account and it received a clear audit opinion.  No. 7 is the National Oil Reserves Agency designated activity company, DAC, for 2021 and it received a clear audit opinion.  No. 8 is Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge for 2021 and it received a clear audit opinion.  No. 9, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for 2021, received a clear audit opinion.  No. 10, the Broadcasting Fund, which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, received a clear audit opinion.  No. 11 is the Pensions Authority for 2021 and that received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> Nos. 12 to 56 are the 45 appropriation accounts for Government Departments and together they have an expenditure in aggregate of approximately &euro;74.5 billion.  I issued a clear audit opinion in all cases.  I do not propose to recite all their names.  I did, however, draw attention to certain matters in the audit certificates.  Obviously, where relevant, I referred to chapters that were published and that dealt with issues.  I also drew attention in a number of cases to material instances of non-compliant procurement.  This is where the aggregate level of identified non-compliant procurement was in excess of &euro;500,000 each.  In relation to four of the appropriation accounts, I drew attention to specific matters.  For Vote 11, Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I drew attention to a payment of &euro;460,000 to a supplier in settlement of arbitration proceedings.  For Vote 13, Office of Public Works, I drew attention to the continuing operation of a maintenance contract where the expenditure incurred is significantly greater than that envisaged when the contract was put in place.  This places it in the category of non-compliant procurement.  For Vote 34, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, similar to last year, I drew attention to a continuing large EU fine incurred in 2021 in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway.  Finally, for Vote 42, Rural and Community Development, I drew attention to the recovery of grant funding of &euro;1.09 million from Mayo County Council following the termination of funding agreements for four projects under the Department-funded outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme due to identified irregularities.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy.  Can we agree and note the financial statements and accounts?  Agreed.  As usual, they will be published as part of the minutes.</p><p>As previously agreed, items of correspondence not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is that from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  </p><p>No. R1476B is correspondence from Ms Cathy Bryan, public transport and corporate services division, Department of Transport, dated 22 September 2022, explaining why the financial statements of the National Transport Authority, NTA, were not laid before the Houses within the timelines set down in Circular 24/21.  To put this in context, Circular 24/21 included the timelines within which accounts and funds audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The circular states that:</p> <blockquote> 	If exceptional or unusual circumstances arise which cause an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits, either for a body or fund in submitting its financial statements/accounts to the parent Department or for the Department in laying the financial statements or accounts of the body or fund before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts [...] should be informed of this by the relevant Department. </blockquote> <p>Due to a widespread failure to comply with this provision, we have a standing agreement to request explanations from State bodies that do not meet the timelines set down in the circular.  As is the case with Nos. R1475B and R1476B, which are also on today&rsquo;s correspondence list, this item of correspondence is proactive notification of a delay to the laying of accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas and is unusual in that it demonstrates compliance with the circular.  That is welcome, and we should see more of this type of correspondence, as it removes the need for us to monitor compliance and request explanations.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this correspondence for discussion.</p></speech>

Dublin Bus raised approximately &euro;1.6 million in advertising revenue in 2020.  I presume this figure will not differ hugely, given only so much advertising space is available.  A division within CI&Eacute; manages the contract on behalf of the NTA.  It is doing the work, but the money is being taken by the NTA.  It seems to be a very clumsy arrangement.</p><p>Does it do exactly the same in relation to Go-Ahead advertising or any other organisation.  To be honest, I have never had as many complaints as I have had since the National Transport Authority, NTA, has taken over responsibility for bus services.  It is quite chaotic.  </p></speech>

There is a number of items of correspondence from different bodies - I cannot clarify how many - but they indicate that the delay to the laying of the accounts relates to the fact that the budget was brought forward.  It was announced that the budget would be brought forward in July.  That is seven months into the year.  I would have thought that there would have been still sufficient time for accounts to have been prepared beforehand.  The cited circular is exactly one year old.  Within its first incarnation there are a number of bodies that are not providing their accounts on time.  There needs to be an improvement across all bodies in respect of that.  Of course it is better for somebody to proactively let us know that they will be late as opposed to us having to chase accounts up.  It would save on the paper in the correspondence if the accounts were actually submitted on time.  </p> <p>  The NTA were in before the committee not too long ago and there are a couple of outstanding questions which we might follow up on over the coming weeks as well.</p></speech>

As it has grown it is having a greater impact.  Its representatives were in before with regard to the capital projects that were taking place.  These are incredibly significant.  This week both the BusConnects and metro projects for my area are being published in tandem.  It would be useful to have the NTA in again.  The area I would like us to focus on is the area of fines for non-delivery of service.  If I am correct, we have seen Go-Ahead, the Luas, and one other operator that I cannot recall here, all being issued fines up to a value of approximately &euro;5 million.  It would be interesting to understand what happens those fines when they are collected, the economic calculation of whether they have any real impact on the service providers, and whether they are pitched at the right level.  The service delivery side mentioned by Deputy Murphy and also the capital projects the NTA operate under Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, are things we should look at when they come before the committee.</p></speech>

Have the Department officials been provided with the business case for the proposed project?  Has the external assurance process, required under the public spending code, happened?  I think they are called decision gates and it would be quite useful to know what they are.  Are we likely to see, for example, the HSE putting together a board like the National Pediatric Hospital Development Board as a subset?  How is it going to be managed?  We can keep on talking about learning lessons but there is something live at the moment and we need to be watching this process to make sure it is managed in a way that is not as frustrating as the children's hospital.</p></speech>

It is putting the cart before the horse, so to speak.</p> <p>  There is a considerable amount of documentation with that item which members may find useful and wish to refer to again.</p> <p>  Crrespondence No. 1494B is from Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer, HSE community healthcare organisation, 4.  It arises from last week&rsquo;s engagement with the HSE, during which certain information provided by the HSE was subsequently queried.  This item got a fair thrashing out this morning.  I know Deputy Hourigan had a particular interest in it.  If members are okay with that, we will move on.  </p> <p>  I want to revert to No. R1492 as it was not addressed.  Correspondence No. 1492, dated 20 October 2022, is from Mr. David Moloney, Accounting Officer and Secretary General, related to our work programme and the engagements we have scheduled with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and concerns on the agenda for the engagement.  This item was only received yesterday and I am not sure if members have had a chance to consider it.  At our meeting last week, we agreed that the agenda is as follows: taken from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021, chapter 3, on Vote accounting and budget management; and chapter 4, on the re-allocation of Voted funding; format and content of the appropriation accounts and the associated circular; and value for money and spending reviews, which is an area we have been dealing with recently.  </p> <p>  We also agreed to advise the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the closure of the Benefacts database and the Department's correspondence concerning expenditure on the National Maternity Hospital, considered the week before last, in correspondence No. R1426, might also be raised.  The Benefacts database is an area which we have been trying to give attention to and scrutinise.</p> <p>  Given the range of material to be covered, and to avoid crowding the agenda, it was decided not to include the appropriation accounts for this meeting and to consider scheduling a further meeting at a later date.  The Secretary General has requested the committee to consider including the relevant appropriation accounts which are: Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances; Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement, and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  The Secretary General makes the case that this was done at the meeting last May, and that the appropriation accounts provide the basis for discussing some of the other matters that will be raised.</p> <p>  Are members happy to proceed with the agenda as agreed last week or is there a preference to examine the relevant appropriation accounts as requested by Mr. Moloney?  </p> <p>  It was left off because we felt it was crowding out the meeting but the Secretary General is making the case here that the appropriation accounts would provide the basis for discussing some of the matters that will be raised and that we have highlighted.  It is in the committee members' hands at this stage.</p></speech>

It is point 4.  Members might remember that the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, was to be set up on 1 January this year to replace the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  One big impediment to the effective running of the ODCE was that there was an inadequate number of garda&iacute; assigned to it.  The director had come out and been critical of that.  A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Garda and the new CEA.  I was given the assurance in the D&aacute;il that would be the case.  It says on item 4 that there were to be 16.  I understand there are, according to this, seven members assigned.  This agency cannot function unless the garda&iacute; are assigned.  There are high-profile cases like the one in relation to the FAI and John Delaney, pending a long time, and the one for Independent Newspapers.  People lose confidence in an agency if it cannot do its work in a timely way.  This agency was to be set up with the appropriate complement of garda&iacute;, who are required because they have the power to arrest, for example.  Something may be pending and you can do nothing unless you have the power to arrest.</p> <p>  We need a quarterly report on progress on this recruitment.  It should have been ready to go when the new agency was set up.  We will be serious about corporate crime or we will not.  We end up having to do things retrospectively that cost way more money.  There is significant value for money in this.  Given the director of the ODCE was so critical of the inadequate number of garda&iacute; and the assurances we have been given, the idea this did not happen from day one is not acceptable.  I want a close eye kept on that.</p></speech>

This is Maynooth University but could equally relate to any of the universities where additional resources are sought from students in relation to student services.  I welcome where these are treated separately.  There were referendums in Maynooth to collect an additional amount going back to the 1990s.  The money was to be borrowed from the European Investment Bank and then paid back by the levy.  That levy was increased in 2015 to provide the new building, which had commenced.  Now the project has terminated.</p> <p>  There is a big protest outside Maynooth today.  Maynooth started as a college with about 5,000 students.  There are now about 15,000 so it is one of the more rapidly growing universities.  There are people from all parts of the country attending it and there are many positive things to say about it.  However, where there is a dedicated amount of money for particular projects, is it set out in the accounts that it is used for the purpose for which it is collected?  It appears this project has been ended and, instead of that facility being provided, they are told there will be additional spaces in other buildings around the campus, seating and things like that.  It is not what the students voted for.  The issue is about how it is accounted for and holding them to account for delivering things that are collected for.  It is a big deal to be paying &euro;150 on top of the &euro;3,000.  The student body has got bigger there over the years.</p></speech>

One paid in money over a four-year period for this project and raised the issue of the project not going ahead.  It seems there was just a decision taken to end it.  They are saying if the money was collected for that purpose, what happens?  That is an issue we need to follow up with the university.  I will bring in the Comptroller and Auditor General on this.  Does he want to offer a view?</p></speech>

It would be premature for me to give a view.  The issues the Deputy has outlined deserve answers.  The committee may want to write to the university and set out those questions.  We will examine it as part of the audit.</p> <p>  In terms of the way it is accounted for, the student levy income is taken as an income into the university.  There is not a restricted reserve in which that money has been accumulating.  Some of it has been spent.  It is all intended to be spent on student services or student-related services, societies and so on.</p><p>Obviously, a large part of it was for the infrastructure development and there was an accumulated fund.  Even as far back as 2014, it already had a certain amount in it which was being earmarked for expenditure on the centre.  In a way, there is a general issue coming out of the hyperinflation impacting on a capital project because the same rules apply to capital projects everywhere, and this may not be the only capital project that will find itself in difficulties like this.</p></speech>

I may well talk to them, as the Chairman may also do.  A key condition attached to the 1999 levy referendum was that if any of the conditions were broken, the referendum would be deemed null and void, so they were being very clear about what was expected and that was set out.  I completely understand about the hyperinflation and I believe this project has gone something like 50% over what was originally tendered.  We need to understand that.  To go back to the 1990s, there was a &euro;40 per student fee at that time and that went up to &euro;150 in 2015.  That was to be discontinued when the facilities were in place but none of the facilities that were supposed to be in place have been provided.  That is why there is such frustration that the money was collected but the services have not been delivered.  There is a wider issue and I believe we should be looking at this when we are looking at the universities and, in particular, where there are additional charges, how they are handled and what is delivered from them.  There cannot be a university without students.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, not later than 6 months after the passage of this Act, lay a report before the Oireachtas Committee that&mdash; <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	(a) proposes the wording for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure,<br /><br />(b) sets out a timeline for the referendum,<br /><br />(c) sets out in detail all other key considerations.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This amendment, if accepted, will mean that the Minister, no later than six months after the passage of this Bill will lay a report before the Oireachtas committee on a proposed wording for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure, to set out a timeline for a referendum, and to set out in detail any other considerations.</p><p>For quite some time the Government has been saying that the matter of a referendum is under consideration.  This Government and Oireachtas is approximately halfway through its full term, so I believe the time for this matter to be under consideration is coming to a close and we need to know what the timeline is and when this will happen.</p><p>This amendment seeks to do that and I will go through some of the reasons I think that is very important, but I believe it would be useful if the Minister of State were able to give us an update.  Is this matter still under consideration or does the Government now have a timeline as to when this referendum is likely to happen and when will we hear more about it?  What are the Ministers of State&rsquo;s thoughts in that regard?  </p><p>On the substantive issue of water, its supply and the importance of it being in public ownership, we have seen around the world in the past number of years 235 different places where water went into private ownership and has been brought back into public ownership because the privatisation was so disastrous.  Two of the high profile areas we would be aware of are Berlin and Paris.  </p><p>In Paris, for example, over 24 years of privatisation the price of water increased by 174%.  While the profits of the owner soared, the amount of public investment in the infrastructure did not justify that.  That is one of the reasons water was brought back into public ownership.  Bringing water back into public ownership is a very costly exercise because this infrastructure has often been privatised at a low cost and brought back in to public ownership at a very high cost to the Exchequer or to the people.</p><p>In Berlin the privatisation of water was nothing short of a disaster.  It led to very significant deficits in investment in water infrastructure, which is something that we could not afford here.  I am aware that the present Government has no intention whatsoever to privatise water.  This is very important, however, where we as a committee are always talking about housing and the infrastructure needed around housing.  While there are very significant deficits in that at present, privatisation would make that even worse again.  As a fundamental issue in respect of people&rsquo;s access to this resource, with the exception of air, there is nothing we need access to more for human life, for business, for farms, for companies, for industry and for everything, than water.  </p><p>It is of crucial importance and the reassurance that a referendum on this will be held, putting it into the Constitution, and enshrining that public right and ownership, would be a very positive step.  That is what this amendment is seeking to do in progressing that.  If the Minister of State is able to give us a definitive update on what is going to happen with a referendum, then I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

We fought a long campaign to prevent water being privatised.  Some hundreds of thousands of people came on to the street.  This issue does not seem to be on the Government&rsquo;s agenda but there is still a concern there among people I speak to that until we have the referendum and until right to water issue is enshrined in the Constitution, a Government at some future stage might try to revisit this issue and privatise water and the water infrastructure in this State.  That is why we need a commitment and a timeline from the Government to know that this will not happen.  With the cost of living, in housing and in health; these are the number one issues.  There is still a fear factor there in the back of people&rsquo;s minds, however, about this privatisation agenda which Fine Gael has driven for the past 12 years.</p> <p>  I would appreciate, therefore, if the Minister of State could give that commitment because at least people would know then and it would help to ease their minds because at this moment in time, this issue is still a serious concern for many people.</p></speech>

I have a letter here from SIPTU and its members where in Limerick alone, the county council wants 70 of their water and water treatment system workers to transfer to Irish Water.  We are talking here about not privatising water yet this transfer has to be done by 2026.  This represents 70 of the local authority workers who are working in the water services who are being told at the moment that they are not being forced but are being asked to change over to Irish Water, and that the county council wants this framework done by 2026.  It appears to me that the Government is looking at privatising our water system completely where it is bringing over local authority workers from their local authority work to Irish Water.  In the absence of a collective agreement or of a rejection of the framework document, some are advocating that the Government would be enabled to implement section 19 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which provides for compulsory transfer of a number of matters to Irish Water.</p></speech>

I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments which may show that the Government in the back of its head is looking at privatising our water system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.618" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022100600002#B00100"><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for the proposed amendment.  I agree with the comments made.  I have seen in other countries where privatisation has been brought in, either through IMF interventions or structural adjustment programmes, that it has been detrimental.  That is not on the cards here.  I give that assurance.  There is also a commitment to a referendum in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  The amendment concerns the wording and timeline for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure.  While I welcome and share the support shown by the Deputy for a referendum on ownership, the amendment suggested is outside the scope of this Bill and cannot therefore be accepted.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will recall, the 2017 report of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services supported the holding of a referendum, subject to there being no adverse impact on private and group water services.  In response, and in the context of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced in the previous D&aacute;il, extensive work has been undertaken by the Department and the Office of the Attorney General to consider possible approaches to advancing a referendum proposal.  An approach based on protecting the public ownership of the entity established under law to provide public water services, Irish Water, has been identified as the most appropriate and straightforward approach.  Having consulted his colleagues in Government on the matter, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has signalled his willingness to support a referendum on public ownership along these lines.</p> <p>  An important consideration in planning for a successful referendum is the need to ensure proper public engagement.  Noting that the Commission on Housing has been specifically tasked with advising the Government on a referendum to place the right to housing in the Constitution, it would make sense that the constitutional issues around the rights to housing and the protection for the supply of public water should be considered at the same time.  The Department will therefore bring its proposals on a water referendum to Government in conjunction with any anticipated referendum on housing.</p> <p>  It is understood that the Commission on Housing hopes to be in a position to put forward proposed wording for a referendum on housing towards the end of this year or very early in the New Year.  This approach has been outlined to unions on the referendum, on which I note the points made by Deputy O'Donoghue, in the context of the broader engagement on water sector transformation.  The position is set out in a paper entitled Water Sector Transformation: the Wider Policy Context, which the Department shared with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 18 July 2022 and which the Minister has now placed in the Oireachtas Library for the benefit of Members generally.</p> <p>  I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  I assure members that it is the Government's intention to proceed with the referendum on water in tandem with the referendum on housing.</p></speech>

It is now five years since the report was published and more than five years since most people felt this matter had been settled and consensus was achieved on the need for a referendum to provide assurance in the Constitution that our water infrastructure would stay in public ownership.  However, we are still left without a referendum.</p> <p>  The Minister of State made the relevant point that what has happened in some other countries has not always been driven by governments but has sometimes been driven by the IMF or external bodies.  I do not believe and I certainly hope that we will not be in such a situation any time soon but we never know what will happen.  We need protections in the Constitution, as otherwise economic turmoil or spillover from the disastrous situation in the UK at the moment could lead to a Government being told that, whether it likes it or not, privatisation must go ahead.  If we had a provision in the Constitution, that would be off the table.  The IMF or anyone else could say whatever it wanted but the Constitution would provide full protection and we would not have to worry about the issue.  That is one reason that, notwithstanding the fair amount of political consensus on this issue at the moment, having this provided in the Constitution is a good idea.</p> <p>  It is positive that the Minister of State reiterated the point about holding a referendum at the same time as a referendum on housing but we do not have a date or timeline for the latter either.  My concern is that we are halfway through this Government and we never know what could happen.  If the Government were to end early due to unforeseen circumstances and these referendums are not held, the matter is then on the plate of the next Government.  The failure of the Government to give a firm time commitment is the reason I am concerned.  Unless the Minister of State can give us a timeline for the referendum, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

The intention is to have the wording ready for the end of this year or early 2023.  That would put the commission in place and it would then get moving on a timeline for a referendum and referendum campaign.</p> <p>  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will remain in public ownership so a referendum aside, the programme for Government includes a commitment that Irish Water will be retained in public ownership as a national, stand-alone, regulated utility.  However, I fully appreciate the assurance Deputy O'Callaghan has spoken about with regard to having that enshrined in the Constitution as an added safeguard.  It is important from my perspective and that of the Government that the referendum take place.</p></speech>

It is always tricky running two referendums on the same day.  I will not say they are similar issues but I know there will be considerable public engagement on both.  I cannot anticipate what the wording will be on the housing referendum specifically but it is important, as Deputy O'Callaghan said, that we try to move as quickly as possible with this.</p></speech>

One of the concerns that many of us have is that in the second document that emerged from the Workplace Relations Commission discussions, which is directly related to this legislation and to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill, there is no commitment to hold a referendum.  To be clear, we have a commitment from the Minister to consider, at a future date, bringing a proposal to the Government.  Does the Minister of State know if there is consensus among the Government parties that if such a proposition was brought, there would be agreement?  We are waiting for the Commission on Housing to report and we understand it will report in November.  We understand it is highly likely to recommend a referendum on the right to housing in the Constitution.  However, we also know from this committee that while a majority of members are on record as supporting such a measure, Fine Gael members, as is their right, currently do not support such a proposition, although that may change.  I am not asking about Cabinet because it is governed by Cabinet confidentiality, but is the Minister of State aware of any consensus among the three parties in government that a referendum to enshrine in the Constitution the public ownership of our public water system or utility would be a good thing?  I ask because there is considerable concern among water service workers regarding the single utility.  One of the points many of these workers make is that if there was a constitutional protection for the public status of the utility, and this speaks directly to Deputy O'Donoghue's question, the decision of whether they transfer to Irish Water would be a much easier one for them to make.  Therefore, some clarity on where the Government parties stand would be really helpful on this.</p></speech>

Again, as I said, the wording is being worked on in regard to the housing referendum and, similarly, in parallel with that, wording will be worked on in terms of what shape the referendum on water will take.

It is at that point that a decision is formally made on whether to proceed to a referendum, and either outcome is possible.  The Cabinet and the Government will be within their rights to decide collectively that they do not want to go with that wording and not have a referendum.  What we know now is that the wording on a referendum is being worked on and that will be brought to Cabinet.  We do not have a specific timeline on that and we do not know how the Cabinet or the Government will decide on that because no one can tell.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.644" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022100600002#D00300"><p>Section 16 provides that Uisce &Eacute;ireann, also to be known as Irish Water, will be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The heightened levels of accountability and transparency applying to Uisce &Eacute;ireann are commensurate with the level of Exchequer funding of the company.  This policy change has a consequential impact on another statutory body tasked with an oversight role with respect to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, namely, the Water Advisory Body.  There will be a duplication between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Water Advisory Body as both consider transparency and accountability matters relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, considers that it is in the best interests of the Oireachtas and Uisce &Eacute;ireann that there is a clear line of accountability for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and that the Committee of Public Accounts is the appropriate body that should be solely tasked with this role.  This sole accountability role for the Committee of Public Accounts will obviate the need for the Water Advisory Body.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is giving urgent consideration to the accountability arrangements in light of the role of the Committee of Public Accounts and will consult further with Government colleagues on this matter.  Any amendment necessary would be relevant to the provision, scope and principles of the Bill.  The Minister considers that any change to the Water Advisory Body will not diminish the individual statutory roles of the three bodies currently represented on the Water Advisory Body, namely, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and An F&oacute;ram Uisce.  Any decision would not change their individual relationship with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister acknowledges that it is open to the joint committee to request all three bodies and Uisce &Eacute;ireann to appear before it on matters relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts has a specific legal and constitutional responsibility.  Although it does not exclusively focus on the issue of the use of public money, that is its primary responsibility.  The Water Forum is a much broader body, which has a range of different opinions and views on it.  I am unsure whether having a level of statutory accountability to both bodies necessarily involves duplication or conflicts.  Has this been discussed with the Water Advisory Board?  Has its opinion been sought?  If it has not, I urge the Department to seek its opinion before any amendment is brought forward.  If there has been consultation with the Water Advisory Board, I would like the committee to have sight of the view of the board on the matter.  If the Department is not going to do that in advance of any amendment that may be tabled by the Minister, particularly keeping in mind that it might be a late stage amendment on Report Stage and in light of the significant information the Minister of State has just outlined, the Chairman should share that information with the Water Advisory Board and seek its view on the matter for the committee.  Obviously, we cannot prejudge an amendment we have not seen, but what has been outlined by the Minister of State would be a significant change from the Bill as it stands.</p></speech>

It is only correct that the committee would have sight of the view of the Water Advisory Board.  We are trying to ensure there is a clear line of accountability through the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think that is the correct approach.  Obviously, there is also oversight through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I wanted to flag the matter with members.  We will seek the views of the Water Advisory Board and have it appear before the joint committee in that regard.</p></speech>

When the Bill was initiated, Uisce &Eacute;ireann was placed at No. 206 in Schedule 13 as that was the next available number at the time.  The Revenue Commissioners has advised the Department that Uisce &Eacute;ireann should be placed at No. 210.  This is because Nos. 206 and 207 were allocated to bodies that will be established on foot of the recently enacted Institutional Burials Act 2022 and Electoral Reform Act 2022, and Nos. 208 and 209 have been allocated to bodies that will be added to Schedule 13 by the finance Bill.</p></speech>
