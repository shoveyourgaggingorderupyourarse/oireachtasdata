Apologies have been received from Deputy Munster.  If attending in the committee room, which everyone is this morning, or from the precincts of Leinster House, attendees are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others against the risk of contracting Covid-19, which I hear is back again.  Members attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is accompanied this morning by Mr. John Crean, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  We engaged last week with the Health Service Executive to examine, in the context of its 2021 financial statements, mental health-related expenditure in community health organisations, CHOs, 4 and 8.  This morning we will examine the HSE's 2021 financial statements in more detail, including expenditure on ambulance services.</p> <p>  We are joined in the committee room by the following officials from the HSE: Mr. Stephen Mulvany, interim chief executive officer; Mr. Damien McCallion, chief operations officer; Ms Mair&eacute;ad Dolan, chief financial officer; Mr. Robert Morton, director of the National Ambulance Service, NAS; and Professor Cathal O'Donnell, clinical director of the NAS.  We are also joined from the Department of Health by Mr. John O'Grady, principal officer, and Mr. Keith Comiskey, principal officer.  The witnesses are all welcome.  I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse that privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, I may direct witnesses to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, introduced the HSE's 2021 financial statements at last week's meeting.  This is on the record and was circulated to members.  Before we proceed, I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General if he wishes to add to his opening remarks from last week.</p></speech>

He is back in a different position today.  We might say he is in the hot seat.  It is detailed in the letter of invitation that he has five minutes for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#A00900"><p>I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to attend today&rsquo;s meeting to discuss expenditure on emergency services, particularly ambulance services, in the context of the HSE's financial statements 2021.  The Chair has identified the colleagues who are here and introduced them so I will not repeat that.  As requested by the committee, we submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting a briefing note that provides information and a detailed breakdown of HSE expenditure on the NAS.  At last week&rsquo;s session, we provided in the opening statement an overview of the annual financial statements for 2021 and the financial outturn.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks today to the following matters.</p> <p>  The NAS operates from over 100 locations throughout Ireland and its services are delivered by over 2,000 staff members.  The NAS operates under the HSE&rsquo;s performance accountability framework, which sets out the means by which the service is held to account for its performance in relation to access to services and the quality and safety of those services.  The clinical governance of NAS is provided by a full-time clinical director who is supported by a number of other senior clinicians.  The NAS received a budget allocation for 2021 of &euro;202.1 million, representing approximately an 8% increase when compared with 2020.  The actual expenditure for 2021 was approximately &euro;202.9 million, which included Covid-related services.</p> <p>  This expenditure saw the NAS responding in 2021 to over 366,000 emergency 999 and urgent calls; transporting approximately 24,000 intermediate care patients; more than 1,000 aero-medical and air ambulance calls; 2,047 calls via the NAS critical care retrieval service; and the delivery of mobile swabbing and vaccination services in relation to Covid.  Other key activities progressed in 2021 included implementation of the out-of-hours cardiac arrest strategy; continuing development of alternative care pathways - hear and treat or refer and see and treat or refer; a new service commencing in Connemara; supporting implementation of the strategy, a trauma system for Ireland; and improvements to the NAS critical care and retrieval service for adults, children and neonates.</p><p>As of August 2022, NAS expenditure is in the order of &euro;131.7 million against a year-to-date budget of &euro;133 million.  The full year allocation of budget for the NAS is of the order of &euro;202.6 million.</p><p> Based on the outputs of a capacity and demand analysis commissioned in July 2021 and new developments set out in the NAS draft strategic plan, the current NAS workforce plan recommends 2,161 additional staff across a broad spectrum of roles that would be required to meet the future needs of the service.  Given the scale of workforce growth required over the coming years, it is expected to take up to ten years to effectively double the workforce.</p><p> In 2022, 62 graduate paramedics have commenced work and the NAS expects to recruit up to 180 student paramedics and 90 emergency medical technicians by year end.  For 2023 recruitment planning, a submission has been made to recruit up to a further 192 student paramedics across NAS programmes starting in January and September 2023, as well as growing educational capacity by opening a fourth campus in 2023 in the south of the country.  In addition, in 2023, recruitment competitions are planned for 50 medical emergency controllers and 25 intermediate care operatives.</p><p> Last winter, the NAS put in place a capacity action plan which sought to engage with all of the capacity that is available in Ireland, including remobilising all of the community first responder schemes that had unfortunately been stood down in March 2020 due to the Covid pandemic.  The service engaged with voluntary ambulance organisations and the private ambulance sector as part of the contingency plan for winter.</p><p> The HSE continues to invest and develop our urgent and emergency care systems.  There was significant investment in capacity and people in the past 18 months.  We are in the process of preparing the national service plan, which will include the NAS plans for 2023.</p><p> Despite the challenges of recent years, the continued investment by Government in the HSE in the National Ambulance Service is contributing to progress on the shift to reorient healthcare away from a hospital-centric model.  Recent measures are particularly evident within the NAS in the areas of ehealth, telemedicine, and community-delivered care and service integration, that is, community paramedicine, pathfinder programmes and alternative pre-hospital pathways.  The NAS is currently finalising a strategic plan for the service that will provide a roadmap for the continued development and enhancement of the service.</p></speech>

I just want to touch briefly on the cyberattack of last year and specifically the individuals whose data may have been exposed.  Have they been informed by the HSE that their data was incorporated into that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00400"><p>In my first address as CEO, it is important that I acknowledge all the hard work of all the healthcare and social care services staff across the system during both Covid and the criminal cyberattack.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s point, as I understand it, there is a significant volume of work that is progressing so we that can get to the point where we can appropriately communicate with those individuals who need to be communicated with.  We are very anxious to do so in a way that does not cause unnecessary upset.  We are conscious that it is taking longer than people might expect.  However, the volume and complexity of what we are dealing with is substantial.  We are engaged with the Government data protection officer, DPO, to make sure that we are seen to and are doing this in an appropriate way.  I do not believe, specifically, we have made any direct contacts yet with individuals around the data.  However, I understand that is in the near future.  As I said, it is a complex task to be approached appropriately.</p></speech>

Is that days, weeks or months?</p></speech>

I can get the Deputy an update on that; I do not have the specific detail as to when that process will compete.  However, as I said, it is a process that we are heavily engaged in and investing in.  We are also making sure that we are engaged with the DPO on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00700"><p>Mr. Mulvany mentioned a complex process.  I do not think anyone would dispute that.  We can all appreciate that would be the case and that a number of steps will need to be taken in response to it.</p> <p>  My difficulty is getting an understanding of what step is informing those people whose data may have been exposed.  It clearly was not the first or even the second.  Where down the line is it?  What does Mr. Mulvany envisage has to be done before we get to the point where people who are affected are informed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00800"><p>It cannot be the first or the second step.  There are a number of steps to be gone through in assessing the data.  Does Mr. McCallion want to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B00900"><p>I can add to what Mr. Mulvany said.  We stood up a team who will be making contact with people, so all of that part of it is in place.  The scoping out of those who need to be contacted is what is being closed off at the moment.  As the Deputy said, it is complex in relation to just being precise about who needs to be contacted following the attack.  As he can imagine, trying to work that through is complex.  That is the piece that is being closed out at the moment.  In addition, there are ongoing discussions with the DPO and others just to make sure that the process is fully robust and when we start that process off, it is clear in how we deal with people who may concerned as a result of it.  It is, as Mr. Mulvany said, getting closer, but there are just a number of final steps around that scoping and making sure we are clear what that contact is.  The teams have been stood up and are ready to move once we need to move.  We utilised some of the resource that we had in the pandemic in terms of contract tracing.  We reassigned some of those people so that we will have a team ready to go once we clarify the scope of it and some the legal and other data protection issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B01100"><p>I do not have a final figure on that at the moment.  That is still a work in progress.  There are decisions to be made on some of the groups.  I do not want to throw out a number that is not correct.  We are trying to finalise that.  However, it is a substantial number of people who will need to be contacted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#B01200"><p>Are we into the tens of thousands?</p></speech>

We can redeploy people to that to strengthen it up based on what the final numbers will be.</p></speech>

Have any or all of those who have been affected been rated at this point?</p></speech>

It is self-declared but there is a pathway one has to follow.  As I said, we have to follow that and we are in conjunction with the data protection officer.  It would not be appropriate at this stage to comment on what those ratings are.  That information will be available in the future.</p></speech>

They detail the kind of costs that the organisation experiences.  There is an element in them and also in the annual report of which they form a part that shows larger care groups and it will show acute hospitals and national ambulance services.  That type of detail is not published in the AFS as it is not part of the policy.

The AFS follows a certain format that has been set out by the Minister.  Unless the Minister chooses to change it, it will not change.  We provide supplementary information within the annual report, of which the AFS is part, and we can certainly look in the future to calling out ambulance service financial information.

The balance is a range of other vehicles, including intermediate care vehicles that are used for interfacility transfers and rapid response vehicles.</p><p>There are 90 specialist vehicles or specialist equipment carriers, most of which were procured during the Covid period.

After that, for the duration of their shift, they are a mobile resource.  The aforementioned locations are reporting posts.  Essentially, the allocation of vehicles is based on the shift patterns in each location and those shift patterns are determined by local demand.  If we take the example of Letterkenny, there might be four crews while in Cavan, Monaghan there might be three crews.  The vehicles are assigned based on the workload demand and the rostering demand, with a view to making sure that there is always latent capacity of about 40%.  Of the 340 vehicles we have, there would not be any more than 180 or 190 in use at any given time.  That is to make sure there are sufficient vehicles available for the oncoming crews.  The oncoming crews need separate vehicles and we also have to have backup vehicles available.</p></speech>

The capacity review highlighted the fact that we have a huge capacity gap but we already knew that.  Indeed, that is on the record of this committee from September last year.

This year we have ramped up recruitment explicitly.  There has been a massive public campaign with a particular focus on student paramedics and intermediate care operatives.  That has been very successful.  We started three groups of 30 student paramedics between 6 September and 19 September and we will start three more groups on 19 December as well, with a view to them commencing the degree programme in January.  As the CEO has mentioned, we have a finite capacity for placements in education at the moment.  In his opening statement the CEO mentioned the fact that we want to develop a fourth educational campus.  At the moment we educate paramedics in Dublin, Ballinasloe and Tullamore but over the next three years we propose, subject to Estimates, to expand that capacity into Wexford, Cork and Sligo so that we can effectively double our educational capacity to meet the future workforce needs.</p></speech>

We did not have enough ICU beds but thanks to the significant investment in permanently strengthening the health service in recent years, we have increased that number.  We are still hovering at just under 300 ICU beds which is not enough.  We know that.  We need more beds than that and it is our intention to put in place the infrastructure and train and recruit the very specialised staff that we need as quickly as we can.  In fairness to the Government, we have been supported to do that in terms of new service developments, including in ICU.  In the last three years about &euro;1.7 billion worth of investment has been made and we are working hard to recruit all of the extra staff----</p></speech>

It has its very distinct geographical catchment area and we have ours.  Obviously, that crosses over quite a bit.  There is an issue around call taking and dispatch that is ongoing and about which we have concerns.  I do not have responsibility for the specifical geographical operations.  My colleague, Mr. Morton, may have more information on that.</p></speech>

That station provides most of the services in that area on behalf of the National Ambulance Service but as Professor O'Donnell said, we also work very closely with Dublin Fire Brigade.</p><p>There is a lot of blurring of boundary lines and interactivity on a daily basis.  We speak to colleagues in the Dublin Fire Brigade usually at around 3 o'clock every day.  There is a pass-over of calls and a checking-in with one another to see who has capacity and then the sharing of resource where possible.</p></speech>

If a person suffers a stroke or is involved in a car accident or, God forbid, some other sort of incident anywhere else apart from the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area, they have dual cover under the NAS and the Dublin Fire Brigade.  Both resources can be called on at any given time.  I understand this has been rumbling for a number of years but where does the HSE stand on resolving this?  There is not the same equitable service in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area as there is elsewhere in the Dublin region.  It is an anomaly that has been ongoing for a long time.  Does the HSE have an update on this?</p></speech>

The rest of the country has one ambulance service as does south county Dublin.  The longer-term plan, from a capacity development perspective, is to relocate Loughlinstown ambulance station.  Where it is currently, it is hemmed in by residential growth.  There is a need to grow services and capacity in the south Dublin area.  We have a significant growth pattern in Bray, an area that is often served by the Loughlinstown station.  We are planning to have new capital development somewhere at the bottom of the M50 area in which to grow services in that whole area generally.  We have a range of services operating there, including pre-hospital emergency care services and intermediate care services, as well as a motorcycle response unit.  By way of a support to the services in south county Dublin, as St. Vincent's is a model of a large tertiary receiving hospital, many of our resources that will feed into St. Vincent's will often respond to calls while travelling back down the N11.  There is a longer-term plan on the part of the NAS to grow services in the south county Dublin.</p></speech>

That will leave the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area with one service whereas the rest of Dublin enjoys two services.  As I do not have enough time to delve into it today, I ask him to send on a note on the future plans for the NAS in the Dublin region, specifically the south-east area.</p> <p>  I refer to an issue relating to the 2021 statement that also relates the 2020 financial statement, which is the storage of protective suits.  The figure of &euro;1.25 million spent on the storage of those suits jumped out at me.  I understand from reading the documents that some of these suits will not even be used.  Why was the HSE not able to store those itself?  Why would it incur such a cost?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.85" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#D00500"><p>I will give a bit of the background first.  The Covid pandemic was the equivalent of a global storm and, as we know, after every storm there is an element of a clean-up required.  The volume of personal protective equipment, PPE, in storage was immense to the extent that we had to contract significant additional external storage to manage the logistics around it, which was essential in keeping staff at work and keeping them as safe as we could.  I again acknowledge that staff put themselves in harm's way, in many cases.  The reason we ended up with so many protective suits was because of that particular time.  It should be borne in mind that most decisions around purchasing PPE and ventilators, etc., were made in March and April 2020.  As we sit here today behind a wall of vaccines, we all feel somewhat different about things now compared to how we felt then.  Back then, we did not know if vaccines would be available and, if they were, when they would be provided.  Europe was identified as the centre of the pandemic in March 2020.  That is not an excuse; that is by way of context.</p></speech>

We would have bought a different type of full-bodied gown.  At the time they were not available, these protective suits were acquired at a significant cost, as everything was at that point.  Subsequently, we acquired the appropriate gowns.  We have not had a use for these and have had to store them.  We have been seeking an appropriate alternative use for them, which has proven more difficult than we would have expected.  We have ended up having to store them at a cost.  More recently, we have rationalised the storage bringing more of it in-house.  We are storing less of it.  We are using less PPE and can move it on.  This is one of those legacy issues that we have not fully closed out and we need to do that, which we accept.</p></speech>

The figure of &euro;42.5 million was provided for the procurement of ventilators, and according to the financial accounts of 2021, I understand &euro;12.1 million of that amount was recovered.  How is the recovery of that money proceeding?</p></speech>

The amount between the &euro;81 million and &euro;103 million was paid to normal suppliers through normal delivery with an average price of &euro;37,000 or &euro;38,000 in line with sanction.  Most of the ordering decisions were made in March and April.  We deliberately ordered more than we needed on the basis that it was the only way to get them.</p></speech>

To date, we have received value on just over &euro;50 million of it, approximately 60%.  We have either got a refund or, in one case, we received PPE to the value.  Of the rest, we have not got value for approximately 10% and we will not get direct value for the health service.  That amounts to approximately &euro;8 million.  Some &euro;6.6 million of where we have not got direct value, we donated to five large medical schools in India and they have certainly got value out of it.  However, we accept it was not a direct value to the Irish health service.</p> <p>  The balance is approximately &euro;22 million, half of which we now have in payment plans or we are looking to finalise payment plans where we have gone through a legal or an arbitration plan or a bit of both.  Of the remaining &euro;10 million, we are about to enter a legal arbitration process.  We think our case is good.  We have to win the arbitration and then get a payment plan.  We are not saying we will get that &euro;22 million but we are pursuing it in the interest of the State.</p></speech>

I refer to the annual report and appendix No. 4 starting on page 100.  The second MRI machine for St. Vincent's is extremely welcome and it is good to see it included under the projects completed and operational by the end of 2021.  I was struck by a completion delay until after 2021.  The report refers to a lease agreement for a primary care centre.  My understanding was that the HSE owned many of the sites in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 6 area, but it states that it is by lease agreement on page 102.  I do not expect Mr. Mulvany to have that information to hand, but he might furnish that to the committee after today's meeting.</p> <p>  Page 103 refers to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is based in CHO 6.  Phase 1 is complete while phase 2 is ongoing with discussions under way between the Department of Health and the HSE.  I also note there was a 35-bed unit with possible use by acute services, which does not fall under phase 1 or 2.  It is welcome nonetheless.  I ask that information on that be furnished to the committee.  It relates to the refurbishment of an existing vacated building.</p> <p>  I refer finally to appendix No. 5 on page 106 of the annual report.  It struck me that the attendance of members at some of the subcommittees is quite low.  What will be done about that?  Is Mr. Mulvany satisfied with the attendance of the members of the committees, including the audit committee and the performance and delivery committee and others?  If not, what will be done to rectify that?</p></speech>

If we send two vehicles, it depends on the clinical criteria of the call.  In the case of a cardiac arrest, for example, we send two resources as a matter of clinical requirement, to make sure there are three to four practitioners or responders on scene.  That is the only circumstance where we send two vehicles.  We never send two vehicles because of a mechanical issue.</p></speech>

I do not mean to say these are gold standard targets, but these are the targets we aspire to and we need to increase capacity to make that a practical reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.109" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#E01100"><p>That is basically it.  Delivery of targets is a feature of a match between capacity and demand.  Demand far exceeds capacity and, therefore, we are not able to meet the targets.  On the 19-minute target, there is a growing question mark about the relativity of those targets.<br/><br/>Professor O'Donnell is developing the realm of clinical key performance indicators, KPIs - in other words patient outcomes.  I will give a brief example to articulate that point, then hand over to Professor O'Donnell.  For a patient in Dingle who experiences a stroke, the nearest ambulance is Dingle ambulance station but that ambulance might be dropping off a patient or <i>en route </i>to Tralee, as the main receiving hospital.  The ambulance will not get there in 19 minutes because it is at the end of a peninsula but, in real terms, that will not change the outcome for that patient.  The target is 19 minutes but the key target for that patient is to get to a hyperacute stroke unit within four and a half hours of the onset of symptoms.  We are moving to a clinical, rather than response-time, way of thinking about it.  That is not just in Ireland, but in a general global setting.  I ask Professor O'Donnell to comment on the development of alternative KPIs.</p></speech>

It is a good question.  Ambulance response time targets are a blunt instrument for measuring the capability of an ambulance service.  They are easily understood, intuitive and make sense.  If I dial 999, I want an ambulance to come quickly.  That is reasonable, but a 19-minute response time over the breadth of clinical presentations we see often does not impact on patient outcomes.  From a clinical perspective, we are more interested in how we can improve the patient's acute healthcare need there and then.  We send two highly trained clinicians on a call.  If they get there within 19, 20 or 15 minutes of a person having a heart attack or stroke or with a broken leg, that is a blunt instrument in measuring success.</p> <p>  We currently measure four clinical KPIs.  There is cardiac arrest, when your heart stops.  We measure the proportion of patients we get to an emergency department where we have restarted the heart prior to arrival.  That is one point on that patient's clinical journey.  We compare favourably internationally on that one.  This year we have introduced three new ones.  Two are related to stroke care, which Mr. Morton mentioned and which are very important.  One is on pain relief.  If you are in pain and we come out to you, how good are we at relieving your pain?  We have a further suite of these that we will continue to add to in the coming years.</p></speech>

We went back and looked at this.  International experience was similar.  First, people were slower to call 999, particularly in the early stages of Covid.  They did not want to go to hospital because they were afraid.  They had a pain in their chest and stuck it out.  That was a bad decision for them and it went on.  In the early stages of Covid, crews had to put on PPE on arrival at scene.  That took time</p></speech>

A number of reviews were carried out as part of the high earners review.  Our audit and risk committee sought some extra assurance around the area of high earners.  It looked specifically at the top of the organisation and found no issues in terms of high earners.  When we look across the organisation, and we looked at salaries over &euro;300,000 that go across services and in fairness, relate mostly to consultant staff, we found some issues.  It is important to provide some context before we get into any of the detail.</p></speech>

We have very able and dedicated consultants.

Often services were seeking to balance providing a service and managing patient risk with those.  We have established a process to go around the country and identify and log all those practices.

Our audit and risk committee is also considering in the audit plan for next year extending below the &euro;300,000 threshold to see if there are any issues.

From its review of financial statements, does Mr. Mulvany feel that section 39 bodies are in a good financial position?</p></speech>

Some have small surpluses they have built over the years.  Remember that there are about 2,000 organisations funded under section 39.  At the top end, the organisations referred to by the Deputy are typically north of &euro;3 million.  Some of them are under financial pressure while others are under less pressure.  Sometimes it relates to whether they have had to provide residential services and how they have been able to respond to regulation in recent years, which has put pressure on our own services.  While we say in the first instance that it is a matter for the boards of the voluntary organisations, we are aware of our role in that too.  If you look across the larger section 39 organisations in the disability sector, a number have financial issues while others are in a reasonable position or have moderate surpluses.</p></speech>

Without these agencies, the HSE would not be able to deliver services on the ground.  It is very important that we continue to support them to ensure we can deliver services locally.  Western Care Association in County Mayo is a significant provider of intellectual disability services and without it, the entire service would fall to pieces.</p></speech>

Not all section 39 bodies are the same but as the Deputy noted, we rely on the larger organisations just as much as we rely on any of the services and they provide services as good as and sometimes better than other parts of the service.  We are aware that pay parity is a very significant issue.  Many of those organisations would have had links to what we call the consolidated salary scales pre-recession.  We are aware of and concerned about what would be a shift from section 39 organisations to section 28 organisations that can recruit because they have the consolidated salary scale.  It is not an issue we can yet solve but it is one we recognise because we do value and rely significantly on a number of those section 39 organisations.</p></speech>

The Department and the Minister intend that it will be included.  It may turn out to be more practical for the Department and some of those agencies to work directly and not put them through a private process because it involves another public body as well and the HSE would not add any great value to that.  I know the Minister is looking at ways to see can some of those payments, including those to the fire brigade, be accelerated.</p></speech>

Does the HSE believe it has the correct value for money from section 38s and section 39s? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#G01200"><p>It is difficult to generalise.  The most important thing to say is that we rely on and hugely value the service provided by section 38s and section 39s.  In some cases, we can and do learn from them.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>  As I see it, there are two aspects to the relationship, in governance terms, with section 38s and section 39s.  One is those organisations themselves and their internal governance, and whether that is appropriate.  While we are not an innocent party in that, it is largely a matter for them and their boards.  The other piece is the management of our relationship with those section 38 and section 39 organisations, which gets much more difficult when we get to the bigger volumes of section 39s, remembering that we fund more than 2,000 organisations.  We recognise that we had a problem and we still have elements we are working on.  We have nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, around the country and have established what we call contract management support units in each of those nine organisations.  Most of them are now fully staffed and up and running.  Their job is to assist local management to be able to keep on track of that relationship management with the organisations.</p></speech>

For intellectual disabilities in particular, and in the Cork area specifically, it essentially came to a situation where those people in receipt of HSE funding were not able to accommodate children with special needs.  The education and training board, ETB, stepped in and opened special schools there.  In addition, there is resistance to providing respite care to those children who are no longer registered in section 39 organisations because they are now registered for schooling in the ETB.  That is a classic example, from my perspective, of how an organisation that is being funded is taking its own direction rather than direction from the State.  Governance is about internal processes but it is also about responding to the direct demand of the State.</p></speech>

That relationship around services for residential provision, education and social care services between ourselves and other Government agencies is a complex one, as the Deputy knows.  Progressing disability services is one of the ways we are trying to improve that.  Clearly, in the Deputy's example, there may be tensions as to how well or not it is working.  We are aware many of our section 39 organisations and, indeed, our own services, have been under pressure to provide sufficient residential capacity, particularly as we had a very positive experience as regards improved regulation over the years.  The issue is it has not been possible for the investment to keep up with that and we have lost a level of capacity.  We know we have challenges in providing residential accommodation to people.  That is an accepted point.  I do not know if Mr. McCallion wants to make any comment.</p></speech>

That is very clear when there is a private operator but sometimes, when there is a voluntary operator, that same call is not made.  It is a policy issue maybe rather than a matter for Mr. Mulvany.  I sometimes feel we do not subject section 39s to the same level of scrutiny regarding value for money.  I ask for a note from the representatives to respond to the committee regarding some of the issues raised in that 2016 report about how the HSE is responding to concerns raised.</p></speech>

The relationship is one we are working on, and need to work on, but there is a lot of engagement around individual client needs, accommodating additional clients and equality around what is being provided to existing service users.  That is an ongoing process between every CHO, every disability service manager and the section 39s they are funding.  Whatever about the formulaic, monthly, performance-type meeting, day in, day out our managers and placement co-ordinators are engaging with voluntary providers about the quality of service people are getting, or are trying to get people access to services.  It is a collaborative partnership thing.  Sometimes, voluntaries do not have the flexibility they used to have in the past - maybe that is a good thing - to provide accommodation or services.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulvany talked about a contract unit.  On a broader level, a report by Catherine Day was commissioned by the Department some time back on voluntary bodies and how they work with the health sector.  The Deputy might recall it.  A consultative forum was set up under that, where we have representatives.  Apart from contract management and the formal side, that is all about trying to see how we work better together.  We will always use voluntary organisations - Mr. Mulvany mentioned a figure of 2,000 - from the big voluntary hospitals through to the small service provider in a remote area, inner city area or wherever, that is providing a vital service.  A lot of work is trying to get us in a room together to look at how we actually work better together at a practical level both in terms of the ethos and principles of how we work, apart from on the ground-----</p></speech>

One of those is where we allocate new staff and new students.  We have changed our policy this year, which has actually helped our recruitment strategy, to allocate all new staff to a base within 45 km, at a maximum, of where they live.  For existing staff, we are currently implementing a new staff transfer policy to give people the opportunity to move to a base within 45 km of where they live.  We think that will support retention because it has been a big issue that our trade union partners have consistently brought to our attention.</p></speech>

On the role of the NAS, there are other private operators it is competing with as a potential employer.  That degree of flexibility is very important.</p> <p>  I am jumping around here; I often think we should have a standing committee of public accounts just for the &euro;23 billion the HSE spends, but that might fill the representatives with horror.  I will come to the issue of non-compliant procurement.  A process was carried out, which was a self-assessment exercise, to determine the level of non-compliant procurement.  Within that, I was alarmed that compliance assessments were not completed in respect of 13% of the procurement expenditure, when the scoping exercise was carried out.</p><p>That was either because a manager responsible for the expenditure could not be readily identified or the manager failed to respond to the exercise.  That is quite alarming when we are looking at a process to establish non-compliant procurement.  Would our guests respond to that in the time remaining?</p></speech>

We are now moving into quarterly assessment, which is progress.  While it is self-assessment, there is also an element of independent sampling as an insurance.  Yes, the 13% is a concern.  We are following it up although I do not have details as to where we have got to.  We do not find it acceptable, as the Deputy does not.  We will always have some level of non-completion but that level is higher than we would expect and higher than we want.  We have assumed it is all non-compliant.  Some of it might actually be compliant but we have had to assume it is non-compliant.  We will chase it down.</p></speech>

I wish to start with the ambulance service and I thank our guests for the briefing document in that regard.  In the document, there is reference to &euro;9.1 million for Dublin Fire Brigade.  That represented 15.75% of the breakdown of non-staff costs.  Is there a contract in place?  Is there a service level agreement in place for the role that Dublin Fire Brigade plays?  Are there any penalty clauses if, for example, the service is deemed to be unsatisfactory?  It looks as if that equates to almost 16% of the national funding for the ambulance service.  Is that correct?  From whose budget comes the cost of the replacement fleet?  Is it Dublin City Council?  Perhaps our guests would start by answering those questions.</p></speech>

The current arrangements are grounded in a 1993 review.  The fire brigade, through section 25 of the Fire Services Act 1981, deliver fire and ambulance services as a statutory authority in its own right.  It does not deliver those services on behalf of the ambulance service or on behalf of the HSE.  Arrangements emanated from the 1993 review of ambulance services.  As a result of that review, we make a contribution towards the running of the cost of the ambulance service because otherwise we would have to deliver it.</p></speech>

I will move to another area.  The annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General includes a chapter in respect of the management of clinical indemnity.

The estimated outstanding liability is &euro;3.4 billion.  That is decided on a pay-as-you-go basis.  I understand the Minister must provide that is done on that basis.

That should go without saying.  We are supposed to be at a point where there is open disclosure when there has been an accident.</p> <p>  Representatives of the State Claims Agency were before the committee and we discussed trying to get a mediated settlement whereby there is acceptance that there was an injury and fault involved.  During that engagement with the agency, it was interesting to hear that there appeared to be a change in the practice during the pandemic when the courts were not available to prosecute some of these cases.  There was a greater use of mediation.  Are there mechanisms in place to ensure that happens?  The evidence seems to suggest that settlements are quicker and less costly because there are fewer legal costs.  Why did it take a pandemic to make that change?  Is that change being maintained?</p></speech>

We work closely with the State Claims Agency in that regard and it is helpful to us.  The agency provides a service to the Government and Government bodies in respect of managing claims under its own statute.  It is not doing that for us.  It is doing it because the Oireachtas has asked it to do so.  In my experience, the agency does that very well.  It always seeks to get to an appropriate resolution.  That may not be the experience of individual families.  The court process is what the court process is.  The Deputy would have to ask the State Claims Agency as to why Covid may have brought about a change.  I would say it was a matter of practicality with regard to the courts, even though the courts did operate remotely during the pandemic.  As to whether that situation has continued-----</p></speech>

That will include the legal costs.  It was the non-availability of the courts that appears to have brought about this change.  We need to pursue this matter separately and we may have to look at this chapter in its own right because I am not at all satisfied that this is working in the way it should be.</p><p>Obviously, Mr. Mulvany is acting CEO of the HSE.

The evidence is that, thankfully, the incidence of those claims, those tragedies for families, is the same in Ireland as it is in other developed countries.  The incidence of claims is not necessarily the issue; rather, it is the operation of the courts process and the legal process.  We engage with the State Claims Agency in that regard but there is only so much of that we can influence.</p> <p>  As to the value, obviously the State Claims Agency is, in effect, part of the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department of Finance.  The fact that it is not on the balance sheet of the HSE does not mean there is not an awareness all the way up to central government of those amounts, and they are very serious amounts.</p></speech>

Last week, we extensively considered capital spending in Cork-Kerry CHO and I was assured that the service users who are in 24-hour assisted living at Owenacurra and Garnish House had been fully communicated with regarding the closure of Garnish House and the move out of there.  In the meantime, I have been contacted by families who say that is not the case.  I am not sure whether that is just a breakdown in communication but I would like to get more information on this.  The witnesses do not have to take my word for it; the <i>Irish Examiner</i>this week published an article on the matter written by Cianan Brennan.  Last week, the HSE stated that &quot;staff and clinicians talk directly to service users at Garnish House on a constant basis about their future plans&quot;.  However, the family of a Garnish House resident stated &quot;The only communication we (my relative and my family) received regarding my relative&rsquo;s move from Millfield House to Garnish House came on the evening of the move in April 2020 via a short phone call from ... Millfield House&quot;.  Another communication I received from a family states:</p> <blockquote> 	We asked both the Garnish House staff and the clinical team as recently as last week for information.  On pointing out that a recent PQ response ... [to a question I tabled] stated that Garnish would be vacated by the HSE in early 2023, the Garnish House staff and clinical team stated that they have not been informed of this.  The uncertainty of the past two and a half years has led to a deterioration in our relative&rsquo;s mental health. </blockquote> <p>My time is running out and I do not want to use it all on this issue but the clear answer to this issue is to find out exactly what the communication has been.</p><p>In the email I received from the chief officer in the CHO he states:</p> <blockquote> 	In this context, there is and has been on-going discussion with residents of this high support service, to ensure that they are aware that the service would be moving at some stage, though we would not have a finalised decision on its location.  This discussion would be more in the context of keeping service users aware of the temporary nature of the service location rather than in any greater detail and not to detract from their own individual plans of moving forward to a more independent living model suitable to their needs.  Once we are clear on the service relocation plan, the clinical team will be engaging with each service user once again in more detail on the specifics. </blockquote> <p>I am reading this into the record on purpose.  The email continues:</p> <blockquote> 	The commitment is made that the service will transfer from Garnish House by the end of Q 1 2023.  There will be full communication with service users around the details of the service transfer in advance. </blockquote> <p>I know we discussed the matter last week but these are incredibly vulnerable people.  We know that Cork-Kerry CHO's idea of lots of time in advance is, at best, three months, because that is what it did in the context of Owenacurra.  These people have been living there for a very long time.  I would love for the HSE to come back to me and explain exactly what the communication has been.  I do not want to say that what we have been provided with is muddy but there is not a huge amount of detail from the CHO on exactly what the communication with these people was.  There should be a log.  If a clinician speaks to a family member, he or she makes a note of that, as is best practice.  If the families are saying one thing but the HSE is saying another, the way to move forward and get rid of that grey area would be for the HSE to simply set out exactly how it has been informing residents and their families.  I acknowledge that the CHO has been careful to state here that it does not wish to discuss individual residents.  I am not asking for anyone's name or PPS number or anything like that; I just want to understand how the testimony of the HSE is so at odds with what the families are telling us.  That is really important in the context of people being moved from their home of more than a decade.  I am not asking for answers to be provided today but I am asking the HSE to take the matter away and see if it can come up with actual information.  The information that has been provided so far is fuzzy.</p></speech>

That was why Owenacurra was so great - it was like a home.  I take the point made by Mr. McCallion and I thank him for it.  He is correct, but it seems that some of the staff were not aware of the plan for Garnish House, so they would not have been able to communicate that on a low level with service users.  From what the families are telling us, it seems the staff did not know.</p></speech>

I will keep my eyes peeled for more communication.</p> <p>  In the two and a half minutes I have remaining, I will ask a quick question for clarity on the debt that is in question.  I do not want to say it is owed by the HSE to Dublin City Council, given that the witnesses say it is not owed.  As a former member of Dublin City Council, this is something that I did not realise.</p><p>There seems to be an acceptance within Dublin City Council, DCC, that this is owed.  Obviously, the HSE is at odds with that.</p><p> Can I just understand this a bit better?  The HSE awards the council &euro;9.19 million per year to run the service.  The debt that is outstanding, which is at question here, is now at the figure of &euro;116.8 million.  Within that context, the chief executive, Owen Keegan, has also made the point recently that costs have risen steadily, in line with the cost of everything else over the last couple of years.  The council suggests that the cost of the Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, emergency ambulance service is expected to reach approximately &euro;26 million.  For my own clarity, are we not accepting that all of that figure of &euro;116 million is a debt that is owed?</p></speech>

I want to move onto an issue that I raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday, which is in relation to the level of claims against the HSE and where we are with that issue.  The amount paid out for the level of claims in 2021 was &euro;461 million.  That was paid out by the State Claims Agency.  Not all of that figure related to healthcare but, as I understand it, the bulk of it was.  As the figure in the previous year was &euro;372 million, that is an increase of &euro;87 million.</p> <p>  In relation to the estimates, it is my understanding that were everything settled in the morning for all claims against the State, the figure would be approximately &euro;4.2 billion.  However, the figure for the healthcare sector is approximately &euro;3.4 billion.  We have dealt with the issue of insurance.  It is in the context of dealing with the insurance Bill yesterday that I raised this issue.  We made major changes to many areas of insurance over the past ten or 15 years but we have not really made any major changes as to how we process and deal with things when incidents do arise.  No matter how careful people are within a hospital setting, errors do happen.  What we try to do is try to reduce them as much as possible.</p><p>Has any analysis been carried out on what can be done to reduce the level of errors and hence the level of claims?  Where an error arises, should we be far more proactive in dealing with it than the current system appears to be?  Unfortunately, the HSE is getting caught up by post mortems, inquests and so on.  I am thinking of the idea of having an overall review of how we can deal with this in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.267" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#M00200"><p>There are two parts to this.  The first, which the Deputy raised and is the most important, is trying to make sure we are managing the risk and reducing it for patients and service users.  We are very significantly focused on that.  The State Claims Agency, in fairness, has given us great assistance in that.  We seek to focus on making sure that we log and report incidents and that we investigate them, seek to learn the lessons and respond.  Specifically, in the case of a subset of the incidents that are driving a disproportionately large amount of the annual payment that the State Claims Agency makes and we reimburse - the catastrophic birth cases - we have established under the chief clinical officer a separate central team which works with maternity units when they have these tragic cases to see what can be done differently and what lessons can be learned.  That is despite the fact that the incidence of those catastrophic cases, which are individual personal tragedies for the families involved, is in line with international norms for developed western economies.  We still would like to reduce it and reduce it further.</p> <p>  The second part is that the State Claims Agency, under its own legislation, is the indemnifier for the State.  As well as providing risk management support to us, which is excellent, it also has to seek to progress the claims.  We discussed that with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It does not itself control the legal process in which it operates.  I understand that there are efforts to streamline elements of that legal process.  The evidence to us is that the increasing level of costs appearing in our accounts for reimbursing the State Claims Agency and the increasing noted contingent liability around future costs of claims are not being driven predominantly by the volume of claims increasing or the severity of claims.  They are being driven by the legal process and increases in the cost of processing, completing and paying out claims.  It is not the piece that we predominately can influence but the piece that relates to the legal process.</p></speech>

Can we manage it in a better way while making sure that where errors are made, people are adequately provided for?  Is it not time to review the whole process rather than having what we have now where claims can go on for long periods of six, seven or eight years before they are finalised?  Do we now need to look at that overall picture?</p></speech>

I am not an expert but as I understand it, there is an interdepartmental group in which the State Claims Agency is involved that is doing just that and looking at the overall operation in this area.  It is largely in the courts process or not necessarily the courts but how redress is sought and provided, which is currently predominantly through the courts process, although there are alternatives that may need to be used more.  The work the Deputy is talking about is going on.  The HSE is involved indirectly through its engagement with the State Claims Agency but it is a matter for the State Claims Agency, a number of Departments and the Courts Service how that operates.  I agree with the Deputy that it is something that needs attention.</p></speech>

It goes back to the issue of children who suffered as a result of thalidomide.  While they got compensation, it was in no way adequate in real terms.  I have heard of a number of cases where substantial compensation was paid out and within a very short period people passed away unfortunately.  There is a huge variation.  Is there a need to be proactive in trying to reduce further the level of errors that arise by checking all the systems, whether in smaller hospitals or very large ones, and at the same time, looking at how we can expedite the processing of these claims?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.273" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#M00800"><p>Yes, I agree on both fronts.  We are and do put significant energy into reducing and minimising the impacts of clinical incidents, acknowledging, as the Deputy said, that they will always arise.  They are very difficult for patients and can also be very difficult for staff and we need staff to be supported as well as to be assisted to make improvements, where they can be made.  Not every critical incident or adverse incident can be avoided but some certainly can.</p> <p>  Returning to redress, periodic payment orders is the language used to refer to a process where there is not just a single large lump sum paid but payment is made over time.  I understand they have been and are in use.  There is work on those orders within the overall courts process.  I do not know exactly what it is.  That is something the State Claims Agency would keep us briefed on periodically.  The notion of moving to a different form of redress payment mechanism and hopefully, over time, to less adversarial methods of getting redress are all in that mix, as I understand it.</p></speech>

That is a huge slice of the HSE budget.  There are more than 2,300 of these organisations and it is not physically possible to audit every one of them.  They obviously have proper systems in place.  In any one year, how many of the 2,300 organisations' accounts would the HSE go and review?</p></speech>

Over 93% or 95% of it is provided to a relatively small number of very large organisations.  I would guess it is less than 100.  There are a number of ways by which we review and engage those organisations.  Our internal audit division will go out, put boots on the ground and visit a certain number of section 38 or section 39 organisations in any given year.  It may be between 30 and 50.  I may have the figure wrong but I can check it.  Separately, depending on size, we get a certain amount of information every year, including annual accounts, although we do not get audited accounts from every one of those organisation.  It depends on the size and if they are below 50,000.  We get their audited accounts, we have a review process and above a certain size we ask them to provide a summary or precis of that financial information so that we can see and track through the HSE's resource going into the organisation.  As we said earlier, we have established across each of our nine CHOs what we call conflict management support units to try to help the local services to deal with that volume of interaction with a greater number of those organisations.

I am just asking that every effort be made.</p> <p>  I will revert to the ambulances.  Last year, I think, at a meeting of the committee, I raised with Paul Reid the issue of dynamic deployment and the fact that a number of ambulances were quickly deployed from, for example, County Laois or County Offaly to Wexford or Waterford.  When they are three quarters of the way there they are told that an ambulance has arrived on the scene and told to turn back.  Not only is time lost, but that also leaves parts of the midlands without a service.  I have heard reports of this from different parts of the country.  On the second occasion I raised this with Mr. Reid and pressed him on it, he said that the HSE was looking at the geographical situation, that there may be a case for geographical limits and that there were working groups looking into this along with the unions, which I know about.  This may be a question for Mr. Morton.  What is the current situation?  Has the HSE come down on a figure for that?</p></speech>

That was in response to capacity challenges.  We had to balance what we wanted to do against patient safety.  Obviously, once a limitation is put in, there is always the possibility of not reaching a patient.  However, what we have reached a conclusion on is that we have set a limit of 80 km.  That basically balances patient risk against staff well-being.  We have been working on that for a considerable period of time and it seems to be working well so far - broadly, anyway.</p></speech>

Mr. Morton is an expert on this matter, whereas I am not.  This is his everyday job.  It seemed to me, however, that it was becoming a real problem, particularly given that the service is running at about 54% capacity.  We have little over half the number of ambulances and staff we need.</p> <p>  I will turn for a moment to the recruitment targets.  There are 2,161 staff at the moment.  I think it was said that the HSE needs around 850 extra staff to stand still, that we really need to double staff and that to do so would take ten years.  I am looking just at the recruitment for this year.  How many staff has the HSE recruited into the service this year?</p></speech>

In September we recruited 90.  Then we have a plan to recruit around 90 more.  It depends on people passing Garda clearance, but we expect to recruit about 90 in December of this year as well.  We have also recruited 60 emergency medical technicians, who work in our intermediate care service and support our ambulances.  That is the kind of profile of recruitment we are working to this year.</p></speech>

We would have to grow our fleet in the out years, but right now we probably have one of the better fleet profiles of most of our comparators around the globe.  We are in a very good place.  The HSE has invested a lot of money consistently over repeated years.  The Department has been very supportive of our fleet replacement programme over a number of years.

Is that the direction of travel?  Is there a move away from the private?  I know that on social media there is a lot of rubbish that makes a comparison which is not like for like.  Obviously, private services do not deal with critical incidents and so on, so we cannot compare like for like, but is the direction of travel in terms of the service to stay with the publicly owned HSE National Ambulance Service ambulances?</p></speech>

HSE policy is to continue to develop our own intermediate care service.  Equally, however, one of the valuable lessons we have learned from Covid is that there is always a need to have access to surge capacity.  Private ambulance companies and voluntary organisations have ably provided that surge capacity, particularly in supporting patient flow between hospitals.  There is a place for the private ambulance sector, but the HSE's policy is basically to develop our own intermediate care service.</p></speech>

The staff are more highly trained, maybe, than years gone by.  Like a lot of other things, time moves on.  The feedback from the public generally is very good, and the workers in the service are very dedicated.  Talking to them, the one thing that always comes across, although they might complain about this, that or the other, is their dedication to doing the best for the patients.</p><p>I will ask about a more local issue regarding County Laois.  County Offaly has three ambulance stations.  I have no argument in that regard.  There is one beside Ofalia House, one in Birr and one in Tullamore.  We have one in the middle of Laois, which is a good location because it is a rounder county; it is not as strung out as Offaly.  There has been a significant population increase in the northern part of the county, however.  Are there plans to locate an ambulance base there?</p></speech>

Graiguecullen in the south east, for example, is well supported by County Carlow.  Roscrea supports the south-west to some extent.  Certainly, there is a need to look at services in the Portarlington and north Laois area.  We are examining that at the moment.  We are looking at the area that was the M8 corridor down to Durrow and Cullahill.  We are currently working with Kilkenny County Council to procure the old fire station in Urlingford with a view to setting up an emergency dispatch point that would then service what was the old N8 corridor; places like Cullahill across to Castlecomer and Durrow and areas that are not particularly well-served by Portlaoise.  It is quite a distance away in the event of an emergency.  That is what we are working on at the minute.</p></speech>

What properties are vacant at the moment?  Some of them might be health centres that are no longer in use, some may be houses that were bought to provide services or some may be facilities that have been owned by the HSE for some time.</p></speech>

There are properties that could be used and converted in my own area.  Mr. Mulvany might send me a note on that, including properties the HSE has bought but that have not yet been put to use.

Again, we are a long way away from where we need to be on that.  On an EU comparison with many other countries, we were at approximately 50% or just above that.  Capacity seems to be the issue.

The facilities are needed and so is the space.  They are very specialised.  Then, a certain number of consultants are needed to run intensive care lists, particularly to run a certain number of beds.  It will, therefore, be a combination of those factors.  More typically, it is getting the suitable space and particularly the expert nursing staff.</p></speech>

At the moment, the plan is to be up around 320 beds by the end of this year and there are further developments from there.  Some of those are tied to capital and staff.  The one advantage we have now is that we know exactly where they should be and how they should be developed.  We can forward details of that plan to the Chairman.</p></speech>

We can see that from the ambulance figures.  Unfortunately, the situation arises where an ambulance with a patient inside arrives at the door of the emergency department and there are no critical care beds.  There are bottlenecks, which I presume this is adding to.  It would be welcome if that happened because that would be an increase of nearly 40 beds.</p></speech>

Is that working the way it should for consultants who are on those 80:20 contracts, that is, 20% of their work being carried out in the private sector and 80% in the public sector?

The consultants are, some would say, the most powerful group within a hospital, and we have a shortage of them.  I do not want to be hard on consultants because they do a very difficult job and they are highly skilled.  We and our families are all dependent on them.  In terms of the important management decisions, however, is it Mr. Mulvany's sense that consultants in this State have a greater influence or greater control over how hospitals are run than they should have?  Is that a concern of his?</p></speech>

The key point is that hospital managers and CEOs have to manage - they are leaders.  Leaders need followers, however, so they need to make sure their clinicians, non-clinical employees and all their staff are being brought with them.  Therefore, yes, our consultant colleagues have a huge impact.  In some cases, that may be problematic and the consultant body itself will tell us that.  We are no different from any other part of the world in some of that.  There will always be areas where clinicians may in some cases overstep the mark or where managers may not fully be doing what might be expected of them.  It would be too simplistic to say it is an overall general concern, in fairness.</p></speech>

Each hospital has a chief executive and an executive management team with a clinical director, director of nursing and other associated disciplines.  We are trying to promote clinical leadership.  There are programmes to encourage clinicians to come forward into those roles because that is how we bring about change.  We need to have good executive leadership, as the Chairman said, alongside good clinical leadership, be it nursing, added health professionals, consultants or medical staff.</p><p>We are actively trying to encourage more clinicians to come forward into those clinical leadership roles.</p></speech>

We do not disagree with that but I am saying we have made progress.  We definitely have more to do and we are focused on doing more.  We are, for example, turning that annual self-assessment, which we managed to do for the first time only in the past two years, into a quarterly self-assessment, with the first two quarters of this year to be done by the end of October.</p></speech>

The newspaper article pretty much said that the costs for providing the service have risen steadily and the cost to the Dublin Fire Brigade emergency ambulance service is expected to reach just less than &euro;26 million.  As we know, the amount that has been allocated from the HSE is &euro;9.19 million, so there is &euro;16.55 million in running costs for the service.  Mr. Owen Keegan said:</p> <blockquote> 	Anybody else would have withdrawn the service long before now.  But there&rsquo;s a huge commitment among the staff, and I think it&rsquo;s important that we will support them.  And we&rsquo;ve done that and the HSE have exploited that to the hilt. </blockquote> <p>That was the article.  Is it costing Dublin City Council more to run its ambulances than it is costing-----</p></speech>

Third, it is not really appropriate for two public bodies to effectively engage in a kind of dispute by me trying to respond to that.  We have already said we would disagree with the CEO, Mr. Keegan, on some of the figures.  We believe a resolution is required and we know that does not involve ourselves.  As a final point, we actually do not know.  We told the committee, and the director of the Ambulance Service has said, that the contribution we are making is broadly in line with what we understand to be our costs.  The city council's costs are its own costs and they intermingle to some extent.  The service it has, which is a great service, is a fire brigade service with an ambulance component.  Again, let us remember that the key thing to be resolved in all of this is the integration of call-taking and dispatch, because that is a quality and safety issue.  The rest is money, and the money is important.  We do and we will engage with Owen Keegan but I do not think that across the floor of a committee chamber is the way to do it.</p></speech>

That is under the local government auditor.</p> <p>  I will move to a different topic, which is the cyber attack.  Some &euro;657 million over seven years is the cost of implementing the PwC recommendations.  Obviously, some of the things that happened can be rectified reasonably quickly.  We were told there was no single person responsible and no documented recovery plan, the patching updates were not effective, there was a single antivirus product, antivirus signatures were not updated and 30,000 machines were on Windows 7.  Some of those issues are pretty basic.  Have the most immediate aspects been dealt with and how will that plan work out?  I presume the HSE has moved away from Windows 7 at this stage.  Have some of those more exposed and easily fixable aspects been dealt with at this stage?</p> <p>  Mr. Mulvany might also deal with the number of people who have been identified.  Has the HSE identified every one of the people who are likely to have had their information disclosed or accessed during that attack?  Many people have yet to be notified.  Does Mr. Mulvany have a ballpark figure for that?</p></speech>

Our board has a committee governing the overall monitoring of the implementations of these recommendations.   The low-hanging fruit and the priority stuff is getting that additional focus.  The number of Windows 7 licences is down from over 40,000 to less than 10,000.  They are only on systems where we are in the process of replacing those systems so we do not rely on Windows 7, but we do have clinical systems that-----</p></speech>

It is not Windows 7 in itself; it is the fact that the applications are on that.  There is a plan to try to migrate that or to replace those as quickly as possible to remove Windows 7, and that is basically where we are at, but there are old applications that our services are entirely dependent on for operation, and that is what we are trying to ramp down as quickly as possible.  Good progress has been made on that already because, as the Deputy said, that is one of the risks identified.</p></speech>

We have asked ourselves how quickly we can tell people because we want to tell people so they would know, but we do not want to cause unnecessary angst to people.  That is our aim.

I have two quick questions.  The first is a question I ask of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na a lot.  I am interested in the key performance indicators, KPIs, and understand an ambulance service will always look at its indicators based on how may calls it takes and how quick it is.  However, I am interested in whether the service, bearing in mind it is the first point of contact in often quite traumatic situations, is investing in training around diversity, human rights and civil rights.  It is something the Garda has taken on board and started to train up staff on.  What kind of recognition is there in the service of the need for that?  I am aware the service did good work as part of the Covid-19 roll-out and doing mobile sites in the Travelling community.  That is the kind of area I am interested in.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  I am looking at the annual report and the financial statements from 2021 on the National Ambulance Service and there are a number of areas like the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy and things like the enhancement of alternative care pathways.  Will the service give us a general approach to how that aligns with the reforms of Sl&aacute;intecare?</p></speech>

On the area of equality, diversity and inclusion we are looking to our colleagues in the UK, who have done quite a lot of work on this area.  Our head of HR is engaging with that broader network to understand what the sector is doing over there and what lessons we can bring and embed in our workforce thinking as well.  That is something we are actively doing.</p></speech>

If I can have a very quick follow-up question on that, are they talking to stakeholders in Ireland, for example the Travelling community, new communities in Dublin or whoever it might be?</p></speech>

Obviously we engage through our broader HSE family network as well and there is a broad range of contacts there but on an ambulance-specific workforce, given we have a highly-moblie workforce that engages with all sorts of vulnerable people from a broad range of backgrounds we also need to look at diversification of our own workforce as well because quite frankly-----</p></speech>

We have a health psychologist now as part of our education team so we are rolling in that direction, as it were, but our head of HR is very much focused on it this year.</p> <p>  The second question was on the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy and alternative care pathways.  The two things we are doing, which the CEO mentioned in his opening statement, is hear and treat and see and treat.  We are looking at ways to offer services to patients in the community or at the point of contact.  We have developed a clinical hub and I might ask Professor O'Donnell to talk about the clinical aspects of in a moment.  The hub tries to provide a meaningful clinical solution for patients at the point of contact, as distinct from having to send an ambulance, which is not necessarily always the right thing to do.  An obvious example is when somebody dials 999 with a broken toenail.  They may be alternate pathway of care we can offer to that patient in those circumstances.  The out-of-hospital cardiac arrest strategy is based on the sudden task force report from 2007 that has been Government policy since then.  It says every uniformed responder in Ireland should be contributing to a reduction in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest mortality.  That involves the fire services, the Garda, community first response schemes and the Irish Coast Guard.  That strategy is focusing on embracing all those organisations and we have 12 organisations around that table that are actively involved in progressing that strategy, which is funded this year to the tune of about &euro;650,000, and all that money will be expended on that.  Some of that is around placing automated external defibrillators, AEDs, in the communities.</p> <p>  I ask Professor O'Donnell to touch on the clinical hub aspects.</p></speech>

The traditional ambulance model where someone rang us and we went out to them in an ambulance with two paramedics and brought them  to hospital, unless they  told us they did not want to go, is the historical model and not nuanced enough for modern healthcare.  We have an aging population and a much more complex healthcare system.  What we are currently doing, and what we are going to build on to do in a much wider fashion, is identify patients who have low-acuity healthcare needs and try to address their healthcare needs in the community close to them so they do not have to go to hospital.  That is good for the patient first of all, it is good for the hospital given the capacity issues we have in the hospital service and it is good for us because of capacity issues we have.</p> <p>  We have a couple of different threads to that.  The one Mr. Morton mentioned is the clinical hub.  We have had clinicians, that is, doctors and nurses, in our ambulance control centre for the last couple of years.  We plan to increase that very significantly.  We recently reached an agreement with Tallaght University Hospital for it to provide us with the clinicians, clinical leadership at consultant level and then nursing staff too.</p></speech>

It has been referred to very strongly in contributions by other members but the importance the NAS has across every constituency in the country cannot be understated.  All I can tell the officials about is what is happening in my own area and unfortunately the reports are not good.  Recently, we had an incident in east Cork where a gentlemen who was waiting over 90 minutes for an ambulance died.  I have dealt with other consequences for people who have been waiting well in excess of an hour.  The consequence of course was the person who was waiting for the ambulance is now deceased.  Unfortunately, this seems to be a recurring issue.  Our existing ambulance service staff, especially those in the HSE Cork-Kerry region, are working exceptionally hard.  I know many of them and they are good people but they will say themselves they are under huge stress.</p> <p>  Something I find completely unacceptable is that when it comes to arriving at the hospital, staff must remain with patients and this effectively disallows them from leaving places like Cork University Hospital and other emergency rooms to go back on the road and get back out there to help people.  It is a profoundly flawed system.  That is the question I put first and foremost.  From a cost perspective, what is the HSE planning to do to allow a quicker turnaround time for ambulance crews who arrive at a hospital with an extremely sick patient and who want to get the patient into the hospital and leave?  I am hearing many reports of crews who are being left in the hospital caring for patients, which is something they should not be doing, quite frankly.  It is a huge concern because the knock-on impact is that ambulance crew will not get to another patient who needs them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#R03200"><p>I agree with the Deputy on the importance of the ambulance service.  I was lucky enough to visit the Tallaght control centre on my first day and it was great to meet the staff.  The atmosphere of caring, quietly efficient teamwork was very impressive.  I will get to meet an ambulance-based crew tomorrow.  We agree ambulance handover times at hospitals are a significant problem.  We are working with hospital staff.  It is about changing mindsets.  We must remember the hospital staff themselves are under significant capacity pressures, which we are trying to alleviate.  It is also about working with them so that we are all thinking of the patient who could be at the side of the road needing the ambulance.  It is a complicated problem that is not straightforward to solve but it is about supporting everyone to get to that same place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Morton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#S00100"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  Absolutely, it is probably the single biggest clinical risk we face at the moment.  Working closely with all of our colleagues across the acute hospital sector we collectively realise the implications of offload delays and the clinical risk this presents, which is the patient lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance because it is parked at a hospital somewhere.  The solutions are complex.  Some of it is down to capacity in the hospitals and in the ambulance service.  We are focused on working with our acute hospital colleagues to try to streamline the process of handing over patients, and looking at measures we can take <i>in extremis</i>.  Part of that is how we prepare for the forthcoming winter period.  For example, Professor O'Donnell is involved in a high-level group along with other clinicians looking at what are some of the process solutions we can put in place.  From our perspective, we are looking at measures around improving the local escalation arrangements between local National Ambulance Service, NAS, managers and local hospital managers.  We are looking at models such as fit to sit, where we must take a deep look at ourselves and ask ourselves whether every patient who attends an emergency department needs to go in on a stretcher or are some patients clinically suitable to sit in a chair, which would release the ambulance to get out back out to another patient.  We are also looking at cohort arrangements whereby we can have one crew looking after more than one patient, to release another ambulance.  These are the kind of <i>in extremis</i>measures we need to look at as part of our own contingency planning.  It is very high on our radar but the solution will not lie in the acute hospital or the National Ambulance Service looking at it in isolation.  We must look at it together.</p></speech>

This issue has not occurred just today or yesterday.  It has been going on for a number of years.  It is starting to seriously worry me now and, while I do not mean to be parochial,  in my area we are seeing a collapse in SouthDoc services.  I am getting repeated calls from people telling me that they can get through to SouthDoc.  This causes issues and knock-on impacts on whether or not ambulances should be called. Then, when ambulances are called the waiting times are far too long.  This is happening as a consequence of the issues outlined, and as I have outlined, in that they are not being released quickly enough from the hospital.</p> <p>  Surely it is not that big of an undertaking for the HSE to put in place a task force to look at this over six months, and to get teams in place at hospitals to receive the patients so that the ambulance crews can get back on the road.  That is all it is going to take: a couple of nurses and a couple of doctors.  We are all aware of the recruitment shortages in the HSE at the moment, but I do not believe it would have an adverse knock-on impact on the entire national healthcare system to put those staff into the busiest hospitals in the country.  It all boils down to the fact that ambulance crews should not be sitting in hospitals caring for patients.  They should be out on the road trying to rescue people who are in circumstances where they need the help.  It is unacceptable that this is going on in this day and age.</p> <p>  From my knowledge and from what I am hearing in my area it seems to be deteriorating.  That is a serious worry.  Is the provision of funding for a task force something that the HSE would be willing to undertake or look at, and that we would have period of time to look into this issue, with a time limit to come back with some findings to the Government?  Is this on the cards with the HSE?  I cannot take anything that the witnesses said to me today at face value.  I do not believe there was any commitment in anything they said.  Would Mr. Mulvany consider that?</p></speech>

Mr. Morton mentioned that there is a group already in place focused on this issue between hospitals and the ambulance service.  The core of the issue with regard to staffing is that we have put extra funding in for safer staffing in our emergency departments and our hospitals.  We also discussed at the committee recently, and the Deputy has mentioned, the challenges around staffing in the context of recruiting nurses and doctors in emergency departments.  As Mr. Morton has said, some of the measures that have been set up with the ambulance service are to try to mitigate those pressures that continue on our emergency departments.  Part of the winter plan is looking at those measures.  It is not just in the ambulance service because, in fairness, the challenge is not just there.  It is in the hospital on the one hand as well as trying to grow the capacity in the ambulance service.</p> <p>  We are under pressure.  We spoke to the NHS last night and they are equally under huge pressure on this issue of ambulance turnarounds.  The causal factors are partially down to the current increased demand going into the winter.  This is why that group is in place to look at solutions in the short, medium and longer term, and also looking at crisis solutions, as Mr. Morton has set out.  Mr. Morton might want to respond on that.  I want to be clear to the Deputy that there is a group focused on this.  We see it as a huge issue for our performance, for safety, for the release of ambulances, and for patients.  There is a group focused on this for our hospitals and ambulance services.  A collective solution needs to be found.  It is a challenge in lots of healthcare systems at the moment, unfortunately, coming out of the pandemic where we are seeing a lot of pressures on emergency departments.</p> <p>  I understand the Deputy's concerns and what he has said about getting confidence on it.  We can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to try to find solutions that will address it.  It is not a simple fix.  I just want to be clear on that.  We are trying-----</p></speech>

It is a difficult thing to do.  Anything that involves deploying a medical team does not have a simple solution.  This must be raised, however, and I will give a recent example.  A person in east Cork recently had to wait 90 minutes for an ambulance to come from Carlow.  I will not give any further breakdown, but that person is now dead.  I will leave it to the experts to make their assumptions but it is my understanding that perhaps the person could have been helped if they had got to the hospital on time.  This is extremely worrying.  It is just not good enough.  It is wholly unacceptable that ambulances are being pulled from the middle of Leinster down to Munster in east Cork, and particularly when we have hospital only 45 minutes up the road.  There are most certainly ambulances waiting there to be discharged.  There is an enormous urgency around this issue.  I would hope that in one years' time when the witnesses are before the committee again that improvements would be made by then.  I accept that Covid was exceptionally difficult for everybody but I remind the witnesses that this issue was there before Covid.</p> <p>  All of us here acknowledge the extraordinary work done by the people in the National Ambulance Service.  We are very grateful to them.  They are under enormous pressure.  It is just not good enough from the HSE quite frankly.</p></speech>

Perhaps the HSE will come back to the committee with the definitive position on that.  The figure of &euro;25 million worth is a significant sum of money.  Surely there is a use for that across the health sector.  That needs to be questioned with the manufacturers.</p> <p>  With regard to PPE.  The Comptroller and Auditor General estimates the impairment charges of &euro;374 million, and these are recognised in the 2020 financial statement.  In 2021, the HSE incurred further impairment charges of &euro;109 million.  That is a total impairment of &euro;483 million.  It is a substantial sum of money.  I understand, and it has been explained a few times in this committee by the Health Service Executive in relation to why a lot of stuff must be procured quickly, that saving lives was the priority.  At the same time, it has turned out that a lot of the PPE purchased was not suitable, fell short of standards, or maybe was more than we needed.  In the situation that we were in, obviously people have to play it safe.  The figure of &euro;483 million is a substantial sum of money.  Perhaps Mr. Mulvany will respond to that.</p></speech>

Again, going back to conditions that were in place at the time, about which we do not need to remind people, all of those decisions were made largely in March or April on all the orders.  On the technical piece of it, the vast bulk of that &euro;483 million over two years, which was the &euro;109 and &euro;374 impairment charges, the vast bulk of that was a price impairment.  There is a level that was obsolescence and there is a level that was storage, but the vast bulk of it is price.  This means that we had a choice.  Back in March and April 2020, we could have said "We will buy less now in the hope that we will be able to buy more later, on which there was no certainty, or that we will get it at a better price".  We were just not prepared to do that arbitrage or that gambling.</p></speech>

This was a price impairment.  We did not buy it to resell it.  We bought it to use it.  This is simply a technical piece: if it is worth less at the end of the year before one gets to use it, one charges it to the year.  It is not an impairment of something that is going to be resold.  It is not because it was the wrong size or that it was not fit for purpose.  It is none of that.  That is now on the record of the House and I just need to correct that.  It was not the case.  This was price impairment.  We balanced the financial risk, which was substantial, against the risk that we would not have enough PPE to keep our staff coming to the service.</p></speech>

We and all of Europe were caught in this situation.  We were at the epicentre of the Covid-19 pandemic and we understand that and the work that was done to counter that.  What we are saying to the HSE now, however, is that whatever the main equipment and sanitiser is, that this receives serious attention, in terms of trying to use it.  Other services possibly might acquire this equipment, as in the case of India which I have no argument with, because this was a worldwide pandemic and a better use was found for it.</p> <p>  My other question-----</p></speech>

That is a separate discussion about the hand sanitiser, which we will do everything to address.</p></speech>

One of the reasons for this was that it was a sellers&rsquo; market at that point in the spring of 2020.  One of the reasons, in turn, was that it turned out that we did not have any indigenous sources.  Many people have raised with me the question as to how we arrived at a situation, not just in Ireland, but in Europe, and in particular western Europe, where we do not make masks, hand sanitisers, gowns or protective suits.  What has been done now because I would not like to see the country caught again?  Because of international travel now, the world is a smaller place.  I am not an expert on this but the Spanish flu became an epidemic mainly in Europe.  It did not travel as far and travelled more slowly.  Many of us thought that perhaps Africa would be very badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic but it turned out that the virus did not reach parts of Africa because, from a development point of view, cars were not as available and people do not move as far.  Many localities in Africa, apparently, remain, thank God, fairly Covid-19-free.  My point is to ask what is happening now and what is being done now to ensure that we have indigenous supplies of PPE when we need them.  Perhaps the Department and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady might answer my question here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mulvany" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022100600002#T00600"><p>In the first instance I will answer and Mr. O&rsquo;Grady can come in then.  We have bought a substantial amount of masks, in particular, from indigenous suppliers but we had an element of indigenous supply prior to Covid-19.  The issue was that the volume of PPE required pre-Covid-19 and post-Covid-19 was incomparable.  The Chairman is completely right in that this is one of the lessons to be learned and it is being learned.  There is a European-wide agency looking at future preparedness.</p></speech>

There has been development of indigenous supply.  As I understand it, our HSE colleagues have advised that a great deal of current expenditure on replenishing stocks is coming through indigenous suppliers.  That has been built up with support from the Department of Health and from other Departments.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also involved, so I believe that lessons have been learned.  I am not across the detail of this or have it in front of me.</p></speech>

It is hard to prepare for every emergency but if one thing emerged from that pandemic, it showed that western Europe was caught out and we need to be more prepared in future.</p> <p>  I have a couple of final questions.  On home care, the budget and the number of hours have been increased, all of which are welcome.  We want to try to keep more people at home.  There are problems arising in the nursing home sector which clearly point to this.  The demographic trend is that people are living longer and they want to stay at home.  Some 99 out of 100 elderly people will say that they would prefer to be kept in their own home for as long as possible.  </p> <p>  I understand there are problems with recruitment.  The service is provided directly by HSE staff, by what used to be termed home helps and by agency staff.  As an observation, based on my own contemporaries, the agencies have a job in retaining staff and perhaps the HSE does too.  On the issue of costs, and in answer to parliamentary questions I have submitted over the years to which I have often had difficulty in getting a direct answer, where it might take a couple of parliamentary questions, these replies confirm that agency staff cost more to the HSE than directly-employed HSE staff.  This was contained in the answers I received on three occasions over the past 12 years.  On that issue, how much effort is being put into recruiting directly-employed HSE staff for home care?</p></speech>

If we were appearing before the committee three years ago, members would have been correct in informing us that they had seen letters where people were waiting because of funding.  That has now been substantially eliminated.  Now we have people waiting, unfortunately, because we need to get caring staff to go out and care for them.  This is just as big a problem if one is waiting, but is one we are seeking to recruit for.</p></speech>

I understand that there are three different types of services.  First, there is a public one, which is the PRSI service, whereby some people get cover if they have a certain class of PRSI and are entitled to certain treatments.  The second is the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, which is the medical card scheme.  The third one is the school service.  I am trying to understand what is happening in the three of those.  I am saying here today that the school service is not available in the part of the planet I inhabit; it is not available in Laois.  Every time HSE representatives appear before the committee, I will say the same thing to them because this has to be fixed.  There is no primary school dental service in County Laois and it is patchy in County Offaly as well.  Children who have gone right through that system, are almost at the end of the secondary school system and are 17 years of age, have never seen a school dentist or public dentist.</p> <p>  I am saying directly to our witnesses that on its budget, the Committee of Public Accounts and I want to know that if the Department of Health takes up a significant amount of money for the budget over at the Miesian Plaza - I would argue for as much money as possible going there because running the health service is expensive - that we will see a service at the other end.  What is happening in between?  If we are relying on private providers, why are we not offering a career path here to train, recruit, encourage and educate people into these positions?</p><p>This must be sorted.  The DTSS has collapsed also.  It is non-existent.  There is no DTSS.  The HSE is negotiating with hundreds of businesses.</p></speech>

No one has said to the Minister for Health or to the Minister for Finance that they are putting too much money into it.  I know these issues are hard to fix, but a start must be made somewhere.  Could Mr. Mulvany say what the funding is on a national level for dental services?  Could he tell me what it is per CHO?  I do not want to be parochial, but I am trying to get my head around what is happening.

Agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings for today's meeting?  Agreed.

We will then go into private session to report on our engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The first item is minutes from the meeting dated 29 September 2022, which have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters regarding the minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, they will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  I will move on to accounts and financial statements.  Some 56 sets of financial statements and accounts, including appropriation accounts, were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas between 26 and 30 September 2022.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening the floor to members.</p></speech>

This is effectively a dormant account.  There are no transactions on it, and it received a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The next couple are subsidiaries of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann - Greyhound Racing Operations Ireland Limited for 2021, which got a clear audit opinion; Abergrove Limited got a clear audit opinion for 2021; and Shelbourne Greyhound Stadium Limited got a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Also related to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann is the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust.</p><p>The account for 2021 received a clear audit opinion.  No. 6 is the Ciste Pinsean Thithe an Oireachtais, Comhalta&iacute;, account and it received a clear audit opinion.  No. 7 is the National Oil Reserves Agency designated activity company, DAC, for 2021 and it received a clear audit opinion.  No. 8 is Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge for 2021 and it received a clear audit opinion.  No. 9, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for 2021, received a clear audit opinion.  No. 10, the Broadcasting Fund, which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, received a clear audit opinion.  No. 11 is the Pensions Authority for 2021 and that received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> Nos. 12 to 56 are the 45 appropriation accounts for Government Departments and together they have an expenditure in aggregate of approximately &euro;74.5 billion.  I issued a clear audit opinion in all cases.  I do not propose to recite all their names.  I did, however, draw attention to certain matters in the audit certificates.  Obviously, where relevant, I referred to chapters that were published and that dealt with issues.  I also drew attention in a number of cases to material instances of non-compliant procurement.  This is where the aggregate level of identified non-compliant procurement was in excess of &euro;500,000 each.  In relation to four of the appropriation accounts, I drew attention to specific matters.  For Vote 11, Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I drew attention to a payment of &euro;460,000 to a supplier in settlement of arbitration proceedings.  For Vote 13, Office of Public Works, I drew attention to the continuing operation of a maintenance contract where the expenditure incurred is significantly greater than that envisaged when the contract was put in place.  This places it in the category of non-compliant procurement.  For Vote 34, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, similar to last year, I drew attention to a continuing large EU fine incurred in 2021 in respect of a wind farm constructed in County Galway.  Finally, for Vote 42, Rural and Community Development, I drew attention to the recovery of grant funding of &euro;1.09 million from Mayo County Council following the termination of funding agreements for four projects under the Department-funded outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme due to identified irregularities.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. McCarthy.  Can we agree and note the financial statements and accounts?  Agreed.  As usual, they will be published as part of the minutes.</p><p>As previously agreed, items of correspondence not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee&rsquo;s meetings and published on the committee&rsquo;s web page.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is that from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings.  </p><p>No. R1476B is correspondence from Ms Cathy Bryan, public transport and corporate services division, Department of Transport, dated 22 September 2022, explaining why the financial statements of the National Transport Authority, NTA, were not laid before the Houses within the timelines set down in Circular 24/21.  To put this in context, Circular 24/21 included the timelines within which accounts and funds audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The circular states that:</p> <blockquote> 	If exceptional or unusual circumstances arise which cause an unavoidable delay beyond these time limits, either for a body or fund in submitting its financial statements/accounts to the parent Department or for the Department in laying the financial statements or accounts of the body or fund before the Houses of the Oireachtas, the clerk to the Committee of Public Accounts [...] should be informed of this by the relevant Department. </blockquote> <p>Due to a widespread failure to comply with this provision, we have a standing agreement to request explanations from State bodies that do not meet the timelines set down in the circular.  As is the case with Nos. R1475B and R1476B, which are also on today&rsquo;s correspondence list, this item of correspondence is proactive notification of a delay to the laying of accounts before the Houses of the Oireachtas and is unusual in that it demonstrates compliance with the circular.  That is welcome, and we should see more of this type of correspondence, as it removes the need for us to monitor compliance and request explanations.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this correspondence for discussion.</p></speech>

Dublin Bus raised approximately &euro;1.6 million in advertising revenue in 2020.  I presume this figure will not differ hugely, given only so much advertising space is available.  A division within CI&Eacute; manages the contract on behalf of the NTA.  It is doing the work, but the money is being taken by the NTA.  It seems to be a very clumsy arrangement.</p><p>Does it do exactly the same in relation to Go-Ahead advertising or any other organisation.  To be honest, I have never had as many complaints as I have had since the National Transport Authority, NTA, has taken over responsibility for bus services.  It is quite chaotic.  </p></speech>

There is a number of items of correspondence from different bodies - I cannot clarify how many - but they indicate that the delay to the laying of the accounts relates to the fact that the budget was brought forward.  It was announced that the budget would be brought forward in July.  That is seven months into the year.  I would have thought that there would have been still sufficient time for accounts to have been prepared beforehand.  The cited circular is exactly one year old.  Within its first incarnation there are a number of bodies that are not providing their accounts on time.  There needs to be an improvement across all bodies in respect of that.  Of course it is better for somebody to proactively let us know that they will be late as opposed to us having to chase accounts up.  It would save on the paper in the correspondence if the accounts were actually submitted on time.  </p> <p>  The NTA were in before the committee not too long ago and there are a couple of outstanding questions which we might follow up on over the coming weeks as well.</p></speech>

As it has grown it is having a greater impact.  Its representatives were in before with regard to the capital projects that were taking place.  These are incredibly significant.  This week both the BusConnects and metro projects for my area are being published in tandem.  It would be useful to have the NTA in again.  The area I would like us to focus on is the area of fines for non-delivery of service.  If I am correct, we have seen Go-Ahead, the Luas, and one other operator that I cannot recall here, all being issued fines up to a value of approximately &euro;5 million.  It would be interesting to understand what happens those fines when they are collected, the economic calculation of whether they have any real impact on the service providers, and whether they are pitched at the right level.  The service delivery side mentioned by Deputy Murphy and also the capital projects the NTA operate under Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, are things we should look at when they come before the committee.</p></speech>

Have the Department officials been provided with the business case for the proposed project?  Has the external assurance process, required under the public spending code, happened?  I think they are called decision gates and it would be quite useful to know what they are.  Are we likely to see, for example, the HSE putting together a board like the National Pediatric Hospital Development Board as a subset?  How is it going to be managed?  We can keep on talking about learning lessons but there is something live at the moment and we need to be watching this process to make sure it is managed in a way that is not as frustrating as the children's hospital.</p></speech>

It is putting the cart before the horse, so to speak.</p> <p>  There is a considerable amount of documentation with that item which members may find useful and wish to refer to again.</p> <p>  Crrespondence No. 1494B is from Mr. Michael Fitzgerald, chief officer, HSE community healthcare organisation, 4.  It arises from last week&rsquo;s engagement with the HSE, during which certain information provided by the HSE was subsequently queried.  This item got a fair thrashing out this morning.  I know Deputy Hourigan had a particular interest in it.  If members are okay with that, we will move on.  </p> <p>  I want to revert to No. R1492 as it was not addressed.  Correspondence No. 1492, dated 20 October 2022, is from Mr. David Moloney, Accounting Officer and Secretary General, related to our work programme and the engagements we have scheduled with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and concerns on the agenda for the engagement.  This item was only received yesterday and I am not sure if members have had a chance to consider it.  At our meeting last week, we agreed that the agenda is as follows: taken from the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2021, chapter 3, on Vote accounting and budget management; and chapter 4, on the re-allocation of Voted funding; format and content of the appropriation accounts and the associated circular; and value for money and spending reviews, which is an area we have been dealing with recently.  </p> <p>  We also agreed to advise the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the closure of the Benefacts database and the Department's correspondence concerning expenditure on the National Maternity Hospital, considered the week before last, in correspondence No. R1426, might also be raised.  The Benefacts database is an area which we have been trying to give attention to and scrutinise.</p> <p>  Given the range of material to be covered, and to avoid crowding the agenda, it was decided not to include the appropriation accounts for this meeting and to consider scheduling a further meeting at a later date.  The Secretary General has requested the committee to consider including the relevant appropriation accounts which are: Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances; Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement, and Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  The Secretary General makes the case that this was done at the meeting last May, and that the appropriation accounts provide the basis for discussing some of the other matters that will be raised.</p> <p>  Are members happy to proceed with the agenda as agreed last week or is there a preference to examine the relevant appropriation accounts as requested by Mr. Moloney?  </p> <p>  It was left off because we felt it was crowding out the meeting but the Secretary General is making the case here that the appropriation accounts would provide the basis for discussing some of the matters that will be raised and that we have highlighted.  It is in the committee members' hands at this stage.</p></speech>

It is point 4.  Members might remember that the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, was to be set up on 1 January this year to replace the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE.  One big impediment to the effective running of the ODCE was that there was an inadequate number of garda&iacute; assigned to it.  The director had come out and been critical of that.  A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Garda and the new CEA.  I was given the assurance in the D&aacute;il that would be the case.  It says on item 4 that there were to be 16.  I understand there are, according to this, seven members assigned.  This agency cannot function unless the garda&iacute; are assigned.  There are high-profile cases like the one in relation to the FAI and John Delaney, pending a long time, and the one for Independent Newspapers.  People lose confidence in an agency if it cannot do its work in a timely way.  This agency was to be set up with the appropriate complement of garda&iacute;, who are required because they have the power to arrest, for example.  Something may be pending and you can do nothing unless you have the power to arrest.</p> <p>  We need a quarterly report on progress on this recruitment.  It should have been ready to go when the new agency was set up.  We will be serious about corporate crime or we will not.  We end up having to do things retrospectively that cost way more money.  There is significant value for money in this.  Given the director of the ODCE was so critical of the inadequate number of garda&iacute; and the assurances we have been given, the idea this did not happen from day one is not acceptable.  I want a close eye kept on that.</p></speech>

This is Maynooth University but could equally relate to any of the universities where additional resources are sought from students in relation to student services.  I welcome where these are treated separately.  There were referendums in Maynooth to collect an additional amount going back to the 1990s.  The money was to be borrowed from the European Investment Bank and then paid back by the levy.  That levy was increased in 2015 to provide the new building, which had commenced.  Now the project has terminated.</p> <p>  There is a big protest outside Maynooth today.  Maynooth started as a college with about 5,000 students.  There are now about 15,000 so it is one of the more rapidly growing universities.  There are people from all parts of the country attending it and there are many positive things to say about it.  However, where there is a dedicated amount of money for particular projects, is it set out in the accounts that it is used for the purpose for which it is collected?  It appears this project has been ended and, instead of that facility being provided, they are told there will be additional spaces in other buildings around the campus, seating and things like that.  It is not what the students voted for.  The issue is about how it is accounted for and holding them to account for delivering things that are collected for.  It is a big deal to be paying &euro;150 on top of the &euro;3,000.  The student body has got bigger there over the years.</p></speech>

One paid in money over a four-year period for this project and raised the issue of the project not going ahead.  It seems there was just a decision taken to end it.  They are saying if the money was collected for that purpose, what happens?  That is an issue we need to follow up with the university.  I will bring in the Comptroller and Auditor General on this.  Does he want to offer a view?</p></speech>

It would be premature for me to give a view.  The issues the Deputy has outlined deserve answers.  The committee may want to write to the university and set out those questions.  We will examine it as part of the audit.</p> <p>  In terms of the way it is accounted for, the student levy income is taken as an income into the university.  There is not a restricted reserve in which that money has been accumulating.  Some of it has been spent.  It is all intended to be spent on student services or student-related services, societies and so on.</p><p>Obviously, a large part of it was for the infrastructure development and there was an accumulated fund.  Even as far back as 2014, it already had a certain amount in it which was being earmarked for expenditure on the centre.  In a way, there is a general issue coming out of the hyperinflation impacting on a capital project because the same rules apply to capital projects everywhere, and this may not be the only capital project that will find itself in difficulties like this.</p></speech>

I may well talk to them, as the Chairman may also do.  A key condition attached to the 1999 levy referendum was that if any of the conditions were broken, the referendum would be deemed null and void, so they were being very clear about what was expected and that was set out.  I completely understand about the hyperinflation and I believe this project has gone something like 50% over what was originally tendered.  We need to understand that.  To go back to the 1990s, there was a &euro;40 per student fee at that time and that went up to &euro;150 in 2015.  That was to be discontinued when the facilities were in place but none of the facilities that were supposed to be in place have been provided.  That is why there is such frustration that the money was collected but the services have not been delivered.  There is a wider issue and I believe we should be looking at this when we are looking at the universities and, in particular, where there are additional charges, how they are handled and what is delivered from them.  There cannot be a university without students.</p></speech>

All those present in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in respect of protection against the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  Today, we are considering the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality regarding pay and workplace conditions, specifically, recommendations No. 32 to 36 of the assembly report.  We are delighted to welcome representatives from three organisations: WorkEqual; IBEC; and SIPTU.  I would like to welcome the following witnesses joining us in the committee room: Ms Angela Smith, CEO and Ms Sonya Lennon, founder WorkEqual; and Ms Ethel Buckley, deputy general secretary and Mr. Michael Taft, senior researcher SIPTU, who will join us shortly.  Joining via MS Teams are Dr. Kara McGann, head of social policy and Ms Pauline O'Hare, senior employment law manager, IBEC.</p> <p>   Before we begin, I must read an important notice regarding parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make them identifiable.  Participants who are giving evidence from a location outside parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating from with parliamentary precincts does not extend to them and no clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I will invite witnesses to make their opening statements before opening the floor to members for questions and answers.  Our focus throughout our hearings has been the practical implementation of the recommendations of the citizens' assembly.  We have asked witnesses to focus on how to implement these important recommendations.  We are grateful to them all for their submissions, opening statements and engagement with us.  We also have time limits on participation to ensure the maximum number of Oireachtas colleagues can engage in questioning.  There will be a six-minute time limit on each exchange.  We may then be able to go to a second round of questions and discussion.  We ask witnesses to keep opening statements relatively short - five minutes or so, if they can.  I thank them all again for coming before us today.  I will call WorkEqual first, followed by IBEC and then SIPTU.  I call Ms Smith and Ms Lennon to make their opening statements.  It is a pleasure to have you here.</p></speech>

The mission of WorkEqual is to promote the economic independence of women and build an Ireland that champions workplace equality.  We are a registered charity providing free supports nationally to women entering or re-entering the workforce.  This includes professional styling, mentoring and career development services.  Our clients are very diverse, but we work in particular with women who face challenges accessing the labour market.  We partner with grassroots community groups and specialist support services such as the Irish Refugee Council, the Liberties Training Centre and Empower in providing our services to those most in need.</p> <p>  Our work is supported by a range of corporate partners including Permanent TSB, SOLAS, Oracle and Indeed.  They provide funding and volunteers to support our service provision and campaigning.  At WorkEqual, we help women to access labour market opportunities but through client feedback, we became increasingly aware that women face additional challenges and barriers in their career progression.  This is particularly true of women from less advantaged backgrounds and women who have been out of the workforce for long periods.</p> <p>  This has informed our campaigning work.  Since 2016, we have run an awareness campaign every November to highlight and tackle gender inequalities in Irish workplaces centred around Equal Pay Day, the date on which women effectively stop earning relative to men because of the gender pay gap.  As many committee members will be aware, a WorkEqual Oireachtas all-party group was formed in 2018 and is currently co-chaired by Deputy Bacik and Senators Lorraine Clifford-Lee and Emer Currie.  We have also established a strong working relationship with colleagues in Iceland, particularly the Icelandic Women&rsquo;s Rights Association, to understand and learn from global gold standard.</p> <p>  Within the workplace equality landscape, we occupy a unique position because we bridge the gap between employees, employers and policymakers.  We have followed the progress of this committee keenly and we very much welcomed the report from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality.  I will pass over to Ms Lennon to speak about how our work specifically relates to recommendations No. 32 to 36 of the citizens&rsquo; assembly report.</p></speech>

I am the founder of WorkEqual.  First, I would like to share relevant market research we commissioned on public attitudes towards gender equality, conducted by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes Limited last October.  We found that 74% of people believe that closing the gender pay gap is important and should be a priority for Government and employers.  The other, and bigger, piece of the research was the impact of caring duties on career progression.  Some 35% of people said family caring duties impacted on their careers, with 45% of women feeling that they were impacted, compared to only 25% of men.  The finding that 33% of women with teenage children said their careers had been impacted, compared to 0% of men, was particularly striking.  In summary, the research we commissioned showed that, while there is strong support for Government and employers to tackle the gender pay gap, the wider public do not fully understand the root causes or diverse factors that feed into the pay gap.  We also found that 85% of people did not really understand what the gender pay gap was and thought it was more to do with equal pay.  There is a big piece of work to do there.</p> <p>  On career progression, the associated factors such as job security and earning power are hampered by caring duties and this impacts much more on women than men.  Public sentiment and changing behaviour are two very different things and, backed by our research, we believe that a public awareness campaign is needed to build understanding of the causes of the pay gap and the importance of addressing it.  Building wider public understanding will ensure full buy-in and long-term support for the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021, which was initially brought forward by Deputy Bacik.</p> <p>  In addition to the public awareness campaign and based on our ongoing collaboration with relevant groups in Iceland, we recommend the establishment of a State-driven, consumer-facing quality assurance mark for organisations that meaningfully commit to gender equality and follow a prescribed framework to promote and achieve equality in their workplaces.  A similar mark has been introduced successfully in Iceland, where it has become the norm for companies to secure that quality mark and adhere to its principles in the same way that companies adhere to health and safety and best practice regarding sustainability.  It is a consumer-facing mark on products and services.</p> <p>  In conclusion, we must grant cultural permission for everyone to advocate for equitable cultures in work and life.  Proactive and holistic communication is key to changing the narrative, normalising new behaviours and embedding real change.</p></speech>

It has been a pleasure to co-chair the working group in the Oireachtas with WorkEqual.  I thank her for her focus on the practical implementation.  I would like to welcome our colleagues from SIPTU.  I will call IBEC next and then SIPTU for their opening statements before we move to the exchanges with members.  We will have time limits on exchanges with colleagues.  We hope, therefore, to cover a wide range of issues.  I call Dr. Kara McGann.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#C00500"><p>I thank the joint committee for the opportunity to address them following the comprehensive recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality.</p> <p>  IBEC has a long track record of working on the issues of gender equality and developing policy and resources to tackle barriers facing women in the labour market.  While progress has been made in many areas, there continues to be more work to do.  Regarding recommendations No. 32 and 33, the roots of a gender pay gap are multiple and complex, symptomatic of how we think of men, women and gender across society.  The gender pay gap calculates the difference in the average hourly wages of all men and women across a workforce, not just those in same jobs, with the same working patterns or the same competencies or experience.  It does not indicate discrimination or bias, or even an absence of equal pay for equal value work, but it does report a gender representation gap.</p><p>IBEC supports the aim to reduce the hourly gender pay gap through targets, but it is difficult to see how this will be achieved if only the business community is targeted given the underlying structural, policy and cultural causes.  Effective policy development must consider how men and women participate in the labour market, including pre-labour-market areas such as education; culture and biases around the jobs and careers men and women have; the responsibility for child and long-term care and how this impacts on outcomes.</p><p> We welcome the introduction of the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021, but it has been a difficult journey, because while organisations have known about reporting for some time, the Irish methodology, which is very different from other jurisdictions, was only published in June.  In addition, major concerns regarding clarity within the reporting requirements have been raised and have needed significant and ongoing follow-up.</p><p> Gender pay gap reporting alone will not identify or solve the myriad challenges but has the potential to offer a real diagnostic tool to highlight the relevant issues for targeted interventions by all stakeholders.  However, without a whole-of-society approach, progress will be limited and an opportunity for real change will be wasted.</p><p> With regard to recommendation 34, IBEC believes that a five-year timeline with a high degree of flexibility in determining annual rates, while still challenging, would be realistic if Ireland is to transition to a living wage.  The effects of moving to a living wage on both total-hours-worked and employment should be reviewed by the Low Pay Commission, LPC, annually over the timeline of its introduction with a particular focus on any loss of employment or hours of work resulting from an increased living wage.  We share the view of the Parliament that consideration should be given to the impacts on small, and indeed all, businesses, particularly those within the most affected sectors such as hospitality and retail.  </p><p> Proposed changes would impose a greater regulatory and administrative cost burden on companies, particularly on SMEs, in inputting hours on a payroll basis.  The ability to make these changes and the phasing of them must be borne in mind when initiating the transition to a living wage.</p><p> With regard to recommendation 35 Ireland has a strong voluntarist industrial relations framework which has been effective in times of both economic growth and recession.  Reform of the legislation has introduced sectoral employment orders; affirmed joint labour committees and registered employment agreements; and clarified the circumstances in which a trade union may refer a trade dispute to the Labour Court for a legally binding outcome.  Therefore, while employers can choose whether or not to negotiate with a trade union or engage in collective bargaining, there may be real consequences for refusing to do so, namely a legally enforceable determination by the Labour Court.</p><p> In parallel with reforms, Ireland has introduced a significant body of statutory employment rights governing everything from working hours, to sick pay, so it is increasingly difficult to identify traditional areas of collective negotiation that are not now regulated by statute.  While IBEC, does not support the proposal, we have been working progressively with the trade union movement, under the auspices of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, collective bargaining group, to promote and address any obstacles to collective bargaining in our current framework.  This work has proposed a set of recommendations that demonstrate the best aspects of our industrial relations, IR, systems and recognises the success of the voluntarist model underpinned by a highly developed dispute resolution mechanism.</p><p> We strongly support an effective enforcement framework across all aspects of regulation.  It is imperative that regulation is equally applied to ensure a fair and balanced competitive environment.  The resourcing needs of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, should be kept under regular review to ensure that they are adequate.</p><p> I move on finally to recommendation 36.  It is questionable whether it is necessary to introduce a statutory right to access flexible working.  If the intention is to provide a framework for employers and employees, then best practice guidance in a code of practice would provide a much more agile and flexible way to address this area.</p><p> Business recognises the benefits that flexible working solutions can bring to a workplace, including sustainability; attracting and retaining best talent; and promoting a healthy work-life balance, to name but a few.  However, it is imperative to balance the importance of reconciling professional and private life with the need to sustain employment and economic competitiveness.  While many employers can and will offer remote working conditions to employees, remote working simply cannot be facilitated in some sectors and by some employers.</p><p> The business case for gender equality is well established and while much has been achieved, momentum seems to have stalled in recent years.  IBEC looks forward to engaging further in this work towards gender balance and supporting an Ireland that enables women and girls to fulfil their potential including in the workplace.</p></speech>

We appreciate that practical approach.  Before I invite our witnesses from SIPTU, I need to give a privilege warning.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Those participating in the committee meeting from a location outside parliamentary precincts have a different position on privilege which I have already read.  It does not apply to SIPTU.  I apologise for the delay.  I just needed to read that to the witnesses who are present.  </p> <p>  We thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and engaging with us and for their submissions and opening statements.  I invite Ms Buckley to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.616" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethel Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#D00300"><p>On behalf of SIPTU, I thank the members of the committee for the invitation to input into its considerations of the recommendations of the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Gender Equality and to outline SIPTU&rsquo;s work to tackle gender inequality in the workplace, the labour market and in Irish life.  I am accompanied by my colleague, senior researcher, Mr. Michael Taft.</p> <p>  SIPTU is the largest trade union in Ireland.  We represent workers in all sectors of the economy in both the public and private sector.  Representing approximately 200,000 workers, 42% of whom are women, our trade union has been at the forefront of campaigning on issues impacting on gender equality for over a century.</p> <p>  Women workers pay a heavy price for their gender.  To achieve our goal of gender equality, we will need to significantly improve pay and working conditions for women who disproportionately experience low pay and precarious living standards.</p> <p>  SIPTU&rsquo;s Working Women&rsquo;s Charter, launched on International Women&rsquo;s Day in 2020, is the guiding manifesto for our policy, campaigning, organising and industrial work on behalf of women workers.</p> <p>We welcomed the fact that many of the Citizens' Assembly&rsquo;s recommendations aligned with some of the key demands of our charter, which were also contained in our quite lengthy submission to the Citizens' Assembly, most notably the introduction of a legal right to collective bargaining; a substantial increase in investment in childcare to create a professionalised workforce delivering quality affordable childcare; pay transparency legislation and targets as a tool to tackle the gender pay gap; and promotion of women&rsquo;s participation and leadership in all forms of decision-making.</p> <p>  As a union, we have a strong commitment to promoting gender equality.  SIPTU introduced a rule in 2017 that requires representation of no less than 40% males and 40% females on all of our peak decision-making bodies.  That is our national executive council, our five industrial divisional committees and our 21 industrial sectoral committees.  Ensuring that women are at the table where decisions are made is intrinsic to gender equality.</p> <p>  As requested, we will limit our remaining comments in our opening statement to the recommendations on pay and workplace conditions, recommendations 32 to 36.</p> <p>  In respect of recommendation 32, the gender pay gap, Ireland's gender pay gap is 11.3%, based on 2018 data, which is the most recent year for which we have data and this is below the EU average.  This is the unadjusted gender pay gap.  It includes both possible discrimination between men and women such as unequal pay for equal work, as well as the impact of differences of the average characteristics of men and women in the labour market.</p> <p>  The EU Commission has attempted to adjust the data, factoring in a number of labour market characteristics such as sector of activity, age, occupation, full-time or part-time work, etc.  This is done to ensure that we are measuring the gender pay gap on a like-for-like basis.  The adjusted result is what the Commission calls the unexplained part of the gender pay gap.  The last Commission study was done using 2014 data.  When adjusted the gender pay gap falls throughout Europe.  However, interestingly in Ireland, the adjusted or unexplained gender pay gap actually increases and exceeds the EU average.  It is difficult to say why this high level of unexplained gender pay gap exists, hence the term "unexplained".</p> <p>  However, SIPTU would like to provide further data which might provide some insights.  EUROSTAT and the Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show the gender pay gap in the public sector in Ireland to be 6.1% but in the private sector to be 20%.</p><p>One explanation is likely to be the high level of collective bargaining in the public sector compared to the private sector.  Collective agreements not only promote strong wage floors and the reduction of any pay discrimination, they also tend to protect part-time workers and help ensure transparency and accountability in career progression.  Levelling up pay and conditions for part-time and flexible workers is a key instrument in shrinking the gender pay gap.  Unfortunately, we do not have sectoral breakdowns of the adjusted gender pay gap.  The committee may wish to recommend that the relevant Department conduct a detailed study of the adjusted gender pay gap by a number of characteristics, for example, public and private sector, economic or industrial activity, age and so forth, using the same methodology as the EU Commission.<br/><br/>Moving on to recommendation 34 in respect of the minimum wage or the living wage, Ireland has a low pay crisis.  In 2018, EUROSTAT and the Central Statistics Office data showed that one in five workers in Ireland are officially categorised as low paid.  Women are particularly affected by low pay.  While 17% of men are low paid, 23% of women are low paid.  SIPTU welcomed the commitment in the programme for Government to raise the minimum wage to the living wage by 2025.  We further welcomed the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission to lift the minimum wage to 66% of the median average:</p><blockquote>	After the 60% of the median wage target has been reached ... the Commission should assess the economic practicality of gradually increasing the targeted threshold rate towards 66% of the median wage and make recommendations accordingly.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Low-wage earners are defined by Eurostat as &quot;those employees earning two thirds or less of the national median gross hourly earnings&quot;.  On that basis, having a living wage rate set at 66% of median wage will eradicate low-wage employment for all workers earning at or above the living wage rate. </blockquote><p>The committee may wish to discuss this further with my colleague Mr. Michael Taft.  It is important to note that Mr. Taft is a member of the Low Pay Commission.<br/><br/>Women make up the majority of employees in the hospitality sector, which has a low pay rate of 54%.  Women also make up the majority in the distributive sector, which has a low pay rate of 30%.  Moving the minimum wage to the living wage would clearly be a boost for hundreds of thousands of these workers.<br/><br/>Reaching the living wage, 66% of the median wage, by 2025 will be particularly challenging in our view.  Based on the Government&rsquo;s own estimates, it would mean increasing the current minimum wage of &euro;10.50 to in excess of &euro;15 per hour by 2025.  Recognising this, the Low Pay Commission proposed economic supports for businesses in the transition to the living wage.  There is much commentary regarding the impact of minimum wage increases on small businesses.  However, SIPTU research has shown that in the retail sector the impact of wage increases is relatively constant in percentage terms across enterprises despite size.  This holds for impact on turnover and operating costs.  The real challenge that small businesses face is the very low level of consumer spending compared with the eurozone.  Ireland would have to increase consumer spending by 17%, or &euro;17 billion, to reach the eurozone average.  That consumer spending is so low may have many causes, but one way to address it is by raising income floors where people have a very high propensity to spend what they earn.  Ultimately, the move to a living wage constitutes a transition away from a low-pay and what we would call low-road exploitative business model, and there is no doubt this will be difficult.  However, other EU countries with higher levels of corporation tax, employers' tax and social insurance, and wages have vibrant and extensive small business sectors.</p></speech>

On recommendation 35 on collective bargaining, SIPTU's view is that if Ireland is truly to tackle gender equality, the recommendation in respect of collective bargaining is a really key recommendation from the citizens' assembly.  Collective bargaining is the key instrument to raise wage floors and to improve working conditions.  Women workers in particular benefit from collective bargaining coverage, especially sectoral collective bargaining coverage.  I draw the committee's attention to a recent example of a very successful and wide-scale sectoral collective bargaining as a result of the unionisation by SIPTU of the early years education and care sector and a recent new first pay deal which came into effect on 15 September for childcare workers, 98% of whom are women.  Some 27,000 workers got a new pay deal and 70% received a pay increase.  It is at that scale and that level of sectoral bargaining that we will really see an impact on the gender pay gap.</p> <p>  As regards flexible working, recommendation 36, the trade union movement has campaigned vigorously over many years for a statutory right to access remote working.  I wish to draw the committee's attention to some recent concerning research from UCD on the gendered aspects of home working and remote working.  There was a marked gendered differential on the intensification of work between women and men and the stress women and men feel when they are working from home.  This is something we really need to watch.  The other thing SIPTU is concerned about is the impact on women's career progression if they are not present in the workplace.  Finally, interestingly though hardly surprising, the research from UCD also showed that where a union was recognised by management for the purpose of representing employees, working at home was less likely to be associated with work intensification.</p> <p>  I thank committee members for listening to our opening statement and we are very happy to take their questions.</p></speech>

I preface all my observations at this meeting with the observation that, after the reporting of IBEC's extraordinary and worrying statement on domestic violence leave, what seems to have gone missing in the furore yesterday was that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, had already indicated he was also going to look for documentation to prove a woman had suffered domestic violence.  I hope now, after the reaction yesterday from the public, that will be squashed on the head because it kind of goes back to the debates that happened during the abortion referendum, when women tried to access early abortion if they suffered domestic abuse, and eventually, in their sense, everybody decided women should be trusted.  I hope the women who were out yesterday on the radio for IBEC and indeed every woman working for IBEC feels their colleagues trust them.  That is very important.</p> <p>  IBEC proposed there could be some compassionate leave given and I have to ask if they understand the word "compassion".  Perhaps Dr. Gahan, as head of social policy at IBEC, could address that and could outline the context IBEC had with the Minister and his Department on this.  I would also worry about how a person would be able to produce evidence of psychological damage, how injuries would be graded and that sort of thing.  If it was to be a box-ticking exercise, which I believe it would be, there are a lot of mothers who would be very worried about people making reports to Tusla and about the fear of losing their children.</p><p>It might mean that women would be reluctant to come forward.  I would like to start with that.  What communication happened between the Department and the Minister?  How does Dr. McGann feel about it and would she like to make a statement to clear things up?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach gave an assurance that domestic violence leave would be introduced, which was very welcome to hear.  However, we need to hear further clarification on the issue the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

I believe Vodafone and many big companies do this as well.  It is strange that what went unnoticed yesterday is that the Minister had already halved that to five days and had also recommended that evidence will be needed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Pauline O'Hare" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#F00600"><p>We were concerned about how the coverage of IBEC&rsquo;s submission was reported.  Looking at the submission in its context, what was reported was absolutely not reflective of what was stated.  We fully support victims of domestic violence.  In fact, in our engagements with the Department, which went on since March 2021, we made very clear to the Department the challenges that victims of domestic violence would face in having to show proof.  In fact, within that submission, we called out coercive control as an issue.  We know that section 39 of the Domestic Violence Act defines coercive control as including the fear of domestic violence.  We directly asked the Department to explain how victims would be able to prove that fear when they are too afraid to go to the Garda.  These are issues that we raised in our submission.  When people are in vulnerable and precarious situations, how do they do that?</p> <p>  Coming back to IBEC&rsquo;s position, as the Deputy mentioned many employers already give this leave and some do it as compassionate leave.  The issue that arises is that when the Government decides to legislate for something and put a statutory framework around it, employers need to know how to comply with that legislation.  They need to know how to apply the rules in a fair and equal way.</p> <p>  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, on 22 September the Department published its own report in which it recommended that employers reserve the right to ask for reasonable proof.  Just to reiterate, employers are very sensitive to these situations.  They understand the vulnerability and reserving a right is absolutely not the same as utilising that right.  Employers apply compassion to these situations.  We absolutely agree that there are difficulties with that proof and we have raised that on a number of occasions with the Department.  It is important that we clarify that because it is very far from what was reported, which was that we demanded that proof be given.  That is not the case and it is very important to say that.  At no point did IBEC say it demanded that proof be required for domestic violence.  We understand the difficulties that arise for employees in those situations.</p> <p>  If it is the case that proof is required, we need to know how to apply that.  This is a Government decision.  If it says no proof is required, employers still need to know how to comply with the legislation.  There are other concerns around the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  Do we need a legal basis to retain records?  Will there be a statutory obligation to retain statutory records on a statutory piece of leave?  If so, what do we do if there is an absence of evidence?  This is what the Department needs to advise employers to do.  There are concerns around that.</p> <p>  Employers absolutely do their best to meet their legal obligations and they are aware of the difficulties around domestic violence and the welfare of employees.  They want to support employees in that situation.  However, they need to know how to comply with that.  If no proof is required, the WRC needs to know how it can determine whether an employee is a victim of domestic violence in the absence of proof.  That is a matter for the Department-----</p></speech>

The reason members might focus on that is because many of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality were about tackling issues where gender made a significant difference.  There is no doubt that women suffer domestic violence far more than man.  That is not to say that men do not experience violence; of course they do.  If we are to address gender equality, we have to address issues such as how we handle domestic violence, and tone is important in every part of how we address it.</p> <p>  What we missed in focusing just on domestic violence, which I will come back to within my time, was a broader suggestion by IBEC that the amount of leave being provided, including parental leave and so on, was too broad and should be delayed and staggered.  It was alarming that at a time when we are trying to address gender issues and the flexible working legislation, which is a huge step forward, employers were seeking to delay that.  Perhaps IBEC might focus on that issue for the moment, before I come back to the domestic violence issue.  Why was the principal employer body in the State trying to prevent such a crucial tool to address gender equality?</p></speech>

In the broader submission in which the domestic violence references were made, there was a broader view - complaint is probably too hard a word &ndash; by IBEC that there should be a delay or staggering.

Obviously, there will be no delay on that because the State has to transpose it as soon as possible, having just missed a deadline.  That includes flexible working arrangements or the right to request flexible working arrangements for parents and carers.</p> <p>  We have proposed legislation relating to remote work, which is a form of flexible working arrangements.  We are engaging with the Department and have raised our concerns around that.  Keep in mind that arising from Covid, many employers have flexible working arrangements in place, such as remote working.  Employers absolutely recognise the value of flexible working arrangements in terms of the labour market, retaining and recruiting talent and widening the talent pool.  There are a number of reasons for this.  However, flexible working, like remote working, is a very complex issue.</p></speech>

My suggestion was that IBEC is suggesting that the Government was introducing too much paid leave, citing the extension of parental leave, the introduction of statutory sick pay and the domestic violence legislation.  It is a broader tone here; it is not just on the issue of domestic violence.  It is a broader tone that the statutory provision of leave was something that IBEC saw as regressive, as opposed to seeing it as progressive.</p></speech>

We cannot look at one type of leave in isolation; rather, we need to look at the cumulative effect of that.  Employers, especially small businesses, are dealing with the cost of the energy crisis and they are coming out of Covid still dealing with the challenges-----</p></speech>

We have highlighted the cost impact, which cannot be ignored.  In the current climate, businesses have many challenges.  It is not that we are saying we are against a particular thing; it is that there is a need to look at the overall context of every situation and every new leave that is introduced.  The Sick Leave Act is complex in terms of the leave for which it provides.  We engaged comprehensively with the Department on it.  We made a number of submissions.  It is a complex issue.  One cannot ignore the complete impact on businesses of all these initiatives at a time when they are dealing with a number of challenges, particularly in the case of small and medium-sized businesses.</p></speech>

The topic on everybody's mind is the IBEC issue.  I commented on this yesterday.  I take on board what Ms O'Hare has said in respect of the cost of business and the concerns with regard to implementing additional leave.  Maybe that is where the ask should have been.  I hear what she is saying in respect of how the issue was reported but she has not said what was inaccurate in the reporting.  It seems that what was printed was what was asked for.</p> <p>  The proof issue has been dealt with by other members.  We all accept it can be very difficult to prove coercive control and other aspects of domestic violence.  I am not sure what the equivalent of a sick cert from one's general practitioner would be.  There does not seem to be such a certification for domestic violence, so I do not think it will be workable to require some sort of proof in order to get that time off.  Obviously, time can be of the essence in such situations.</p> <p>  I was particularly concerned by the request for the Government to conduct a cost-benefit analysis to weigh up the cost to employers as compared with the benefit to the employee of providing this leave.  That is the wrong way to look at it, particularly in the current environment and given what we have been through as a country.  In the past couple of years in particular there have been very high-profile cases involving violence against women and we are in a new era in terms of dealing with this.  I hope IBEC has reflected on that.  That is not discounting the fact that there has been a lot of change in terms of statutory sick leave and extra parental leave.  There is a lot for businesses to deal with, so I accept that point, but I think the Government can assist with that financially and in terms of helping businesses to adapt.  We all need to sing off the same hymn sheet, however, in terms of this being a necessary additional support for people going through that issue.</p> <p>  To move to Ms Lennon and WorkEqual, I was interested by its submission in respect of a quality assurance mark - I hope I have that term right - for employers considered to be promoting gender equality.  I ask her to elaborate on that and how it might work.  From where did the idea come?   Did it come from businesses?  How could we put it into play in the coming months or years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sonya Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#G01000"><p>The idea of a consumer-facing mark on products and services is one we have discussed with our colleagues in Iceland, where it is live and in action.  In the context of 74% of the population believing closing the gender pay gap should be a priority, it is important to consider the structures we can put in place to support new behaviours.  It could easily be linked to gender pay gap reporting by way of tiered successes of organisations in terms of moving towards gender equality or gender equity and closing the pay gap in the organisation.  It is important to state that gender pay gap reporting will not be without its issues.  Part of the messaging that we believe is required for organisations is an acceptance that nobody has it completely right at the moment, so everybody will have work to do.  How that story is communicated publicly, as well as the action plan towards closing the gender pay gap, are key.  It needs to be time bound, monitored and held accountable, and the legislation must have teeth to ensure people are compliant.  When we begin to put that power into the hands of consumers, we will have great momentum.</p> <p>  The other piece very much relates to the motivation of organisations to close the gender pay gap.  It cannot be compliance.  That is not the point of this.  Much of that relates to understanding the benefit of more equitable workplaces for everybody.</p></speech>

In particular, Ms Buckley may wish to comment on the quality assurance mark and whether unions would consider that useful in reducing the gender pay gap.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.649" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethel Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#G01200"><p>I am not familiar with the specifics of the proposal in respect of a quality assurance mark.  My head goes to the practicalities of how it might be measured.  For trade unions, a real mark of the quality of an employer is its attitude towards workplace democracy.  We know that workplace democracy and engaging with staff, their representatives and trade unions and taking part in collective bargaining are the key instrument for raising the quality of women's pay and jobs and ensuring that women progress well in organisations.  The real game-changer in the context of the gender pay gap is ensuring that people, mainly women, who work in part-time roles and flexible roles are not disadvantaged for so doing.  In our submission, we demonstrated that where collective bargaining is widespread, such as in the public sector, one gets a very different result on the gender pay gap than one does where it is less prevalent.  For us, the real instrument will be the expansion of collective bargaining.  The high-level expert group was announced yesterday.  We are eagerly awaiting the transposition of the European directive which went through earlier this week on adequate minimum wages, which will expand collective bargaining coverage to 80% of the country.  That will be a real game-changer for working women, particularly low-paid working women.</p> <p>  I would like the opportunity to clarify SIPTU's position on domestic violence leave.  I have not had a chance to address that issue yet.</p></speech>

Do they support the proposals of Deputies Louise O'Reilly and McDonald for a statutory ten days domestic violence leave?  My colleague mentioned some of the organisations and companies that provide ten days leave, such as Danske Bank, universities, Vodafone and An Post.  Essentially, the statutory leave of workers in those organisations has been halved as a result of the proposals of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.</p><p>While I respect the Minister, I urge him to revisit this.</p><p> Ms Buckley mentioned the high-level group on collective bargaining.  Yesterday, we all saw the recommendations and they will obviously be judged by the legislation.  The need to protect collective bargaining in the workplace has never been greater and it has real consequences for terms and conditions at work, for workplace democracy, as Ms Buckley mentioned, and for low pay as well.  While I and Sinn F&eacute;in welcome the recommendations on collective bargaining, they will be judged by the legislation.  I would like to get Ms Buckley's initial response to those recommendations of the high-level group.</p></speech>

We too were shocked by the comments by IBEC yesterday and we issued a statement in response, so I will leave it at that.  This goes to the Senator's point about the fact there already exist collective agreements on paid domestic violence leave.  Many employers would have been shocked by the comments yesterday because, in our experience of negotiating paid domestic violence leave with employers - the early starters in this area - we find many employers very receptive and very understanding.</p> <p>  It is important we do not lose sight of why we want paid domestic violence leave.  We come to this issue with tremendous practical experience of the issue of domestic violence and how it has an impact on the workplace.  The reason we want paid domestic violence leave is to give the victims of domestic violence, mainly women, the opportunity to ameliorate their situation and often to get out of violent and abusive situations.  There is paid domestic violence leave in other countries and we know from international research the take-up rate, how much it costs and how much it costs the economy not to have employers paying domestic violence leave.  We know how long it takes for victims to make legal arrangements and make arrangements for alternative housing, given victims are often taking children out of a very violent and abusive situation.</p> <p>  Our position in SIPTU has consistently been that five days is not enough.  We supported the Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the name of the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, back in 2019.  That Private Members&rsquo; Bill called for no less than ten paid days of domestic violence leave and we think that is about the right level to start with.  We do not think the legislation published last week by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, goes far enough, although we welcomed it in principle and we said publicly it is a positive step to introduce the principle of domestic violence paid leave.  Five days is not enough and it needs to move to ten days.</p> <p>  On the issue of proof, it is in our submission to the Minister and it has been our consistent position with regard to the requirement by employers to show some sort of proof that, first, we cannot see how that would work practically and, second and more fundamentally, in some ways it could be a barrier to women and victims getting out of the situation they are in.  What we want to do is remove all potential barriers from people moving to a safer situation.  We do not in any way support the positioning in the IBEC submission on employers requiring proof.</p> <p>  On the wider issue of the extension of leave, we have campaigned for a long time and we sincerely welcomed the introduction of paid sick leave.  Why was that?  It was because workers were going to work sick and injured because they could not afford not to.  Many of our members are extremely lowly paid and may be on the minimum wage or just above it, or hovering around the living wage, and at that level of wages, women cannot afford not to go to work and to wait the waiting period to get paid their social welfare.  We campaigned on and very much welcome the introduction of sick leave.</p> <p>  On flexible working, we have only seen the heads of the Bill.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman&rsquo;s work-life balance Bill, which transposes the directive as required, seems to indicate the introduction of a right to request flexible working.  There is a very significant difference between the right to flexible working and the right to request it.  The right to request is the right to ask for it, which, for us, infers the employer&rsquo;s right to refuse.  That is not sufficient.  What this committee is about is gender equality at the end of the day, and the levelling up of women's working lives, incomes, living standards and living experience to what men enjoy.  We know women bear the responsibility of caring to a much greater extent than men and we would welcome if that balanced out, although obviously that is currently the situation.  We know that women parents need access and need to be given the right to flexible working.  We would like to see the Deputies and Senators, as that Bill moves through the legislative process, put more emphasis on the granting of flexible working arrangements to people who require them, rather than the right to request.</p></speech>

In regard to IBEC, it is unfortunate we have to spend so much of the committee meeting speaking about some of the comments and the news reports, but it is important and that is what we are here for.  I would agree with Deputy McAuliffe, although I do not want to put words in his mouth, that there is a lot that is problematic, not just in the comments over recent days but also with respect to the opening statement today, on a broad range of issues, in particular around collective bargaining.  We have very low rates of people taking up trade union membership, which is at 500,000 at the moment, so I think the voluntaristic nature IBEC speaks about has to be put in the context that many people do not feel they have the opportunity to avail of collective bargaining in this country.  That is the pure fact of it.  I do not see any suggestion here on how IBEC intends to change that.  Just simply disagreeing with the recommendation is not very helpful to us, to be honest.</p> <p>  Why does IBEC say in its submission it welcomes the gender pay gap Bill from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  IBEC says it has been a difficult journey to get to here and it finishes up its statement by saying the employer is the only stakeholder that has to report and yet, to achieve real change, we need to see changes in the education system.  There are a lot of recommendations in regard to the education system but that is not what IBEC is here to talk about.  It is here to talk about its obligations and the obligations of businesses.  On the one hand, it is saying it welcomes the Bill and, on the other, it seems to be saying it does not seem very fair that it is the employer that has to report.  Obviously, the employer is the one who has to report on the gender pay gap because it is the one paying people.  IBEC&rsquo;s opening statement is problematic throughout.  It is almost like it is kicking and screaming about any changes we need to see in regard to inequality in the labour market.  That is my first point.</p> <p>  In regard to paid domestic violence leave, as I said on the record a couple of weeks ago, I do not believe it is in any way practical to suggest there has to be proof.  We have to remember that any legislation has to go through Cabinet and be approved by all three parties, and sometimes those things can be a barrier and a challenge.  I was delighted to see the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement yesterday that we do not believe that proof is something that is necessary or practical.</p><p>I am disappointed IBEC cannot see that also.</p><p> This is probably the fifth or tenth item on my list at this stage but I would love to hear our guests' comments on a four-day working week.  We discussed it at a previous committee and I am conscious some trade unions are trying to advance this.  Do IBEC or WorkEqual think this is something we can move to?  That is it for the moment.  I will come back in during the second round.</p></speech>

We support the gender pay gap reporting and the role employers have to play in addressing that.  There is much organisations can do and I can speak to that in a moment.  However, it would be wrong to say employers can fix the gender pay gap alone.  The reason for this that because the various causes that lead to a gender pay gap are very clear, the gender pay gap is not about pay but about the representation of women and men throughout an organisation.  The root causes of the gender pay gap are well researched and include things like the gender-segregated labour market, by which I mean the differences between the occupations and the levels within companies that men and women hold.  The roots of that lie in society and the different education and career choices that are supported and made by men and women.  This can stem right back to how children are introduced to learning opportunities, how children are socialised about what is women's work or men's work and the roles men and women often assume around caring responsibilities.  That can be consciously and unconsciously reinforced-----</p></speech>

With respect, this is not Dr. McGann's expertise.  We need to hear what employers are doing.  I am delighted Dr. McGann is saying she is supportive but it is not 100% clear from the IBEC opening statement that it is supportive of any of the measures because it always comes with an addendum like "but this is difficult" or how it is not just employers' responsibility.  Anyway, I will leave it at that.  The WorkEqual representatives have not been in and I want to hear from them.</p></speech>

I accept absolutely what the Senator is saying but I do not think it is as simple as just being the responsibility of employers.  There is a lot that employers can do and are doing in many cases.  We have many employers working on everything from their recruitment and promotion practices - for example, by looking at the language used in their advertisements, training, the removal of bias from recruitment, and performance and promotion interviews - to the level of transparency around who gets opportunities to stretch and development opportunities.  They are looking at their development practices and examining their data to determine where the problem areas within their organisations are.  That is why I mentioned that even though the gender pay gap as a reporting tool is a very useful diagnostic tool, it is only a figure from a point in time.  The decisions which brought us to that point were made by individuals, organisations and society over a long period of time.  Employers alone cannot fix it.  What employers can do is look at their gender pay gap figure and interrogate their data to understand where within their organisation the blockages or obstacles might be.  If you are in a STEM organisation in a technology industry, for example, and you are not getting the same number of men and women coming from graduate level, the problem is not just with the employer.  The employers have stepped up in that regard.  They have looked at teacher internship programmes with STEM companies where people get a paid internship to immerse them in the whole area of STEM because this is a growing area where there are higher levels of pay, growth opportunity and real demand for graduates.  As the same number of women is not coming through, they are not getting that access and therefore that is going to impact the gender pay gap down the track.  That is why I keep referring to this being a whole-of-society approach.</p> <p>  I am not taking for one second from the absolute need for employers to play a key role in this regard, but without all the other pieces in that whole-of-society approach we will not get as far as we need to get.  Our objective is gender balance and gender equality in the same way as the Senator is discussing, but how we get there is not solely within the ambit of the employer.  The employer is the only one who has to report; I accept that and it is not a problem.  However, the actual solution to it is beyond the employer alone.</p></speech>

Many of the others address cultural issues, stereotyping in education and so on.  We have had hearings on those issues.  We want to focus very much on pay and workplace conditions and on the experience and expertise each of the organisations before us brings.  I ask our guests to focus on that.  I am conscious the WorkEqual representatives have not yet got to address domestic violence leave so with the permission of colleagues I will give Ms Lennon and Ms Smith an opportunity to do so before I move to Senator Higgins.</p></speech>

It needs to be at least ten.  To ask for proof is inhuman and regressive to women's rights.  We deal with women from all walks of life and many different backgrounds.  Members would not believe some of the stories we hear.  These are the women who are left behind and we are there to try to get them back to a place where they are more confident and to a place where they want to be.</p></speech>

On the flexible working, it is one to watch out on.  As has been mentioned in this forum before, if the flexible working piece becomes a women's issue that in itself creates its own problems.  Building policies that support both men and women to work flexibly in tandem is the way to look at it.</p></speech>

I have lots of questions.  It is a point worth making that we have had this delay factor from IBEC, unfortunately, on lots of factors of progress.  I was looking at it historically and one of the things that came up is that the Federated Union of Employers opposed the granting of equal pay in principle and had to be forced to change that position through a sit-in at its headquarters.  The same arguments were being made.  The point being made at the time was that the evidence for why we could not have this progress was not being provided by the Federated Union of Employers.  The argument was that it would impact on SMEs.  It has been the same argument forever.  Is it not the case that we have mechanisms, such as the inability to pay mechanisms, if there are individual businesses that struggle or have difficulties with paying, for example, an increased minimum wage?  We already have such mechanisms and those situations are the exception rather than the rule.  When the ESRI was before us, its representatives confirmed that the evidence does not show, for example, that increases in those wage levels lead to job losses.  That is a core issue.</p> <p>  Others have spoken on the domestic violence leave, but the key point put very well by Ms Buckley was that this is something women do so they can get the capacity to leave.  Even meeting a lawyer is something people in this situation cannot do safely unless they get time and space to do so.  The leave is there for safety and giving people the opportunity to get to safety.  It is not something that comes after a process of addressing domestic violence but something that allows people to address it.  That understanding is crucial and was put very well by Ms Buckley.</p> <p>  I would like a comment on it being the case that we already have mechanisms like the inability to pay mechanism.  The voluntarism approach to collective bargaining clearly is not working.  I do not see how we could get to the recommended level of 80% using a voluntaristic approach.  The unions might comment on that.</p> <p>  I have a core concern about the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality with regard to the minimum wage, which was carefully worded.</p><p>It recommended increasing the minimum wage to align it with the living wage.  My concern is that I am seeing a rebranding of the minimum wage.  Increasing the minimum wage to the recommended amount may well align it.  For example, I have looked at 2020.  Effectively applying the living wage that year or applying 66% of the median wage would come to about the same amount but that would not be the case this year, thanks to inflation.  We need a belt-and-braces approach whereby we improve the way the minimum wage is measured so that we are applying the 66% principle.</p><p> I should point out that the Government's proposed 60% of the median wage in 2020 would have fallen far below the living wage as calculated based on the international living wage principles.  Those principles hold that should be based on what is needed to live a decent life and participate in society fully and should be measured against actual concrete measurements.  The minimum essential standard of living is based on 2,000 items that families actually need.  I am concerned that in the excitement to improve the minimum wage, which is desperately needed, we may be allowing it to be rebranded as the living wage, which is something different.  We should be able to set an adequate minimum wage according to the EU directive alongside the living wage and check it against that.  The living wage principle, internationally, is based on the actual cost of living.  If we are talking about these special measures being based on the employer's ability to pay, we also need to look at people's ability to live.  That must be factored in when we are looking at the minimum wage.  I know that is rather detailed but it is important.  I have lots more questions but I will save them for the second round.</p></speech>

I will start with the point on collective bargaining if I may because it came up previously.  On collective bargaining - and SIPTU did mention this - the high-level group report was published yesterday.  IBEC actively engaged with the unions around how we can promote collective bargaining.  As many will know, the directive that will require the promotion of collective bargaining focuses on promotion at sector level.  We already have sectoral collective bargaining mechanisms in place and as SIPTU rightly mentioned, we had the recent employment regulation order in the early years sector which is an example of those mechanisms working.  There is a collective bargaining mechanism already in place and while we are looking at the promotion of collective bargaining, we cannot support the proposal to legislate for a right to collectively bargain.  We have lots of examples where direct engagement works very well and that model needs to be respected too.  We also have examples of collective agreements that work very well.  We have a voluntarist framework that has served us very well in times of recession and economic growth.</p> <p>  I reiterate that the Government has produced a high-level report and we are looking at the promotion of collective bargaining.  We have been involved in that in the context of what is a voluntarist industrial relations framework.</p></speech>

We had cases where we had sectoral negotiations under way and the employers pulled out.  Employers should not be able to pick and choose whether to engage in sectoral discussions.</p></speech>

It does not serve them well because the voluntarist method allows certain employer bodies to completely veto collective bargaining and sectoral collective bargaining.  There is a strong correlation between the feminised industries, those industries where women tend to work - and I am concentrating my comments on women unapologetically, in the context of this being the gender equality committee - like hospitality, retail, nursing homes, care and healthcare, and a lack of collective bargaining.  There is no collective bargaining in those industries because the employer unions refuse to engage in collective bargaining.  That is what they volunteer to do.  Bodies like the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and Nursing Homes Ireland will not have any truck with engaging in collective bargaining voluntarily.  We need to understand that voluntarism serves some interests well but not those of workers.</p> <p>  We very much welcomed the report that was published yesterday and I accept Senator Higgins's earlier point that the proof of the pudding will be in the legislative measures that follow.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly mentioned trade union membership and collective bargaining earlier and I would like to comment on that.  The research, particularly some solid recent research from UCD on workers' attitudes towards trade unions, shows that workers in Ireland want trade unions.  They want to be members of, and to participate in, trade unions.  What group of workers wants unions the most?  It is women workers.  Women workers are the most positively disposed demographic to having unions in the workplace and the other most positively disposed group is young workers.  Sometimes when one reads newspapers, listens to the media or to the establishment in Ireland, one would actually think that unions were a thing of the past or that there is enough legislation or regulation in place such that workers do not need unions any more.  That is not the case and that is not how workers feel about unions.</p> <p>  The key reason for workers not unionising is fear.  It is fear of victimisation and recrimination by anti-union employers.  That is what we have to tackle in dealing with women's wages and working conditions.  Workers in Ireland, whether Irish or migrant women who come here to work, need to make the decision to join a union as freely as workers in any other European Union country.  The Republic of Ireland is a complete outlier in terms of its attitude towards unions.  Women need to be able to make a free decision and they need to know that their employer will not discriminate against them if they are in a union or active in one.  How do employers on the ground do that?  When the WhatsApp messages are sent with the working hours for a hotel, restaurant, shop or bar, the workers are just not on the list.  That is how employers do it.  They just do not give them hours any more.  There are other ways to discriminate too.  The IBEC representatives mentioned career progression.  People can be held back in their careers if management takes a certain view of them.</p> <p>  I will now move on from the collective bargaining issue to the gender pay gap issue.  As well as gender pay gap legislation, we also need transparency legislation in Ireland.  Again, the Irish solution to the Irish problem is voluntarism.</p><p>We campaigned and argued for us to have a role in the process.  That point was made in submissions from ICTU, SIPTU and other unions.  IBEC said it cannot fall only to employers.  We wanted a role.  Trade unions wanted a specified role in both the legislation and regulations on the gender pay gap in the workplace but, unfortunately, there is no role for trade unions under the regulations.  The problem with that is that all the expertise we bring in respect of how to equalise pay - we have decades of that experience - and how to negotiate better pay structures, career progression and working conditions for flexible and part-time workers will not be taken into account.  We could extend the kind of results we get in the public sector, where there is a pay gap of 6.1%, to the private sector if we were allowed to do so and if there was engagement with trade unions and we were at the table and listened to.  I ask the committee to consider that.</p><p> I also ask the committee to please consider the fact there is no specified role for worker representatives in agreeing action plans.  From December, employers with more than 250 employees will start to issue their reports.  It cannot be the case that a company is named and shamed, it is in the media for a day or two and then the matter goes away for another year.  We need to do something about the gender pay gaps that are reported.  We want to be involved in that.  We do not want it to be an employer, top-down and enforced solution.  We want workers - the people who know the employment - to be involved.  We want workplace democracy and engagement.  We would love the committee to consider that and build in a role for worker representatives in tackling the gender pay gap in the workplace and agreeing action plans with employers.  We have a very strong record of getting good results in that regard.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Taft to deal with the living wage.</p></speech>

I am a member of the Low Pay Commission, LPC, although I am not appearing today in that capacity.  Earlier this year, the LPC, in recommending its strategy for implementing a living wage, made clear that the final destination is 66% of the median wage, which is referred to as the low pay threshold.  Anybody earning below that 66% threshold is officially categorised as low paid.  As my colleague Ms Buckley pointed out, 23% of women employees are below that threshold while 17% of men are below it.  It is one in five.  The arrangement to go to 60% is merely, if you will, a way station in the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission.  The figure of 60% was chosen as the first phase of implementing a living wage because there are a considerable number of academic studies and surveys showing that raising it to 60% will have no negative impact at all.  In fact, it will have several positive benefits.  Having reached 60%, the LPC must the carry out an assessment that will, in essence, consider the capacity of the economy to afford to go to 66%.  That is what the LPC does every year in any event, so in one sense it is not different.  The next stage, therefore, will be to move to 66% within three to five years.</p> <p>  Senator Higgins raised a point in respect of the living wage technical group, which has been providing information on what a living wage should be since 2014 and is made up of civil society groups, including SIPTU.  It used the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, approach, which involves using focus groups and pricing 2,000 goods and services.  The paper published by Maynooth University that fed into the recommendations of the LPC stated the MESL approach is closest in spirt to the living wage because it involves pricing those goods and services.  However, for the sake of transparency, consistency and certainty, the LPC went with the fixed threshold approach because that means there is no argument over which goods and services are included each year and all of that.  However, the committee may wish to consider that, in endorsing that fixed threshold approach, and although 66% is usually the approximate level of the figure produced by the living wage technical group anyway, support be given to any civil society group or organisation that conducts studies on a living wage using the MESL approach or any other internationally agreed protocol.  It is important we continually monitor the fixed threshold approach as we move towards the living wage and 66% to ensure it is achieving its function rather than just being a calculation on paper.  Important support for moving towards the living wage would be provided by civil society continuing its work of assessing the living wage according to the MESL approach or any other protocol.</p></speech>

That is very helpful.  As Chair, I will ask a couple of brief questions, if I may.  We have covered domestic violence leave extensively.  I am disappointed by the tone and language of the IBEC submission, which is not reflective of the compassionate approach being taken by many employers.  That is evident from what we know of employers already offering such leave.  We have to recognise the reality that women employees in particular who go to an employer to seek such leave do so out of a place of immense courage, and that must be acknowledged.  To identify as a victim of domestic violence takes incredible courage and we should acknowledge that.  I agree with colleagues who stated that evidence or proof should not be necessary in such circumstances.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two other matters which are related.  The first relates to a form of leave we in the Labour Party sought to introduce.  Indeed, we tabled a Bill on reproductive health-related leave, which is the leave in question, in the Seanad and it received Government support.  It is similar to the domestic violence leave proposal.  It would involve an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act framework and it would provide for paid leave for employees such as women suffering early miscarriage or any employee who needs time off work for IVF or reproductive health-related reasons.  The proposal we put forward involved medical certification because it is clear this is very much a health-related matter.  We have been inundated with queries from women in particular who had to undergo early miscarriage and who currently have no specific right to time off to deal with the aftereffects of such a difficult time.  What are the views of the witnesses on that form of leave which we are proposing as an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act?</p> <p>  On the flexible work point, I am very taken with the comments of WorkEqual in respect of the need for men to take up flexible leave in greater numbers to ensure it does not become seen solely as a women's issue.  Will the witnesses comment on examples they have seen, particularly in Iceland, where there are good practice models and we can see flexible leave used in that way?</p> <p>  I have a similar question for Ms Buckley, who referred to a UCD study which showed that the take-up of flexible leave and remote working arrangements during Covid impacted adversely on women's career progression.  How do we, as the Committee on Gender Equality, address that?  I invite the representatives of WorkEqual to come in first on those points, to be followed by our guests from SIPTU.</p></speech>

It comes down to our duty of care, as a society, to foster respectful cultures in workplaces and in broader society.  If we could, we would rename the whole thing because this is about equity, not equality.  Domestic violence is a case in point in that regard as it is much more pertinent to women than it is to men, by definition.  These are structures we have to put in place to support women to progress.</p><p>With WorkEqual, we did a piece of work with a public body that showed the gender gap rate of 6.1% hides other hidden policies that work against women progressing.  Our deeper audit of the data showed that although it was a public organisation that had 50:50 gender parity from the top all the way down to the bottom of the pyramid, including the board, it concealed the fact that, because of a policy on management level requiring full-time application, all the recruitment for senior positions was external.  There was an invisible blockage to career progression within the organisation.  Looking at the gender pay gap reporting and the wider strategy to create new and more effective cultures, this is the sort of hidden data we need to uncover to see what are the landmines women are facing and what we can do about them.</p><p> I am sure the committee is aware of a case brought against New Zealand by an individual claiming equal pay for work of equal value.  This is in response to the conversation about feminised sectors and how we can begin to unpick sectors that have become feminised and how we can raise the wages in those sectors, as was done successfully in early childcare, which is fantastic.  It is about understanding the work women predominantly do, how it compares to similar work done by men, and how we as a nation can close that gap and understand the work has similar value.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.684" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ethel Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#M00200"><p>I am familiar with the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill, Organisation of Working Time (Reproductive Health Related Leave) Bill 2021, which we are supportive of in terms of the entitlement it would afford to people who have experienced a miscarriage and those undergoing various reproductive treatments, possibly even fertility treatments.  We are very supportive of that Bill, but I make the point that while it would require proof, it is in a different category from the domestic violence leave.  In that Bill we are making arrangements for people with medical conditions who are undergoing medical treatment, so there would be no difficultly acquiring or securing medical certification.  I do not want to conflate such proof with the proof required in domestic violence leave where, as previous speakers have referred to, there would be difficulties, particularly around domestic abuse and coercive control.</p> <p>  On the points I made about career progression and flexible and remote working, I would direct committee members to research by Professor John Geary, the industrial relations professor at UCD.  He found quite stark gendered results in the differential experience of men and women who were working at home during the Covid pandemic.  We all knew about it anecdotally but now we have research to show that, even in homes of heterosexual couples where there is a man and a woman at home, most of the additional work fell to the woman.  Men continued working and having meetings while women took care of children, dealt with the homeschooling, and did the cooking.  That is what I mean by intensification of work, but there is also the intensification of the actual paid work through an increase in productivity and additional monitoring by employers that are using new electronic monitoring tools.</p> <p>  The most fundamental point I was making about career progression, and there is a lot of research to show this, is that visibility in the physical workplace is very connected to career progression, especially at middle management, executive and leadership levels.  Our concern in SIPTU is that if more women took up the option for home working and flexible working, it could set back women's progression in the workplace.  If, as we believe, that is the case, we need to build in measures that ensure we tackle it.  We will need promotional and career progression processes to be mindful of the need to equalise across the staff who are present at work full time or even part time and the staff who are in the home.  There are very practical measures employers and unions can put in place to counterbalance this, but if it is not counterbalanced, we would be very concerned that what might be seen as a progressive move, and it is progressive, especially for women with young children or who have long commutes, and the opportunity to work from home some or part of the time is welcome, could on the flip side have some pretty serious and long-standing negative impacts if we are not aware of them and do not all work together to counter them.</p></speech>

For too long we have been chasing the idea that men and women can be doing caring work equally, but that is not a reality.  There are times in women's lives when they will be doing more caring than men, and they should have the opportunity to choose to do that and not be disadvantaged based on that choice.  I am delighted to hear some of those practical solutions, as mentioned by Ms Buckley, that more women might do this but it will not lead to them being disadvantaged.  That is where we need to go - to look at those opportunities.</p> <p>  A number of weeks ago, witnesses before this committee talked about women over 55 years and this being a real area of concern.  I have seen, as have my friends and people I know, that women come to a certain time in their lives where I will not say they are back caring again but they are taking the option to care for a loved one who may be older.  Let us not forget that.  We recognise the need for maternity and paternity leave but there is a much larger issue in respect of caring.</p> <p>  Bearing all this in mind, will WorkEqual, SIPTU, and IBEC comment on re-entering the labour market?  Stay-at-home parents may be out of the workplace for a significant length of time and much of the disparity in the gender pay gap comes about when such people re-enter the labour market five or ten years down the line.  What are the practical solutions the witnesses see that say people can have it all but maybe not all at the exact same time, so they choose at different times of their lives to do different things?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#M00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The whole area of returners is very important to us and we have been working with employers for quite some time on how to look at the untapped area of women who wish to return to work after caring responsibilities and others, including older workers, coming back.  The returner programme approach is key to bridge the gap with any skills area as well as the confidence areas for people who wish to return to work and pick up their career again.  It is crucial that those supports are in place.  We are doing a piece of work with the Department of Social Protection on the area of returners and with Skillnet and the education and training boards, ETBs, about putting programmes in place to provide support on the skill side and to build back confidence, because it can be difficult to return when you feel you networks have moved on or things have changed since you were last in the workplace.  Employers are taking that on board and we have seen many fantastic programmes put in place.  Skillnet has a programme called Women ReBOOT, which is specific to the tech sector.  There are some good practices we can build on and broaden across sectors.</p><p>What is key is that we have that support in place and that we ensure that people are getting back in, getting up to speed and then progressing through their careers.</p><p> In regard to the point on shared caring responsibilities, that is also key in considering men and women both as having caring responsibilities and not seeing that as an obstacle to career progression.  We know that care traditionally defaults to women and that has an impact on the gender pay gap.  It widens significantly after women have children but that imbalance could be reduced if there were greater opportunities for balancing care for men and women.  We are encouraging organisations to encourage equal uptake of family leave and the range of flexible arrangements to ensure they are not reduced to something that only female employees avail of.  We also encourage organisations to promote examples of senior colleagues who have availed of such leave to ensure it is clear that the organisation supports and welcomes that and it is not an obstacle to career progression.  </p><p> In regard to Ms Buckley&rsquo;s point about the possibility that if more women take up flexible arrangements it could work against them, we must be absolutely thorough in stamping that out.  We cannot have a two-tier situation where the &ldquo;real&rdquo; employee goes back to the office and the others stay remote.  We cannot have that.  That will require a change in how we work and training of our managers and systems.  That is necessary and appropriate to have in this new way of working.  We are seeing organisations taking that up.</p></speech>

I will share some statistics from our research.  Some 35% of people say family caring duties have impacted their career.  That is 45% of women versus 25% of men, and 33% of women with teenage children - I mentioned this - say their careers have been impacted versus 0% of men.  Among parents of pre-teens, 41% of women feel impacted compared with 10% of men.  That is stark.</p></speech>

Again, the normalisation of sharing duties is key.</p> <p>  Going back to the point about recruitment, when careers begin recruiters will say that there is a bias against women as being the child-bearing gender.  That is a fact of life, as the Senator said.  What can we do to look at the parental leave structure so that a man might be as likely as a woman to take time off?  That involves looking again to the Shangri-la of the Nordics and how they do it, which would definitely be worth considering.  I will ask Ms Smith to speak about personal experience.</p></speech>

Our ambition is to get women into work, back to work and maybe into further training to get them to where they want to be.  We find more and more of what we call the women who are left behind.  We see women aged 40-plus, between 45 and 50, whose confidence is low.  We are trying to support them to build their confidence in order that they can go for interviews.  We also find that women who get the interviews face an unconscious bias.  They are being treated differently and questioned differently when they go for interviews.  They find it increasingly difficult to get jobs.  Sometimes they might be interviewed by younger HR people who may see them as a threat.  We are not sure about this as this is all anecdotal.  We may recommend that businesses introduce mentoring and sponsorship programmes for women at all stages of their careers and business policies and procedures for recruitment to mitigate against that unconscious bias.  It is very real; it is there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GES2022100600002#N01000"><p>I will raise a new point.  It was interesting to hear in respect of the right to remote working that it would be the exception to justify a refusal of it rather than just the right to request.  Will the witnesses comment on the right to disconnect as potentially an important part that links with that?  There have been concerns about the overtime expectations that sometimes come with remote working.  I asked the IBEC representatives, who may wish to come back in again, about the point that we already have an inability-to-pay mechanism, for example, where an SME is struggling.  Do we not already have a mechanism for the exception?  We should not seek to delay progress on the general raising of the bar because of those few exceptions.</p> <p>  I will follow up on what I see as a fundamental mistake being made.  When the Low Pay Commission was founded it did not include the word &ldquo;adequacy&rdquo; in its terms of reference.  It does not have a track record of looking to the adequacy of wages.  It looks more to an appropriate market point on wages.  It would be an improvement to move to 66% of the median wage as a minimum wage.  That is the task.  If we did that, there would be a greater chance of the minimum wage aligning with the living wage.  I make the point again that the living wage is not just a nice phrase that is available to be taken.  It is an internationally established concept used in many countries and by many people in different ways and directly relates to whether people can live on it and, specifically, whether one can live a decent life and participate fully in society on it.  There are well-established mechanisms for measuring and calculating that.  We have had them in Ireland for seven years but other countries have had them for longer.  I suggest that we call the 66% idea what it is, namely, a better minimum wage, and let us have it checked against its alignment with the living wage.  It is a presumption to brand it as a living wage.  That is an important point.  We have a duty to the international movement on the living wage not to dilute what it means.  That is a concern.</p> <p>  I was going to ask about progression but it was very well addressed by WorkEqual.  We talked about changing who takes up care so that employers are not as prejudiced.  Is it not also the case that we need new mechanisms in workplaces to ensure that when people take periods of time off for care or go part-time for a period, it is not seen as stepping off the progression ladder?  Will IBEC and WorkEqual explain how important it is to ensure progression opportunities for those who have reduced hours or move to flexible working for a period of time?  They should be maintained actively on the ladder of progression.  That is not just a matter of prejudice in recruitment.  It is a matter of designing workplaces better so that we do not lose out on good people.</p></speech>

There are specific issues that affect women in their 50s, as Senator O'Reilly mentioned.  We have been trying to draw attention to and encourage the adoption of policies on menopause.  This is often conflated with what the Senator described.  Women come to a certain age or stage in their careers where their children might be reared and out of the house and it then falls to them to care for elderly parents.  That is our experience with our women members.  They raise this issue with us constantly.</p><p>It is often conflated with another change in women's lives and bodies, namely, menopause.  There is a silencing of women of that age by many parts of society, so I am glad that this issue has been raised.  We would welcome a greater focus on women of that age and the issue of menopause in the workplace.</p></speech>

Women with teenagers and so on have often spoken about being slightly better paid and slightly further up the ladder but sometimes getting pushed out by aggressive scheduling.  Union membership can help to alleviate this.</p></speech>

Leaving it at any age has a detrimental impact on pension entitlements, but women are already disadvantaged in their pension entitlements, so we do not want to add to that.  One of the ideas that we tried to popularise in our Stop67 campaign on the State pension's qualifying age was the notion that people could reduce their working hours as opposed to leaving completely.  This is an idea that we want to be taken more seriously.  We have spoken about women in their 60s.  As it is conceptualised in Ireland, retirement happens at an arbitrary date and time based on someone's birthday.  We would like to popularise the idea that people could prepare for retirement a number of years in advance, including by starting to work fewer hours.  There is a demand among workers for that on a voluntary basis.  It is progressive in terms of career advancement.  It is often the reality in workplaces that older workers are promoted workers and are sitting in promoted roles.  It can be an abrupt moment - I am sure that employers experience this as a challenge - when someone senior, experienced and qualified leaves the workplace.  If so, why do we not plan for a reduction in that person's hours if he or she wishes and prepare someone else to enter a promoted role?  There is a certain intergenerational solidarity element to this.  I am glad that we have touched on this issue for workers.</p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity that next year's referendum on Article 41 will offer everyone to have a different conversation about paid and unpaid caring work.  We in SIPTU embrace and celebrate our dual mandate in representing not only the interests of male and female workers who work in paid care, but also the interests of working people - our members' families and communities - on the issue of unpaid care.  We are preparing for that discussion.  There will be a national conversation about care work and the valuing, or undervaluing, of it.  WorkEqual has pointed to a case in New Zealand.  It involved an individual, but the trade union movement took the case.  Through taking test cases, New Zealand is showing how work that tends to be done by women is valued and remunerated differently from work that tends to be done by men.  My upbeat contribution to the conversation is that 2023 will be exciting insofar as the referendum will allow us the opportunity to consider as a country how we want to value the care work that is mainly done by women but in which we would like to see more men engaging.</p></speech>

On the point about caring responsibilities, why they fall on women and how there should be a more equal division, at the time that the extension of parental leave was being considered at European level a number of years ago, many member states were allowing leave to be transferred.  This was stopped, so men had to use it or lose it.  This showed that men were not taking up the leave, and would not do so even if we increased their statutory leave.  This raises a question as to why they are not taking parental leave and why caring responsibilities fall where they do.</p> <p>  The right to disconnect is an important issue.  We published our code of practice on the matter recently.  Disconnecting is an important health and safety issue.  Our code of practice looked not just at the obligations on employers, but also at the obligations on employees in terms of disconnecting under health and safety legislation, in particular section 13.  This is not just a working time issue, but a health and safety one as well.  The importance of disconnecting has been outlined.  In terms of employers' needs and other business needs, we do not live in a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. world anymore and employers need to meet consumer demand.  There is a good balanced framework and best practice in the code of practice.  At European level, the social partners and the European Commission are examining the idea of legislating for the right to disconnect.  It is a timely issue.</p> <p>  There is a minimum wage exemption, but the application must go to the Labour Court with the consent of the majority of workers and where the employer can show that, if it were compelled to pay that wage, doing so would result in layoffs or dismissals.  It is also only a one-off exemption.  This is a high bar for employers to meet.  We are in a time where many businesses, in particular SMEs, are facing a number of challenges.  For example, the energy costs that employers are facing have been well reported.  There have been major cost increases and many policy initiatives are coming down the road, so it is not as easy as saying that an exemption can be availed of.</p> <p>  Regarding a couple of other-----</p></speech>

Ms Buckley mentioned the fear of recrimination over joining a union.  It should be highlighted that there are strong statutory protections for employees from victimisation and discrimination.</p> <p>  I have already mentioned my next point, but it is important that I highlight it again because it arises often.  What was reported in respect of domestic violence was not an accurate reflection of what was said.  At the start of this meeting, I stressed that we highlighted in our submission to the Department the difficulties that employees face in showing proof.  We highlighted the example of coercive control.  We also highlighted what compassionate things employers were doing and continue to do.  It has been mentioned by several committee members that there are a number of companies that already have policies in place.  We note the Government's recommendation that employers reserve a right.  Employers want to comply with their legal obligation, be that a requirement for proof or not.  We are not demanding that proof be required, as has been reported.  Regardless of whether proof is required, employers still need to be told how to comply with their legal obligations.  Once a legislative framework is put around something, it is not just a matter of providing leave.  Questions arise about whether employers need to comply with GDPR and retain statutory records.  Under other legislation, not retaining a record is a criminal offence.  What do employers need to do and to get?  IBEC is very supportive of any measure that is put in place to support victims of domestic violence.  Employers just need to know what they have to do.  We are guided by the Government in that regard.</p></speech>

This is a priority.  Discrimination and bias, while they can be systemic or overt, intentional or unintentional, can also come through in organisational policies and practices that may have unintended consequences.  We absolutely need to see a change in how we do things.  I refer to getting rid of prototypes concerning what a particular role requires or what a career trajectory should look like.  Many employers are considering this and establishing focus groups with their workforce to determine how particular policies play out for various cohorts, who will have different experiences and working patterns.  It is a question of putting steps in place to make sure progression and development opportunities, and others, exist.  This is part of an organisation's role in addressing the gender pay gap.  This may very well be one of the elements that needs to be addressed, so it is a key area for us.</p></speech>

How we converse is vital.  The discourse and communication that surround every one of the recommendations are paramount.  I had a quick chat with the Chair about the composition of this very Chamber, which is 80% women.  I am delighted to have the men who comprise the remaining 20% in the room, but this has to be framed as a societal issue, not a women's issue.  This room should have a ratio of 50:50.  Deloitte did major work on covering in the workplace and how, unsurprisingly, 86% of the members of the LGBT community cover their true selves in the workplace.  The research covered 3,000 people.  It was found that 45% of white men also cover in the workplace.  Part of what they are covering is there positive motivation towards supporting women.  They feel they will be ostracised for standing up for women.  Research from Stanford shows that both men and women do not like it when men stand up for women.  It is a really thorny issue.  Part of our role in this whole process is giving men permission to be part of the solution.  Currently, I believe there is a bit of a disconnection.  Role modelling is a massive part, as we have discussed.  Policy is a massive part, but everyday behaviour, actions and words are what will really matter.</p></speech>

At recent meetings, we discovered the gender pay gap is higher among higher earners and close to zero among the lower paid workers.  The gap widens for mothers of children &ndash; really, we could say working women.  When a woman goes to work, she has to earn enough.  She is trying to earn as much as her male counterpart but also has to earn enough to pay another woman.  There is great solidarity shown in childcare because a woman will generally depend on another woman to mind her children so she can go out to work.  The idea of the village raising the child is quite an old concept.  I wonder how long the concept of the stay-at-home mother dates back, because women have always had to work.</p> <p>  I have a question on the living wage.  It is very much tied in with the gender pay gap.  The number of people who depend on having their wages topped up by the State or having exorbitant rents paid is significant.  We have socialism when it suits capitalism all the time.  In its argument on the move from the minimum wage to the living wage, IBEC said it felt that work had a capped value and that there would be job losses owing to outsourcing to other countries and so on.  However, we have had meetings here at which it was shown that this was not really the case.  We received reports to back that up.  Lately, many smaller businesses have been saying the minimum wage is causing problems with recruitment and retention.  I visited many businesses over the recess and remember somebody in SuperValu saying to me that they wanted their workers to be able to afford to shop there.  Those who work in restaurants need to have enough money to dine in restaurants every so often.  Does IBEC think it properly represents SMEs?  You could cut off your nose to spite your face sometimes in that the economy needs workers with a disposable income if the whole shebang is to keep going.</p></speech>

What we are highlighting is the impact on employers.  The costs cannot be considered in isolation from all the other costs faced by employers.  I acknowledge the comments being made but one needs to consider the cumulative cost.  The minimum wage is one thing but there are also energy costs, labour costs and a ream of statutory employment rights policies that are also coming down the road.  The latter have a huge cost impact on businesses.  We know they have a cost impact on SMEs.  Sectors such as hospitality and retail are dealing very much with these challenges</p></speech>

Dr. McGann might speak about that also.  The point we want to make is that there needs to be balance.  There are cost concerns on the employer side.</p> <p>  Let me refer to an issue I was asked about that I do not believe I addressed.  I was asked about our view on the four-day working week.  With regard to its being a flexible working arrangement, we need to examine whether the arrangement suits each role.  Many sectors do not lend themselves to four-day working weeks.  If it is granted, there is a knock-on cost, giving rise to the question of who is present on the fifth day.  There is the question of the increase in headcount.  Again, one must consider this in terms of the cumulative cost.</p></speech>

Employers have a huge role to play in this.  I believe they are very conscious of this and willing to play their part.  The gender pay gap will comprise one element but there are many others.  We are seeing great practices in respect of fertility and menopause.  Really good practices must be put in place.  We must consider how we bring people back into the workplace and also understand the data within our workplaces and where the obstacles and blocks may be, even if they are not necessarily immediately obvious.  We must determine how they play out and their impact.  It will take a concerted effort not just in the business community but also broadly.  However, there is willingness.  We are at a crucial point for all of us to pull in the same direction.  There is an opportunity in this regard.</p><p>We are at a very crucial point for all of us to pull in that direction and there is an opportunity there.</p></speech>

It is not that long since we were deifying those very feminised sectors during Covid-19. It is vital to recognise the work that is done in feminised sectors, so any movement towards improving working conditions there is very much to be welcomed.</p></speech>

The way that they have set up affordable, sustainable childcare is extraordinary.  It is the best in the world and that is why we are going to look deeper into it.</p> <p>  It is worth saying we have a series of webinars where we look at the Icelandic model of childcare and we have a fantastic contribution from Tatjana Latinovic, who has been one of the key members of our partnership.

It is not free. There is a contribution to be made by parents but it is tiered based on their circumstances.  It is different for single parents than it is for two parents living together.  As part of that series of webinars, we also interviewed Mr. Andrew Barnes, who is the founder of 4 Day Week Global.  We had a fascinating discussion around his solutions.  He claims no sector cannot adopt a four-day week and he was subject to some questioning around that.  I am not entirely convinced but certainly he makes a really good case, and some of the companies in Ireland that are adopting the four-day week on his protocol are saying the benefits are enormous.</p></speech>

First, rarely if ever will employers' organisations come to the public debate. They rarely if ever provide evidence that business cannot afford something.  They assert it and claim it but you will not find much in the way of evidence for these kind of generalised comments such as saying businesses cannot afford a wage raise or to take the minimum wage off the ground.  I urge Deputies and Senators, when they hear this, to ask where is the evidence and where is the proof.</p> <p>  Second, let us be clear about what low pay employers do, because it is not just their employees on whom they have a negative impact.  As a result of low pay, the Exchequer is not getting money as high income tax revenue and it may have to pay out subsidies.  It is a cost to all of us through the Exchequer and might be called an opportunity cost.  Had the employees been properly paid, there would have been more resources for the Exchequer to invest.  Business that rely on the domestic purchasing power of Irish workers are also as impacted because they are relying upon workers having more money in their pockets.  If they do not, the businesses do not have the turnover, which impacts on their workers, and so you get a cycle downwards.  Therefore when we talk about low pay employers, the employee is the first one impacted but every one of us, through the Exchequer, and so many other businesses lose out.  Low pay employers stay in business and make a profit essentially by imposing costs on others.</p> <p>  Finally, in terms of the minimum wage and many of the issues raised here like collective bargaining, the right to disconnect and the domestic abuse paid leave, this is about moving to a new business model.  The whole idea of raising wages is not just about ensuring workers have enough to live on, although that is extremely important.  It is also about making a statement about the type of business model we have.  We will no longer tolerate low-paid exploitative employers or a low-paid or exploitative business model.  We are going to move to a new model, and part of that new model is that business must be negotiated through collective bargaining.  Part of that new model is that workers in especially difficult circumstances have access to the support they need, whether that is being able to take a few days off with a proper income or having to get outside support.  That is the type of new business model SIPTU and the trade union movement want to see us going to.</p> <p>  It is not about talking about costs.  We would argue the benefit accruing to business and through the wider economy is much greater than any kind of imagined cost.  Certainly, it will be costly to those businesses that cannot play by the new rules.  It will be costly for them if they refuse to do so, but where businesses are willing to move to the living wage or to move in these directions and if they are having genuine difficulties, the trade union movement is always there either locally at the enterprise level or at a sectoral level to work with those employers.  We have done so in the past on many occasions.  Therefore, in terms of an economy-wide shift to a new business model, the trade union movement will be found to be an active and constructive partner in that process.  What we need is other active and constructive partners to work with.</p></speech>

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However witnesses and participants who give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does and may consider it appropriate therefore to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the directions given by the Chair and the practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to that person or entity.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I now call Lord Alderdice to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is good to join the committee today.  I was asked to reflect on my experiences leading up to the Good Friday Agreement, GFA, in about five minutes or so.  Given that I was involved in that process for about 11 years, it is a challenge that all politicians resile from.  It is much more difficult to make a short intervention than a long one but I shall do my best.<br/><br/>As a teenager I was puzzled by why my community appeared to behave in a self-destructive way.  Political science said that people acted in their own rational best self-interest, but this seemed to be contradicted by the evidence I saw around me.  To better understand harmful, non-rational community attitudes, I trained in psychoanalytical psychiatry and took those ideas into political life, becoming the leader of the Alliance Party in 1987 at the age of 32.  The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>assessment was that I was a decent chap but who would want such an impossible job?  It could have added impossible &quot;unpaid&quot; job.  I set up a group of the brightest of the &quot;young Turks&quot; in the party and in 1988 we published Governing with Consent, a document I have here, which was basically a restatement of policies of power-sharing, North-South co-operation and Northern Ireland remaining within the United Kingdom for as long as the people of the North wanted it.<br/><br/>My own commitment was to work to end the violence and the received wisdom was that the violent groups would not negotiate realistically but a compromise between the main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland would marginalise extremists, who could be dealt with by a more united community.  I engaged with the various political and civil society leaders in Northern Ireland and with Margaret Thatcher and successive British Prime Ministers, as well as Charles Haughey and those who succeeded him as Taoiseach.  John Hume was also working to develop a talks process but although we got it under way, it moved very slowly and did not stop the violence.  When we seemed particularly stuck the four Northern Ireland party leaders would meet alone without British or Irish Governments, civil servants, advisers or anyone else.<br/><br/>I remember at one such meeting John Hume said to the three of us, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re going to get anywhere without me engaging with the IRA.&quot;.  I will always remember looking at Jim Molyneaux sitting on my right.  The blood drained from his face, and he said, &ldquo;Well that&rsquo;s it, there&rsquo;s no hope then.&quot;.  I  went home downhearted that power-sharing had been dealt a mortal blow.  What could I do?  I knew John well enough to realise that he would not easily be persuaded to change his mind, so we would have to test his idea to destruction.  We could continue to argue about it politically, but we were going to have to go along with him and see what happened.  This required a fundamentally different political analysis, which went as follows.  You can have a political process without engaging with the violent groups, but you cannot have a peace process without them since you need to persuade them to give up violence.  They will not abandon their political dreams and so they need to be persuaded that the non-violent democratic political path is a better way of achieving them.  This was the road that led to the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement.<br/><br/>There is little in the agreement that had not been prefigured in Governing with Consent or any number of other documents over the years.  The difference was the understanding that the problem was not a failed political system but disturbed historical relationships between the various communities.  We identified the three key sets of relationships as being between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Britain and Ireland.  The peace process required three strands that would involve the political representatives of those three sets of relationships and the outcome was three sets of interlocking institutions, the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly, the North-South executive bodies and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.<br/><br/>The Good Friday Agreement was however a divergent agreement.  Unionists agreed to it on the basis that it was a settlement through which the IRA would give up violence in return for guaranteed nationalist participation in the government of Northern Ireland at the highest level.  Nationalists saw it as another step in a process that would lead ultimately to a united Ireland.  This divergent understanding did not need to be a problem if there was a continued focus on building the three sets of relationships, but that is not what happened.  In the talks process, I had proposed that the Northern Ireland Executive should be formed by a coalition that was required to reach 67% support in the Assembly.  In Governing with Consent we had actually said 70%.  In the talks our proposal was two thirds.  This was a way of promoting cross-community engagement.  It seemed to me that John Hume&rsquo;s proposal, which was the other main proposal of a majority of unionists, majority of nationalists and majority of the whole was doomed to deepen polarisation.  I also believed that prisoner releases should be predicated on dealing with the weapons, a demonstration of their commitment to democracy.  However, I lost the argument on both issues and both came back to bite us.<br/><br/>When the  Good Friday Agreement did not have the mechanisms to ensure the implementation of the latter issue, the British and Irish Governments put the Independent Monitoring Commission in place, and we spent seven years working, with some success, on getting rid of the weapons and the paramilitary organisations.  However, that still left the vulnerability to political polarisation unless there was a constant focus on the three sets of relationships, and that did not happen.  For years the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council did not meet at the highest levels, leading to problems on Northern Ireland, but also contributing to the Brexit problem.  A new generation of Northern Ireland politicians also failed to understand that the unionist-nationalist and North-South relationships needed to be constantly nourished through respect and engagement.  Now all three sets of relationships are in poor shape. <br/><br/>Twenty-five years on, the context has also changed.  Instead of joint EU membership facilitating British-Irish relations, the EU now backs Ireland against the post-Brexit UK.</p><p>Similarly, the United States, which has long-standing but different relationships with Britain and Ireland, is now siding with one against the other on this issue.  In addition, there are profound post-Brexit changes in political demography and all of this requires a recasting of our understanding of the three sets of relationships.  The peace process, in my view, is long over and we are now in a complex political process which requires a greater degree of commitment, effort and creativity than we have seen for some time.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

It is great to see Lord Alderdice again.  I thought he did very well to be so succinct.  I know him well enough to say being succinct would not be his strong point, but he got a lot in within five minutes.</p> <p>  At the beginning of his comments, Lord Alderdice mentioned conversations he had with Jim Molyneaux, John Hume and others.  Around that time, Jim Molyneaux described the Good Friday Agreement as the most destabilising thing that had happened in the North.  Lord Alderdice also spoke about cross-community engagement and constantly nourishing those relationships.  I think that is why, some 25 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, there are still big chunks that have not been implemented.  We still do not have a bill of rights, the civic forum or the all-Ireland civic assembly that was discussed.  The brakes have been on all-Ireland co-operation for decades.  Strand one, as Lord Alderdice is aware, is not operating at the moment but strand two has been non-operational for a lot longer, starting when unionists walked away from those arrangements.  To be honest, the only thing that there is any kind of life left in now is strand three.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about that destabilisation Jim Molyneaux talked about.  Lord Alderdice spoke about looking for cross-community engagement and the 70%-odd.   We have put that to bed; it is 50% plus one.  Does Lord Alderdice recognise now why that is so important?  There has been, to use Lord Alderdice's term, a lack of constant nourishment from unionism.  I have come through this.  I grew up throughout this process.  I sometimes feel despair.  I know we do excellent work and there are many people within civic unionism who are very pragmatic, who understand what it is like to live beside the Border and were not in favour of Brexit and of us coming out of the EU.  Those people recognise the difficulties and challenges around us sharing a landmass with 26 counties that are within the EU and us being outside of that.</p> <p>  Political unionism has failed in that constant nourishment role.  I would like to get Lord Alderdice's thoughts on that.  I presume that, 25 years ago, he would have thought, like we did, that we would have had a border poll, that we would have been further down the list of all-Ireland co-operation and we would have been able to engage at a level where it became easier and more natural.  The polarisation that he spoke about seems to have been fed to a certain extent by political unionism.  Brexit has been very damaging for everybody on the island of Ireland, whatever your background is or wherever you come from.  How does Lord Alderdice see the past 25 years?  How have they shaped up?  Would he share the assessment that there could have been a little more generosity of spirit and more working together, had we been able to do with political unionism what we have been able to do with civic unionism?  I have been there.  I have worked on committees.  I have been on the Executive.  I have worked really well with people across the political spectrum but that lack of generosity or willingness to discuss the future seems to be why we are stuck in this particular situation now, where strands one and two are de facto parked.  I hope they are only parked.  How long can we keep breathing life into those institutions?</p></speech>

She has mentioned quite a number of important things.  I may be wrong but my memory of it - and that is getting a bit more faulty as the years go on - is that Jim Molyneaux was describing the IRA ceasefire or cessation as the most destabilising thing, rather than the Good Friday Agreement itself.  I think the reason for that was, whenever the violence was going on, you kind of knew where the enemy was, in his terms.  Once that stopped, I think he realised that once republicanism moved away from depending on physical force and moved towards depending on the mandate, that did to some degree really change and eventually threaten the perspective that he would have held to in those days.</p> <p>  After 25 years, things have changed.  I will say a little about what I think has changed.  Ms Gildernew is quite right in that 25 years ago, I certainly believed that we would be a lot further along the road of collaboration with each other.  For some time, it looked pretty good when Ian Paisley of the DUP was leader and Martin McGuinness was deputy First Minister and then, subsequently, with Peter Robinson replacing Ian Paisley.  It was looking reasonably promising at that time.  I would not overstate it; there were still all sorts of problems but there was at least a degree of optimism.  Ms Gildernew, while she continues to look very young, is to some degree part of a previous generation that understood what the violence was like, how it adversely affected all sides of the community, and so on.</p> <p>  As the next generation came along and the longer there was a degree of "peace", if we use that word, the more people kind of took it for granted and second, the more the relationships diverged.  Ms Gildernew mentioned civic unionism, as distinct from political unionism.  Certainly, within political unionism, there was an increasing fear that ultimately, they were going to lose.  It was not just a question of demography being a problem for them.  I think they began to feel, and frankly, given that I have been over at the House of Lords for 25 years or more, I have seen a change in the relationship between politicians in London, on the British side if you like, and politicians in Northern Ireland.  The sense of attachment to Northern Ireland and its people and institutions is not the same as it was 25 or 30 years ago.  There are all sorts of interesting reasons for that but they are not reversible.  I do not believe that political games being played with the protocol and so on represent a real deep sense of attachment and interest, as far as politicians on this side of the water are concerned, towards Northern Ireland or unionists.  I think unionists realised that things are not going in the right direction.  You might well say, with good reason, that if unionists feel that, surely the thing to do is to make a good relationship with the people they are going to be spending the whole of the future with.  That is a completely rational position to take but one of the things that led me into my own approach to politics was a realisation that people frequently did not behave in their own rational best interests.</p> <p>  Even over the Brexit question, many of us were saying to people in the DUP, and indeed the Ulster Unionists, who did change their position, "for goodness' sake, do not vote for Brexit.  It is not in your best interests at all".  They did not listen and we know the outcome of that.  There are all sorts of ramifications from it.  The problem is that the three sets of relationships have not been attended to or nourished in the way that they could have been.  It is important also to note that people in Northern Ireland and in other places too have long memories.  They have long memories regarding historic hurts and difficulties.</p><p>Horrible things happened on all sides and it is quite difficult to let go of those.  That was one of the things we tried to do and we were making some progress on it at the start but that has stalled, as Ms Gildernew described the institutions having stalled.</p><p> It is not impossible to get some of these things back together again.  If the British and Irish Governments can find a way of working together to help, not use it against each other in some kind of political game but genuinely help, that would be most helpful because we must remember the Good Friday Agreement, and the Anglo-Irish Agreement before that, came about because the two Governments were the driving force that held things together.  Insofar as they are not doing that in strand three or in any other context, that is unhelpful and we would both probably agree it is important that the two Governments work together to try to take us forward.</p></speech>

Many mechanisms exist that could be used and they are not being capitalised on in the way they could and should be.  It is also probably useful to say that the situation has changed, as I mentioned.  The political demography has changed and the relationships have changed because the UK is not in the European Union any more.  Frankly, that means the political trajectory in the medium to long term is probably more encouraging to nationalists and republicans than to unionists and loyalists.  Unionists and loyalists feel, as they are right to feel, that the trajectory for politics in the future is less favourable to them and more favourable to colleagues like Ms Gildernew.</p></speech>

That money has been transformative in working class communities across the board, unionist and nationalist.  Brexit was a game changer for many young people.  It was the conduit through which they no longer have the same hang-ups that previous generations had and they see their future within Europe and in a unified Ireland.  Does Lord Alderdice share that view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#D00500"><p>There is truth in what Ms Gildernew says but Brexit does not stand on its own.  It also represents a change in the attitudes of people in England, and in the Conservative Party in particular, and the kinds of things that are said and done and so on.  I mentioned that people in England are increasingly divorced or separated in relationship terms from Northern Ireland.  Many people in Northern Ireland feel increasingly little identification with the current British Government and the kinds of attitudes that are seen there.  An openness to looking for other sets of relationships is evident.  I agree with Ms Gildernew.  The way we finished up in the Good Friday Agreement was that if a border poll was held and people in the North decided they wanted to be part of a united Ireland, there would not be a question of having to apply for membership of the EU.  Northern Ireland would automatically become part of a united Ireland and part of the EU.  As Ms Gildernew said earlier, that is 50% plus one.  It is not any other weighted majority.  There are other cases for weighted majorities in the formation of the executive that did not pass, as I said, but in respect of a border poll or a referendum, it should be 50% plus one.</p></speech>

I can understand that, but at the same time we want a future for the next generations.  At the event on Saturday, Karen Sethuraman spoke very well about the future and what it means for her children and grandchildren.  Does Lord Alderdice have anything he wants to say to the leaders of political unionism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#D00700"><p>First, the two Governments have a huge responsibility.  They have understandably been somewhat preoccupied with the Brexit problems which are not unrelated, but they have a fundamental responsibility for the Good Friday Agreement process.  Not that it is a question of every single item in the Good Friday Agreement being completely unchangeable as we move forward.  Some bits of it will have to change because the realities and contexts have changed, but they need to be working together on this and not fighting and feuding.</p> <p> Second, as far as political unionism is concerned, both unionism and nationalism must pay attention to the relationship between them.  Some unionists will probably leave if we move towards a united Ireland, but for those people who want to stay in Ireland, which is the overwhelming majority of both unionists and nationalists, it is about finding a way of getting on with one another.  All sides have to work pretty hard at that.  I hope political unionism in particular finds a way of addressing that in a more serious way.  It is natural for people to fight against a future they do not want to see, but sometimes that is not in their best interests.  They need to address the reality as it develops.  We all need to do that because otherwise we end up with the worst of all possible worlds rather than the best world we can create.</p></speech>

This is fascinating work because we need to realise what was achieved in the Good Friday Agreement.  Moreover, we need to get a greater understanding of how we came to that point of getting agreement across the religious divide in the final moments and, in so doing, learn the lessons from the past that might help us to move forward.  Lord Alderdice has been very helpful in that regard thus far.</p><p>Towards the end of his presentation, Lord Alderdice referred to the EU and the US backing Ireland.  I will not get into the politics of that today.  I have a different opinion.  I certainly feel the UK has been quite reckless in its approach and it has taken positions that are contrary to previous agreements it made.  It is very hard to deal with political arrangements in that context.</p><p>One of the major issues since the Good Friday Agreement relates to dealing with issues of the past and legacy issues.  Lord Alderdice touched on this<b>.  </b>How big a factor are those issues in resolving the divide in Northern Ireland?  Moreover, at the time of the Good Friday Agreement, were they on the table?  Did discussions take place on them or were they too hot to handle?  What is Lord Alderdice's memory of dealing with them at that time?</p></speech>

I am just making an observation that the relationships are different and they are not so evenly balanced.</p><p>The British Government has, in a way, made much the greatest contribution to that, although sometimes the EU, understandably, gets frustrated and digs its heels in.  However understandable that is, it is probably not the best way of dealing with the problem.  That is moving.  Some Brussels leaders, and indeed, President Macron from France have been saying things both the content and the nuance of which have been extremely thoughtful and helpful.  I hope we can move forward on that kind of basis.</p><p> The Senator mentioned the legacy of the past.  The truth is, although it was mentioned in the talks, it was not as much of a focus as perhaps it ought to have been.  In the Colombian peace agreement, for example, one of the first Bills passed in response to that was about the victims.  That is not to say that it was very good legislation or that it resolved their problems, but at least it showed where it was in their priorities.  In retrospect, the issues of the victims were mentioned, but they did not necessarily have the priority that they might have had.  That is one element of legacy.</p><p> It is not just the people who were directly harmed who are part of the legacy; it is the political and cultural remnants of that.  People look at their community, another community or other communities and they remember difficult and unpleasant things that happened for them in the past and they find it difficult to forget them.  They find it very difficult to let go of them.  When we had the Good Friday Agreement, there was at that time a degree of momentum that we felt was going to carry us forward beyond a lot of these bad, difficult feelings, because of these new relationships that were being developed.  In truth, at that time, there was a good prospect of that.  The more the momentum stalled, the more people began to feel that they were not being very well treated by each other at a political or public level and the more people went back to remembering all the difficult things that had happened.  I could even see it in the talks process where, when things were going well, people were a bit more optimistic.  When things got a bit more difficult, you could hear people say, "I knew it, they were never interested anyway", or "they were always agin us".  Once you get the momentum up again, that ought to take people beyond it.</p><p> It is not so much that the legacy of the past is one of the enormous hurdles that has to be overcome.  When you focus too much on it, it makes things worse.  The lack of momentum and progress is a symptom of the problem in the relationships.  I could see in dealing with individual people as a psychiatrist in clinical practice in the old days, or at a community level, that by focusing too much on the past, the hurt and the difficulties, you can get stuck in it.  There is not always a way out that enables you to let go.  It is a very difficult, sensitive issue.  If we make more progress on the political front and provide the kind of counselling and care for individuals they need and deserve, that holds out some possibilities.</p><p> The other final warning is one I made many years ago.  Some people say, "The generation that was damaged as victims will die and that will be it".  It will not.  One of the things we know in working with trauma is that it is a trans-generational problem.  It gets passed on.  The consequences get passed on, and the consequences that are passed on may become de-linked from what actually happened.  Where somebody shows symptoms or difficulties and they remember what happened and can speak about is one thing.  With the next generation, they sometimes do not realise why they are in the problems they are in, nor do those who are working with them.  That can be even more problematic.  We should remember, at an individual level at least, and at a community level to some extent, that there is a trans-generational component to this, which is not going to go away easily.</p></speech>

On the final point that Senator Blaney made and Lord Alderdice responded to regarding legacy issues, the British Government has united all political parties in Northern Ireland, as well as all civic groups and all public opinion in our State as well - on its absolutely deplorable proposals that step back to the worst possible days.  One would expect better from a parliamentary democracy than to come up with a system that would literally give some people the right to grant themselves immunity for horrific deeds, whether they were paramilitaries or state forces.  It is absolutely reprehensible.</p> <p>  Lord Alderdice mentioned trauma being trans- or inter-generational.  We had a very good engagement with the WAVE Trauma Centre and that was the point the made to us all regarding the second and third generations where there has been no justice.  For example, the other day Oliver McVeigh commenting on the search under way in Bragan Bog in County Monaghan for his late brother, Columba, made the point that they are not just out for vengeance but they are out to get a body restored and have a Christian burial.  Those types of comments and those people show great grace and dignity in dealing with difficult situations.</p> <p>  In every parliamentary democracy, the system has its defects and faults - our own does too.  Since the Brexit debate started, even before the referendum in 2016, both Houses of the Oireachtas and all of the committees devoted enormous time to working on the Brexit issue.  We had engagement every day of the week with parliamentarians from Britain and other countries in Europe who wanted to hear our viewpoints on Brexit and the difficulties it would cause if Britain exited the EU.  Our parliamentary democracy, including the D&aacute;il and Seanad, worked well in that respect in support of the Government.  In that debate, there was never antagonism from the Irish side towards the British side.  We were outlining our concerns very cogently and quite rightly and those concerns have come to pass.  It is very important in that respect.  Of course, many parliamentarians from Westminster shared the same view as us.</p> <p>  Ms Gildernew mentioned the lack of a civic forum.  That was within the competence of Stormont, to my recollection.  I recall speaking to some of the people who participated in the short-lived one, from trade unions and other civic bodies, who found the workings of it very beneficial.  It is a shame it has not been re-established in a different format to give civic society additional voices apart from the political representation they have.</p> <p>  With regard to winning support for the political institutions and politics in general, is a greater focus needed from both Stormont and Westminster on trying to improve the lot of many people in the disadvantaged communities.  If we are to put an end to all types of violence, we need to ensure that people have the opportunity to get a good education, training and skills and go on to gain full employment.  That is the best way to engage people in a democracy and in the political process.  I thank Lord Alderdice.</p></speech>

It is important to realise, as far as engagement with institutions in the United Kingdom, particularly at Westminster, goes, that it is a deeply divided country and it is deeply divided on the issue of Europe.  It has been for years.  When you are engaging with those parliamentarians who wish to engage on this question - there were quite a lot who did not want to engage - you probably find yourself engaging with people who are of a relatively similar disposition.  One of the problems in Northern Ireland over many years is a deeply divided community and getting everybody to engage is really quite challenging and difficult.  In Ireland, as a whole, an overwhelming majority of people want to remain within the EU.  That was not the case in England or Wales.  That was the case in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  The divisions this has opened up are deep, profound, historical, cultural and political.  What has happened is tragic, but it is important to understand that you are dealing with a different thing when you are dealing with the United Kingdom, which is so divided on the issue, than dealing with it in Ireland, where there is, if not unanimity, then overwhelming support for the particular issue the Deputy is describing.</p><p>Finding ways of engaging is difficult.</p><p> On the question of the importance of socioeconomic benefits and development and so on, of course there is a moral imperative to do this as well as a general socioeconomic and political imperative to do it.  However, that will not solve the problem.  People have deep senses of identity and allegiance that are not resolved or dealt with.  I remember we did some work, for example, with people in the Palestinian authority.  We told them they would not get the right of return but they would get money and asked how they felt about that.  They were very angry.  Then we told them they would not get the right of return but they would get a shedload of money and asked them what they thought.  They expressed even greater anger.  This is because the suggestion is that people's principles, their fundamental identity, allegiance and convictions, are purchasable, and that does not win people around.  It only makes them angry.  The issue was not just to pile loads of money into west Belfast.  That was done by the Thatcher Government.  It did not make any positive difference to the politics at all, nor could it have been expected to because people there had some fundamental identifications and allegiances which they were not going to allow to be bought off.  Sometimes the things that would potentially work in a peaceful, stable society where it was largely based on socioeconomic issues may not necessarily bring the results we want to see on the politically divisive issues of identity and allegiance.  We have to work in other ways to try to achieve this.  Can it be done?  Yes, of course it can be done.  Is it easy?  No, it is not easy at all.</p><p> When we come to the question of whether the British Government is more to blame than the Irish Government, there is a danger we get into the sort of blame game I remember listening to in Northern Ireland for a long time and it did not get us terribly far.  We have to say the relationship is not very good, whoever is making whatever contribution to it, and let us find a way of getting beyond that.  I am not too pessimistic about that in the medium term.  We are going through difficult stages but I can begin to see we are moving to a potentially better place.  On whether the new British Prime Minister will achieve that, she has a peace process to engage in within the Conservative Party before she engages in one with everybody else, but that may not be a long-term issue.</p></speech>

The first one relates to reconciliation and building a shared future.  There is a school of thought that says the Good Friday Agreement almost froze the divisions in Northern Ireland regarding conflict management, but at the time the agreement was formulated there were a lot of aspirations and hopes that we would see an evolution in that respect.  Does Lord Alderdice feel it is a glass half-full or half-empty in that regard?</p> <p>  The second question relates to reform, probably in a similar light.  A particular set of structures were put in place that perhaps fitted people's world view of how Northern Ireland was constituted back in 1998 but, as Lord Alderdice appreciates, demographics and electoral fortunes have changed quite substantially since then.  To what extent does Lord Alderdice feel the institutions need to be modified to reflect those changes and to take into account some of the experiences of blockages and vetoes over the past 25 years?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.765" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#F00400"><p>The questions are very much related to each other, as Dr. Farry says.  We have to be a little careful about our expectations of reconciliation because, in truth, that is about how people feel about each other and engage with each other.  I am pretty cautious about the expectations of reconciliation if we understand that in a powerful and fundamental way as distinct from simply accepting we have to live together in a community that may have diverse perspectives in it.</p> <p>  When it comes to reform, we are in an easier place to speak about it - maybe not easier to deliver, but an easier place to speak about it.  As Dr. Farry might recall, in the governing with consent document, we took the view that the best way of getting agreement on the formation of the Executive was a weighted majority.  In that document it was 70%.  When it came to the talks process, I pushed very hard to get a weighted majority of 67% because I felt that would ensure you had to get cross-community support.  No one community could get 67%, so cross-community support was necessary. What it would do would be to encourage politicians on one side of the community, as we used to talk about, to try to win the support of people on the other side of the community.</p> <p>  The problem I could see with the proposition John Hume was very wedded to of a majority of unionists, a majority of nationalists, and a majority of the whole was that it encouraged party leaders on one side of the community to appeal to the people on their own side and leaders on the other side of the community to appeal to people on their side.  Although John wanted to see things coming together and, frankly, I think, could not foresee a situation where the SDLP was not the largest nationalist party and the Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, was not the largest unionist party, there was in fact a dynamic built into that which was polarising in its nature.  That is why I did not want to go down that particular road.  I well remember, and I do not believe this has been a matter of public record before, a conversation with David Trimble after he had decided to go along with John's proposal where he was somewhat in two minds as to whether it was the best way forward.  I suspect he and John thought theirs would be the two largest parties and they could probably divvy up the Alliance Party vote between them.  What actually happened was something quite radically different.  Given the new situation we are in, a radically different position in terms of support for the Alliance Party, the SDLP and the UUP, returning to the kind of proposition - not every item of it - we had been making for a long time of a weighted majority as the best way of reaching across the community divide in the establishment of an Executive is something people ought to be getting back to looking at again 25 years later.  I do not believe the Good Friday Agreement is the law of the Medes and Persians.  It needs to evolve and change as the situation changes if it is going to remain a worthwhile way forward, not just in terms of reform but in the longer term, we fervently hope, in respect of the reconciliation to which Dr. Farry referred in the first part of his comment.</p></speech>

It has been powerful listening to him.  Many of the questions have been covered and he has answered them brilliantly, might I add.  I only had one question.  It is about the drafting of the Good Friday Agreement and the whole area of the criteria for how the Secretary of State can call a border poll at any time and we do not know what the criteria are.  I want to get a bit of an understanding of what the thinking was behind that.  That is my only question for Lord Alderdice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.767" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#F00700"><p>I thank the Senator for her comments and for her question, which is in a sense a more topical question than it was 25 years ago.  At the time of the Good Friday Agreement, nobody was under any illusions as to what the situation would have been had there been a border poll.  The overwhelming majority of people would have voted to stay in the UK with better relations with the Republic of Ireland institutionalised through the Good Friday Agreement and so on.  It is a very different situation altogether 25 years on.  It is becoming an increasingly difficult and more complicated one for a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  Does a Secretary of State look at opinion polls over a period of time?  Does a Secretary of State look at the support for political parties or for the number of MLAs in a new assembly after an election?  It is not an easy one.</p> <p>  I remember talking to a friend a few years ago who was a strong supporter of the SDLP.</p><p>We were talking about how the situation was and I joked with her and said, "Well, you are going to get what you want".  When she asked what I was talking about, I said, "You are going to get a united Ireland; I do not know exactly when, but that is the direction things are going in quite clearly".  When she said she did not want a united Ireland, I asked her to wait a minute because she had always told me that she voted for the SDLP.  She said "Oh yes, but I don't actually want a united Ireland", and I replied, "I'm sorry, but you're going to end up getting it because that's what you voted for".  I think we have to recognise when we count up the votes that go to political parties that there may not be exactly the same support for some of the parties' leading policies in a referendum that there appears to be if you just count up their votes.  It is a bit of a complicated one.  My view is that the Secretary of State, whoever it happens to be, should not put themselves in a position where they appear to be, as is the case in Scotland at the moment, resisting a border poll.  I think they should make it clear that they are open to it.  As it becomes clearer that that is the trajectory, they should sit down to talk to people about it and try to get a bit of a sense of the situation.  Everybody then will need to be careful that they might get what they asked for, and that they might not necessarily want it.  Rather than a simple formula, I think it is a bit more complex than that.  It is an important decision for the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State and the British Government should not allow themselves to get into a position where they look as though they are resisting it for any reason other than that manifestly there is no support for it and that is an obvious thing.  </p><p> The position on Scotland is a difficult one because there has already been a referendum, and you cannot have a referendum every ten minutes.  The British Government looks as though it is standing in the way of it.  I do not think that is a good place for it to be.  I do not think that would be in the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

I welcome his commentary.  Some of the speakers we have had before us seemed to say there was an implicit agreement that the Irish Government would have to be consulted on the decision of the Secretary of State in Britain on that issue.  They suggested that it was implicit that it would have to be done with the consent of both Governments even though this is not actually stated in the agreement.  I do not know if Lord Alderdice has a view on that.  Does he agree that it will not be a case of one person looking into his or her heart, like de Valera would have in the past, but instead it will be a case of the two Governments reaching a consensus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.771" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#G00400"><p>I agree, although it may be a more complicated thing than it first appears.  I remember at one time in the talks process, when things were at a bit of a difficult stage, a rather senior Irish civil servant whom I will not name or identify told me he had been thinking that in the event of a united Ireland, some of these DUP fellows might be minister of agriculture or something like that.  When I said that was absolutely right, he said he was going off the notion.  You have found a way of getting on reasonably well with yourselves south of the Border, but you should not assume that if Northerners come in it will be all peace and pleasantness.  I think it would be a bit difficult.  There are some people who would have questions about that.  Having said that, of course there should be consultation.  There should be consultation between the two Governments all the time on all the issues.  Certainly, a major thing like the decision to have a border poll is not something that should be done without consultation with the Irish Government.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.774" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#G00700"><p>That is a key point there.  Lord Alderdice made a very important comment earlier when he spoke about the implications of Brexit.  I am not quoting Lord Alderdice verbatim, but he said that there is less of an interest in what happens here in Britain.  He referred to a change in the way they look at the relationships.  That gives those of us who believe in a united Ireland a chance to put our proposition in detail to the unionist community.  As Lord Alderdice has said, people in that community feel that they would less favourably treated and therefore look less favourably on a united Ireland or a new configuration of relationships on this island.  The key point to me is not getting a border poll or a majority of one; it is getting a significant consensus in favour of it based on - this is the key point - the absolute need to reassure the unionist community of all their rights into the future, including the right to remain British always and to choose their Britishness if that is what they want.  Equally, the nationalists will have their right to choose their Irish identity.  That is the key to it.  The point about Britain is that if we can reach a consensus on this island, Britain will not have a problem with that.  In other words, it will no longer have any other interest in it other than trying to extract itself from this historic problem.  I do not know if that makes sense to Lord Alderdice.</p></speech>

It was one of a number of important pieces of political progress that were brought about by John Hume with the language he developed.  The point he repeatedly made in public and in private was that it was not about uniting territory; it was about bringing people together.  It was about uniting people.  In a way, we have sort of slipped back a bit from that into talking about borders, polls, territory, institutions and all those kinds of things.  All of those things are important, but fundamentally it is about how you bring people to have a relationship with each other.  John Hume repeatedly spoke about that, absolutely rightly.  It had a positive influence on how people thought about these things.  It is not about a united Ireland in terms of the territory; it is about how you bring the people who live on the island of Ireland to a place where they can have a shared view of what the future should look like.  That is the key thing.  John Hume emphasised that.  I remember that when he was talking about his talks with the IRA, he said he had asked them what they wanted, and they had said they wanted a united Ireland.  When he told them to look at the map and see that it is one island, they said "Yes, yes, yes but there is a Border".  He made the point to them that what the Border tells us is that the people who live on the island cannot agree how to share it, so we have to get agreement on how to share it.  That is what the Good Friday Agreement was about.  That sharing bit - that relationship bit of the people or peoples - is the key thing.  We should not let go of that.  We should not forget about that.</p></speech>

I think that is the key issue.  It is up to all of us to put the proposition out there.  The difficulty, obviously, is to get unionists to engage with that, or even to talk in a formal or informal way about it.  One of the points that has been put to me - I think Senator Blaney touched on it - relates to trying to find something we can all agree on.  For example, can we advance a proposition on which unionists and nationalists on the whole island, North and South, can agree and which will improve health services for everybody?  Can we build a new internationally renowned university, a third level institution that everybody can sign up to, in the north west?  Can we improve our transport connectivity?  I suppose it goes back to the shared island concept.  Those of us in government in the South are putting in a significant amount of money to show the good faith we have in this regard, and we would put a lot more in.  To me, that is the way you will get a new island - a new relationship that will not result in the equivalent of an IRA campaign on the extreme unionist side.  If you force people into a united Ireland by a majority of one, or even a majority of 2,000 or 3,000, you are going to face generations of hostility and division.  Notwithstanding the majority of one, there must be a meeting of minds.  That is my opinion on it.</p></speech>

In the talks process, one of the challenges I faced was to find a way of talking about North-South collaboration that did not make unionists immediately antagonistic.  It struck me that the Foyle Fisheries Commission was a very interesting model.  It was a very small model but very interesting.  The fish in the Foyle did not respect the Border; they just swam about the place.  That is why, North and South, an executive body had to be established which reported to the Governments North and South.  It went on for a long time.  Because that collaboration happened and because it worked, it was possible to say to unionists that having a North-South body is not a betrayal of your history or your background because previous unionists did that when they had Stormont.  If you couch North-South collaboration in terms of being a way to seduce unionists away from their adherence to Britain, I think you will get a kickback.</p><p>However, if you say we are about building good relationships and collaborating together on things that make social and economic sense, there is a much better possibility of collaboration and the future will take care of itself.  If people feel they are being engineered into something, there is a bit of a Protestant northern culture that tends to dig its heels in and be a bit stubborn about things.</p></speech>

I was not going to pick up on this point but, in the previous conversation and in this committee, we have discussed much about constitutional change in the future and what shape that may take.  There has also been a focus on citizens' assemblies.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been a strong advocate of putting pressure on the Government to establish citizens' assemblies in order that we can have a debate and conversation on future constitutional change.  It is far to say that almost 25 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, there is considerable interaction and discussion to this day about a potential border poll and what shape a new Ireland may take.  We only have to look at the recent Ireland's Future event, which more than 5,000 people attended, to have those discussions and debates.  Does Lord Alderdice think a citizens' assembly would be good with regard to trying to have that debate and conversation and trying to include those from a unionist background.</p></speech>

It is a real shame it did not continue.  The civic forum was in place when I was speaker and I engaged with its chairman.  It could have developed more momentum.  By sitting in the Senate Chamber in Stormont and bringing about an approach that was energetic, committed and proactive, it could have survived longer.  I very much hope that is an element of the Good Friday Agreement that could be returned to because it is very important to have other ways into government discussion rather than merely through elected representatives, not that they are not absolutely key.</p> <p>  With regard to citizens' assemblies, it is always positive to try to get people involved in the discussion.  However, if it is simply people who already largely agree on what the outcome might be, in a case such as the question of a united Ireland, and if the only people who come along to participate, in an energetic way and in any sort of numbers, are those who are already convinced that is what they want, I am not sure it achieves what citizens' assemblies are meant to achieve, that is, to bring together people with different perspectives and to try to find a way of reaching agreement beyond political partisanship.</p> <p>  If it simply represents the views of people who already agree with each other and the others do not want to or do not come along, I have no objection to it but I am not sure that it fulfils things as fruitfully as one might hope would be the case.  However, if it becomes possible to have significant numbers and representation from those who take a different perspective, then something may well be able to come from it.  The perquisite is that there are people who differ from each other and are prepared to disagree without damaging each other.</p></speech>

If we were to use that approach, it may help or encourage those from a unionist background to be involved in the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.783" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#H00600"><p>I find it difficult to be definitive about that.  The fact that the British Government wants something does not mean that unionists will go along with it .  It is very important to understand that.  The relationship between nationalists and republicans and the Government on the one hand and the relationship between unionists and loyalists and the British Government on the other is completely different.  Loyalists and unionists know in their hearts that the British Government, in the end, would not be too sorry to be rid of the problem.  Thus, they do not have the same kind of element of trust in or accept guidance from that government.  They are not two sides that are mirror images of each other.</p> <p>  I would be cautious about getting two governments involved in something such as this, as distinct from the political thing.  They are political institutions and need to be the driver of the political dimension.  Getting governments involved with civil society may be the way forward or it may be better to try to use some elements of civil society, such as getting the universities, churches and trade unions, North and South, and civil society representation to say something about how to create this kind of civil society assembly.  It might have a better chance of becoming acceptable.</p> <p>  The two governments need to drive the political dimension of things but I think Ms Begley is talking about trying to take it out of partisan politics and knee-jerk reactions to the other side and into a more fruitful debate.  This would be good in principle.  I am bit agnostic as to what is the best way of achieving a good outcome in that.</p></speech>

When the Good Friday Agreement was being devised 25 years ago, it was with the interpretation that there would be equal rights throughout this Ireland but, unfortunately, we have seen a diminution of rights over time.  I look towards the British Government as being the key anchor in that.  We have not seen the implementation of a Bill of rights.  What is Lord Alderdice's opinion on where we sit at present?  We do not have those protections, especially in the North.  Some of the other regions have equality Acts and we, unfortunately, do not.  If the Human Rights Act 1998 was to be repealed, that would be very worrying for the people living in the north of this island.  What role does Lord Alderdice see with regard to the Government stepping up to the plate in ensuring there is a bill of rights for the North.  What does he see as the British Government's role there?</p></speech>

There is a clear conflict within the Westminster system.  I am a Liberal Democrat and the party of which I am part is very strongly opposed to the current British Government approach on this question.  Ms Begley will find that is also true of the Labour Party and, indeed, of some Conservatives.  However, getting into a fight between the British and Irish Governments over this will not be very helpful.  A thoughtful engagement and trying to persuade people that this is very important internationally, as well as domestically, is a priority.  Regardless of the longer-term political future, this is a priority and engaging people in the conversation to make that happen is the thing to do.</p> <p>  I cannot say what will happen in Westminster.  It is a very febrile and unpredictable place at present, as Ms Begley probably knows, but there are many people there who are deeply unhappy about the approach that is being taken and the fact that things that were promised have not been delivered and things that were not promised have come into play.  It is a difficult one.  There is no easy answer.</p> <p>  Should the Government engage with the British Government in a constructive way?  Of course it should.  The two governments working together is critical to all of this, but it is about working together to achieve it and that is a challenge.  As somebody said about two horses that were ploughing - one horse was willing to work and the other was willing to let it.  That is the problem.  Getting two people who are in a harness together, want to go the same direction and have the same energy is one thing, but one horse being willing and the other horse willing to let it work is another.  That is kind of what we have at present.  Many of us will try to do our best at Westminster to try to change attitudes and we have to work together on it.  There is no magic or easy answer to that one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.786" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mickey Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#H00900"><p>I thank Lord Alderdice for the presentation.  It was very interesting and he has covered many points.  As Ms Begley said, many parts of the Good Friday Agreement have simply not been implemented.</p><p>Recently, there has been a lot of talk about revising the Good Friday Agreement, and that is without implementing the original.  If we follow on from the Bill of Rights, which has been implemented, St. Andrews and Acht na Gaeilge and other language Acts that have been put on the long finger, it seems to me that there is an unwillingness to carry on by both Governments who are joint guarantors, as was mentioned.  </p><p> It was interesting to listen to the description of the friend who voted for the SDLP but did not want a united Ireland.  I was around when the SDLP was formed.  It was my understanding at that time the reunification of this country was way down its list of priorities.  Maybe he was voting for the right party, as far as he was concerned, at a particular time.  That is only a personal observation.</p><p> In terms of the Good Friday Agreement and what has not been implemented, legacy was not a big issue at the time because it was so contentious.  Lord Alderdice is a Member of the House of Lords, and I presume the legacy Bill will come before the committee.  Has he picked up any insider knowledge on how that might be addressed?  The Parliament can overrule that, as it can with the protocol Bill.  A lot of things go through Parliament that, in the long term, will not be very conducive to those of us in the North.  </p><p> When I was in Stormont in 2007 and welfare cuts were being introduced, I was invited to speak at a church in east Belfast about the cuts and how they would impact on communities.  What struck me at the time, which pertains to the current cost of living crisis, was that the community I represented in nationalist republican areas would be as badly off as loyalist communities in east Belfast.  At the time that was accepted.  There was a lot of talk about going forward together in dealing with this.  Unfortunately, the flag protest came along very shortly afterwards and skewed the whole thing.  I will continue to make the point that both communities have a lot more in common than is sometimes realised, particularly in terms of day-to-day living.  A single parent with kids is not particularly bothered about the politics of what is happening; they are struggling on a day-to-day basis.  That is now becoming more relevant with the cost-of-living crisis. </p><p> I deal with a lot of people from the unionist community on a daily basis in my constituency clinic.  If one is an abstentionist, as I am, one spends a fair amount of time in a constituency dealing with constituents.  I deal with issues around loyalism, unionism and people from our community.  When people sit down to think about it, we are the only ones who want each other.  I am sure the lack of interest in Westminster in the Six Counties is also apparent to others.  We lobby all parties, the Liberal Democrats, Labour and Conservative.  The lack of knowledge they have about and interest in the Six Counties is evident.  They really do not want us.  </p><p> At some stage we need to sit down and talk.  There has been a lot of talk about a united Ireland concept.  It is as if we want to be bolted on to the Twenty-six Counties in the morning as things stand, and God forbid as far as I am concerned.  What we need to do is sit down and talk about a new and inclusive Ireland, how it will impact on our loyalist, unionist, nationalist and republican communities and how that affects people in the South.  People want a proper health service which is free at the point of access, an integrated education system and to know how their quality of life will be improved.  We need to get that message across and that is why we need to sit down and talk.</p><p> Lord Alderdice is not too keen on a citizens' assembly, but it may be a way to proceed.  Trade unionism in Ireland is an all-Ireland movement.  There are all-Ireland bodies which can sit down and contribute.  What are his views on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.788" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Lord Alderdice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2022100600002#J00200"><p>I thank Mr. Brady.  There are parts of the Good Friday Agreement that have not been implemented and parts that were implemented and then abandoned, like the civic forum..  A civic form existed for a while and was effectively abandoned.  There is no reason it should not be brought back at any stage.  There is no law against it; on the contrary.</p> <p>  Changes were made, such as in St. Andrews.  I do not think we are very good at change, but changes were made to accommodate short-term political advantages or problems for people.  That is rarely a good way of sorting out constitutional arrangements.  Mr. Brady is correct.  There have been changes that were not very good, a failure to implement parts and parts that were implemented and then abandoned.  Too many people forget that.  It is a complicated history.  The key thing is to use the 25th anniversary to take us forward to something that is better.</p> <p>  Mr. Brady made a comment that sparked something in my mind.  I spoke to a colleague from what was, in the old days, East Germany, many years ago when both of us were involved in church youth activities.  He was of a very different political persuasion to me and was quite supportive of the regime in East Germany at that time.  The point he made to me was that when German unification took place, it was the absorption of the east into the west German constitution.  They had no say in the constitution, flag, national anthem or any of those aspects.  East Germany was simply absorbed and told we will do this, this and this.  He said he felt for himself and others there was an abiding resentment caused by that.  </p> <p>  There is an interesting question that might come out of Mr. Brady's comments, namely if it became possible to say that we are not talking about absorption of the North into the South but rather the creation of a new Ireland that all of us live with.  As Mr. Brady said, the living with it is not just a question of identity, although I do not think we can understate that and his party would certainly be pretty strong about a sense of identity, as others might be of theirs.  He mentioned many important aspects, such as health, education, transport and agriculture.  Talking about those kind of things could be a very helpful way of moving forward and one which people might well find more agreement on that they might imagine.  </p> <p>  I found in the talks process that when we started talking about matters of high principle, we inevitably ended up with division.  When we started talking about matters of practical concern, we often found that there was a greater identity of interest.  There is mileage in what Mr. Brady said.  Exactly how we do it is the issue.  I suppose we have to do it carefully, and not be put off if not everybody signs up for it in the first instance.  There are interesting thoughts in what he said and it merits further conversation.  I know his party and others are currently trying to explore some of these questions, and I would encourage that.</p></speech>

Mr. Brady and Lord Alderdice hit the nail on the head in terms of discussing the issues of the day, such as education and the health service.  That is why the work of the shared island unit, led by the Taoiseach, is critically important.  That is not recognised by all across the political spectrum or given the credence I feel it should be.  What is happening is the necessary preparation if we are going to sit down and talk about our shared future.  We need to know the differences in the education systems and health services North and South.  People in Northern Ireland hold dearly the current concept of their health service in Northern Ireland.  We need to compare outcomes.</p> <p>  The economy, farming and agriculture were also mentioned.  The work of the shared island unit is about getting an understanding of the differences, which is vital preparation.  If the protocol is off the table, we hope that one day we will get a UK Government that has a more open approach and will sit down and take an interest in and discuss these issues.</p> <p>  The one organisation across these islands that is getting quite a bit of focus at the moment is Ireland's Future.  The organisation has come before the committee and I have been critical of it because I feel the work it is doing could be more fruitful if it merged some of the work with the shared island unit.</p><p>The shared dialogue series is the only vehicle that is going into unionist communities.  The more organisations such as Ireland's Future keep talking up a united Ireland, the greater the possibility that we push unionists further away.  That is the fear I have.  I am not sure what people expect the outcome to be when we speak at unionists rather than sit down with them.  I am not just saying this for myself.  I hear strong views when I meet unionist politicians and the community throughout Northern Ireland.  I also hear it from some nationalists.  What is the opinion of Lord Alderdice on the work of the shared island unit and organisations such as Ireland's Future?  Could they play a greater role?  If so, what does he think this role could and should be?</p></speech>

The first thing I want to pick up on is the contribution of the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and not just in terms of structures and proposals.  The tone he has taken has been very helpful.  It is a thoughtful nuanced tone and sometimes quite courageously so.  As is the case with many of these things, it does not always get the positive response that it deserves.  He has tried and is trying and I hope he will continue to try to move along the line that he has taken.<br/><br/>In terms of collaboration, there is a lot that could be done to address the practical difficulties that exist.  When I was involved as a psychotherapist it was clear that we needed to work together North and South to develop psychotherapy services.  This was because we did not have enough people with the qualifications and experience either in the North or the South on its own.  I set up the Irish Forum for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy which still exists and continues to work.  I did not always find it that easy to get colleagues from the North to come with me to Dublin.  It seemed to be a shorter route from Dublin to Belfast than it was from Belfast to Dublin.  At any rate it was important.<br/><br/>I then began to explore co-operation in psychiatry and medicine generally and in areas such as policing.  I wanted to see whether we could arrange for people to do stints in the corresponding organisation on the other side of the Border, such as young doctors doing part of their training in the North or the South and police officers going North and South.  I began to run into all sorts of practical difficulties.  Some of these may have been excuses but I do not think they all were.  There were issues such as pensions.  If people took two years out of their pension scheme in the North, were they disadvantaged?  It was the same <i>vice versa</i>for people who went from the South to the North.  If we start to explore these types of practical questions, we might begin to make things happen that would then not be a problem down the line because they would have already been sorted.  This could be the case if we could practically co-operate even more than we do already on healthcare North and South.  Particularly in areas of high specialism we need the population of the entire island to make a service viable and this has happened.<br/><br/>If we work on these practical issues people will begin to see it happening, such as when Drew Harris came down to take up a position in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This was a very positive message to unionists in the North that there is an openness to working together North and South on policing.  This has not always been the easiest thing to work on in either direction.  There are practical things that can be done that may well help people to get over some of their anxieties and resolve some very real constitutional, practical and economic issues such as pensions.  We can ask how this could be an issue.  It is because we have different systems North and South.  If we work on these, we might be able to make quite useful progress that would mitigate some of the practical anxieties people have.<br/><br/>From speaking to a number of people in the unionist community in recent times, I know a big concern they have is not whether they will be oppressed on whether Protestant churches would be closed, it is about losing the health service.  The health service is anything but ideal.  It is anything but perfect.  It is not as good as it was, frankly, ten or 15 years ago.  Nevertheless people have confidence in it.  This could be a key issue for many people if there were a border poll.  If people want a border poll to go in a particular way, they may need to work on the issue of healthcare North and South to get the answer they want.</p></speech>

As Lord Alderdice said, we have a small population on our island of 7 million people.  There are some services that are very difficult to deliver in a scattered method.  On the point made by the Cathaoirleach and Senator Blaney regarding the shared island unit, earlier Lord Alderdice mentioned it would be a helpful way of moving forward a number of issues.  This day last week, I was at an event in Cavan where An Taoiseach announced 25 projects that were being funded through the local authorities to develop further proposals for large-scale infrastructural investment in tourism, climate action and a range of activities.  Significantly, 23 of our local authorities are involved in these projects.  Every local authority in Northern Ireland is involved, as are local authorities down from as far away as Cork and Kerry.  It is great to see it.  There are joint proposals for North-South projects and all-Ireland projects.  There were people attending who hold the position of chair or cathaoirleach of various councils North and South.  Regardless of their political viewpoint, there was an extremely warm welcome for these proposals.  Many of them are projects we have spoken about North and South over the years but they have never been funded or progressed.  From that point of view, it is a practical way of building communities across the Border.</p> <p>  The shared island unit has issued invitations to attend a dialogue series next week in Belfast.  There is an event at Queens University Belfast on culture and arts and the challenges and opportunities for all of our island.  There is another event in the Titanic Quarter, with a joint initiative by the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach and the ESRI comparing the education and training systems North and South.  This is doing effective work that can put better systems in place to benefit people of both communities regardless of what viewpoint they hold or what political tradition they come from.  That is very important.</p> <p>  I heard An Taoiseach say in the D&aacute;il at Question Time on Tuesday that more than 3,000 people have partaken in the dialogue series.  This is really getting civic engagement.  People go along to events on a subject matter in which they have a particular interest.  This is the type of engagement that will take place in Belfast next week at two different events.  That is welcome.  We are speaking about all-Ireland forums.  It would be very beneficial if the civic forum constituted in Stormont many years ago were reconstituted.  It is always important that we have as much local engagement from a civic point of view as is possible.</p></speech>

I have attended many of the shared island events.  I have enjoyed them.  At the end of the day, I am not sure what is coming out of them.  Will there be recommendations?  The shared island process is welcome but it is at a very different level from where a citizens' assembly would be.  When we see the very positive dialogue happening at shared island events I cannot understand why parties are setting their face against a citizens' assembly that could examine in depth what the Irish health service or education system would look like after unity and all of the issues we have spoken about, including policing and justice.  There are many areas of co-operation that we will need to develop further.  I am not sure there is enough meat in the shared island debates or the recommendations coming out of them.</p><p>We always welcome dialogue wherever it is and whatever level it is at but we need to see something tangible coming out of it so people can actually see what different areas of life that are so important to all of us would look like on the other side of a unity poll.  </p></speech>

Regarding the terminology she used - shared island and sometimes North-South - people from a unionist perspective do not come out in goose bumps when they hear that terminology.  Whenever people talk about all-Ireland bodies, it immediately makes unionists bristle.  Language is important.  If you want to wind people up, it is not hard to do so in any direction.  If on the other hand, you want to take things forward, the careful use of language is really important.  I know Ms Gildernew knows that because I listened to what she is saying and she is quite careful about the way she speaks about it because she lives there and works with people and so on.  John Hume and colleagues developed a particular language for the Good Friday Agreement process where we spoke about things in a particular way.  It was not just playing with words.  David Trimble famously said that because people have a past we do not like does not mean there cannot be a different future.  There are ways of speaking about things that can be helpful and ways that can be unhelpful.  I would flag that when we talk about all-Ireland bodies, that has a particular resonance for many people in the unionist community that North-South bodies or even shared island bodies does not have.  The language we use is an important dimension to think about.</p></speech>

The shared island work is critical first.  That preparatory work is critical.  I believe that in future, the citizens' assembly will be useful in that regard - just not at the moment.</p></speech>

That is the message that has been sent to every local authority.  I remember the initial meeting we had with the officials.  I was very strong that the corporate knowledge in our local authorities had to be harnessed to work along with the shared island unit.  That is actually happening.  What was announced last Thursday was funding to local authorities to develop the proposals that can draw down some very substantial funding from the shared island unit so it is going into communities.  Local authorities in particular have that great link with local parishes and communities and can translate that into really effective policy.  Not alone will it be a policy aspiration, the funding is there to bring these projects to fruition.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, not later than 6 months after the passage of this Act, lay a report before the Oireachtas Committee that&mdash; <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	(a) proposes the wording for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure,<br /><br />(b) sets out a timeline for the referendum,<br /><br />(c) sets out in detail all other key considerations.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This amendment, if accepted, will mean that the Minister, no later than six months after the passage of this Bill will lay a report before the Oireachtas committee on a proposed wording for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure, to set out a timeline for a referendum, and to set out in detail any other considerations.</p><p>For quite some time the Government has been saying that the matter of a referendum is under consideration.  This Government and Oireachtas is approximately halfway through its full term, so I believe the time for this matter to be under consideration is coming to a close and we need to know what the timeline is and when this will happen.</p><p>This amendment seeks to do that and I will go through some of the reasons I think that is very important, but I believe it would be useful if the Minister of State were able to give us an update.  Is this matter still under consideration or does the Government now have a timeline as to when this referendum is likely to happen and when will we hear more about it?  What are the Ministers of State&rsquo;s thoughts in that regard?  </p><p>On the substantive issue of water, its supply and the importance of it being in public ownership, we have seen around the world in the past number of years 235 different places where water went into private ownership and has been brought back into public ownership because the privatisation was so disastrous.  Two of the high profile areas we would be aware of are Berlin and Paris.  </p><p>In Paris, for example, over 24 years of privatisation the price of water increased by 174%.  While the profits of the owner soared, the amount of public investment in the infrastructure did not justify that.  That is one of the reasons water was brought back into public ownership.  Bringing water back into public ownership is a very costly exercise because this infrastructure has often been privatised at a low cost and brought back in to public ownership at a very high cost to the Exchequer or to the people.</p><p>In Berlin the privatisation of water was nothing short of a disaster.  It led to very significant deficits in investment in water infrastructure, which is something that we could not afford here.  I am aware that the present Government has no intention whatsoever to privatise water.  This is very important, however, where we as a committee are always talking about housing and the infrastructure needed around housing.  While there are very significant deficits in that at present, privatisation would make that even worse again.  As a fundamental issue in respect of people&rsquo;s access to this resource, with the exception of air, there is nothing we need access to more for human life, for business, for farms, for companies, for industry and for everything, than water.  </p><p>It is of crucial importance and the reassurance that a referendum on this will be held, putting it into the Constitution, and enshrining that public right and ownership, would be a very positive step.  That is what this amendment is seeking to do in progressing that.  If the Minister of State is able to give us a definitive update on what is going to happen with a referendum, then I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

We fought a long campaign to prevent water being privatised.  Some hundreds of thousands of people came on to the street.  This issue does not seem to be on the Government&rsquo;s agenda but there is still a concern there among people I speak to that until we have the referendum and until right to water issue is enshrined in the Constitution, a Government at some future stage might try to revisit this issue and privatise water and the water infrastructure in this State.  That is why we need a commitment and a timeline from the Government to know that this will not happen.  With the cost of living, in housing and in health; these are the number one issues.  There is still a fear factor there in the back of people&rsquo;s minds, however, about this privatisation agenda which Fine Gael has driven for the past 12 years.</p> <p>  I would appreciate, therefore, if the Minister of State could give that commitment because at least people would know then and it would help to ease their minds because at this moment in time, this issue is still a serious concern for many people.</p></speech>

I have a letter here from SIPTU and its members where in Limerick alone, the county council wants 70 of their water and water treatment system workers to transfer to Irish Water.  We are talking here about not privatising water yet this transfer has to be done by 2026.  This represents 70 of the local authority workers who are working in the water services who are being told at the moment that they are not being forced but are being asked to change over to Irish Water, and that the county council wants this framework done by 2026.  It appears to me that the Government is looking at privatising our water system completely where it is bringing over local authority workers from their local authority work to Irish Water.  In the absence of a collective agreement or of a rejection of the framework document, some are advocating that the Government would be enabled to implement section 19 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, which provides for compulsory transfer of a number of matters to Irish Water.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-06a.814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2022100600002#B00100"><p>I thank Deputies for their contributions and Deputy Cian O'Callaghan for the proposed amendment.  I agree with the comments made.  I have seen in other countries where privatisation has been brought in, either through IMF interventions or structural adjustment programmes, that it has been detrimental.  That is not on the cards here.  I give that assurance.  There is also a commitment to a referendum in the programme for Government.</p> <p>  The amendment concerns the wording and timeline for a referendum on the public ownership of water infrastructure.  While I welcome and share the support shown by the Deputy for a referendum on ownership, the amendment suggested is outside the scope of this Bill and cannot therefore be accepted.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will recall, the 2017 report of the Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services supported the holding of a referendum, subject to there being no adverse impact on private and group water services.  In response, and in the context of a Private Members&rsquo; Bill introduced in the previous D&aacute;il, extensive work has been undertaken by the Department and the Office of the Attorney General to consider possible approaches to advancing a referendum proposal.  An approach based on protecting the public ownership of the entity established under law to provide public water services, Irish Water, has been identified as the most appropriate and straightforward approach.  Having consulted his colleagues in Government on the matter, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has signalled his willingness to support a referendum on public ownership along these lines.</p> <p>  An important consideration in planning for a successful referendum is the need to ensure proper public engagement.  Noting that the Commission on Housing has been specifically tasked with advising the Government on a referendum to place the right to housing in the Constitution, it would make sense that the constitutional issues around the rights to housing and the protection for the supply of public water should be considered at the same time.  The Department will therefore bring its proposals on a water referendum to Government in conjunction with any anticipated referendum on housing.</p> <p>  It is understood that the Commission on Housing hopes to be in a position to put forward proposed wording for a referendum on housing towards the end of this year or very early in the New Year.  This approach has been outlined to unions on the referendum, on which I note the points made by Deputy O'Donoghue, in the context of the broader engagement on water sector transformation.  The position is set out in a paper entitled Water Sector Transformation: the Wider Policy Context, which the Department shared with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 18 July 2022 and which the Minister has now placed in the Oireachtas Library for the benefit of Members generally.</p> <p>  I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment.  I assure members that it is the Government's intention to proceed with the referendum on water in tandem with the referendum on housing.</p></speech>

It is now five years since the report was published and more than five years since most people felt this matter had been settled and consensus was achieved on the need for a referendum to provide assurance in the Constitution that our water infrastructure would stay in public ownership.  However, we are still left without a referendum.</p> <p>  The Minister of State made the relevant point that what has happened in some other countries has not always been driven by governments but has sometimes been driven by the IMF or external bodies.  I do not believe and I certainly hope that we will not be in such a situation any time soon but we never know what will happen.  We need protections in the Constitution, as otherwise economic turmoil or spillover from the disastrous situation in the UK at the moment could lead to a Government being told that, whether it likes it or not, privatisation must go ahead.  If we had a provision in the Constitution, that would be off the table.  The IMF or anyone else could say whatever it wanted but the Constitution would provide full protection and we would not have to worry about the issue.  That is one reason that, notwithstanding the fair amount of political consensus on this issue at the moment, having this provided in the Constitution is a good idea.</p> <p>  It is positive that the Minister of State reiterated the point about holding a referendum at the same time as a referendum on housing but we do not have a date or timeline for the latter either.  My concern is that we are halfway through this Government and we never know what could happen.  If the Government were to end early due to unforeseen circumstances and these referendums are not held, the matter is then on the plate of the next Government.  The failure of the Government to give a firm time commitment is the reason I am concerned.  Unless the Minister of State can give us a timeline for the referendum, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

The intention is to have the wording ready for the end of this year or early 2023.  That would put the commission in place and it would then get moving on a timeline for a referendum and referendum campaign.</p> <p>  Uisce &Eacute;ireann will remain in public ownership so a referendum aside, the programme for Government includes a commitment that Irish Water will be retained in public ownership as a national, stand-alone, regulated utility.  However, I fully appreciate the assurance Deputy O'Callaghan has spoken about with regard to having that enshrined in the Constitution as an added safeguard.  It is important from my perspective and that of the Government that the referendum take place.</p></speech>

It is always tricky running two referendums on the same day.  I will not say they are similar issues but I know there will be considerable public engagement on both.

One of the concerns that many of us have is that in the second document that emerged from the Workplace Relations Commission discussions, which is directly related to this legislation and to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's Bill, there is no commitment to hold a referendum.  To be clear, we have a commitment from the Minister to consider, at a future date, bringing a proposal to the Government.  Does the Minister of State know if there is consensus among the Government parties that if such a proposition was brought, there would be agreement?  We are waiting for the Commission on Housing to report and we understand it will report in November.  We understand it is highly likely to recommend a referendum on the right to housing in the Constitution.  However, we also know from this committee that while a majority of members are on record as supporting such a measure, Fine Gael members, as is their right, currently do not support such a proposition, although that may change.  I am not asking about Cabinet because it is governed by Cabinet confidentiality, but is the Minister of State aware of any consensus among the three parties in government that a referendum to enshrine in the Constitution the public ownership of our public water system or utility would be a good thing?  I ask because there is considerable concern among water service workers regarding the single utility.  One of the points many of these workers make is that if there was a constitutional protection for the public status of the utility, and this speaks directly to Deputy O'Donoghue's question, the decision of whether they transfer to Irish Water would be a much easier one for them to make.  Therefore, some clarity on where the Government parties stand would be really helpful on this.</p></speech>

The Cabinet and the Government will be within their rights to decide collectively that they do not want to go with that wording and not have a referendum.  What we know now is that the wording on a referendum is being worked on and that will be brought to Cabinet.  We do not have a specific timeline on that and we do not know how the Cabinet or the Government will decide on that because no one can tell.  Do I understand the current process correctly?</p></speech>

I give the assurance that the wording is currently being worked on in regard to a housing referendum, as was committed to.  We would anticipate that both referenda would take place on the same day.  That is our intention.</p></speech>

The heightened levels of accountability and transparency applying to Uisce &Eacute;ireann are commensurate with the level of Exchequer funding of the company.  This policy change has a consequential impact on another statutory body tasked with an oversight role with respect to Uisce &Eacute;ireann, namely, the Water Advisory Body.  There will be a duplication between the Committee of Public Accounts and the Water Advisory Body as both consider transparency and accountability matters relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, considers that it is in the best interests of the Oireachtas and Uisce &Eacute;ireann that there is a clear line of accountability for Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and that the Committee of Public Accounts is the appropriate body that should be solely tasked with this role.  This sole accountability role for the Committee of Public Accounts will obviate the need for the Water Advisory Body.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is giving urgent consideration to the accountability arrangements in light of the role of the Committee of Public Accounts and will consult further with Government colleagues on this matter.  Any amendment necessary would be relevant to the provision, scope and principles of the Bill.  The Minister considers that any change to the Water Advisory Body will not diminish the individual statutory roles of the three bodies currently represented on the Water Advisory Body, namely, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and An F&oacute;ram Uisce.  Any decision would not change their individual relationship with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister acknowledges that it is open to the joint committee to request all three bodies and Uisce &Eacute;ireann to appear before it on matters relating to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts has a specific legal and constitutional responsibility.  Although it does not exclusively focus on the issue of the use of public money, that is its primary responsibility.  The Water Forum is a much broader body, which has a range of different opinions and views on it.  I am unsure whether having a level of statutory accountability to both bodies necessarily involves duplication or conflicts.  Has this been discussed with the Water Advisory Board?  Has its opinion been sought?  If it has not, I urge the Department to seek its opinion before any amendment is brought forward.  If there has been consultation with the Water Advisory Board, I would like the committee to have sight of the view of the board on the matter.  If the Department is not going to do that in advance of any amendment that may be tabled by the Minister, particularly keeping in mind that it might be a late stage amendment on Report Stage and in light of the significant information the Minister of State has just outlined, the Chairman should share that information with the Water Advisory Board and seek its view on the matter for the committee.  Obviously, we cannot prejudge an amendment we have not seen, but what has been outlined by the Minister of State would be a significant change from the Bill as it stands.</p></speech>

It is only correct that the committee would have sight of the view of the Water Advisory Board.  We are trying to ensure there is a clear line of accountability through the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think that is the correct approach.  Obviously, there is also oversight through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I wanted to flag the matter with members.  We will seek the views of the Water Advisory Board and have it appear before the joint committee in that regard.</p></speech>

When the Bill was initiated, Uisce &Eacute;ireann was placed at No. 206 in Schedule 13 as that was the next available number at the time.  The Revenue Commissioners has advised the Department that Uisce &Eacute;ireann should be placed at No. 210.  This is because Nos. 206 and 207 were allocated to bodies that will be established on foot of the recently enacted Institutional Burials Act 2022 and Electoral Reform Act 2022, and Nos. 208 and 209 have been allocated to bodies that will be added to Schedule 13 by the finance Bill.</p></speech>
