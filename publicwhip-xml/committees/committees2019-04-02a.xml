    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#B00200"><p>The purpose of today's meeting is consideration of the Revised Estimates for public services 2019, Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred to the committee by the D&aacute;il.  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and his officials.  The format proposed for today's meeting is that we will deal with Vote 30 programme by programme.  The Minister will make an opening statement on each of the five programmes at the outset.  We will then consider each programme separately or see how the discussion goes at the time.  Before I begin, I remind members to make sure their mobile phones are turned off.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#B00300"><p>I am pleased to have this valuable opportunity to present the current challenges and opportunities across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry to the committee.  My key focus for 2019 is protecting vulnerable farm incomes, supporting sustainable farming and jobs in rural and coastal communities, and assisting the sector in meeting the challenges of Brexit.</p> <p>  In 2019, the Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1.6 billion.  This comprises &euro;1.341 billion in current expenditure and &euro;277 million in capital expenditure, including a &euro;22 million capital carryover.  This represents an overall increase of &euro;31 million over last year when carryovers are taken into account.  Regarding our 2018 performance, I note that expenditure was &euro;1.546 billion.  Almost 99% of the current allocation was spent, reflecting a very strong delivery of crucial supports to the agrifood sector.  As members may recall, our allocation for 2018 included a &euro;30 million supplementary allocation which provided additional funding for measures introduced last autumn to alleviate the fodder situation.  I thank my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the European Commission for support given last year when we were presented with unprecedented difficulties by weather impacts on farmers.</p> <p>  I am conscious that we meet today at a very uncertain and challenging time for the agrifood and fisheries sector.  If a no-deal Brexit emerges, I am confident that the Government and our colleagues in Europe will not be found wanting in responding to the needs of our sector.  However, the Estimate I present to the committee today is as set out in the 2019 Revised Estimates as published in December 2018, which were framed for a Brexit scenario presuming implementation of the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>  I will now speak about each of the four programmes and the key themes.  Programme A shows a substantial increase in pay and non-pay administrative allocations.  This reflects the allocation to this programme of the vast majority of the Department&rsquo;s additional funding for what is termed a "central case Brexit scenario".  This covers preparations for the additional checks on east&ndash;west trade, including the associated development of IT systems and equipment.  Obviously, this will be adapted to any change in circumstances that may arise in the weeks ahead.</p> <p>  I am providing for a substantial increase in programme expenditure, which includes additional funding for the meat inspection service.  This relates to a new arrangement recently agreed between my Department and Veterinary Ireland regarding the engagement of temporary veterinary inspectors.  I have provided a once-off sum of &euro;4 million in additional funding to support the introduction of sheep electronic identification, EID, with funding both for producers and to provide readers for marts.  I am also providing additional funding for ERAD, recognising that even with good progress in many aspects of the tuberculosis, TB, programme, we have seen a slight rise in herd incidence rates.  The work of the TB forum will be very instructive as to the ways and means to achieve our ambitious goal of eradication by 2030.</p> <p>  Turning to programme B, a total of &euro;863 million is available in 2019 to be paid almost exclusively to farmers, with &euro;640 million allocated to EU co&ndash;funded rural development programme, RDP, schemes.  That is in addition to the &euro;1.2 billion in funding from the EU for Pillar 1, the basic payment scheme.  These figures reflect the mature level of RDP implementation.  The allocation for our agri-environment schemes is lower than 2018, at just over &euro;228 million.  The reason for this is that an exceptionally high level of expenditure in 2018 of &euro;232 million on the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and a further &euro;22 million on other schemes succeeded in removing the large hangover of 2017 scheme payments and paying the vast majority their 2018 advance payments, hence reducing the funding requirement for 2019.  The agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, are now virtually completed with only some residual payments due.</p> <p>  This support to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits is vital.  As well as the inherent environmental benefits involved, this investment enhances our sustainability credentials, which are invaluable as we serve increasingly demanding and knowledgeable customers at home and around the world.  In that regard the allocations for organic farming schemes and locally led schemes are increasing.  We will be investing in three highly significant local schemes concerning the pearl mussel, the hen harrier and Burren farming in 2019, as well as a number of smaller and even more localised schemes.  This work is very much in sync with the objectives of the recently published report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action and the whole-of-Government approach to ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>  We have increased the allocation to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme by a further &euro;23 million to &euro;250 million, restoring the scheme to pre-downturn levels.  This year is the first year of the new ANC scheme, with land eligibility now designated according to biophysical criteria.  The redesignation process has been lengthy and forensic and it arrived at a very reasonable outcome.  On budget day I described this latest increase as a very important part of building our Brexit resilience by giving invaluable direct financial support to farmers with land in the many naturally constrained parts of the country.  The average ANC payment of approximately &euro;2,500 will be an important part of income for producers, many of whom are farming in challenging circumstances.</p> <p>  Another element of our Brexit response for 2019 is included in the B6 subhead, namely, beef sustainability schemes.  This now includes both the well-established beef genomics and data programme, BDGP, and the new beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP.  For 2019, the pilot has been allocated &euro;20 million for farmer payments and another &euro;1 million for weighing equipment.  I am pleased that the application process for BEEP went smoothly and has attracted a very good level of applications.  It will offer an immediate income boost for participants and provide practical guidance for the future viability of our suckler herds.</p><p>It will complement very well the BDGP, for which &euro;46.5 million will be available in 2019.  I have also increased the allocation for knowledge transfer to &euro;25 million for the third year of the three-year programme.<br/><br/>Moving to the sheep sector, the sheep welfare scheme allocation for 2019 at &euro;18 million will provide for the balancing payment from the 2018 scheme year and the advance payments for the 2019 scheme year.  As I have mentioned already, under programme A I have provided more than &euro;3 million for payments to farmers for sheep EID.  The new system will significantly reduce record keeping for farmers and will result in a simpler and more effective sheep traceability system.<br/><br/>In terms of capital expenditure, I have maintained the allocation of &euro;70 million for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  I expect this to be fully spent as payment claims are being submitted on an ongoing basis, with more than &euro;20 million paid already this year.  Despite the uncertainty the sector faces, many farmers recognise the value of upgrading their equipment and improving their facilities, and we will continue to match them in their ambition and pragmatism.  I am also increasing the allocation for the commercial horticulture scheme to &euro;6 million, recognising the need for greater efficiencies and innovation in that sector in the face of the challenges already endured and those ahead.  I welcome the fact that the level of applications to this year&rsquo;s scheme exceeds previous years.<br/><br/>Turning to forestry, the level of new afforestation we achieved last year was substantially lower than target but I am hopeful that at least some of the reduced rate was weather related and that activity will pick up this year.  A strong programme is crucial to our sector's contribution to climate change mitigation.  By the same token, I am fully aware of the concerns regarding afforestation in certain communities and my colleague, the Minster of State, Deputy Doyle, has recently established a group to examine this matter and to report this year.<br/><br/>Many of the programme C allocations reflect the comprehensive approach to Brexit responsiveness and how that intertwines with the continuing implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  It includes additional funding for capital investment by food companies, initiatives for artisan producers and further support for the prepared consumer foods centre at Ashtown.  I have also made a substantial contribution to Teagasc's national food innovation hub at Moorepark, which is reflected in the &euro;4 million increase in the capital allocation.  These initiatives, fostering innovation and product development, have been given a greater focus by Brexit but are consistent with the direction of travel of Food Wise 2025.  The implementation to date of Food Wise 2025 has positioned the sector to defend its market presence in the UK robustly and develop new markets.  In that regard, the allocation for Bord Bia has been increased by almost &euro;5 million and now stands at almost &euro;47 million compared with &euro;32 million pre-Brexit decision in 2015.<br/><br/>The extraordinary export success of our indigenous food sectors did not come easily or quickly.  Maintaining and growing this foothold in higher value markets requires huge efforts in the face of stiff competition and challenges such as Brexit.  In 2018, after years of work, we achieved a very substantial breakthrough in opening the Chinese market for bone-in beef and further deep work is needed to exploit that hard-won opportunity fully.  In that regard, I will also be expanding my Department&rsquo;s global footprint.  My Department has eight agricultural attach&eacute; posts in embassies in the European Union and across the world, including in Beijing and Washington DC.  I intend to expand this network by 50%, adding extra posts in the key locations of Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico.  Trade missions play an important role in market development.  In 2018, I led missions to US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia.  This year I have already visited Turkey in early March and I plan to lead Government agrifood trade missions to China in May, Japan and South Korea in June, and Algeria and Egypt in November.<br/><br/>I have also increased the allocation for the horse and greyhound fund by &euro;4 million, a 5% increase to help with the work in promoting and supporting these sectors.  I am pleased that the greyhound Bill has made good progress in the Seanad and I hope it will pass into legislation later this year.  I hope that with its financial position greatly improved after the sale of Harold's Cross stadium, the sector will move forward with confidence.  Horse Racing Ireland is investing heavily in new facilities and services and we continue to be a very important partner to the industry.<br/><br/>The zero allocation for Brexit resilience as presented in the Revised Estimates Volume 2019 in contrast to the &euro;25 million in 2018 might give cause for concern.  However, as I have set out, we have a very intense focus on Brexit, with an overall package of &euro;78 million in funding distributed across a number of subheads, including the &euro;7 million for staff and information technology to facilitate my Department's regulatory role.  Moreover, the 2018 allocation for the future growth loan, which involved a contribution via the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to the European Investment Bank, EIB, has just been launched, so the benefits of the investment in the loan funding will start to flow to both primary producers and processors in 2019.<br/><br/>Part of our Supplementary Estimate for 2018 involved the transfer of savings from various subheads into the World Food Programme, WFP, to allow for the earliest possible payment of our 2019 contribution to that programme.  Accordingly, when taken together with that voted amount and a further allocation of &euro;4 million from later identified savings, the total WFP contribution in 2019 will amount to &euro;22 million.  This is an increase of 10% on our contribution for 2018.<br/><br/>With respect to programme D, the provision for my Department&rsquo;s seafood programme has been increased by &euro;6 million, mostly by way of an increased allocation to the fishery harbour centres to a total of &euro;27 million, and this will help fund vital investment in Castletownbere and Killybegs harbours.  The budget provision will also allow the Marine Institute to commence the planned replacement of the 21 year old <i>Celtic Voyager</i>with a new 50 m modern research vesselThe other significant change in programme D is the reduced allocation for the Haulbowline remediation project.  This reflects the great progress made in 2018, resulting in the completion of the east tip remediation.<br/><br/>The majority of funding for Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, is in respect of various schemes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, operational programme.  This is fully operational, with a total of 19 schemes.  The investment will fund a range of programmes, including capital investment in the seafood processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors to foster growth in production, value and employment, enhance sustainability and competitiveness, and support training, skills development and stakeholder capacity development.  We continue to support the sector in what we all know to be a very challenging period.<br/><br/>I have not referred to another very important aspect of the work of the year ahead, namely, the negotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post 2020.  Although it is not visible in the Vote, there is much work under way in my Department in preparing for the next CAP and we can discuss this further during the course of the meeting.<br/><br/>These funding allocations will assist us in focusing on competitiveness, innovation, new market development and environmental sustainability while responding to the uncertainty and challenge posed by Brexit.  This is a brief overview of the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for 2019.  I look forward to the discussion and questions from committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for coming in today to discuss the Revised Estimates.  Will the Minister outline the key differences between the Revised Estimates and the Estimates provided after the budget?  This meeting is happening against the backdrop of Brexit and, over recent months, a crisis facing the beef sector.  Permission was granted from the EU to increase permissible state aid from &euro;15,000 to &euro;25,000 five or six weeks ago, but our beef sector in particular has been in crisis for a number of months.  Many finishers have been losing their shirts.  There must be immediate support for those farmers, especially those involved with finishing cattle who have lost significant money.  It is affecting the sector as a whole, and unless there is some support from the Government and this Department in particular, the beef sector will be further undermined.  The Minister has mentioned a number of times how welcome is the increase in permissible state aid.  That is of no use unless we assist farmers.  Has the Minister considered this and can we expect to see something immediately from the Department to provide support to the beef sector?</p> <p>  Will the Minister speak to the BEEP uptake?  In his contribution he did not outline how many farmers availed of it, how far that number is off target and where we are with the associated budget.</p><p>I would also like the Minister to flesh out how the &euro;1 million in associated estimates in regard to weighing and will be spent and to comment on whether it will be sufficient to ensure there is not a burden on farmers who are participating in regard to the cost of weighing.  </p><p> In regard to the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, and projected spend in that regard, I note the current round is due to expire at the end of April and that uptake in regard to projects was very slow initially.  In terms of the Department's future projections in regard to this scheme, is sufficient funding in place to meet likely demand in the future?  In regard to the 2018 outgoings, was there an underspend in the Department's overall allocation and, if so, what happened to that underspend?  </p><p> In respect of Brexit and preparations in this regard, the Department outlined plans last September to hire 116 veterinary inspectors.  Earlier in the summer, it had announced that 300 veterinary inspectors would be hired.  What progress has been made in regard to the hiring of those inspectors?  I note that a few weeks ago, the Department advertised in the public press for private veterinary practitioners to indicate their interest to be available to work in the ports and points of entry in the event of a hard Brexit.  I took from that that there has been no progress made in regard to the hiring of veterinary inspectors.  I ask the Minister to provide further detail in this regard.  </p><p> In regard to the Brexit loan scheme, which was finally announced last week but was initially announced under budget 2018 in October 2017, will the Minister outline what happened to the funding that was allocated in budget 2018 for this scheme?  Was it used elsewhere or carried forward?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#D00200"><p>The Deputy raised a number of points but the critical one, which I think many in the agriculture community would acknowledge, is the challenge facing the beef sector, on which we had a construction debate in the D&aacute;il Chamber last week.  We are directing the resources available to the State in a targeted way to farmers to try to shore up falling incomes.  As the Deputy will be aware, unfortunately or otherwise, the reality is that there is nothing I can do in respect of meat factories and the prices they pay.  What I can do is ensure that whatever resources I have are focused in the most effective way to the sector.  The keys areas of action are increasing payments under areas of natural constraint, ANC, introducing schemes such as the beef environmental programme and driving the adoption and implementation of producer organisations.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where we are at with regard to the beef environmental efficiency pilot.  There were 18,536 applicants, covering almost 450,000 weanlings.  There is a significant level of interest in this scheme.  As the Deputy will be aware, the intention in respect of the scheme is for individual farmers who have applied for the scheme to have their own scales registered, in respect of which there is a facility to do this online on the Department's website, or for them to be able to avail of a bank of weighing scales that will be delivered for the purposes of the scheme through a series of outlets around the country.  Farmers will be able to borrow these scales to weigh their cattle and then return them.  This is how the programme will operate.  The intention is to deliver the scheme as efficiently as possible with the least amount of bureaucracy or administrative burden and to target whatever scarce resources are available into the pockets of participating farmers.  To the best of my recollection, the cost of providing the scales is approximately &euro; 1 million.  The remainder of the money will go directly to farmers who are applicants.</p> <p>  On the issue of Brexit staffing, I know that-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#D00400"><p>My understanding is 450,000 weanlings are covered.  We do not have final figures but it will be in or around the &euro;20 million budgeted for.  We will not have the exact figures until later this year.  The ambition is to pay this scheme in the current calendar year.</p> <p>  On Brexit staffing, on which the Deputy has been asking a lot of questions, we are trying to manage a situation as prudently and effectively as possible.  We made estimates and were involved in a central case scenario early on and in more recent times in terms of the necessary staffing requirement to deal with a crash-out Brexit.  In a crash-out situation, there will be an escalating requirement for staff over a period of time.  I am certain that should that happen next week or in May, we will be able to fulfil our obligations in respect of checking on trade coming from a third country and facilitating trade that we export to what then will be a third country.</p> <p>  As I understand it, the current staffing complement is in the region of 120, comprised of a mixture of veterinary inspectors, forest inspectors, technical staff, clerical officer portal inspectors, agricultural inspectors and a range of administrative staff.  This complement may increase to 230 within a relatively short timeframe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#D00500"><p>The Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Creed, announced in early summer that 300 staff would be recruited.  This figure was downgraded in September to 116.  My recollection is that the staff complement of 116 was primarily focused on veterinary and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, officials.  I am concerned that there has been little or no action in regard to follow-through in regard to recruitment of this 116 staff or the previously-announced 300 staff.  Will the Minister outline what was intended in terms of that 116 staff and what has happened in this regard.  The first we heard about private veterinary practices being asked to front up in regard to providing assistance was when the advertisements were published in the papers a few weeks ago.  I have grave concerns that nothing has happened in regard to that 116 staff.  Will the Minister clarify what was to be done in that regard and what has happened?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#D00600"><p>As the situation has been an evolving one we have been able to refine our requirement in terms of populating rosters to meet shift work and so on.  For example, the Wexford facility will operate on the basis of two rosters and Dublin Port will operate around the clock, if I am not mistaken.  We have been able to drill down into the granular detail around the staffing requirement.  The overwhelming imperative is that whatever the Brexit date we are in a position to meet our legal requirements and satisfy the European Union in that regard.  Rather than recruit a lot or direct staff, with all of the contingent responsibilities and liabilities that that would bring with it, I have been trying to meet this requirement from the point of view of the most financially efficient way to do it.</p><p>In doing it efficiently financially, we must also make sure we are doing everything necessary with regard to our legal obligations.  We have worked through the detail of that around all of the border inspection posts and the type of staff that are necessary.  We have refined our numbers requirement and I expect it will increase to some 230 staff.  That is the figure we see as ultimately necessary but there will be some 120 staff <i>in situ </i>on 12 April.  This involves redeployment of existing staff and new recruits.  We have been working with the Revenue Commissioners in availing of some of the panels it has had, from which we have recruited some staff.  I understand there are also some temporary contract staff arrangements being entered into so it is a mix of elements.<br/><br/>We are trying to make sure that we are not entering into long-term financial obligations for a situation that might not happen.  It is the case, however, that a crash-out and a requirement for these staff is more likely now than it was some time ago when we were planning for the central case scenario.  I am satisfied that we will be able to do everything that is necessary on the dates in question.<br/><br/>I will give the Deputy some data.  Dublin Port, for example, will be staffed on a 24-7 basis.  At peak times in Dublin Airport the Department will have some 40 staff on the ground to do documentary and physical identity checks when dealing with the UK once it becomes a third country.  As I said earlier, Rosslare Port will operate on two shifts per day based on ferry activity with ten to 15 departmental staff managing inspections for these operations across peak times.  The outcome is based on what is necessary to meet the demand.  I am satisfied that come 12 April, or any future date, we will have the necessary number of staff in place.</p></speech>

It is one of the areas where the budget is up.  That is under the central case scenario.  In a crash-out, the staff complement will be higher.  We want to do this as efficiently as possible to avoid a situation where we have recruited contractually all of those staff and then find that the necessity did not materialise.  Even as we stand here today that is a possibility.  In a number of years' time I am sure there will be great fun before a public expenditure committee in the Oireachtas trying to explain what people in hindsight can say "Sure they were never going to crash out".  We are trying to do it as financially efficiently as possible.  This is why some of the staffing is through redeployment, some is using former staff on short-term contracts and some involves additional staff.  It is a mix of opportunities.</p></speech>

That was in July but all of a sudden in September, the Minister was a bit more low key when he announced that actually the Government was going to change its mind and that the figure was going to be reduced from 300 to 116.  There has been no follow-through on that.  Now the Minister is doing it in different ways.  My point is the way the Minister had told us that he had all these plans in place and that he would follow through.  There was no follow-through.  In hindsight the earlier announcement looks very much like a public relations affair.</p></speech>

I am aware of the headline the Deputy refers to, but I ask that he bears in mind it was in the context of a central case scenario which was a withdrawal agreement, a transitional arrangement and Brexit happening in an orderly way by the end of 2020.  This scenario would have required rolling recruitment of staff up to that period in time.  The Deputy is trying to make the case that because the envisaged number of staff for the 2020 deadline has not been reached by today - when there is a possibility of a crash-out - that in some way we are not prepared.  I believe, without a shadow of a doubt, that Ireland is the most Brexit-prepared member state.  There are enough challenges and uncertainty out there without fomenting uncertainty in this interaction.  We will be ready in the most financially efficient way.  Obviously there will be other people who have responsibilities around recruitment, across the HSE for example, with inspectors and so on in other areas of supervision and regulation to do with food businesses.  They will not be recruited in this particular context but it will all be done to make sure we keep business moving and exports getting to marketplaces.  The figures the Deputy spoke about were to the date at the end of 2020.  The figures I have given to the Deputy are for what we are now planning: staff to be on the ground to deal with the necessary situation, should the UK crash out in the short term.  This will increase and ratchet up.  I do not think it serves any purpose for the Deputy to try to create uncertainty or doubt where we are ready to deal with what could happen, of which I am in no doubt, if the UK should crash out.</p></speech>

The benefit of that is in the loan scheme launched last week.  People will apply to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to get approval as qualified to apply for the loan - which means that the applicant is Brexit-impacted as a primary producer - and for the proposed works.

I have said before that it is a long running story, certainly longer than we anticipated, and it required primary legislation because of the involvement of the European Investment Bank.  It was much more complicated than our previous foray in this area with the working capital scheme or the other &euro;300 million working programme for small business.  The fund is there now and it is welcome because it plugs a gap in the market that was not previously serviced with regard to the unsecured borrowing of money over seven years.  It is very important that it is there.</p> <p>  The Deputy's other question was on TAMS.  The allocation for TAMS this year is &euro;70 million.  We are drawing down in the region of &euro;2 million a week now.  To date some &euro;20 million has already been paid out this year.  We will need to keep this area under constant review.</p><p>In terms of applications, there is growing demand in this area.  According to the most recent figures, we received more than 19,000 applications under TAMS.  It has the exact same profile as any of the previous schemes in terms of being slow to start and then peaking.  We are moving into that space now.  The allocation for TAMS for 2019 is &euro;70 million.  It will require vigilance to ensure we process all applications and keep them moving along as quickly as we possibly can with farmers being paid.</p></speech>

I have a few bits and pieces about which to ask, but everything will be set against the background of Brexit.  I sometimes despair listening to people wanting us to not second-guess, but fourth-guess, what will happen across the water when the people there do not have a clue what is happening.  It is a nonsense.  This is an Irish tendency, where one has to be the leprechaun to jump into the middle of the sea and try to guess what will happen.  Let us see and let us keep nice and cool, and calm.  I get irked when I hear that type of nonsense.</p> <p>  I am worried about basic issues.  In areas of natural constraint, ANC, the Minister has provided &euro;250 million in 2019, a &euro;23 million increase.  The biophysical parameters are now involved.  Of course, it has gone to an appeals process.  All appeals must be in by 8 April.  With this two-stage process, is there any indication of the likely number of appeals?  There is only a week left.</p> <p>  The Minister would expect me to mention beef, given where I come from.  I will mention a few factors here because I have an interest in this issue.  A big issue is the grading issue on the kill lines in factories.  I happen to be out meeting farmers.  It is great to get out to get a bit of fresh air and talk to the Westmeath farmers, many of whom are involved with the beef farmers' forum and beef group.  They are fairly hot on the ground and they are not fools.  They know there can be no magic wand.  They are intelligent people.  Yesterday, I spoke to a man with 250 cattle and 150 sheep who well knows that.  This mechanical grading is just not doing the business.  This man said that they are able to put a digital machine in the air which will tell where one turned the course of a river.  He asked why we could not do so in a factory and make sure that farmers get paid.  I understand the grades were wrong on a number of occasions.  Were there a number of cases where they were wrong in four out of every ten animals?  Maybe I am wrong but that is what I hear on the ground.  There is grave concern about this and it has to be tackled.  It is no use having a beef forum and being nice to those factory boys coming in.  One has to give them a few punches when they are in.  The legal tolerance - maybe I am wrong and the Minister has senior officials who know all this - for beef grading machines in meat plants is approximately 60%.  We should get that up to even 85% or 90% - I accept we will not have 100% - as that is a lot of money going out the door.  There are significant losses in that.  I understand trials are taking place with digital cameras, LED lights, etc., but how far advanced are they?  Is there a plan to deal with those perceived issues?  Maybe they are only perceived.  I hear anecdotally about grading anomalies in the factories and between factories and it is a cause of concern.  Things are bad enough on the ground, as I will illustrate, but if we could intervene, we could make a positive contribution in trying to deal with those issues.  We brought in grids, for example, and if they are not working, they must be re-examined.  We cannot stick to the same old line that they are grand in respect of this and the quality price system, QPS.  We must sort those out.  That is from where I am starting.</p> <p>  I spoke to another farmer yesterday.  He said it appeared that everybody was getting a cut out of it.  All the intermediaries, between farm and fork, are getting a cut and the only ones who are not getting a cut are the producers.  The processors are getting plenty of cuts - the Minister need not worry about that.  They are cutting people any chance they get.</p> <p>  Mr. Martin O'Sullivan was a colleague of mine in the 1980s, which is a long time ago.  He did a study, which is well worth reading, taking the Teagasc farm management survey on suckling and cattle rearing on an average-sized farm of 87 acres.  Between 2013 and 2017, the return on that farm, including subsidies, was &euro;11,063, or &euro;130 an acre.  Let us not forget the subsidies are included.  Between 1998 to 2002, the average income was &euro;12,228, some &euro;1,200 more.  In the meantime, there was inflation of 37%.  In order to stand still, one would need &euro;16,752.  That tells members, who themselves are involved in a bit of this and are interested, one would need &euro;6,700 more to stand still on the same farm, the same number of animals, etc.  Of course, the subsidies are 105% profit.  Without the subsidies, it would be a negative wash-out.</p> <p>  One should bear in mind that Westmeath is a fulcrum of suckler farms.  These are farmers who do the proper beef.  They are not into the dairy stuff.  Theirs is the real stuff.  I spoke to those farmers yesterday and one man said to me that he would be better off if he let the land or put much of it into forestry.  He said a man up the road was going into dairy an that he could let it to him.  I cannot issue enough warnings about this rush into dairying, particularly by those in the beef dry stock area.  It might sound great but, Lord save us, it involves a level of investment, work and everything else.  Apart from that altogether, I never saw a balloon going up that did not come down.  That is what worries me.  That is the story.  The return is &euro;130 per acre and all that is all subsides.</p> <p>  The policy over the years must have been devised by Gay Byrne as there is a little for everyone in the audience.  That is a problem.  We must make our minds up on a policy direction and see where we are to go.  The next round of CAP measures will be the defining time.  It will be time for the Minister to make his mind up because he cannot represent everybody.  If the Minister wants to have a policy objective to make sure we sustain the maximum number of farmers, something will have to happen.</p> <p>  The reason I raise that is there was a vote in the European Parliament today about convergence.  If I am correct, it opted for 75% convergence, which is Big Phil's story, as opposed to 100% convergence, which is the left-wing story.</p></speech>

That is a bit of good news.  It will certainly benefit a significant number of farmers with low-value entitlements.  We should not be shirking or afraid.  There will be many people out evaluating.  We will have the farm organisations thundering in.  Let us protect those for whom this was geared.  Look at the objective of the Treaty of Rome and the Common Agricultural Policy.  The two key objectives of the policy were cheap food for the consumers and sustaining the maximum number of farms on the land.  This is a chance for us to reach out to those objectives.</p><p>Many farm organisations are calling for various new measures to be taken in TAMS.  Is the Minister open to that?

Is there anything the Minister can do to help young farmers?  He will have to grab the bull by the horns and think about stretching into a pot to help young people come onto the land.  An early retirement scheme will have to be looked at again and there will have to be a farm insulation aid grant for young farmers.  The amounts were only between &euro;8,000 and &euro;10,000 but they were very important.</p> <p>  I always look to see how much tuberculosis eradication costs.  The Minister knows my view on that.  We have pious aspirations about 2030 but I will have the Shannon drained before that and TB will still not be eradicated.  I do not know where we are going to go with this.  Some &euro;5.5 billion has gone since it started and another &euro;1 billion is planned.  We will have to look at new ways of dealing with this as it is taxpayers' money.  New Zealand has achieved the objective and they set out to do something about it in Australia too.  Professor Simon More gave us a very detailed talk about it but he also delivered some home truths.  I understand a TB group is looking at an evaluation of the situation and the various methods that could be used.  I do not have a solution but going down the same way of dealing with it between now and 2030, or even 2050, will not work.  Somebody will have to change something.</p></speech>

I could not agree more with the Deputy that if we want to achieve the objective by 2030, doing exactly what we are doing now will not deliver.  It is an ambitious target but it is probably more doable than draining the Shannon.  We have spent &euro;5.5 billion in today's money and the plan is to spend another &euro;1 billion between now and 2030, by which time we hope to have eliminated TB.  It is not that there will be no incidence of TB but we will be below a certain threshold and thus deemed to be TB-free for the purpose of international trade, which will bring its own benefits.</p><p>I have established a working group under the chairmanship of Michael Cronin and the issues it is considering are raising the pulse rate a little bit.  I have deliberately refrained from commenting on any of those issues because it is respectful to the group to allow it to bring forward its proposals.  Representatives of the farming industry are also involved in it.  The challenge is to step outside our comfort zone and embrace new positions on the basis that they are epidemiologically sound and based on science.</p><p>The Deputy will see that allocations this year are up, which does not reflect an increased incidence, though there is a marginal increase, so much as the fact that when a herd contracts tuberculosis now it is more costly because herds tend to be bigger.  The choice is to continue plodding along at the rate we are going or to do something more radical and try to achieve our ambition by 2030.  In that sense, we have to stop thinking all the time about the 3% which get TB and instead ensure the 97% do not get it, while looking after the 3%.  Studies are being done about the impact on deer and we have a badger vaccination programme.  We are spending an awful lot of taxpayers' money but, to make the quantum leap we need to make, we need to do different things.  This committee has had interesting engagement with veterinary personnel and academia, which has been thought-provoking and challenging, but we have to be prepared to listen to different voices too, including those who might suggest doing things somewhat differently.  We also need to look at international best practice and how other places have dealt with the issue.</p><p>The Deputy also asked about TAMS and the possibility of new measures.  Deputy Cahill has previously referred to underpasses and they are always looked for but the scope for manoeuvre is extremely limited.  Some of the early approvals under TAMS were expiring, having originally been three-year approvals.  We changed the scheme to 12-month approvals, with six-month approvals for plant.  The fact that the early ones were expiring gave us some wriggle room, which we used to announce that we would extend the availability of TAMS funding for solar panels in the livestock sector, which was previously confined to the intensive pig and poultry sector.  This is significant and there is significant potential in it but the scope to reopen the scheme is limited as the budget is finite.  It is not that extra money was made available but that some money was not being used, meaning we could include something else in the scheme.</p><p>The debate on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is picking up speed and there were votes in the European Parliament yesterday and today, though I am not <i>au fait</i>with the latest results.  A trend is emerging towards greater convergence.  There are disparities between people who get very large payments and others who get minimal payments and are forced out of farming or into part-time farming.  There is now a momentum to address this.  I support doing so but we need to be careful of the law of unintended consequences.  Last time, people had low gross single payments but they may have received a high payment per hectare.  Others had large tracts of land but got a lower payment per hectare than the average.  One person may have got &euro;300,000 and saw the amount go up while another, with a payment of &euro;10,000, saw it go down.  We need to avoid that situation.</p><p>There is an inevitability around convergence.  Apart from happening internally it is, unfortunately from our point of view, happening externally, with other member states saying they want a greater share of the Common Agricultural Policy budget.  This is challenging for us and that brings me to the overall point, which is that the most important challenge we face is in securing an adequate budget.  We need to encourage young farmers and we do so with top-ups, TAMS, the national reserve, the tax system, stock relief and a new &euro;25,000 credit for succession partnerships, but the best thing we can do for them is to encourage them to see a return for their commitment to the sector.  The age profile in Irish agriculture shows that the youngest are in dairy while the oldest are on the beef side and that tells it all.  Young people do not see the beef industry delivering for them in the long term and that is part of the challenge.</p><p>Part of that involves greater equity in the payments and convergence is part of that process.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the ANC scheme.  More than 1,500 farmers covering 760 townlands have lodged appeals and the closing date is in one week.  There is a very capable appeals panel in place to deal with appeals.  This was a challenging exercise.  It is critical that people tick the box for the ANC scheme when filling out the basic payment application form.  Even if they are excluded under the current revised arrangements, they may succeed following an appeal.</p></speech>

Last week, a Private Members' Bill was introduced in response to the crisis in the beef industry.  A large amount of beef is exported to the EU market.  There is very little recognition of how dependent the Dutch and Danes are on the UK market.  In the case of a no-deal Brexit both countries will seek a home for their products, which will have severe implications on the beef and pig sectors here.  There has not been much discussion on that matter.</p> <p>  The small number of farmers left in the pig sector have gone through an horrendous 18 months or two years.  It looks like the outbreak of swine flu in China will come to their rescue and, hopefully, result in increased pig prices.  The swine flu has been reported in China for about six months and it seems to be having an impact on pig production in China.  The pig industry will disappear shortly if something does not change.</p> <p>  I welcome the presentation made by the Minister but I am disappointed it did not focus more on live exports.  Only a small number of cattle over 12 months are being exported live at the moment.  Deputy Penrose spoke about farmers' dissatisfaction with the grid.  The only way to get competition among processors is through live exports.  When we kill almost 40,000 cattle per week processors do what they like with the primary producer.  That is what has happened for the past six months.</p> <p>  Another issue is the number of cattle the factories are producing.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, must examine this issue.  For two months, nearly 20% of the kill has been factory-owned cattle.  Factories can manipulate the marketplace and control the price they pay to farmers.  In the past five years, we have not seen beef prices increase due to scarcity because the factories are now able to control the market and put their own cattle into the system.  In the past, cattle prices always rose as the end of the beef fattening season in the sheds approached but that no longer happens.  The CCPC is well able to tell farmers what they can do but it is slow to get involved in the monopoly operated by the meat factories.  That must change and it would give farmers some confidence to see some movement on the issue.</p> <p>  With regard to the grid, the way in which the flat classification works has changed in recent years.  Cattle that were classified as grade 4 in the past are now definitely being classified as grade 3, while grade 3 cattle are being classified as grade 2.  These changes in classifications should not happen if we want farmers to have confidence in mechanical grading.</p> <p>  On veterinary inspections, the Minister stated the meat inspection service will receive a substantial increase in funding.  What was agreed following the strike in the sector and how much will the agreement cost?</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose spoke about the 2030 target for eradicating tuberculosis.  Last Thursday or Friday, a farmer told me that his whole herd of between 180 and 190 dairy cows was to be depopulated.  The first question he was asked was whether deer had been on his land.  He replied that deer were constantly coming out of the plantations on to his land.  A fortnight ago, he had a TB test done on his farm and his dairy herd was declared to have TB.  Herd depopulation has occurred a number of times in County Tipperary recently and the common denominator has been deer encroaching on the land.  Until we focus on the role deer play in the spread of tuberculosis, we will not get on top of the issue.  There are people in Wicklow who have chosen not to keep cattle or bovine animals because they could never clear their farms of TB.  Another bunch of farmers in the Killoscully area of Tipperary has heavy plantations and, unfortunately, their herds are all constantly locked up with TB.  It is the same story in Rossmore.  The vast majority of TB outbreaks in County Tipperary occur in areas frequented by deer.  We must recognise that fact.  A cull of deer or tests on the deer population would be very expensive but until we address the issue, we will not make progress in reducing the incidence of bovine TB.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the working group on tuberculosis and the 3% of herds that will be affected by new restrictions introduced for cattle movement and the possibility of indicating on signs at marts how long it has been since a farmer last had a breakdown done on TB.  Farmers will feel very disgruntled if no restrictions are applied to the movement of the deer that are causing TB outbreaks on their farms when the Department then undervalues the stock that leaves their farms.  Discussions are needed before we bring in such restrictions on movement.</p> <p>  How many farmers are participating in the hen harrier scheme?  How many of the farmers who applied to the scheme have not been admitted to it?  It is grand to have a scheme up and running for the hen harrier.  However, as I said when the scheme commenced, the barometer of its success would be if it restored the capital value of the land.  The scheme has given some income to the farmers who have had their lands designated for the hen harrier but it has gone nowhere in respect of restoring the capital value of the land in question.  Some land for planting was worth between &euro;4,000 or &euro;4,500 per acre but is now worth between &euro;800 and &euro;900 per acre because it has been designated under the hen harrier scheme.  Until farmers are compensated to the extent that the capital value of their land is restored, the scheme cannot be deemed a success.  How many farmers have availed of the scheme and how many applications have been refused?  How many farmers have applied but were not accepted for the scheme?</p> <p>  The appeals process for the disadvantaged areas scheme was mentioned.  I presume the Estimates make provision for successful appeals.  When does the Minister expect the appeals process to finish?</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about young farmers and the different incentives available to attract young people to the farming profession.  A scheme for young farmers is essential.  We all know the figures on the age of farmers, which make frightening reading.  A cap has been placed on the amount of incentives a young farmer can get.  Given the increase in stamp duty to 6%, this cap will have a serious detrimental effect on the transfer of land.  It restricts a farmer's access to stock relief.  The Minister is shaking his head in response.  I have tabled questions to the Minister for Finance and unless his answers are incorrect, the cap will have a serious detrimental effect on the incentives that can be availed of by young farmers.  At first glance, &euro;70,000 sounds like a big figure.  However, if stamp duty of 6% applies on a farm of 150 acres, a young farmer will well exceed the ceiling.  The cap will not allow stock relief or any of the tax incentives the Minister mentioned.</p><p>This barrier has to be re-examined.  If I am wrong the Minister for Finance is wrong in his replies to me also, but we can discuss that.</p><p> The Minister mentioned TAMS, which I had brought up previously, and getting underpasses eligible for TAMS.  There would be very significant demand out there for such a measure.  Traffic flows on rural roads are increasing and herd sizes are also increasing.  It would be good, if it was at all possible, to have underpasses incentivised.  I could go over other items in the Vote but those are just the points I wanted to make.  I await with anticipation the Minister's response to me on the &euro;70,000 limit to incentives for young farmers.</p></speech>

A lot of questions were asked there.  On deer and TB, it is my clear understanding that where farmers or communities raise the prospect of deer possibly being a contributing factor to a TB incident, the Department's local veterinary office is quite prepared to have deer samples taken in the local laboratories.  It is not as though the Department is turning a blind eye to the deer issue at all.  In fact, in most of the cases the deer are found not to be the causing factor.  We do, however, have to be open to the possibility of deer being a contributing factor.</p> <p>  The culling of deer is a matter for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, but it is open to farmers whose lands are overrun by deer to apply to the National Parks and Wildlife Service under section 42 of the Wildlife Act for a licence to kill deer.  This is different to a cull in a national park.  It would be a local cull on the basis of incursions on a regular basis.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service deal with this and licences to kill deer are issued.</p> <p>  On the issue of hen harriers - I can get more detail - but all applicants will be included in the scheme by April or May this year.  Everybody who wanted to be in the scheme and who has applied will be in the scheme.  All applications are not in yet but from a recent engagement I had with the project team I understand that they will take everybody in.   </p></speech>

My information is that everybody who has applied and wants to go in will go into the project.  I believe that is about 60% of the eligible area designated for hen harriers.</p> <p>  On areas of natural constraint, ANC, appeals there is budgetary provision for ANCs of &euro;250 million.  The eligible applicants will be divided by the pot of money.  That is how it happens.  The average payment currently works out at approximately &euro;2,500.</p> <p>  With regard to the &euro;70,000 limit on incentives for young farmers, there has been many conversations in the Department with farm organisations, with Revenue and with the Commission on this matter.  The figure of &euro;70,000 was not plucked out of the sky in the 2018 or 2019 budgets.  The figure has been there since the current CAP iteration.  From engagements we have had, I am satisfied that there is an appropriate interpretation now being taken by Revenue on matters to the benefit of farmers.  If the Deputy finds this is not the case I would be interested in hearing it.  That is the engagement I have had and I have seen commentary to that effect also from farm organisations.</p></speech>

The increase in the allocation is &euro;2.75 million.  Members will be aware that there was a situation, which was highly unsatisfactory, where we had industrial action.  That has been resolved and the allocation is up from &euro;18.2 million to &euro;21 million, an increase of &euro;2.75 million in the 2019 allocation.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill spoke about the cattle grading grid.  Different people want the grid to be revisited for different reasons.  I know the background that Deputy Cahill has come from in making this point.  While some farming organisations have a particular view of the world, other farming organisations have an entirely different view of the world but want the same thing to achieve different outcomes.  I have made the point that the grid is not a Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grid.  The grid was facilitated by the Department through the loaning of expertise.  The grid and the payment from the grid is an arrangement between farm organisations and the meat industry.  If our expertise is requested again we would be quite willing but there is no agreed position on this matter between farm organisations as I understand it.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also spoke about live exports and I am glad that he did.  We have different views of the world.  I take the view that live exports are important.  The surest way to guarantee that live exports continue is by absolute vigilance on the welfare issues around live exports.  We are adamant and insistent on that.  In 2018, Ireland exported 246,000 head of cattle, of which approximately 160,000 were calves.  To facilitate the calf exports we reduced the levy from &euro;4.80 to &euro;1.20 per calf exported.  In so doing we also brought in the calf exporters and said that they were the beneficiaries to the tune of almost &euro;750,000 just on the levy alone.  I engaged directly with them last July - if my recollection is correct - and there has been ongoing engagement with them by the Department since then and before that.  I have also engaged directly with them every year since I was appointed.  In the middle of year I met them because we knew the issue of additional calves in the system was coming down the track in the spring of 2019.  We asked the exporters to work together and with their contracting lairage providers in France to make sure the issue could be dealt with.  I regret to say this did not happen.  We are, however, committed to live exports.  I was in Turkey recently on a short mission in respect of live exports.  That is an important market and I will also be going to some north African markets later in the year.  We see them as hugely important, and not just for the calves.  Obviously calves hedge off a problem later but there is also the export of weanlings.  We certainly remain committed to that.</p> <p>  On the pork issue, it has been a horrendous 12 to 18 months for those in the pig sector.  On the basis of every cloud having a silver lining, farmers may be pinning their hopes on the incidence of African swine fever, which may mean a rise in prices internationally.  Deputy Cahill referred to the market in China and I am aware of the difficulties happening there with African swine fever.  I hope this happens but I am not in the business of predicting what will happen with prices.  I hope that what the Deputy referred to may happen.</p> <p>  As for beef in the context of Brexit, the Dutch and the Danes in particular, the Deputy's point is true and undoubtedly the case.  In volume of exports to the UK market the Dutch would be really up there.  I believe that 11% of the Netherlands' total agrifood export offering goes to the UK, while it is 40% of ours.  In value terms, however, it is about the same.  Ireland certainly will not be the only ones looking for support but given the volume of product we put into the UK market, one of our arguments to the Commission has been that we need to contain the issue in the UK market or the contagion would spread into all other European Union markets.  We would look for supports for our industry to keep their products in the UK market until such a time as we negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement, which we will.  Hopefully this will be by the short route rather than the long, circuitous route of a crash-out and the carnage that goes with it.</p><p>Certainly in the event of a crash-out and a package being offered, we will not be the only ones looking for support and nor will beef be the only sector looking for support.  We have laid a very solid foundation in this regard, however.</p></speech>

I do not have the same intimate knowledge as other members, as I am not from a farming community.  Looking at the documents the Minister has supplied to the committee, there is no 2018 output.  There is a list of targets but no outputs.  We have no way of gauging how the Department has performed on any of the parameters.  It is regrettable because our view of the Minister's performance is based on outputs and our own knowledge.  Any Joe Soap would see there is nothing here on how the Minister is performing on any of these figures, which is disappointing.  Anything I say will be gauged in this regard.</p> <p>  The key outputs in programme A include the number of food safety and hygiene inspections carried out.

How do we know that 2018 was in any way on target?  We do not have the figures.  Perhaps the Minister has them.</p> <p>  With regard to programme B10, forestry and bioenergy are combined together and there is no way of knowing how they break down.  The 2019 Estimate is for &euro;81.8 million but we have no way of knowing how this breaks down between forestry and bioenergy and with regard to Coillte.  I am interested to know whether the Minister can expand on this.  With regard to the metrics, in 2017 the target for the number of hectares of new forestry planting was 7,100 and the outturn was 5,500.  We do not know the numbers for 2018 or 2019 in order to make a comparison.  With regard to the number of herds participating in the animal welfare scheme, the target was 33,000.</p></speech>

I would like a breakdown of what that &euro;42 million for 2019 accounts for.  With regard to the outputs for the number of aquaculture development licences under programme D, in 2017 the target was 235 determinations and the outturn was 109, which is approximately 50%.  How do we know how many were done in 2018?  We have a target figure but we have no information on the output.</p></speech>

The number of hectares of new forestry planting in 2017 was 5,538 ha.  The target was 7,140 ha.  In 2018, it was 4,025 ha and the target was 6,605 ha.  For 2019, the target is 6,900 ha.  We have been missing the target substantially.  The year 2018 was exceptional in the sense that part of the reason we missed the target was because of the weather.

We have revised the level of grant aid available for various species mix.  All of them have increased.  We hope we can get the targets back on track.  This is very important.  It was the rationale behind reviewing the operational programme for forestry.  It remains to be seen.  There is a narrative, as the Deputy is aware, in certain parts of the country where forestry is considered to be a dirty word.  This is unfortunate.  Deputy Martin Kenny is here and we have discussed this issue previously.  There is a hierarchy of objectives that we need to meet, one of which is climate change.  Trees are a critical part of the solution.  I am not saying they should be concentrated in any given area.  Apart from the climate obligation, they also bring a number of other benefits in terms of employment and income that is tax-free for 15 years.  There is also employment in timber processing and downstream businesses.  We could collectively do well to consider how we could work to promote forestry.  Last week, I deliberately made the point in the Golden Vale and Tipperary that trees should not be the burden of any particular community to carry.  Every farmer and every region should be obliged to consider tree planting in some shape or form.  It is interesting we are having this discussion during National Tree Week.  We have been missing our targets significantly.  Did the Deputy raise another issue?</p></speech>

It is a demand-led scheme.  If it is exceeded we will pay but we are basing our budget on the previous year's applications.  It is true to say the number of ewes in the country is more than the number of applications we receive.  This is unfortunate because it is a sector that could do with support and we have been happy to introduce the scheme.  We have based our provision for 2019 on the take-up of previous years.</p></speech>

They also encompass controls for new activities being carried out in existing approved plants, new approvals for new establishments, inspection visits in preparation for internal and external audits, the close-out of audits and inspection findings and ongoing specific checks for third country criteria.

I am concerned about another issue.  There is an increase in the amount of money for Bord Bia.  It has increased to &euro;47 million this year, which is a substantial amount for the promotion of Irish food abroad and so forth.  As the Minister mentioned, much of the work involves going to what are, in effect, third countries, such as the US, Canada, China and so forth, and developing new markets.  That is very welcome.  However, many people would consider that many of those new markets, particularly those that are further away, are for our prime or higher quality cuts of beef.  We all know that a large amount of the beef product produced in this country is the lower quality which ends up in manufacturing beef, and there is a large market for that in Britain.  With Brexit approaching and the pressure that will come in respect of that product, is there an opportunity to emphasise marketing it in other European countries as a possible destination for it?  What are the Minister's views on that?</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose said earlier that the idea of the European Union was to have cheap food.  We need to get away from the cheap aspect, if we can, and talk about quality and affordable food.  The idea of cheap food is our problem.  Irish farmers are not in a position to produce cheap food.  We are in a position to produce very high quality, affordable food to a standard that is well above what many other places can produce.  We must market it in that way.</p> <p>  The Minister indicated that additional veterinary certificates and so forth had to be issued when product is being exported to third countries.  What if we run into a difficulty with Brexit?  While the intention is that we keep the market in Britain with whatever supports we can and that we will continue to supply our food there, will that impose an extra burden?  We will have to produce these certificates because the UK will, in effect, be a third country if there is a crash-out, which is looking more likely every day.  Having to issue all those additional veterinary certificates for export to Britain would impose a huge burden.  They are not necessary at present.</p> <p>  The other issue is not mentioned here, but a review of the veterinary laboratories was carried out over the past year.  What is the position with that?  I recently spoke to in Sligo who are very concerned about the veterinary laboratory there.  A number of laboratories are under review.  What is their status and what is the position with the review?  It is not in the Estimates but I would appreciate it if the Minister could give a view on that.</p> <p>  With regard to CAP, I understand that 2% of the overall budget at European level is being set aside for young farmers.  There will be more autonomy coming back to the member state regarding how it deals with these matters.  Is there an opportunity to increase that perhaps to 3% of the budget?  We need to do that to facilitate more younger people getting into farming.</p> <p>  A large section of Pillar 1 of CAP, I understand it is up to 20%, will be for eco-measures.  One of those eco-measures is something that arises regularly.  Most of the farmers who contact us do so because of a problem with payments.  The main problem is that their basic payments are refused due to penalties being put in place.  The width of hedgerows was meant to be 2 m and when the photographs were taken from the sky, they were 4 m wide because they had grown out.  That was not a problem for the farmer.  In fact, it was good for the farmer, for the environment, for greenhouse gas sequestration and so forth, yet the farmers are penalised for it.  The hedgerow area should be included in the area that would be allowed for Pillar 1 payments under basic payments.  It should have been done at all times.</p> <p>  The other issue relates to TAMS payments.  A considerable number of people who made applications for TAMS payments have been waiting a long time for their applications to be processed.  One farmer told me he had made an application and it was accepted last October.  He was told it would probably be May or June before he would be approved.  If farmers have to wait that long to get the building work and everything else they want to get done for the season completed, it will not work for them.  Can the Minister give his view on the length of time it takes to process applications, particularly those relating to farm buildings?</p><p>I acknowledge that afforestation and biomass were mentioned.  I do not wish to have an argument about it, but one of the main aspects is the tax-free nature of forestry development, which the Minister mentioned.  If every cent farmers made from, say, organic farming was tax free, there would be a lot more people working in organic farming; there would be labour involved, and it would keep communities alive.  However, if forestry development was tax free, 100% all the way through the process, it would cause a problem.  I do not mean that there should not be tax incentives, but the level of tax incentives is excessive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.112" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2019040200002#M00200"><p>On Bord Bia, &euro;47 million is a substantial increase in Exchequer funding, although I do not think the Deputy was making any contrary point, given that he was asking whether we had received the best value for the markets Bord Bia was targeting.  That is always a challenge and I am not a marketing expert, but the team, the board and the executive are very good.  I have a lot of confidence in them and they do a good job.</p> <p>  China, South-East Asia and the wider Asian region have been targeted in Food Wise 2025; it is not a matter of the Department determining where food should be exported.  Generally, it is due to the emerging middle classes looking westwards with their dietary habits and so on, which means that there are opportunities.  As I understand it, the problem with the European market for beef, for example, to which the Deputy referred, is that while there is a market for premium cuts, it is not a growing but a static market.  The growing markets for beef are in Asia.  As an overall percentage, they are small but growing.  We recently read in the newspapers that one of our major processors had secured a new contract to supply more beef.  The Asian market is interested in all cuts, not just premium cuts.  One of the contracts awarded was for part of the fifth quarter.  I visited a restaurant chain, the name of which I cannot remember, on the previous occasion I travelled to China.  In both Japan and China they seek premium cuts and those from the fifth quarter.  There is a market for these products.</p> <p>  In many of these matters the function of the Department is to open markets as generously as we can negotiate.  I may have misled the committee when I indicated that bone-in beef was sought in China because I meant boneless beef.  We are always seeking to improve the terms and conditions of access, but it takes time.  It is a matter of building relationships.  We have been fortunate to have good relationships with the Chinese and the Chinese ambassador in Dublin who is leaving but who has been a great asset to us in that regard.  We open markets, but the industry decides what it sells to the market.  However, I understand that in China the full range of products is being sold.  In the context of Brexit, we have always said the United Kingdom is the best paying market and people are slow to leave it, notwithstanding all of the challenges.  It is important that other doors are opened for exporters, which is how we view our function. </p> <p>  On veterinary certification, we already have to certify our products for third countries to which businesses export.  When the United Kingdom becomes a third country, although it has indicated that it will not request veterinary certification for our products, that may change over time as there may be regulatory divergence, where its standards may change and become different from those of the European Union.  Therefore, it may require certification.  We have factored this into our preparations in respect of the staff who will be required, not just in the Department but also in the HSE, local authorities, abattoirs and so on.  They will all have a role to play in that regard.</p> <p>  On young farmers and the CAP, it is a significant challenge, but we invested 2% of our budget in the young farmer aspect of the CAP on the previous occasion and it met the demand.  However, if there was to be growing demand or if it was considered greater incentives were needed, we could consider increasing it, given that these matters are up for debate.</p> <p>  One of the areas to which the Deputy referred was environmental measures and the climate becoming more mainstream, but that does not cause us to have sleepless nights.  We were on that trajectory before it was popular, with schemes we have piloted and driven such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, its predecessors and the beef data and genomics programme.  It is welcome that the CAP may give us more policy levers to meet our climate change obligations.</p> <p>  While I note the Deputy's point on forestry, the overwhelming majority of the beneficiaries of the tax incentive are farmers, which is as it should be.  I reiterate that we have a hierarchy of objectives to achieve, the most critical of which is planting trees for carbon sequestration.  We need all of the incentives we can have because our level of afforestation, notwithstanding the challenges in certain communities, is far too low.  There are income opportunities for farmers in that regard which far exceed anything they might make on marginal land, if not from anything else, certainly more than they would make from beef production at current prices.  We need to retain the incentives and have re-examined and increased them, which is right in the context of climate climate and carbon sequestration.</p> <p>  On TAMS approvals, the case the Deputy made does not resonate because we have no backlog of approvals.  The Deputy referred to an application made in October 2018 for which approval had not yet been received, but it sounds as though there might have been a documentation deficit on the applicant's part.  If the Deputy wishes to supply me with the details, I will have the case examined.</p></speech>

The laboratories are critical to our offering.  There seems to be a conspiracy theory that, whether it be Sligo, Kilkenny, Athlone, Limerick or Cork - or Backweston which also comes under the microscope when we consider how effectively we deliver services - the agenda is to close or dismantle these services, but the contrary is true.  They are critical to the agrifood industry and delivering services locally that are critical to the integrity of our exports and so on.</p></speech>

I had a query about subhead B10, forestry and bioenergy, but it has been answered.  My other question relates to programme C, policy and strategy.  It appears that the spend is estimated to have dropped by 4% from the figure for 2018.  How does the Minister account for this?</p> <p>  What projects are being funded under the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, that is, the rural innovation and development fund?</p> <p>  On food aid donations to the World Food Programme, how can the disparity between the Estimates for 2018 and 2019 be accounted for?</p> <p>  Why is the sum for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development estimated to be lower in 2019 than in 2018?  I refer to programme E, appropriations-in-aid.</p></speech>

If one removes the big ticket item, namely, subhead C10, under the heading, Brexit resilience measures, one will see that &euro;25 million was drawn down in 2018.  It was accounted for in budget 2017 under the heading of the Brexit loan scheme.  That product is coming to the market and not replicated.  It is, therefore, a significant hit to the subhead.  In the case of the restoration of Johnstown Castle, for example, the cut of 48% is simply due to the fact that the work has been completed and there is no need to replicate the funding in 2019.  Apart from that, it is quite satisfactory overall.  In the case of the horse and greyhound fund, capital spending has been reduced by 3%, but current spending has risen by 6%.  Overall, therefore, there has also been an increase in the horse and greyhound fund.  Generally, the programme is in the black.</p> <p>  On the World Food Programme, as I understand it, in late 2017 we brought forward and made our 2018 allocation because the programme is always seeking earlier payment.</p><p>By the end of 2017, we had made our allocation to the 2018 World Food Programme.  The same thing happened in 2018.  We brought forward the substantial balance of our 2019 allocation and paid it at the end of 2018.  It looks like a drop, but I am advised that, over a three-year period, our commitment is &euro;70 million.  The graph is certainly moving in the right direction.  In fact, we are a substantial contributor to the World Food Programme's budget. </p><p> What was the last question?</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and his officials.  I thank the officials at the Department for providing with the briefing material that has been circulated to committee members.  I inform the Minister that the committee has agreed to proceed programme by programme.  At the outset of consideration of each programme, I will ask the Minister to give a high-level overview of the programme, including the pressures likely to impact on the Department's performance and related expenditure for each programme in 2019.  Members will then be invited to put their questions on a particular subhead in the programme.  I will refer to the briefing document prepared by the Department to guide our consideration of the Revised Estimate.</p> <p>  Deputies Naughton, Lawless and Eamon Ryan are meeting with the chief executive of Facebook and will join us later.  We will commence with programme A on communications, which members will find between pages 12 and 17 in the briefing document.  I invite the Minister to make a statement.</p></speech>

Before I say anything I thank the committee for the huge amount of work it has put into the Citizens' Assembly and the report it recently published on climate action.  I know it took a lot of work and I believe it is the most important issue facing our generation.  I express appreciation for the work and I hope I will be able to do justice to it in our action plan, which is under development.  This is the first time I have come to present Estimates and I thank the committee for its hearing.</p> <p>  The total Estimate is &euro;665 million, &euro;288 million of which is capital investment across all of the briefs.  It covers communications, climate action and the environment.  Specifically on communications, the huge challenge is to ensure people in Ireland can avail of the opportunities afforded by the enormous transformation that digital technology is having on our world.  As members see in the Estimate, there are a number of areas where we make provision.  One is on the capital side, where there is a tentative allocation of &euro;75 million for the proposed State-led intervention and the national broadband plan intervention area.  The committee is familiar with what has happened in this area since 2016.  The number of people with high-speed broadband has increased from approximately 50% to 74% but there remains a figure of almost 25% for whom the commercial market will not deliver high-speed broadband to the standard set out in the specification made at the start of the process.  I am at an advanced point in terms of due diligence being undertaken between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and I hope, as has been indicated by the Taoiseach, that I will be in a position to bring a recommendation to the Government very soon.</p> <p>  The second area to which I draw the attention of the committee is the money allocated to trading online vouchers and to providing digital skills for citizens.  These are both important schemes in their own right, in that they help to ensure people have the opportunity to participate in the impact that digital technology can have on their business, in the case of the trading online voucher, or on their lives, in the case of citizens who have not had experience of using digital technology.</p> <p>  The other two points to which it may be worth drawing the attention of the committee is the work of the Digital Hub Development Agency and the National Digital Research Centre.  The other significant area is the National Cyber Security Centre which, as Deputies probably know, has been significantly expanded in the past two years and is taking on new roles in terms of responding to incidents.  It has found to be very effective in how it responds to incidents.  It is going further under EU directives to have a role on essential services, whereby those services will have to report on a quarterly basis on the adequacy of their preparation to deal with cybersecurity.  Consultation on a new cybersecurity strategy is under way, to be developed over the coming months.  This deals with the top lines in communications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019040200002#B00500"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comments to the wider committee for the work done on climate change.  The Minister has had an opportunity since taking office to look at where the situation with the national broadband plan now rests.  When he looks back at how we got to the position we are in, does he have any concerns about the tendering process and the competitive dialogue process entered into, in particular the decision taken by the Department at the time?  I carefully suggest it was taken in good faith, based on the recommendations to go down the gap funding model.  It was KPMG or perhaps PwC that did a report at the time on the ownership model that would best give the State best value for money.</p><p>At the time the gap-funding model was chosen because two players in the State had very considerable assets deployed from a broadband perspective and because their existence in the process effectively ensured best value for money.  We know that over time both those companies pulled out.  It could be contended that the State should have stalled the horses at that stage, regrouped and taken stock of the situation to ensure we were not left with one pretty small operator as the only potential bidder in the race.</p><p> In a perhaps convoluted way, I come to my question.  Looking back, does the Minister have any concerns that the best path might not have been chosen?  Should greater care have been taken at an earlier stage to ensure the State got best value for money and was not left with just one bidder in the race?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019040200002#C00200"><p>The gap-funding model was chosen for good reason.  The idea was that the State did not have a preconceived notion of how this ambition would best be served.  It wanted to test the market.  It also wanted to ensure that irrespective of the technology that was developed and put in place, there would be an incentive for whoever was operating it to keep it future-proofed throughout its life.</p> <p>  The backdrop to this is that a number of years ago Eir was sold off, meaning that we do not own the vast majority of the network.  The inevitable feature of this intervention area is that it has to graft itself upon an existing network that is in private sector ownership.  I do not pretend that I have read every document from that period when that decision was being taken.  However, it was taken on the right basis that the best way to develop this was to stimulate the private sector to come up with a solution that grafted onto existing assets that were not in public ownership.  That was the best option.  State ownership, in itself, did not confer benefits since it would be a piece of a much wider jigsaw.  That was the backdrop.  I have no reason to suggest it was not the right decision.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's second question, when two of the bidders decided not to proceed, a decision was taken that nonetheless we would continue with the competitive dialogue.  That was taken on the basis that there was an understanding in the Department of the parameters of a successful bid to deliver the sort of solution that was emerging.  It was interesting that all the cost-effective solutions emerging were fibre to the home.  There was confidence that with proper oversight of the evolution of the contract which was undertaken, this would still represent a proper way to finalise a cost of delivering this.</p> <p>  The Department substantially geared up its resourcing to ensure that it could investigate in enormous detail the cost of different elements of a potential roll-out.  The Department has a high level of confidence in the various cost estimates that have been put in place, having shadowed much of the cost-estimation process.  The Deputy could argue, as many have argued, that it would have been better if two remained in the race.  However, given that two or more did not stay in the race, the Department took the necessary steps to ensure that this evolution would be invigilated to a point where there would be confidence in what was being proposed.</p> <p>  Obviously, it is up to Government to decide whether the costs that will now have been identified with the various riders, contract terms, qualifications, etc., represent a decision that it wants to go along with.  I hope to be in a position to bring a recommendation to Government very shortly.</p></speech>

The gap-funding model was the right decision with the information that was available at the time.  However, is it not clear that as the circumstances changed dramatically when both Siro and Eir pulled out, there should have been a review at that stage?  The Government resisted all efforts by the Opposition to have a review at that stage because it was rightly identified on this side of the House that the Government was leaving itself open to one bidder effectively holding it over a barrel.  That now appears to have happened if we are to believe the rather well-informed leaks that we read frequently which suggest that the estimated costs have gone from &euro;500 million to somewhere close to &euro;3 billion.  Is it not clear that it was a failure on the part of Government not to intervene when the fundamentals changed significantly?</p> <p>  Is it not also the case that everyone's back is to the wall?  People are demanding broadband to be rolled out.  We are in the throes of an election campaign and people expect it to be delivered.  We are no closer to doing that because we do not know the ability of the remaining bidder to deliver.  The Department claims that irrespective of who might have won the tender, the same set of subcontractors would be doing the work.  However, will the success or failure of the contractor not be in the project management of such a large-scale project across wide geography with varying and difficult terrain?  Therefore the skill sets required are not just about splicing or tracking fibre along poles.  I know the Taoiseach has an issue in that he believes that fibre goes in the ground, but we will get over that.  As the Minister knows, it principally goes along poles.</p> <p>  Is the really important component of the bidder for this project not the project management piece?  I have searched extensively and I do not see the project management capability of Granahan McCourt, a private finance company based in Boston which has been very good at managing investments.  I would argue that its expertise is in buying and selling and not delivering projects such as this.  Over and above the mistakes that get made - I accept that - or the failure of the Government to intervene when it should have, the question now being asked, I think, is whether we should spend &euro;3 billion and bet the future of the 540,000 premises and homes waiting for broadband on a private finance company based in Boston in the hope that it will somehow develop the project management skills to make such a large-scale project viable.  After the decision to sign a contract, might we not find ourselves two or three years into it having to enforce some of the covenants for failure to deliver?  Would that not be an unmitigated disaster for the people still waiting for broadband?</p></speech>

To put this in context, over &euro;3 billion has been invested in providing high-speed broadband to urban communities.  All the contractors are committing to have fibre to the home in urban areas.  The decision in the programme for Government to adopt an ambition of having high-speed broadband available to every home so no one would be left behind was the right decision.  In the event, all the bidders proposed that fibre to the home was the most cost-effective way of delivering it.</p><p>At the point at which some of the contractors withdrew, the interrogation of what was being offered was well under way.  All three bidders had brought forward proposals in the competitive dialogue.  The Department had a strong understanding, therefore, of the parameters of the programme, the likely cost, the technology options and so on.  Eir continued to the penultimate stage.  Two bidders submitted proposals, which included their assessments of the subsidy required.  At the point that Eir withdrew, it was not at a very early stage, leaving one bidder with no benchmark against which its bid could be judged.  The Department had been involved in the process over a long period and one of the bidders had gone a significant distance down the road.</p><p> On the skills and project management required to roll the plan out, I assure the Deputy that at every point, whenever there was a change in the make-up of the consortium, there was a thorough reassessment of the capacity of the bidder to complete the project.  In many cases, the subcontractors to be used were identical for all the bidders.  It was not a question of hiring people with no experience.  The capacity of the remaining consortium was tested, as was required in the contract, to ensure it was capable of managing the process.  Nevertheless, we recognise that one of the criteria for the success of a project such as this, if it is adopted by the Government, will be the governance put in place by the State to oversee not only the contract but many provisions therein that are designed to protect the taxpayer.  We recognise that we will not rely exclusively on the company and instead we will have our own governance to protect the taxpayer.  We will undertake that work, which will provide a double protection for the State should it decide to proceed with the contract.  I understand the concerns, which have also been expressed by other Deputies in the House.  We have taken them into account throughout my Ministry and I have always cross-examined what is being done to be satisfied that we accommodate, recognise and take into account concerns raised by Deputy Dooley or other Deputies in our management of the situation.  I am satisfied that we have done that, although I will be happy to share more details with the committee in due course, irrespective of how it develops.</p></speech>

What I and most other people are trying to understand is why the two largest bidders, Siro and Eir, which have the greatest assets on the ground, pulled out.  Has the Minister sought to understand why they did so?  Would he give any consideration to the charge that they pulled out because they were of the view that only &euro;500 million had been put on the table by the State and they could not put together a comprehensive business plan that made sense and that protected the assets of their organisations while also making a commitment to roll out high-speed broadband to the 542,000 homes?  If so and if that was their understanding and their reason for pulling out, has the Minister any concerns about how it might play out that the one remaining bidder, which has little or no experience and perhaps haphazardly has remained in the race, will now be handed &euro;3 billion, when the two largest players were of the view that all that was available was &euro;500 million?  As such, they pulled out, leaving all of us at a significant disadvantage.</p></speech>

When does he expect that to be concluded?  When does he expect he will be in a position to make a recommendation to the Cabinet on the way forward?</p></speech>

As I have indicated, at the penultimate stage, before the receipt of final bids, two bidders were submitting proposals, which included their assessment of the subsidy required, and that allowed comparisons to be made.  Both Granahan McCourt and one of the bidders which subsequently pulled out had reached the point where they were making their financial assessments of what it would cost.  I have no reason to second-guess what the companies said about why they withdrew.  They both gave reasons in public and I will not enter a debate about why companies made that decision.  The figure of &euro;500 million which has been kicked around related to an entirely different type of proposal, dating back to a much earlier stage when what was being considered was covering a certain number of villages with a hub point.  It was not intended at that point that service would be delivered to every home and, therefore, the number to which Deputy Dooley refers related to a much narrower concept.</p> <p>  On the timing of the review, I am working to a schedule which the Taoiseach flagged in the D&aacute;il.  He would like me to be in a position to have completed my review and be able to make a recommendation to the Government by Easter.  He also flagged that issues such as Brexit could change the precise timing of the Government's schedule, depending on what is being handled in the context of Brexit.  My objective is to be in a position to bring forward a proposal around Easter.</p></speech>

In 2016, only seven or eight people were employed in cybersecurity but there are now 30 people.  The budget for cybersecurity has been significantly increased in recent years and the provision for it is continually expanding, depending on need.  The new responsibilities being taken on by the 67 essential services that will report will doubtless result in an additional workload for the cybersecurity centre, but we are undertaking an evaluation of that and it is out for public consultation.  There is no doubt that all over the world there is increased concern about cybersecurity, and most administrations are investing additional resources, as are we.</p></speech>

In summary, there is significant support for public service broadcasting and there is a broadcasting licence fee, receipts from which in 2019 will amount to &euro;227 million.  RT&Eacute; will receive &euro;199 million of that to meet its public service broadcasting obligations, while TG4 will receive &euro;36.2 million in separate grant payments as it is no longer processed by the Exchequer.</p><p>Part of the licence fee, &euro;15 million in 2019, is allocated to the broadcasting fund and goes towards supporting initiatives open to all broadcasters through schemes such as sound and vision.  It is designed to encourage creative content from outside of the public service broadcasters, RT&Eacute; and TG4.  The fund has been much welcomed by the Oireachtas.</p><p> A broadcasting Bill is in preparation and was discussed in the House recently.  The Bill will introduce the possibility of new options for collecting the license fee, but that will have to be decided upon.  It will also introduce scope for some of the licence fee to be deployed to reduce the broadcasting levy on local broadcasters.  I know that is something Members of the Oireachtas and members of the committee, Deputy Dooley in particular, are keen to see.  The broadcasting Bill will also afford us the opportunity to debate how the broadcasting fund should be deployed in support of valuable content, both local and national.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019040200002#E00200"><p>One of the contentious issues with the licence fee has been the failure rate with collection, the truancy rate if we want to call it that.  It is estimated at about &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million.  A document prepared by this committee contained proposals on the future funding of public service broadcasting.  It examined putting control of collecting the licence fee into the hands of the Revenue Commissioners and some preliminary discussions took place between the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners.  That might pre-date the current Minister, but perhaps he might enlighten us as to whether those discussions have concluded and what conclusions might have been reached.</p> <p>  Moving to broadening the net for collection, we must examine the consumption of content, to use a rather crude term.  As the Minister knows, the strict definition of a television is what attracts the requirement to have a licence.  There have been major changes in technology and demands for content and much public service content is now viewed on screens not attracting the need for a television licence.  Has consideration been given to broadening the definition to ensure we are capturing the consumption of public service content and that it is being paid for?  There is always some debate about the television licence and the impact of raising the cost.  On the other hand, however, we must take into account how much people are now willing to spend on technology and subscriptions to Netflix and various other pay-per-view channels through Sky etc.</p> <p>  I still think the licence fee represents good value for money for what is being created.  It is often misrepresented that the licence fee is going just to RT&Eacute;.  Most of it does at the moment, but the independent production sector does well out of the sound and vision scheme.  That creative sector is important for the maintenance of our culture and for employment, and it could do much better if more money was available.  The Minister will also be aware, as we have discussed this before, of my wish, and that of the House in a recent Private Members' Bill, that public service news and current affairs, often created by the independent radio sector, be brought under the remit, or at least the funding model, of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</p> <p>  There is a broader space where we can protect and preserve the quality of that content and ensure it is protected in future.  We must face up to the challenges associated with the business owned by our visitor to Dublin today, Mr. Mark Zuckerberg.  He is on a public relations tour and, I am sure, he is hoping to influence the legislation being drafted by the Minister.  I am also sure, however, that will be done independently without being influenced by the public relations spin and lobbying that will undoubtedly be hot and heavy.  It would be useful to hear the Minister's views on these matters and the television licence in particular.</p></speech>

It has declined from 15.3% at the end of 2013, so that represents an increase of 35,000 people from whom it has been collected.  Progress is being made and there is a good deal of effort to try to improve that rate further.  The working group is due to report imminently and it is not going to be far behind schedule.  It was due to report the day before yesterday but I am told the report will be with me shortly.  The question of whether we should be looking at alternative collection methods is explored in the report.  The options include collection by the Revenue Commissioners or putting the collection of the licence fee out to tender instead of the current legislative requirement.  I understand that will be part of the broadcasting Bill because changes in legislation will be required to permit either of those two options.  Turning to how money is used, it surprised me but the size of the broadcasting fund is set by legislation to be 7% of the licence fee.  It is not decided by the Minister or the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Oireachtas will have to consider whether we want to change that.  I fully understand the argument Deputy Dooley is making concerning the importance of local radio.  From my experience, it is an important forum where it is possible to get the time and space to discuss issues and make a case in an environment less prone to fake news.  State aid rules do, however, constrain what can be done.  It is not permissible to support the operating expenses of stations from a fund of this nature.  The broadcasting fund is for creative content.  There will be an opportunity for us to look afresh at these issues when we come to discuss the parameters of the broadcasting Bill.</p></speech>

We will move on to programme C dealing with energy.</p></speech>

The key element in programme C is support for the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Much work regarding energy does not appear in the Estimates, however.  Examples include work done in setting a new goal for renewable energy on our grid or supporting the evolution of the grid to meet our ambitions for microgeneration or renewables.  There is no direct support from the Exchequer so that is not included in our Estimates.  It is, however, part of the national development plan and significant investment is envisaged.  What is in the Estimates is concerned more with the activities of the SEAI.  It has significant supports of which I think most Deputies will be aware.  Those include the better energy homes scheme, the better energy warmer homes scheme, the deep retrofit pilot, the solar scheme and certain schemes aimed at the enterprise sector such as the excellence in energy efficiency design, EXEED, programme for the large industry energy network.</p> <p>  The other initiative I always like to plug is the better energy community programme because it has the most bang for our buck in terms of impact on carbon emissions.  I know County Tipperary has a particular interest in this area because a very successful community scheme has been developed there.  Overall, there are 256 sustainable energy communities.  Some have gone the more in-depth route of being a better energy community, which involves a higher level of investment.</p><p>They are really valuable schemes and it should be our ambition to expand them in the years ahead.  The other thing worth mentioning is that the programme provides &euro;18.6 million to support the purchase of new electric vehicles.  The Deputy will have seen that there has been quite a surge in interest in the purchase of new electric vehicles since the beginning of the year.  The final piece to which I wish to draw the Deputy's attention is the figure of &euro;9.7 million for energy research.</p></speech>

Funding under this programme allows my Department to provide reliable geoscience support for environmental protection and the sustainable development of Ireland's natural resources and to address the health and safety implications of certain historical mining sites.  Funding of &euro;2.75 million is provided for mining services, including some &euro;600,000 for mine safety and monitoring and to develop a detailed plan to facilitate further remediation on the Avoca Mines site.</p> <p>  The programme also includes an allocation of just over &euro;11.6 million for Geological Survey Ireland services, including &euro;7 million for the Tellus and INFOMAR mapping projects.  The Tellus mapping project consists of airborne geophysical measurements and ground geochemical sampling.  Data from the project will allow for improvement in geological maps, new radon mapping and agricultural mineral maps and will also facilitate better land use planning and research.  The INFOMAR project is Ireland's national seabed survey and is managed by the Geological Survey Ireland in co-operation with the Marine Institute.  Under the groundwater programme, Geological Survey Ireland's national network of Turlough flood level gauges will provide key data on Turlough flooding to OPW and the local authorities.</p> <p>  Programme E provides grant funding to Inland Fisheries Ireland, which is responsible for the conservation, management and regulation of Ireland's inland fishery resource.  Inland Fisheries Ireland will continue to deliver its licensing, permitting and enforcement responsibilities and the rehabilitation of our rivers and streams throughout 2019.  The delivery of a wide-ranging set of investments, innovations and promotions under the national strategy for angling development will ensure that Ireland's fish stocks and angling infrastructure are protected and enhanced for both their economic value and their recreational benefit to the communities and visitors they serve across Ireland.  The inland fisheries programme includes an allocation of just under &euro;19.9 million towards the staff costs of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency.  The Loughs Agency is a North-South body and is co-funded on a 50-50 basis by my Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs.  Also included in the programme is &euro;13.4 million for non-pay current and capital expenditure by the two agencies.</p></speech>

We opened a disability facility in Mayo.  Members might have seen it on television last weekend.  This is proof of what is happening with Inland Fisheries Ireland and how it is providing accessibility for everybody.  It was great to see this project being carried out.</p></speech>

The big item here involves funding of &euro;36.9 million for the Environmental Protection Agency.  There is also a significant allocation for the remediation of landfill sites.</p> <p>  The other major item is the climate action fund.  Members will see that &euro;15 million is scheduled to be drawn down from the climate action fund this year.  That reflects the first allocation we made from the fund.  Significant elements in that were the public lighting initiative that operates in virtually every county in the country.  A gas injection scheme looks at anaerobic digestion converted to methane.  The other significant one was the ESB roll out of the electric charging network.  That was the first allocation.  The total allocation was &euro;78 million but it is leveraging &euro;300 million in terms of its overall impact.  This fund came from the Project Ireland 2040, our ten-year plan.  There is a &euro;500 million fund to stimulate innovation in the climate action area.  It has had its first allocation.</p> <p>  I draw members' attention to the &euro;3 million allocated to anti-dumping initiatives.  We have an active call out at the moment for communities to come forward.  We hope 300 community projects can be supported under that.</p></speech>

They are generally 5% or 10% up or down on the previous year.  It is the general way things have gone.  I am not asking the Minister to look into the crystal ball for the next set of Estimates at which we will be looking but when it comes to Programme F, I can only hope that in light of the report that has come from the Joint Committee on Climate Action and the work being done by the Minister that the next set of Estimates at which we will look will not be in the ballpark of increases of 5%.  The Minister mentioned the &euro;500 million that is set out over ten years.  We are all coming to the realisation that there will need to be a seismic shift in that space.  While a couple of million is very welcome in terms of the Minister's announcement yesterday, we really need to be seeing really big announcements if we are to reach the kind of targets we need to reach for the deep retro-fitting of homes.  If we are to tackle the issue of trying to come into line with and have a meaningful impact on the transport and heating sectors, we really have to spend money.  I accept, and the Minister said it in public, that the Government will not be able to pay for this.  The taxpayer will not be able to pay for the kind of change that is needed.  We get that but it is going to take very significant financial incentives that will require the Government on behalf of the taxpayer to puts its hand in the pocket of the Exchequer and put it out there.  There is no doubt that investment in this area is really beneficial in terms of addressing our climate change needs but it will also enhance growth in the circular, or green, economy.  We need to change tack very significantly.  That will take investment and leadership and the only entity that can do that in order to show confidence that this is the track being taken is the Government.  I have no doubt that the Minister knows that but it will be about what the committee can do to assist him in convincing Ministers in other Departments that they must hold off on some of their expenditure in the short to medium term to steer the ship in a different direction.</p></speech>

Much of the change that we need is good in itself.  It pays for itself and produces a better, healthier environment and a more sustainable relationship with nature.  We will definitely have to think about how we persuade people to make the necessary investments.  I do not think we will always increase the grant levels in all cases by any means.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland sees grants as an entry-level method to prime the pump.  We need to come up with self-sustaining ways to fund it and ways in which we can get smart finance in and make it easier for people to undertake some of these investments.  It talks about behavioural economics and building out our capacities to leverage change.</p><p> Regulatory change will also have a role to play to get people to think differently, such as with the near-zero energy buildings or the requirement that all employers with more than 20 car parking spaces will have to have electric chargers by 2025.  Those sorts of nudges do not cost the State anything.  They may cost the private sector something but they are key enabling technologies for the sort of changes that we have to make.  Carbon pricing is another element of that.  When I drove in this morning, even though I have a plug-in electric vehicle, I was still generating carbon.  I am not paying for that carbon.  There is a case that setting a trajectory for carbon prices will help people to make decisions about whether they choose electric, go for retrofit heat pumps or whatever else they change.  There will be many elements in the mix to bring about the change.</p><p> With respect to the Deputies here, there is a sense that there is a broad political consensus that this needs to be done, is one of the challenges that we face as a community, and that we need to get behind the Citizens' Assembly as a process that has leveraged significant change in our community in the past, even things that we would not have dreamt of being possible ten years ago.  We have been able to mobilise change and the model that is being used here with the Citizens' Assembly followed by the committee's work has helped us to mobilise change by citizens and I hope it can on this occasion again.</p></speech>

I think it is at something like &euro;4.5 million.  We anticipate that we will be well short of the end-year target which we were to be at in 2020 so even though there was a bit of a surplus early in the period of 2013 to 2020, when we were below our line and therefore earning credits, we will end up with a significant deficit and provision is being made.</p> <p>  The funding for the EPA is a transition of the EPA's non-pay costs from the environment fund to the Vote and for increases due to EPA staff and pensioners under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.  They are standard increases coming from costs rather than from additional activity.</p></speech>

We have moved on to programme F, which is environment and waste management, but if Deputy Ryan wishes to raise a query on any programmes, I will allow him to make a submission.</p></speech>

We were at that meeting.  Unfortunately, the timing clashed but it was important for our own work to attend that meeting.  I was then stuck in priority questions to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I will be running out the door shortly for another engagement.  No disrespect to the Minister or officials is meant; it is just one of those days.</p> <p>  I will make one broad point.  I think the Joint Committee on Climate Action, of which Deputy Dooley and 18 others are members, as well as myself, did really good work.  Even though there was not consensus on a couple of the issues about taxation, there was widespread agreement on some other measures.  Critically, it provides a good roadmap for how we organise ourselves and the governance of how we will make this leap.  I hope the Government will find it useful when it is drafting its national energy and climate action plan, or whatever it is called now.  I do not know if it is the same as the Minister's plan that is due out around Easter.  We know we have to do the national energy and climate action plan under European governance rules.  I am keen for the Government to open up that process so some of what we have learned from the committee can allow other Members of this House to tease out some complex and difficult issues.</p> <p>  These are Revised Estimates for the present time but the State, Government and this Department in particular should be scaling up and we should be looking at completely different Revised Estimates next October for the following year, and an almost completely different Department.  It should scale back and shut down the exploration division and switch some of the expertise and resources to peat restoration, for example.  I have said a number of times that the Department needs to scale up to do what we want it to do with regard to energy or programme F, environment and waste management.  That might include legislation needed for offshore wind licensing.  We have to be quick to get the resources for that.  I know from personal experience that there are approximately 250 or so civil servants in the Department.  I fear that is not enough.  We should be taking 300 officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and 200 from the Office of Public Works, and transferring them in.  We should build up a Department that is at the centre of this transformational leap that we need to make.</p> <p>  The Minister and his Secretary General suggested in this all-of-Government action plan that the Minister's Secretary General and the Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach have a key role in co-ordinating and organising transition on this scale.  I could go on about some of the governance recommendations for the next half an hour.  The key leap is not just the Minister's Department but pulling all the agencies and regulators with it.  We do things well in this country when everyone is on the same page and everyone understands that there is a long-term political commitment to the scale of change that we need to make.  We are getting close to having that.  I have been asking all along about where our Whitaker is.  We need a Whitaker today to provide the same sort of leadership that was provided in the past in our public service for the scale of change that we need to make now.  It is very substantial, it is urgent and it is almost agreed.  It is not fully agreed but there is a lot of agreement in our political system.  There is an opportunity and the Minister should go for it.</p></speech>

It is right, as we have done in this case, to have the Citizens' Assembly followed by the Oireachtas committee and then a Government plan.  That approach has helped us to undertake significant change in other spheres of Government.  I agree with the Deputy when he says that our Department will need to considerably reorganise and expand its capability to take on this responsibility.  We are assessing the types of expertise we need ourselves and how we need to develop that.  Every part of Government must recognise that this is their up close and personal responsibility, not just the responsibility of a Minister who happens to have "climate action" in his or her title.</p><p>Everyone must understand that there is up close and personal responsibility for them, and it is not just the responsibility of a Minister who happens to have "climate action" in his or her title.  Unless we get that change, we will not deliver this.  The Deputy is right to signal T.K. Whitaker as being a light-bulb moment but interestingly there was not a massive institutional change that he instituted.  It was about a sense of conversion, confidence and self-belief, and about starting to plan to be ambitious, to set targets and seek to reach them.  That first paper that he produced and the first economic plan that followed it were not grandiose documents.  If we go back and look at them now, we will see how simple they were in many ways.  At the time, they were a light shining where none had been shining for many years.  This is something similar.  We must not think that we can push it over there and that is the job done.  I think the committee's report reflects that.  The governance is not about me or my successor reporting.  What is envisaged is for the committee to hold every Minister to account for his or her area of responsibility.  I hope our plan will reflect that.  Notwithstanding that, I accept that we need to beef up our capability.  I was involved in the Action Plan for Jobs process.  One of the things we did early in that process was bring the capability of Forf&aacute;s into the Department, so we had capability to drive and initiate change and interact with wider parts of Government.  It will be the same here.  We need to develop that sort of capability.</p></speech>

In my own constituency in Tipperary we have a large number of solar farms that have gone through the planning process and expended significant funds in acquiring planning permission.  None of them has progressed.  At a time when we are promoting renewable energy, people are very frustrated and annoyed with the delay.  Companies and groups cannot make further investment until they know exactly what return they are going to get.  What is the status of that at the moment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019040200002#H00700"><p>Mr. Manley may correct me on this if I am wrong.  The position is that there are two processes through which solar energy can evolve.  One is the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which is the successor to these refits.  We are now working intensively to develop the capacity to have an auction for that, to be scheduled for about the end of this year.  That will be a technology-neutral auction so whether it be solar, wind or whatever, people can come in and bid on a level playing pitch for access to the grid.</p> <p>  The second piece is the development of microgeneration, which has also been the subject of discussion in the House.  We are obliged to create a microgeneration framework under EU legislation by the middle of 2021 at the latest.  We are examining what it will take to create a microgeneration network.  It throws up some tricky enough issues around pricing, standing charges and so on, which we have to work through.  We are determined that microgeneration should be part of a mix.  It is really important that we encourage people to look at their own energy use and seek to replace what they are doing with renewables.  In some instances, they will have surplus to sell to the grid and that represents the scope for a price for that microgeneration.  Those are the two channels through which this is working.  They will be a significant part of our own plan but we also hope that we will be able to develop them.  There are a number of levers available under the RESS to prevent any one technology from dominating the whole pie, as it were.  There is capacity for making sure that while it is technology-neutral, one technology does not scoop the pool.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019040200002#H00800"><p>My concern was that it be technology-neutral but not the lowest price.  That is important.  There is nascent technology out there and if we are to try to become an industry leader or have some capacity to get ahead of the rest, it is really important that we try at this early stage to get some advantage in the offshore space.  I accept that it is eight to ten years out but if we look at what has happened in the last ten years, and I am not being politically critical here, very little has happened in terms of turning that dial.  There really is capacity to turn the dial if we can capture the offshore wind capability that we know is there.  It would be a terrible loss if we failed to take advantage of the opportunity, not just in capturing the energy but in capturing the investment associated with it and the potential run-off jobs that would come from that.  This is not going to happen by just getting lucky from an auction.  We will have to develop a clear policy ourselves, perhaps separate from the renewable energy piece, which would bring the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on board as well and would seize an opportunity and would put the supports in place.</p> <p>  It is about more than just meeting our demands for renewable energy.  We see a capacity to grow and develop an actual industry here.  There is real opportunity given the timeframe and where we are now within the space.  We have seen it happen with the manufacture of solar technology in China and the drop in cost of the solar PV cells.  They have really come down in price and the same is going to happen with offshore wind as soon as companies reach that critical mass of orders.  There is a great opportunity there but we have to have the appropriate policy in place to make it happen.</p></speech>

As Deputy Eamon Ryan said, we need to upgrade the Foreshore Act.  The Taoiseach is taking a particular interest in driving that forward and there is a cross-Government team working on it.  We also recognise that offshore wind could be lumpy in terms of the units so we will have to look at it differently from just a technology-neutral frame.  We need to recognise that it is very early and we have very significant capacity.  Going back to my old haunts, I was very pleased to be out in Enterprise Ireland recently where it had an offshore network of Irish companies that have formed a network.  They are already selling their capability into the UK offshore but they are a nascent capability.  All going well, we will see the development of their expertise and the scaling up of their operations.</p></speech>

I am Paul McGowan, chairman of the CRU.  As committee members are aware, the CRU is the economic regulator for the energy and public water sectors in Ireland and safety regulator in the energy sector.  Our mission is to protect the public interest in water, energy and energy safety.  My colleagues and I welcome the opportunity to meet the committee today to discuss our role in HE CHP certification and to provide an overview of our decision to award a partial HE CHP certificate to Mayo Renewable Limited.  I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Aoife MacEvilly, who will outline our role in HE CHP certification.  Our directors of energy networks and markets, Ms Karen Trant and Mr. John Melvin, will then provide more detailed information on the certification process and on this particular application.</p></speech>

The aim of this directive is to improve the EU&rsquo;s security of supply by reducing primary energy consumption and decreasing energy imports.  It is also aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way and thereby mitigating climate change.</p><p>The directive specifically addresses HE CHP and provides a detailed methodology and criteria in annexes 1 and 2 on how to calculate the efficiency of the CHP process.  European and Irish legislation, therefore, is detailed, technical and prescriptive.  In 2012, following a public consultation process, the CRU set out its role and detailed guidance on how we would process HE CHP applications in a policy paper which gives further effect to this legislation.  That is CER/12/125. </p><p> The methodology and the engineering analysis carried out on each application can be complex and must be applied by the CRU for all HE CHP applications.  The assessment is based on specific information, including, technical and financial values provided by the applicant, which are then used to arrive at a specific answer regarding certification.  The focus is not so much on the technical specification of the plant itself, although that is examined, but rather on the useful heat produced by the plant and whether this useful heat is economically justifiable and delivers primary energy savings, PES. </p><p> The CRU appreciates the committee has a broad remit and it is concerned with the regional economic impact of our certification decision regarding Mayo Renewable Limited.  We are obliged to balance a range of competing priorities such as competitiveness, security of supply and sustainability when reaching many CRU regulatory decisions.  Our role as the body appointed to certify HE CHP is prescribed in narrow and technical terms.  It does not allow for consideration of broader economic, social or environmental factors.  My colleagues will give an overview of this process but, in short, our role is to take the business case submitted by the applicant and apply the HE CHP methodology as prescribed in law.</p><p> We consider the rigorous application of this methodology important given the significant benefits arising from HE CHP certification.  Those in possession of certificates gain priority dispatch in the all-island electricity market and can also avail of certain Revenue rebates.  In addition, and perhaps most important, HE CHP certificates allow applicants to avail of relevant payments through the renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, scheme.  The REFIT scheme is funded by electricity customers through the public service obligation, PSO, levy charged to their electricity bills.  The REFIT payments for HE CHP are among the highest level of REFIT payments available under the scheme and can be as high as hundreds of millions of euros over the 15-year term. </p><p> To give an example, REFIT payments for a plant of a similar scale to Mayo Renewable Limited, with a 100% certificate and operating at full output, could be in the order of &euro;31.6 million annually, based on 2019 figures.  If similar payments were made each year for the 15 years of the REFIT scheme, the total payable could amount to &euro;474 million.  Members will understand, therefore, why it is so important that the assessment for HE CHP certification is carried out by the CRU in a robust way to protect the public interest.  In addition to the initial certification process, the CRU also audits the HE CHP plants awarded certificates to ensure that they are delivering useful heat and primary energy savings in line with their certification.</p><p> The CRU has amended HE CHP certificates based on actual outcomes following audits.  The HE CHP certificate is not, therefore, enduring in nature and can be amended when circumstances change.  This is also why there is a time limit for planned HE CHP certificates, beyond which a new application must be made if the plant is not operational.  It would be expected after five years that the inputs to the application, including the business plan and economic factors such as prices, would have changed and warrant a new application.  I hand over to my colleague, Ms Karen Trant.</p></speech>

The HE CHP certification process is designed to ensure that the plant meets the high efficiency criteria set out in legislation.  The HE CHP process is defined on the basis of primary energy savings.  Applicants are required to submit all relevant information to substantiate and support an application and to demonstrate qualification as HE CHP.  It is important the applicant demonstrates that he or she meets the criteria.  Applicants and applications will be certified based on available data.  If a plant exists actual data will be used and if a plant is planned then projected data will be used to assess a planned plant certificate.</p> <p>  The HE CHP is used to replace heat generation from conventional fuels in a number of difference processes.  These could include heating swimming pools or drying products such as woodchips and biomass.  We have supplied a picture to the committee of a facility for milk drying.  An economic justification must exist for the process in the absence of CHP.  That is an important point.  A primary energy saving must also exist to achieve HE CHP certification.  What conventional fuel generation process is being replaced?  Examples include oil, gas and diesel.  In the case of a planned plant, the details I have referred to must be shown via the demonstration of an alternative case.  That is a hypothetical business case demonstrating what will be in place in the absence of the HE CHP plant.  </p> <p>  There are a number of components to the process.  They are enshrined in the legislation and we have transposed them into domestic legislation and into our policy document.  Three elements are involved.  The first is useful heat where the applicant must demonstrate that there is an economically justifiable demand for heating or cooling, as the case may be.  This is demonstrated in the case of a new plant by providing an alternative case.  It must show that the business would be commercially viable in the absence of a CHP unit.  The second factor involved is primary energy savings.  If the applicant has demonstrated that the demand is a useful heat then he or she must demonstrate, via the alternative case, that there are primary energy savings.  The CHP plant must have a PES of at least 10% to be certified as HE CHP.  The third element examined is the technical detail.  The CRU uses much granular technical data to assess the technical data and determine the level of subsidy that can be awarded.  </p> <p>  We then examine the overall efficiency.  There are different thresholds to demonstrate overall efficiency.  Regarding Mayo Renewable Limited, the threshold must exceed 80% if it is to receive a 100% HE CHP certificate.  If the overall efficiency is below 80%, then the amount of electrical energy output eligible for the HE CHP certificate is determined on the basis of the power to heat ratio.  If that is not available, the legislation contains a default ratio and that is what would have been used in the case of Mayo Renewable Limited.  </p> <p>  Turning to the certification process, we assess all applications on their own merits.  It is a matter for the applicant to demonstrate, through the data provided to the CRU, that the plant qualifies for HE CHP.  We assess all the documentation and information we receive.  All planned certificates are issued and valid for five years.  The certificate expires if the plant has not become operational in that time and a new application must be completed.  Unlike planning applications, we do not have a mechanism whereby we extend the certificate.  </p> <p>  Importantly, once the plant becomes operational, an audit is carried out 14 months after that date and the actual outputs from the plant are assessed.  For a small number of existing plants, the CRU has changed the level of certification or issued no certification based on changes in the actual performance data of the plant when audited.  Since 2012, the CRU has issued 113 HP CHP certificates.  Of those, 79 have been for existing plants and 34 have been for planned plants.  Some 20% of those 34 were for partial certificates.  No planned plant has become operational or provided actual output data.  </p> <p>  Regarding the application for Mayo Renewable Limited, I have outlined the timeline from when we received the application in May.  We interacted with the company in June, July and August and we were ready in September 2018 to issue a decision.  We then spoke to Mayo Renewable Limited before the recommendation was made to the commission for a final decision.  It then asked for a postponement of that decision so that it could respond with further information.  We agreed to that postponement.</p><p>In October 2018, we appointed new consultants because our existing tender contract had expired.  We brought our new consultants on board and they again reassessed the application.  In October and November, additional information was submitted by Mayo Renewable Limited and in March 2019, having exhausted that process, the CRU issued a decision.  The decision was for a high efficiency combined heat and power certificate for 18%.</p><p> The application from Mayo Renewable Limited was made by a different legal entity from the application that was submitted in 2012, which was submitted by Mayo Renewable Power Limited.  Mayo Renewable Limited submitted three alternative cases.  The first is the one we used to assess the HE CHP certificate.  It does not demonstrate that all of the proposed heat export is useful heat.  Alternative case No. 1 presented by MRL in 2018 demonstrates that if the co-generation CHP plant was not built, it would still be economically justifiable to build but only if a higher efficiency dryer was used.  In its actual business model, MRL proposed a lower temperature energy dryer.</p><p> Alternative case No. 2 presented by MRL was withdrawn because the application of the alternative case could not be assessed on a like-for-like basis.  Alternative case No. 3, which was presented by MRL in 2018, used a data centre to try to demonstrate primary energy savings.  We did not agree that a data centre meets the requirements for an energy generation process for the purposes of the assessment.</p></speech>

As Ms MacEvilly said, the joint committee has a very broad remit.  We are here to defend a &euro;90 million investment, which has already gone into the ground and was invested on the basis of certification awarded in 2012.  While Ms Trant stressed that the company involved was a different legal entity in 2018, the project remains the same.  It is the project that was authorised in 2012 by the body that the CRU replaced.  That authorisation was the key to the &euro;90 million that has gone into the ground.  This figure had not been plucked from thin air.  Construction has taken place, 130 people are working on site and the project offers major potential.  The CRU's decision has caused frustration and this meeting has been arranged to try to get an understanding of it.  What changed in the project, as opposed to the legal entity, between 2012 and 2019 that resulted in a 100% certificate being issued in 2012 and an 18% certificate being issued in 2019?</p> <p>  Ms Trant said that no planned plant has become operational.  I have a few questions to put to the CRU in this regard.  Is it a matter of general concern that considerable investment is made in drawing up applications, which I presume require significant CRU staff time to process, yet none of the proposed plants has become operational.  How does this compare internationally?</p> <p>  Was the CRU's ruling in respect of the data centre based on policy or judgment?  How does it stack up internationally?  Those are my questions for the time being but I will contribute again.</p></speech>

One of the key differences between 2012 and 2019 is the cost of the fuel input.  In 2012, the fuel input was a much lower cost for fuel imported from the United States in a very dry state.  The plant was to take wet biomass from Ireland and dry and sell it in the Irish market.  Appropriately dried wood chips would be a very valuable finished product.  In the 2018 application, the same plant was proposed to be used but using a different fuel input.  The 2018 business plan was to use some 70% of the dried biomass output of the plant to burn in the plant itself.  As this was a very valuable product, the price of the fuel input changed greatly between 2012 and 2019.  In essence, whatever piece of equipment one is using, the economic justification will depend on the cost of the fuel versus the benefit of drying things.  A low cost fuel in 2012 using the particular machine the company included in the application, which was a relatively low efficiency machine, could meet the business case.  It could demonstrate there was a justifiable economic use for the heat in 2012.</p> <p>  In 2018, however, by using the much more expensive fuel, namely, the finished product of the plant, it would not necessarily be the case that the same low efficiency machine would justify the heat load at that high a price.  The same machine is used in a different way but the key difference is the cost of the fuel input.  What makes economic sense with a low cost fuel does not necessarily make economic sense with a very high cost fuel.  We apply highly technical legislation and the very first step is to ask what is the justification for the heat.  If the fuel is very expensive, one would need a very efficient machine to make it justifiable.  If the fuel is very cheap, as it was in the 2012 application, a low efficiency machine can meet the justifications.  That is a key difference.  It was the same machine but a very different business case.</p> <p>  On the question on the fact that not one planned plant has become operational, there would be a relatively small number of planned plants.  They take a long time to build, perhaps four, five or six years.  There is one other very large planned plant that is tied up with a gas importation terminal and there are other elements behind the particular delay in that piece of equipment coming.  It would not be unusual for the planned plant certificate to pre-date construction or operation by a number of years.  We put a five-year limit on that.  Five years is a reference figure in the European Union legislation that guides this whole process.  Certain elements of those plants are tied in with the refit scheme.  Timelines on the refit scheme also drive when some of the planned plants may commence operations.</p> <p>  On the data centre question, if a data centre is already in place and uses electricity, the processing of the data creates a large amount of heat, which is a by-product of data centres.  This heat may be used to dry woodchip  If a HE CHP plant is built to replace this, no energy will have been saved because the data centre is still generating waste heat and rather than drying the biomass chips, someone is burning biomass elsewhere to dry the biomass chips.  The first of two key steps in the EU legislation is to ask if there is useful heat and a business case for the heat process.  The second key step is to ask if what is being planned makes it more efficient than the alternative.  If the alternative is a data centre, it will use the same energy irrespective of whether HE CHP plant is in place.  In essence, therefore, no primary energy saving will be achieved compared with getting heat from a data centre.</p></speech>

We hope to see more such plants open over time.  Our decision on the data centre is also based on the legal definition of the energy generation process, which is set out in law.</p><p>We could not see any case for the use of electricity in a data centre being considered as energy generation, which is the requirement under both the directive and Irish law.</p></speech>

For example, the publicly available documentation shows that in respect of the period between the last time it obtained an EPA licence and the present, it proposes to use a different fuel.  Similarly, the 2018 application is clear that up to 70% of the finished product will be burned and will be the key fuel for this facility.  That was not the case in the original 2012 application.</p></speech>

Although we cannot take it into consideration in our decision-making, we are aware of that context.  It is open to Mayo Renewable Limited to come in with a new application.  Through this process, we have tried to engage with it and provide it with as much information as we could so that it could understand why the previous application did not meet the criteria so that it might be in a position to put in an application that did.  Having said that, it is very important to say that it must be a realistic application.  It must be credible.  Most importantly, if we give a certain level of certification, if we go back there after the 14 months, it must also be credible in terms of Mayo Renewable Limited being able to demonstrate what the heat used is so that we can renew the certification on the same basis.  The worst case scenario would be for a higher certificate to be issued and a lower certificate to be issued based on the actual data from the plant so it must be credible, realistic and available to audit when we go back after a while.  If it comes in with a new application, we will certainly look at it on its merits.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity to ask questions.  As my colleague outlined, this represents significant investment in the west of Ireland and County Mayo.  There has been a significant outlay of investment.  This project was hugely welcomed by the community so we are very disappointed to see that we are at this stage.</p> <p>  I understand that a question has already been asked around what changed.  Besides the name and the entity, what changed in the project?  I take on board what Mr. Melvin said about the fuel composition changing.  Did anything else change because in her initial statement, Ms MacEvilly stated that the assessment is based on specific information?  When the first application was made, what specific information that was provided in 2012 was not provided in 2018 or have the CRU's processes changed in the intervening period?</p></speech>

In 2012, we published a very detailed process as to how we would process the applications.  We have certainly learned as we have gone through the 113 applications but the process is effectively the same.  The application has changed.  Looking at this from the outside, I appreciate that Deputy Lisa Chambers's question is valid.  It is the same plant.  It is the same technical specification of plant but, as we have explained, the key focus at which we are looking is the business case for the heat use.  That is the data that has changed.  The data provided by the previous applicant, as Mr. Melvin outlined, was about importing a cheap fuel to burn in the plant and then selling a high-quality fuel into the Irish biomass market.  The application we received in 2018 was different.  It had a different business case for the heat use.  As Mr. Melvin has explained, it was using that high-quality fuel within the process to burn as the fuel for the plant.  The economics have changed quite dramatically.  Mr. Melvin might be able to go into this a bit more.  In respect of the justification provided by the applicant, it demonstrated to us that this could be done on an economic basis but by a much more efficient process.  This is why when we issued the certificate, it was a partial rather than a full certificate because in a way, the new application was only demonstrating that part of the output of the plant would be efficient in line with the criteria.  Perhaps Mr. Melvin can address that.</p></speech>

In 2012, the promoter had a business plan that involved a low-cost fuel and a relatively low-efficiency dryer but that made economic sense because the fuel cost is low and the company can use a lot of it to make the finished product.  That stacked up in 2012.  For whatever reasons or perhaps as a result of market changes that took place in the mean time, the business case proposed in 2018 was different.  It now stated that the plant would consume 70% of the high-value finished product and burn it.  In giving the economic justification for that, the applicant demonstrated that at that price of fuel, if the alternative was a high-efficiency dryer, it made economic sense.  We agreed that if the hypothetical alternative is a high-efficiency dryer, it makes economic sense but the big difference is that this high-efficiency dryer that demonstrated the economic sense uses less than a third of the fuel the machine on the ground uses.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Melvin saying that the CRU made it very clear to Mayo Renewable Limited that it was this fuel that was the issue?  Was Mayo Renewable Limited informed all the way through that this was the issue.  Is this the only issue?  Mr. Melvin is stating that the CRU did inform Mayo Renewable Limited.</p></speech>

It has had sight of the report outlining the issues as the consultants or technical experts saw them.  As Mr. Melvin stated, each application is assessed on its own merits and must be within the market conditions as they are today.  Mayo Renewable Limited is aware of the issues we identified within that report.  It is important that, as an applicant, Mayo Renewable Limited is able to demonstrate how it can meet those issues.  It is not up to the CRU to provide advice to relating to that but the report sets out the issues.</p></speech>

Did the commission receive any objections, either before or after the initial granting of the certification, or correspondence from any other entity about the application by Mayo Renewable Limited at any stage of the process?

From discussions with the applicant around that time, I understood that the matter was coming from the US.  This is not my area of expertise but according to the applicant, under US law, one must clear out the thinnings from forestry in order to avoid the risk of forest fires.  Therefore it is a cost to forestry companies and there is a surplus of naturally dried chippings and wood like this.  In essence, it was cost effective to ship that across the Atlantic to Dublin, move it across the country and burn it in Mayo at a lower price than similar fuels could be obtained here.  That was the case at the time and then what the applicant said in the 2018 case was that it was going to burn 70% of its finished product.  That is a valuable product, has a very different price and leads to a very different economic justification.</p></speech>

I assume the applicant will get a certain amount per megawatt up to the level that the commission gives certification for, which is 45 MW.  Surely the duty and need is on the private investor to ensure it is going to make some money out of this and, if it is burning something more expensive, the commission is not going to be handing over any more money.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It just presents a different business case for us to assess.  The Senator is inquiring as to why, if the developer believes it has a justifiable business case, the commission probing beyond that.  That is the nature of the assessment that is set out in law for us to conduct.  Given the scale of the support that is given to biomass HE CHP, it is not enough for the developer to state it can take that large amount of money and come up with a business case and that is sufficient justification.  We are asked, under the law, to consider is this a heat use that would be economically justifiable under market conditions if the CHP plant did not exist.  That is why we are looking at it from a different perspective than, say, the developer.  That is why we ask for an example of how this would be produced in the market in an efficient way.</p> <p>  The simple example we come across when we are looking at a HE CHP plant is where there is an existing heat load.  For example, in the presentation, there was a milk drying unit which perhaps had been using an oil-fired generator to produce the heat.  A HE CHP unit comes along to replace that.  Obviously, there was a business case for drying the milk with the oil-fired unit so we know there is a commercial case for that use and then the HE CHP plant is introduced to replace those oil boilers.  One then has better use of the heat and has created primary energy saving.  That is the simple case.</p> <p>  When it comes to a planned plant such as that in Mayo, it is more difficult to assess and we have to use this alternative case, as we call it, which is almost like a hypothetical judgment around whether, under market conditions, somebody would dry this biomass as a business in the absence of the CHP plant.  That is how the economic case is justified.</p> <p>  A more expensive input means expensive heat to produce so there must be an efficient unit to do it and sell it under market conditions.  What has happened in this case is that we have looked at the 2018 application versus the 2012 one.  There is more expensive fuel, more expensive heat, and a less efficient process.  That is why they are falling below the levels which give the full certification.</p></speech>

She is stating that it goes back to what is being fed into the CHP plant.  Going back to the 2012 certification, the plant had been almost half built.  Approximately &euro;100 million had been spent and, on foot of a financial hiccup, the company involved went into liquidation.  I assume that the witnesses is aware that the EPA, ESB Networks, EirGrid and Mayo County Council, which extended the planning, treated this as renewable.  In some way, has the commission not set a precedent in respect of this?  The commission had granted a certificate of high efficiency which would allow the operator to obtain 100% of the feed-in tariff.  The commission is stating that the proposition is not the same as before and has materially changed.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There is a useful heat but is it economically justifiable?  That has changed significantly since the 2012 application.  As to precedent setting, the difference between our process and, say, a planning decision or an EPA licence is that our certification is not enduring in nature.  When we issue the HE CHP certificate for a planned plant such as Mayo, we make it clear to all applicants that it is five years before that becomes operational.</p><p>Aside from the fact that it lasts for only five years, after which a resubmission is required, let us say for the sake of example that MRL had continued under construction and had been completed within the initial timeframe.  Let us further imagine that having done so, it discovered that for whatever reason it was no longer able to source the cheap fuel from the United States and its original business case had changed.  Had we visited after a year of operation and discovered that the actual use of heat and actual process were different from what we had initially certified, we would have undergone a new assessment and would have potentially changed the certification level based on the actual output of the plant.  It is not an enduring certificate; it is always subject to the test and audit we put in place.  It is quite different from the EPA-type licensing process.</p></speech>

What exactly has been learned, and what comparable projects are there?  Are there other large-scale combustion operations?  It is my understanding that there are a number of countries where there are similar types of system but they are certified at 100%.  I refer to a number of plants in France and the USA.  How is the CRU different and what has it learned?</p> <p>  This is the first time we have received proper engagement or answers on the issue.  We can get technical, and it is clear that the witnesses are technically-minded people.  I understand that the CRU will meet with the company, which will have technically-minded people present, but the CRU can deal with that.  I would like to speak about policy issues.  I have copies of several reports, ranging from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's report on bioenergy supply in Ireland and a report from Nera Economic Consulting, to reports from Imperial College London and the US Environmental Protection Agency.  Based on a decision of the US Environmental Protection Agency on 23 April 2018, forest-based biomass is treated as carbon neutral in the generation of electricity.  There is a suggestion that biomass is out of favour.  We are in a situation where there is no regulation change and it is virtually the same proposition.  Ms MacEvilly referred to change but I understand that there will be a more indigenous biomass supply chain because an agreement has been entered into with Bord na M&oacute;na.  There will not be, therefore, a large carbon footprint coming across the sea in the form of thinnings from the United States.  More will be sourced locally and, in time, local farmers will grow willow.  It is all part of the mix.  </p> <p>  What has the CRU learned, and where can I or the company read about what it has learned?  It seems that the goalposts have been moved.</p></speech>

While we have a vision to secure a low-carbon future, in the assessment of biomass it is clear that there is a technical process to undergo.  In the case of this particular plant, we have followed the detailed, technical process set out in legislation.  The real issues are the economic assessment, whether primary energy savings are available, and how much useful heat is produced by the plant.  There is nothing in the process that requires it to be biomass or anything else.  It is very much focused on the economic assessment.</p> <p>  The source of the biomass is not relevant to the process.  It is the price of the fuel that is factored into the economic assessment.  Whether it is produced in the US and shipped or whether it is produced locally, the economic case that is put forward concerns the input cost and the revenue from sales.</p> <p>  I will pass over to my colleagues to discuss the process, what we have learned from it and the question about similar plants.</p></speech>

The CRU stated it will not pay the company any more per megawatt, but it is concerned about the cost for the company of the raw material or the biomass that it uses.  The CRU is not concerned, however, about the carbon footprint or the source of the material.  A number of members of the committee spent several months examining how we could reduce carbon emissions, move towards a nearly zero carbon economy and so on, but the CRU is focused on the cost for the company.  We are losing out on having a licensed biomass plant.</p> <p>  I would appreciate to hear what has been learned and what the CRU can tell the company to do.  Did the CRU tell the company that it would not be acceptable if it did not return to the model of importing from the USA?</p></speech>

Rather, the process of economic assessment that we undergo does not consider whether the biomass is imported or indigenous but instead considers the import cost.</p> <p>  On our wider remit and the delivery of meeting targets, we are concerned about working towards those targets, along with all other relevant agencies.  As we have indicated, a full HE CHP is a very valuable certificate to be awarded, due to the potential dispatch on the network and the potential access to funds.  It is important, therefore, that any body that is certified as such can meet the requirements.</p> <p>  I will pass over to my colleagues to respond to the question on what we have learned.</p></speech>

Given that the company's business case was to dry biomass and sell it into the biomass market, one of the main questions on which we focused during the economic assessment was whether we could establish that there was a biomass market, that there was a market price and that, therefore, there was an economic justification for that degree of heat output.  Several years later, circumstances have changed considerably.  We have a well-established framework for understanding, say, if someone is drying wood chips and selling them, what the market is.  We have learned a great deal about that.  The process has not changed fundamentally but we have a better framework of understanding and testing alternative cases.  For example, we have better experience of knowing what an efficient alternative case is and so on, but that is just due to learning.  It is the same process with the same test in respect of the legal requirement-----</p></speech>

Notwithstanding what the CRU has stated, that is the reality.  There is the economic reality and the national reality of our targets, which brings me to my final question.  I acknowledge that the witnesses have shown forbearance and I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  Was the CRU's judgment affected by the cash-for-ash problem in the North?</p></speech>

It is important to state there is nothing in the application that suggests anything of the sort.  In fact, we can say with hand on heart that this applicant has been completely above board, it has given us information that we consider credible, and we have no issue with it.</p><p>In terms of the rigour of the process, it underlines the public interest requirement to ensure we are not giving a certification level that is higher than is warranted by the application we have received.  That is the only part of the context that comes into it.</p><p> In terms of the learnings from this case, every regulatory process is about continuous improvement and learning.  I do not believe there is any aspect of that learning that would fundamentally change.  If we knew everything in 2012 that we know now, the business case was so strong in 2012 that it would have got exactly the same answer.  We would have to test that again.</p></speech>

We have a report that stated this plant would not be efficient and, therefore, did not get its certification.  On the other hand, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, gave it a high level rating regarding emissions.  The commission examines economic efficiency but the EPA examines emissions.  Who looks at the needs of the planet and the reduction of our carbon footprint?  Where does that all tie in?  There are parallel processes which do not necessarily speak to each other.  If it has happened in this particular case, we need to find a solution quickly because decisions on other plants may be impacted.</p> <p>  The commission referred to another plant which is tied up with a gas terminal.

For example, the current target for renewable electricity on the system is 40% by 2020.  By all predictions, we are going to fall a small way short of achieving 40% but will be quite near it.  Obviously, we play a role in meeting that target, including, for example, delivering a connection policy to connect renewables to the system.  We administer the public service obligation, PSO, levy and we have other functions in ensuring those targets can be met.</p> <p>  High efficiency combined heat and power, CHP, is one of the technologies legitimately identified as assisting towards the achievement of these targets.  For onshore wind, there is a renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, scheme and a soon-to-be renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, which may support a particular technology.  For high efficiency CHP, it has to be certified as such and must achieve the primary energy savings.  Otherwise, it is a biomass power station which of itself delivers on renewable targets, if it were built.  There is some support available for that.  However, high efficiency CHP carries a higher level of support which is why it is subject to additional rigours under legislation. </p></speech>

It is quite open to those legal entities to submit another application.  We will look at them on their own merits.  We do not have a predisposition.

The variables included in the application include not only the plant and its specification but the heat use and the alternative cases.  Many of those variables are financial and include prices of inputs, the sale of the product and cost of capital.  Many variables are not just related to the plant; they are more related to the business case for the heat use and that is the key element that change from 2012 to 2018.</p></speech>

We are very clear that the certificates are not enduring.  For example, a full certificate could be reduced to a partial one at a later point.  If a partial certificate is issued and a plant starts to use the heat in an alternative fashion and it can demonstrate that it meets the criteria for a full certificate that can change too.  It is clear in the process that they can change.  It is not like getting planning permission which is enduring in nature.  Rather, it is something that can change over time and we are very clear about that in our process.  Not only do we issue the certificate for the planned plant based on an application and data submitted, once the plant has been operational for 14 months we review a year of actual operational data and test it to ensure that it is consistent with what was submitted.  If it is not consistent, we will change the certificate.  We have done that in the past, not for a planned plant but for an existing plant.  We made changes to the certification based on what we seen when we tested an audit.</p></speech>

We gave an example in the presentation of existing heat use by a milk drying facility.  As long as the underlying business which requires the heat use remains in place, that justification should remain broadly as per the application.  While that is not a guarantee it provides some certainty for the developer.  There is no doubt that the planned plants are more complex.</p></speech>

That is the business of developers and businesses.  The function of the HE CHP certification scheme is to certify the quantity every year of electricity generated that meets this economic test.  Someone could build a plant beside a milk plant and the milk plant might close.  There is a risk that the user of the heat will close or will not use as much heat as had been anticipated.  In those circumstances, we would have to determine how much heat was used and if there was an economic need for all of that heat.</p> <p>  Similarly, investors take a risk as to the cost of the fuel.  The cost of the fuel could increase to such an extent that the end user no longer wishes to purchase that heat at that price.  There is risk.  We certify every year to ensure that every year the element of electricity that is certified and is available for that higher price is meeting a true economic need.  It can go up and down every year depending on the heat load of the end user and the economics of it.  Significant incremental public moneys are available for HE CHP.  It is our duty under the legislation to certify the quantities, which can go up and down.  What is fixed through the refit scheme is the price for every kilowatt hour that is certified but the quantities that are certified can go up and down depending on market circumstances, the cost of fuel and the desire or throughput of the end user.  Those risks still exist.</p></speech>

The test for high efficiency CHP is defined and set out in legislation.  It is very much a defined function assigned to the CRU.  The process by which we are guided is publicly available.  A certificate, once awarded, is time limited.  All of this is known to the developer.  The processes which the EPA and others go through are separate to that of the CRU.  The CRU process is narrow and defined.  The purpose is to determine if a plant is a high efficiency CHP and does it achieve full certification of 100% or partial certification and at what percentage that should be set.</p></speech>

That is the business case that was put forward and that was the right thing for the promoters to do.  If that is the true and current business plan, it is right for them to tell us that is their plan.  In September 2018, the draft recommendation was submitted to Mayo Renewable Limited.  It asked for a copy of the draft recommendation and it received one.  At that point in time, the promoters could see all of the calculations and all of the views of our advisers.  They asked us to delay the decision-making process.  At that point, if there were any material errors in our analysis, it was open to Mayo Renewable Limited to draw our attention to them.  I do not think there is any debate or difference between ourselves and the applicants that in 2018 they asked to burn up to 70% of the high value product that comes out of the facility.  There is no controversy about that but it leads to a very different business case.  Mayo Renewable Limited, in giving the alternative, acknowledged that the cost of this product is high because it is of high quality.  It proposed a high-efficiency dryer and demonstrated that, given this high-cost fuel, if the alternative was a high-efficiency dryer it would meet an economic test.  However, the dryer uses approximately one third of the heat of the plant that is actually there.  That is the big triggering difference between the decision made in 2018 and the one made in 2012.  Mayo Renewable Limited was aware of all of this information in September 2018 at the latest because that is when it asked for and received a copy of our draft decision.  There is no controversy between us as to the fact that in the 2018 application, the applicant was seeking to burn 70% of the valuable output of the whole plant.  The whole enterprise is to make this valuable finished product and there is no controversy that in 2018, they sought to burn up to 70% of it.  That is a big change and that is the key differentiator.</p></speech>

The data that came through in the application in 2018 differed from the data that came through in 2012.  I appreciate that if one stands back from it, Mayo Renewable Limited would say that the plant has not changed and it is quite right.  It is still drying biomass.  Looking at it from the outside, some of the key features have not changed.  However, our process is around taking the applicants' data and applying the process to it and that data have changed.

The risk is enormous.  It has been pointed out that if one gets planning permission, one can extend it.  There is more flexibility there for obvious reasons but the CRU is not bound by the same flexibility requirements.  That is clearly a problem because &euro;90 million has gone into this project thus far.  We cannot just say, "Sorry, the time is up".  That cannot be the investment and regulatory environment in which these types of businesses are expected to operate.  We are supposed to be moving towards cleaner energy.  We want to encourage this type of investment but we have what appears to be an extremely hostile environment.  I cannot understand it.  Either the process was broken or it is broken now.  We cannot sit back and just accept that this is the way it is.  Have other member states transposed the directive in the same way as us?  Do they have a five-year cut-off point whereby if there is some unforeseen bump in the road and a delay, the investment is lost?  Is that the risk faced by prospective investors?</p><p>If we are trying to encourage this type of business, this example will do much to discourage them.  I would certainly think twice about it.  We must find a way to get through this.  The idea that changes in fuel composition which make the fuel slightly more expensive should cause the certificate to be reduced from 100% to 18% cannot be right.  It seems wrong.  There is an onus on the CRU, as a State entity, to provide investors and businesses with certainty.  The process should yield a similar outcome at least given that pretty much all the key factors are the same.  The only change - and this is disputed - has been the cost of the fuel, yet the certificate has been reduced from 100% to 18%.  We cannot have a regulatory environment which allows that to happen.</p><p> What will be done to save this project and to restore confidence among prospective investors that this will not happen to them?  If this is a real risk for prospective investors, they will not invest in Ireland which will be a problem for us beyond Mayo Renewable Limited.</p></speech>

We can certainly examine whether the five-year period is too long or too short.  However, that does not change the fundamental fact that if Mayo Renewable Limited had proceeded to build the plant within the five-year period and the heat use had changed, the certificate could very easily have changed too.  That is the requirement of the directive.  We are looking at whether this is high efficiency CHP and it is a continuous assessment on an annual basis to ensure that only the correct amount is paid through the renewable support scheme.  It is not terribly different from the position that applies to wind farm developers.  Clearly, 100% of their output is renewable so the high-efficiency test is not necessary but their earnings will be based on how good a wind year it was.  In all markets there are risks that have to be taken on board by the developer.  Some of these can be managed, and HE CHP producers may be in a better position to manage their heat output than the wind industry.  However, that is the nature of investment in different renewable sectors.</p> <p>  Mr. Melvin will explain the point regarding the difference between a full and a partial certificate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Melvin" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019040200002#L00300"><p>The Deputy is correct that an enormous difference can be triggered by relatively small changes in the efficiency of the plant.  As noted in our presentation, the threshold set out in the European legislation is that the overall efficiency of the plant must be greater than 80%.  If, for example, the efficiency of a plant similar to that proposed by Mayo Renewable Limited declined from 80% to 79%, by virtue of the way the legislation is written, it would be determined that rather than 100% of the electricity being HE CHP, as is the case once the 80% threshold has been met, approximately 50% of the plant's electricity would be HE CHP because the 79% efficiency rate falls below the threshold.  The legislation is written in such a way that if the efficiency target is exceeded, the percentage of HP CHP electricity produced in the plant will be set at 100%, whereas if it trips just below the efficiency target, a different set of calculations comes into play.  In the case of a plant such as Mayo Renewable Limited, by virtue of the legislation and the formula it provides, the maximum percentage of HE CHP electricity thereafter would be between 50% and 53%.</p> <p>  On the risk that the entity making the investment makes, our decision is very clear that where the plants are not yet installed or operational, a planned plant certificate in no way guarantees future evaluations will result in continued certification.  That is made very clear in our 2012 decision.  The reason is that we are obliged under legislation to examine annually how much of the electricity in a site warrants the HE CHP certification.  That will vary from year to year.  If the efficiency drops below 80% at any point, the amount of HE CHP electricity drops by virtue of the formula in the European legislation.</p></speech>

We have private generators and we do not want to have a dominant supplier, as was the case with the ESB.  We have moved away from that in the retail and wholesale markets and apparently that is progress.  However, as has been stated, some degree of certainty is needed if we are to attract private investors.  Investment will always involve an element of speculation but there is a point at which people are turned off and they will then move and invest elsewhere.  This occurred in wind generation when transmission issues arose.</p> <p>  We have consultants of international standing retained on this matter and there has been engagement with the CRU.  Aside from the complexity described by the CRU and the methodology it must apply, this process appears to be something of a mystery and companies must take a punt.  My experience is largely with the planning process.  Under the local authority planning process, pre-planning gives a developer a clear indication of the way in which legislation or regulations will be interpreted to enable the applicant to tailor an application accordingly.  I am confident that the people the CRU is dealing with are intelligent enough to modify their proposal if generating electricity using 70% of what they have dried is not considered efficient use.  That the previous proposal to transport wood thinnings across the Atlantic is considered a more viable prospect sounds mad to the general public, me and possibly other members.</p> <p>  Documentation issued by the CRU does not provide conditions or reasons for refusal, as is done by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and other bodies.  It does not indicate that the proposal to use 70% of the dried matter to generate electricity is not efficient under the economic justification grounds.  There is nothing like that.  There is a serious problem here.  None of us needs to have a technical background.  We can try to appreciate what the CRU is doing but we will never step into its shoes.  This process is much too obscure to be healthy or democratic.  We are asking people to invest to create jobs and economic benefits locally, as described, and to help us reach our renewable targets.  We have heard many complaints from people who have not received feedback.  The decision made has surprised everyone.  This meeting has shed some light on the situation but I do not consider it satisfactory.  What the CRU has done leaves an awful lot to be desired.  It would be fine if we were discussing a project that had not been half built already.  The CRU has basically said it has been on a learning curve in the past few years.  That is not acceptable.  I am annoyed and outraged that these people have gone through this.  It took them long enough to get the certificate in 2012.  It was not a knee-jerk reaction.  The the Commission for Energy Regulation, the previous iteration of the CRU, told them it would have to be biomass at a time when peat could not be burned because plants were to be co-fired with peat and biomass.</p><p>Surely the CRU could have communicated with them to tell them the proposal was never going to go anywhere.  We have enough problems with our planning systems but what if local authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la operated like that?  There is a provision for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to tic-tac on strategic planning applications because one has to tease out issues.  I saw the document the CRU issued and it did not give reasons.  If something is not 100%, it is not commercial viable.  It is not academic for them and it is crazy.</p><p> Mr. Melvin spoke of the economic justification.  We heard the case for a renewable heat incentive scheme, which we do not have.  Is he saying that if there was an end market for woodchip, a district heating system or something else and that this would be more economically justifiable than recycling it and burning it in a plant to generate electricity, it would be acceptable?  If Killala wanted a district heating system in the morning, is he saying it would be able to have one?  If the CRU's interpretation was made plain in that way, people would understand it.  The CRU accepted that another European Union country could interpret the directive differently but it does not give our people any benefit of the doubt.  The CRU is on quicksand in relation to this.  It is not at the cut and thrust of the industry, as are the people to whom I am referring.</p><p> The mystery around the engagement in this case is a hallmark of the case.  We do not want to be dragged into this but it has been going for a full year.  The CRU has had two sets of consultants, the first of which carried out due process for the bank, which justified the proposal in its entirety.  My understanding is that this is the reason the consultant went.  Are there not enough resources for the CRU to do the assessments itself?  Why are assessments being handed out to consultants?  It is very unsatisfactory.</p><p> What is the CRU going to do for these people?  If it is now telling them to do X, Y and Z and to import the material from the United States, why did it not tell them to do so in the middle of the process?  If it is acceptable now, with a bit of hocus-pocus, why was it not acceptable back then?  Is it all such a mystery that no one can invest?  Are we going to have no further CHP plans like this?  I am baffled by it all.</p><p> This is a serious issue but I think the CRU is getting the message.  We have skin in the game but there is a national issue in the form of heat and electricity.  It will cost more for input material but we are also going to be fined.  That makes no sense.</p></speech>

We have a very defined legislative role to fulfil relating to the high-efficiency CHP.  Outside of that, we work to ensure that Ireland can meet its renewable targets.  The certification of high efficiency requires a very narrow analysis based on the submission from the developer.  We cannot advise the developer what to put in its application because the economic case has to come from the developer.</p> <p>  We shared our results with the developer in September last year.  At the developer's request, the team decided to hold off on a decision to allow it to make further submissions.  We have agreed to meet the developer to discuss the outcome and it is open to the developer to make a further application.  Other applications are ongoing but we are familiar with the developer and the plant and we would look to progress any future application in the shortest possible time.</p> <p>  On the change of consultants, I reiterate what my colleague said.  The consultant was out of contract and there was no other reason the consultant was changed on this application.  We could not, under procurement rules, use that consultant any further.</p></speech>

We have heard real concerns over the local impact and it was a very difficult decision to take for the commission, even though the advice is clear and the process is very black and white.  We knew the impact the decision could have locally.  We have to come here to give technical, financial and engineering explanations but this is the nature of the role we have been given.  We are doing it to the best of our ability because the public interest is key.  I hear the suggestion that there is no openness in the process and we considered this point when we looked at this case.  We provided a response to the applicant relating to the certification, detailing the rationale for the partial certificate.  I appreciate that somebody who is not immersed in the technicalities and the legal basis of this might not find it clear but we hope it provided some clarity to the applicant.</p> <p>  In the course of this process, we have considered whether we should or could publish more on the applications we receive, as the EPA does.  Our initial concern was that the financial information would be commercially sensitive and that there might also be competition issues but there may be a way of redacting the information and if the committee is giving us feedback to the effect that we should have more openness and transparency around the process, we could certainly take it on board.  We want to improve on that aspect if we can.</p></speech>

Some of the applicants can locate themselves close to an existing user and be part of the development of a new user.  It is available to developers to do all of the things the Senator mentioned.  If industry is located adjacent to the facility that has a use for additional heat, that can increase the efficiency of and economic justification for the facility, be that district heating or co-location with other users.  All that a developer could do to increase the efficient and economic utilisation of the heat would be taken into account in the annual certifications as it got new customers, increased the use of the heat nearby or found new users adjacent to it.  Some facilities have three or four different uses and two or three different customers in their mix.  That is an option for Mayo Renewable Limited or any of the HE CHPs.  This is entirely what the energy efficiency directive is about.  It is to incentivise this approach, hence the higher payment for HE CHP, and create a mechanism whereby the public moneys involved go towards where there is an economic justification and the new equipment is more efficient that it otherwise would be.  All we do in this regard is undertake the role we have been given in legislation to apply the legislation and that test so that the incentive is efficiently applied and goes to where it brings correct benefits.</p></speech>

If that created more demand for heat from a facility like this one, is Mr. Melvin saying that the State would subsidise not only that, but also the generation?  Is that how it will work out?  If there is suddenly an increase in the market for woodchips and a facility does not use its 70% by burning it but by selling it into the market, is that the sort of consideration that Mr. Melvin has in mind?</p></speech>

If the demand for this product took off and Mayo Renewable Limited found a way to use less of its own throughput and sold more of it elsewhere, that would clearly improve the economics of the business.  Applying the legislation, as guided by Europe, we would calculate the useful heat.  In that scenario, the useful heat figure would increase.  The HE CHP's figure could also increase.  If the overall efficiency rate went above 80% for this type of plant, it would automatically get 100%.  If it was slightly below 80%, it would go somewhere slightly lower than 53%.  All of this is done through the application of the formulae in the legislation.</p></speech>

Mr. Melvin is saying that if a facility, instead of burning the 70% itself, brought it up the road to the likes of Coca-Cola and the latter was able to adapt its premises to burn the pellets for the purpose of generating heat or electricity for its plant, the facility could qualify for 100%.</p></speech>

That is difficult for us, as we cannot advise on what is an appropriate business case.  Rather, we are saying that if Mayo Renewable Limited can find alternative uses for the heat and show us the economic justification, we will assess that.</p></speech>

It is ridiculous to think that a facility could bring the woodchips up the road and use it in a different plant but that if it burned them in its own plant to generate electricity, its case would fail.  It would be much more efficient to burn the woodchips on the facility's own premises than to haul it 10 miles or 20 miles away.  That would make no sense, but it is what the witnesses are saying.</p></speech>

The cost of the fuel makes the processes that it is proposing quite expensive.  It is an expensive way to dry woodchips.  That is what we have to keep in mind.  Compared with an alternative process for drying woodchips, for example, a high-efficiency boiler, what Mayo Renewable Limited is proposing is only about one third as efficient.  That is the core problem.  If one has a low cost of fuel and a low-cost energy, one can effectively afford to have a less efficient process and still meet the economic test.  The problem is the cost at which the facility operates and the efficiency of the process that the company has proposed.</p></speech>

What has changed is the business case that the developer submitted.  The business case in 2012 stacked up because there was a low cost of fuel.  With the low-efficiency dryer that the developer installed, it made economic sense.  In its 2018 business case, the developer acknowledged that the facility would burn an expensive fuel that was its own product.  While we agreed that burning this expensive fuel in a high-efficiency dryer made economic sense, the justification the developer gave only used approximately one third of the energy of the actual plant.  This was the case that Mayo Renewable Limited put to us and that we evaluated.  We can only evaluate the cases put to us.  Hence Ms MacEvilly's suggestion that we do not speculate on alternative cases.  We will evaluate any case that is put to us.  This element was a major difference between the 2012 and 2018 cases.  We communicated that to Mayo Renewable Limited when it asked to see our report.  It was, therefore, aware of the difference.  It was for Mayo Renewable Limited to propose a different business case if one was tenable for it at the time.</p></speech>

It is usually based on output rather than capability.  While a wind turbine might have a 5 MW capacity, it will only be paid a REFIT payment based on the megawatt hours that it produces.  The subsidy provided to onshore wind is approximately &euro;70 per megawatt hour.  I will confirm that in writing, but it is of that order.  The subsidy that is paid to HE CHP per megawatt hour is in excess of &euro;100.  There is a considerable difference in the rates that can be paid for different technologies under the current REFIT scheme.  That scheme is now changing and will become the renewable energy support scheme, RESS.</p></speech>

In the case of a power generation facility that is burning biomass in order to produce electricity, for example, the Senator is correct that it may well be able to run on 24 hours a day, seven days a week but it may also be subject to downtime for maintenance and on foot of unexpected outages.  There are risks associated with the operation of such a plant, even though it might seem to be very predictable.  One can never assume that such a plant will achieve 100%.  In the case of a wind project, as far as I am aware, wind developers carry out an awful lot of analysis at their sites to determine the expected average wind yield and what they can expect in terms of output.  They can work out their economics based on that analysis.  We are talking about two very different types of analysis but both include risks to the developer.</p></speech>

It is not just important for Mayo but for the entire country.  It is one of the first HE CHP plants to be planned but many more could come on stream in the future if it is successful and if investors can be found for similar schemes.  However, potential investors would run a mile from such a scheme based on what we have heard today.  Investors would have no confidence in the system given that an application for this project was submitted in 2012 and that those involved were facing bankruptcy by 2018.</p></speech>

I am joined by Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy, director of consumer protection and Vasileios Madouros, director of financial stability.</p> <p>  The Central Bank serves the public interest by safeguarding monetary and financial stability and by working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy.  We treat the dual arms of our mandate &ndash; safeguarding stability and consumer protection &ndash; with equal weight.  Our work in each domain is mutually reinforcing.</p> <p>  Over the past decade, the Central Bank has proactively worked in conjunction with the Oireachtas, the Government, State agencies and international counterparts to strengthen the solvency and stability of the financial sector and enhance protections for consumers.  We believe that a strong consumer protection framework is essential.  This is particularly the case for mortgage borrowers as a mortgage is the most significant financial commitment for most families and individuals.</p> <p>  That is precisely why we advocated for a legislative regime whereby borrowers would be protected regardless of whether their loan was held by a bank or a non-bank.  This is now the case.  Customers whose loans are sold to another firm maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes of conduct issued by the Central Bank.  Firms must comply with these codes by law.  This includes the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, which was put in place in 2009 to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of financially distressed borrowers.  The CCMA includes requirements that arrangements be sustainable and based on a full assessment of the individual circumstances of the borrower and that repossession be used only as a last resort.  Firms must also follow the mortgage arrears resolution process when dealing with borrowers facing arrears.</p> <p>  There is significant support within the broader Irish consumer protection framework for those in arrears, including the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, the national mortgage arrears resolution service, the personal insolvency regime and a court mentor service.  Collectively, these protections have kept the vast majority of distressed borrowers in their homes in spite of the scale of mortgage arrears experienced following the financial crisis.</p> <p>  At the end of 2018, fewer than one in 16 mortgages relating to private dwelling homes were in arrears of more than 90 days.</p><p>In 2018, there were 22,000 new restructure arrangements for mortgages relating to private dwelling homes.  This brings the total number of private dwelling homes loans categorised as restructured to more than 110,000.  In addition, more than 3,000 distressed borrowers have secured personal insolvency arrangements, which return borrowers to solvency, while keeping them in their home in more than 95% of cases .  </p><p> The enactment of the Bill will not offer new or existing borrowers additional regulatory consumer protection and it could have negative consequences for the functioning of the mortgage market, with wider implications for all mortgage borrowers.  Its enactment in its current form would hamper the ability of banks to access market-based sources of financing using mortgages as collateral, such as securitisations and covered bonds.  Access to such forms of finance helps diversify the funding base and achieve lower funding costs relative to issuing unsecured bonds.  Constraints on the ability to mobilise mortgages as collateral to raise funding through these market-based channels could ultimately limit the availability of mortgage credit or increase its cost.  At a time the severe dysfunction in the mortgage market is finally easing, the Bill could unintentionally slow or even reverse that progress.  It would certainly give further pause for thought for any firm considering entering the market as it would increase the cost of doing business in Ireland and effectively limit the funding available for mortgage lending.  We do not believe this is in the interests of current and future mortgage borrowers. </p><p> During the financial crisis, the ability of Irish banks to post securitisations and covered bonds as collateral was crucial to allow them to borrow from the eurosystem to meet their acute liquidity needs.  Total monetary policy lending provided to Irish-domiciled banks rose to a high of &euro;140 billion towards the end of 2010, of which approximately 40% was collateralised by mortgage-related securities.  The Bill would render the type of asset transfers required to use these instruments effectively impossible.  The eurosystem would have concerns about the realisation of such collateral in the event of a counterparty default.  This, in turn, has the potential to restrict the capacity of Irish banks to access central bank funding.</p><p> If banks cannot mobilise collateral quickly in times of financial stress, crises can get worse very quickly.  Although the Bill makes an exception for failing or likely to fail banks, this is not sufficient.  If banks are close to the point where they are deemed failing or likely to fail, they are likely to have taken actions, such as reducing the availability of credit, that will have harmed the economy.  The entire focus of the resilience changes made over the past decade has been to try to prevent banks getting into a situation where they are failing or likely to fail, precisely to guard against the kind of events that trigger damage to the system, businesses, households and consumers.</p><p> The financial crisis serves as a stark reminder of the severe costs of financial instability to society as a whole.  Although there has been significant progress towards repairing the banking system, legacy vulnerabilities remain.  The restrictions imposed by the Bill would reduce the ability of the banking system to absorb future shocks.  Ultimately, these costs would be faced by households and businesses in Ireland.</p><p> Over the past decade, much work has been undertaken to enhance the resilience of the banking system, including increasing capital, reducing non-performing loans, NPLs, and making funding sources more stable.  We continue to expect banks to use a full toolkit to reduce NPLs.  The ability to sell portfolios while ensuring full compliance with statutory consumer protections is important.  Since the 2013 peak, the stock of NPLs held by the retail banks has declined by &euro;67 billion.  Approximately 12% of that reduction was achieved through residential loan portfolio sales.</p><p> In our view, the introduction of the Bill would significantly constrain the ability of banks to engage in portfolio sales and, thus, limit their ability to deal with outstanding vulnerabilities from the crisis.  These constraints would hinder the continued post-crisis recovery of the system and, crucially, reduce the ability of the banking system to deal with any future macroeconomic downturn and deterioration in asset quality.  Put simply, this means the banking system would be more likely to be impaired in times of stress and less capable of supplying credit to households and businesses.</p><p> As the Governor of the Central Bank noted at the meeting of this committee on March 26, the Central Bank has grave concerns about the Bill, given its far-reaching implications for the operation of the banking system and for consumers.  Although designed to give effect to a voluntary code dating from 1991, the regulated financial services sector has changed fundamentally in the intervening three decades, and consumer protection has been significantly strengthened.  The voluntary code has been superseded by statutory codes of conduct and strong and wide-ranging regulatory powers which are underpinned by intrusive supervision.  As such, our view is that the Bill will not offer borrowers any additional regulatory consumer protection; rather, it could have significant unintended consequences to the longer-term detriment of all borrowers.</p><p>In that respect, we concur with the ECB's view that the Bill, at a minimum, should undergo a thorough impact assessment to ensure it is in the best interests of consumers as a whole.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by Mr. Des Carville, head of the shareholding and financial advisory division, and Mr. John Palmer and Ms Gr&aacute;inne Goggin of the banking division.</p> <p>  I welcome this opportunity to highlight briefly the Department's views on the Bill.  As requested, the Department submitted a detailed submission, addressing specific issues as outlined in the new memorandum of understanding on Private Members' Bills.  As the committee will be aware, the Department has engaged fully with committee members on a significant number of Private Members' Bills.  These include Deputy Michael McGrath's Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018; Deputy Pearse Doherty's Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Amendment) Act 2017; Deputy Pringle's Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018; and Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s Central Bank (Amendment) Bill 2018.  In each case, we have sought to engage constructively in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We have sought to give open and honest feedback regarding our views on the proposed legislation and the drafting of each of the Bills.  In a number of cases, we have successfully worked with the Deputies to progress the draft legislation into law, following Government approval to do so.  In particular, we have worked with Members to progress a number of Bills designed to enhance protection for mortgage holders who are in arrears with their lenders.  Specifically, these are Deputy Michael McGrath's Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 and the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform (Amendment) Bill 2019 tabled by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran.</p> <p>  On this Bill, we share the grave concerns expressed by the Governor of the Central Bank when he appeared before the committee last week.  We have two types of concerns about the Bill.  The first relates to the unintended consequences and the second to its timing.  To deal with the second concern first, and as highlighted by the Governor last week, we are concerned about the implications of the Bill for the financial stability of the banking sector and wider economy, coming so close as it does to Brexit.  As regards the unintended consequences, our assessment is that the Bill will lead to higher mortgage interest rates for consumers, reduced availability of mortgage lending overall, potential severe restriction of the Irish banks' capacity to access eurosystem credit, institutions losing their ability to use securitisation, an increase in repossessions by banks as their ability to reduce NPLs through sales would be severely reduced, a reduction in new entrants and less competition in the mortgage market and a significant reduction in the value of the State&rsquo;s shareholding in the various banks.</p> <p>  The Government is strongly of the view that a money message is required.  There are direct and indirect costs to the Exchequer, which we have outlined in our detailed submission to the committee.  The Department also believes that the Bill is unconstitutional as it is currently drafted.  The Bill overrides existing contractual rights for persons who issued mortgages to sell them on to third parties and purports to introduce a unilateral alteration of existing contractual terms for mortgages.  The mortgage holders concerned would have agreed as a condition to borrow that the mortgage could be sold on.  In doing so, the Bill is overriding or abrogating vested private property rights.  Constitutionally, this can only be done in a proportionate manner and where justified by the exigencies of the common good.  After consulting with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance is of the view that the interference proposed by the Bill is disproportionate and, therefore, unconstitutional.</p> <p>  I know that the intention behind the Bill is to help those who believe they will be worse off as a result of their loan being sold.  However, the Bill will confer no additional protections and will only serve to cause significant harm to the mortgage market for consumers and to the economy more generally.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I want to be devil's advocate and flesh out how the Bill would not be of benefit to borrowers in difficulty with the banks.</p><p>Would it not give them more rights in terms of their loans?  This is the premise and I want to test it.  The point has been made that the Bill would bring about an increase in repossessions and interest rates and a lack of competition in the market.  I will not deal with issues such as reduced securitisation, access to the ECB for funding, a reduced value of the State's shareholding or unconstitutionality.  I am interested in the mortgage holders who borrow from banks in good faith and are then concerned when the loans are sold on to funds without them being consulted.  We read in today's newspapers, as have many mortgage holders, that today is the closing date for AIB's &euro;1 billion sale to Everyday Finance.  Will the witnesses deal specifically with why mortgage holders would not be in a better position with regard to keeping their homes under the Bill than the position that pertains at present?  I do not say I agree with the legislation but our job is to test whether the points being put by Deputy Doherty, the Department and the Central Bank stand up to scrutiny.</p></speech>

There is a lot of similarity between the opening statements of the Central Bank and the Department but they are not exactly the same.  I did not mention some of the issues the Senator spoke about, such as constitutional rights, and I did not say that interest rates would necessarily increase.  I understand the thrust of the question.  Ultimately, the way I have been looking at the Bill is that it is as much a question about the overall protections in place for borrowers in distress.  Comparatively, there are strong protections in place in Ireland for mortgage borrowers.  My view, which based on a fair volume of work, is the protections in Ireland are stronger than anywhere else in Europe and probably beyond.</p></speech>

We can also see the effectiveness of these protections if we look at how many loans were in difficulty at the peak of mortgage arrears in 2013 and how much of the crisis has been dealt with through re-engagement and restructuring.  More than 100,000 loan accounts on the books of the banks and non-banks have been restructured.  While I appreciate that borrowers may be in difficult circumstances, so long as they engage with their lenders typically it has resulted in arrangements coming through that have kept them in their homes.</p></speech>

All of their loans could go as a group to a fund.  There are aspects of how the banks operate with which I am not happy but the average mortgage holder has assurance that the banks are in the business of lending long term.</p><p>The banks structure a mortgage over 20 or 25 years.  Their home loans could be sold on to a fund which might be borrowing short and which effectively may be structured to be a short-term loan vehicle, and which is itself borrowing money over a five-year period, yet it is suddenly taking on mortgages that might have 15 or 20 years left.

The framework in place applies regardless of whether a loan originates with a bank or is owned by a non-bank.  Indeed, the retail credit firms have originated about a third of the loans that are on their books.  It would be an odd situation if the State was to be comfortable with a position where people are in a worse position if they take out a mortgage with a retail credit firm than they are with a bank.

Let us say someone was with AIB yesterday and his or her loan is sold on to a fund.  We are told that many of the funds have borrowed short term.  In essence, they are highly geared and they are loan vehicles which borrow from pension funds themselves.  The funds might have borrowed that money for a five-year period but they are taking on loans from banks that might have 20 or 25 years to run.  We are at the coalface dealing with people whose loans have been sold on.  The first inkling they get of their loan being loan sold on is when they get the letter through the post.  We deal with these people on a daily basis and we know the impact is enormous.  What is in the current legislation to address this?  I have concerns and reservations about many aspects of this Bill and we are duty bound as a committee to test the veracity of all its aspects.  No one denies what the Bill is looking to do but I am asking these questions so I can have comfort around it.  Obviously, the regulation has been extended to funds whereas it was previously just with the agents that were operating in the country itself.  What assurance can Mr. Sibley give to mortgage holders that, if their loans are being sold on from AIB, Permanent TSB or other institutions to a fund, they have as good a chance of staying in their homes as they would have if the loans stayed with the institution?</p></speech>

The same regulatory protections are in place regardless.  We engaged with the Oireachtas to make sure they stood both for banks and for retail credit firms - for non-banks - and that was amended in 2015 and, with Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill, it was extended in 2018.  Regardless, all retail credit firms had to engage and comply with our codes.  What we can see in terms of the evidence from our analysis of the information we get both from banks and non-banks is that restructures are taking place and engagement is taking place.  Unfortunately, when there is a loss of ownership, it is in similar proportions to the level of distress in banks and non-banks, and there is not an increased propensity to foreclose in the non-banks to date, based on-----</p></speech>

I would be concerned around what it means for the funding model of firms - of banks - and, overall, how the mortgage market functions in Ireland and the further discouragement for new entrants to lend into the Irish market.  Not only are they using secured funding today but, in relatively recent history, at the height of the crisis, a very significant amount of money, some &euro;140 billion, was the total drawdown from the euro system, 40% of which was based on mortgage security.  At a time of need, the concern or difficulty in accessing that funding would have pretty acute consequences from a financial stability perspective.</p></speech>

However, with this Bill coming in, we would be unlikely to see new entrants, certainly new banking entrants, and so it would stymie competition.

In 2009, we introduced a code of conduct on mortgage arrears, which was of particular importance because we recognised that a number of borrowers had come through the financial crisis and were in financial distress.  That code sought to introduce protections for borrowers who were in or facing arrears and it placed many obligations on lenders, particularly that lenders have in place fair and transparent processes and that they consider each individual borrower's case on its own merits and on a case-by-case basis.  It is quite specific in terms of how lenders, be it banks or non-banks, engage with the borrower up to and including assessing their individual financial position and working with them to come to an arrangement that may, as the Deputy noted, allow them to continue to remain in their homes while still paying back their mortgages.</p> <p>  More importantly, as Mr. Sibley alluded to earlier, in 2015, when we saw a trend emerging of banks selling on loans to non-banks, we very much advocated for the introduction of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, which ensured that the protections afforded under the CCMA follow with the borrowers.  Irrespective of whether people are borrowing with a bank or a non-bank, the protections exist and remain.  Furthermore, we undertook and published a review last year on the effectiveness of the CCMA.  Our findings were very much in the public domain and very much found that, for borrowers who engage with their lenders, the CCMA is working as intended.</p><p>Mr. Sibley referenced these data earlier.  There are more than 110,000 restructured arrangements.  In 87% of those cases, the borrowers are meeting the terms of the arrangements and the arrangements are working for those borrowers.  Our review also found that banks and non-banks are engaging with lenders, are continuing to put arrangements in place and are honouring existing arrangements.  Where a loan has been sold by a bank to a non-bank, existing arrangements are honoured.  We feel there are many protections in the existing consumer protection framework that keep borrowers in or facing arrears at the core of the process and protected.                     </p></speech>

This is an emotive issue.  It is distressing for anyone to be affected by the issue of mortgage arrears.  The Department, and everybody here, has tremendous sympathy for people faced with mortgage arrears and in this particular situation.  We are here today, however, to address the question of whether this Bill actually helps people in those situations.  I have no doubt that the Bill is well intended and I accept fully the bona fides of Deputy Pearse Doherty regarding trying to help mortgage holders in difficulty.  Our role today, though, is to give our honest advice concerning our view of this Bill.  Senator O'Donnell asked what we think are the specific implications for mortgage holders.</p></speech>

I will divide this issue into two.  We have the current mortgage holder and then we have the future mortgage holder.  We are not convinced this Bill will necessarily do very much for current mortgage holders.  The reality is that if institutions cannot sell non-performing loans then the Central Bank and the regulators are still going to insist that they address those loans.   One of the ways those loans could be addressed is by repossession.  It is a plausible scenario that in a situation where loans cannot be sold we could see an increase in repossessions.  Similar to Mr. Sibley, I do not have a crystal ball and I am not trying to predict the future.  I am just trying to give an honest opinion of what might happen.</p></speech>

I am referring to people thinking of buying their first home who are struggling to put together a deposit and pay for a mortgage.   Echoing what our colleagues from the Central Bank said, in a situation where secured lending is more difficult and where the rights of borrowers are even further protected, it is likely institutions will price that into the interest rates they choose to charge.  I note that the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland stated today that this Bill will lead to an increase in the cost of mortgages for borrowers.  The banks, therefore, certainly feel that they will have to price in the risk associated with this proposed legislation.  That would mean higher interest rates.  I cannot say definitively that is going to happen.  It may or may not.  It is, however, a concern we have.</p></speech>

Based on those consultations, our view is that the Bill's proposed interference with contractual law and property rights would be disproportionate and, therefore, unconstitutional.  As the Senator knows, specific sections of the Constitution set out rigorous rights regarding personal property in Ireland.  Those rights require any interference be viewed as proportionate.  There are, of course, occasions when it is possible to interfere with personal property rights in Ireland.  The marital home is one particular case in point.  It is a question as to whether that interference is viewed as proportionate.  Based on the discussions we have had with the Office of the Attorney General, we would not be of the view that this proposed interference is proportionate and the Bill is therefore likely to be unconstitutional.</p></speech>

There is also the broader issue concerning what is fair and proportionate interference with vested property rights in the State.  We have concerns that there are clear constitutional and legal difficulties with the Bill.  There are two provisions in the Constitution that deal with private property rights specifically, namely Article 40.3.2&deg; and Article 43.</p><p>I am not a constitutional lawyer and do not claim to be an expert in constitutional law but the Bill appears to constitute an unjust attack on an individual's property rights and any encroachment on private property rights must satisfy a proportionality test.  There is a question as to whether the Bill satisfies that proportionality test or not.  The committee and the Oireachtas may wish to get its own legal advice on that and that is up to the committee but that is the Department's view on the legality issue.</p></speech>

We have a preliminary paper from that office on that retrospective question but there will be a fuller assessment which will feed into the scrutiny report.  We will be preparing a report and will have to come to a decision about the Bill so the constitutionality question is pertinent.  The Attorney General will not come before the committee and give his view so this is our opportunity to tease that out.  The Central Bank, in its detailed submission, also raised issues on that front.</p> <p>  I brought a Bill through the system relatively recently and Deputy Pearse Doherty has also brought legislation through the system.  My experience is that, to get a Bill all the way through the system, enacted and into law, requires a lot of technical support, buy-in from the parent Department, parliamentary draftspeople and so on.  Is it the position of the Department that it will not be co-operating or supporting the progression of this Bill because the Department is fundamentally opposed to it?</p></speech>

We might as well get down to brass tacks because I have been through this process and know how it works.</p> <p>  The Department has made predictions as to the consequences of the Bill.  It is being quite definitive that it will mean higher interest rates, mortgage interest rates, reduced availability of mortgage lending and restricting the banks' capacity to access the euro system.  We can focus on the last of those for a moment.  Can Mr. Tobin take us through how this Bill, if enacted, would impair the ability of the banks to access liquidity on the euro system if it was so required?  I will park that question if it is not for him to answer.  I have separate questions to ask the witnesses from the Cental Bank and I could stitch that question into those.</p></speech>

We believe that we will need extra resources to assess, on an ongoing basis, the implications of the Bill.  We tend to agree with the Central Bank that it would be appropriate that an <i>ex ante</i>, independent impact assessment of the Bill should be carried out.  We have set out, in quite a lot of detail in our submission, the costs that will arise as a result of the Bill.</p><p>There will be additional costs for the Central Bank and the banks themselves.

At the centre of all of this is the debate around non-performing loans, NPLs, and the requirements of the European Central Bank, ECB, single supervisory mechanism, SSM, to reduce the level of non-performing loans within the Irish banking system down towards European norms or the European average.  Can the witnesses give us a sense of where we are on that front?  AIB made another announcement only yesterday.  All of the banks are now expressing confidence that they will have reached their required level of being at or close to the European norm by the end of the year.  This is moving quickly and the question of whether the Bill applies or does not apply to existing mortgage contracts is pretty fundamental but can the Central Bank witnesses give us an overall sense of where we are on NPLs within the Irish banking system, what level they are at, taking account of recent announcements, and is it the case that they must be at 4% or 5% of a bank's loan book by the end of the year?</p></speech>

They are in or around 10% of the total loan books, having come down from approximately 31% or 32% at peak.  There was a strong push from the Central Bank, before the single supervisory mechanism and as part of it, to continue to drive down non-performing loans in the system in a sustainable way.  This European average is a benchmark, not a formal target.  Typically there are many banks with low levels of NPLs and a few which have relatively high levels.  There are few at the actual average level.  There is a strong push to continue to address the NPL problem.  We are making sure it is done in a way that respects the consumer and ensures they are protected.  There is no hard target to hit European averages by the end of 2019.</p></speech>

We were in Frankfurt a number of months ago and put it to the then chair of the ECB supervisory board, Ms Dani&egrave;le Nouy, who categorically denied that there was any push on the banks to get to any particular figure.  It keeps coming up and the banks keep telling us that they are required to reach the European average by the end of the year.  It seems like someone is not telling us the full story.</p></speech>

We have asked for clear strategies in order to bring down NPLs and the planned operational capabilities to deliver on those strategies.  There is no requirement to hit a European average by the end of 2019.  The European average is used as a benchmark to measure levels of non-performing loans, if banks are above and below that mark, but it is not a hard target those banks are required to meet.</p><p>Much work is being done on non-performing loans and their categorisation, including by the European Banking Authority, and on provisioning of non-performing loans to ensure that sufficient provisions are held against those loans.  I am sure that is affecting the pressure, while the potential need to take additional provisions is affecting banks' desire to address the issue quickly, given that they are incurring additional costs as a result.  It is probably in their interest to reduce the number of non-performing loans more quickly but there is not a hard target.</p></speech>

We can see the aspiration of the Bill and its intent, but we have raised the question of concern as to whether it will truly add to the regulatory protection that consumers have.  One side of that impact assessment is to assess whether it will truly deliver additional protections for borrowers, while another side is to consider independently the risks associated with it.  I have outlined our thoughts on the potential implications for the functioning of the market, from a competition perspective and from a financial stability perspective.  That gives an opportunity to weigh up those implications in respect of the costs and benefits of the Bill.  As one could reasonably expect of any intervention in such an important market, it would be worth doing an impact assessment to ensure that both the intended and unintended consequences are understood and weighed up.</p></speech>

The ECB stated it notes that under Irish law, in order for credit institutions to issue asset-backed securities, covered bonds or special residential mortgage-backed promissory notes, or to create security over pools of credit claims, the underlying residential mortgages must be transferred or, in the case of a security interest, be capable of subsequent transfer.  It went on to state the Bill would render that difficult or impossible.  In simple terms, what will that mean for the ability of the banks to access funding, and what will be the consequences of that?</p></speech>

When the Central Bank appeared before the committee last week, I outlined that the intention behind the Bill is not to affect the access to liquidity, passive securitisation or access to ECB collateral, and that will be easily addressed on Committee Stage.  I would be surprised if other members had different opinions but that is up to them and the Bill is now the committee's Bill.  On ensuring that those areas were exempt, the thrust of the Bill relates to the direct sale of a loan to a vulture fund.  Financial stability was mentioned, but to what extent would that address the issue if those areas were exempt?</p></speech>

If there was an ability to carve out eurosystem funding and wider securitisation, covered bonds and so on, that would address many of the concerns we have.  I am not sure, however, that is so simple to do.  In the example of Permanent TSB, it carried out securitisation through what was was effectively a sale.  Getting into the detail to make that happen would be a challenge but it is one of our most significant concerns with the Bill, although Mr. Madouros might comment further.</p></speech>

In a future downturn, if there is a deterioration in asset quality, one of the main ways that the system can ensure that it will absorb shocks rather than amplify them would be if it has the capacity and a range of tools to deal with the future deterioration in asset quality.  I am not sure, however, that exemption would cover it.</p></speech>

That would potentially remove a tool, given that it would be unlikely for many borrowers to give their consent to vulture funds, which I will come to in a moment.</p> <p>  The banks have taken a hit on these loans.  Are there not a number of other tools to allow the banks to deal with those assets at that point?  It is not the case that they would be left bare when dealing with distressed mortgages.  There are a number of examples, some of which are contained within the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, that are non-obligatory and are not used by many banks, such as debt write-down and other measures that could be used.</p></speech>

The Department provided the committee with a written submission which was all over the media this morning and gives the impression that the Department had a crystal ball, which enabled it to determine that the Bill would result in higher mortgage interest rates for consumers.  Will Mr. Tobin inform the committee if that conclusion was arrived at on the back of what bankers were telling the Department or did the Department undertake an analysis that led it to that determination?  It definitely was not mentioned in the Central Bank's opening statement today.  It is evident from the IBF press release issued this morning that I am ruffling a couple of feathers within the banking industry through this Bill.</p></speech>

Six months on from the enactment of Deputy Michael McGrath's legislation why, in his view, did the warning made on the record at that time by the Department of Finance, namely, that that Bill would lead to higher interest rates on consumers, not materialise?  One could argue that interest rates have fallen.

One of the likely implications of that legislation is that fewer buyers exist for portfolios of loans.  A potential buyer now needs to be a regulated entity and some potential buyers will not want to go through that process.  It may well have had an impact in terms of the price that some portfolio loan sales are attracting.  I think that is a likely result of Deputy Michael McGrath's legislation.  As it has only been in operation for a short time, it is too early to determine its full impact.  All we can do is tell the committee what we think will happen.  We are trying to be as open and helpful as we can with the committee.  I am sorry if what I am saying is not what the Deputy wants to hear.</p></speech>

The issue here is that those who work at the coalface with borrowers and distressed debtors, for example, MABS, which was referenced in both opening statements, tell us that in approximately 75% of cases where loans have been sold advisors report that the sale has both slowed progress and limited options available to the borrower.  That is the reality.  If we were dealing with a fund such as Promotoria, it will not allow mortgage-to-rent.  There are certain options available with a high street bank that vulture funds will simply not entertain.  Is that not the crux of the issue?  While they are regulated in the same way, and the CCMA applies to both in the same way, different offerings are available compared to a high street bank.  One is seriously at risk when dealing with a vulture fund.  Glenbeigh Securities, for example, is a fund that was set up a number of weeks before the sale of 6,000 loans.  There is nothing to stop that vehicle or its servicing agents from increasing interest rates for those with a standard variable interest rate.  However, it is also the case that there is nothing to stop the banks from increasing interest rates.  The difference is that if the banks pushed up interest rates they consider agricultural loans, student loans and deposits.  These vehicles have only one interest, which is to get as much money as possible and make as much money as possible from the sale of the loans from the regulated entity in the first place.  That is where the risk lies, and that is why 95% of those who have had loans sold to vulture funds are in a position of personal distress as a result of this.</p></speech>

They show the various arrangement categories for banks and non-banks.  As the Deputy will be aware, some of the arrangements include interest only and term extensions, among other options.  There are a whole variety of arrangements put in place by the banks and the non-banks, and arrears capitalisation is used by both.  I have not seen the submission from MABS to the committee and so cannot specifically comment on it, but it is clear that banks and non-banks are choosing to put in place a variety of arrangements.  They may choose to implement certain arrangements in different numbers, which may in itself reflect the fact that some of the non-banks tend to be dealing with people in very long-term arrears in many cases.  This reflects the fact that the loan portfolios that are sold are made up of this type of customer.  A different arrangement might be put in place for that type of situation than would be put in place for a customer with fewer arrears.</p> <p>  Looking at the latest repossession statistics, the banks are repossessing many more properties than the non-banks.  The CCMA review carried out by the Central Bank said that it did not see an obvious difference in the treatment of mortgage arrears cases between the banks and the non-banks.</p></speech>

We discussed this matter with the Central Bank last week.  MABS, which is involved now, or the Irish Mortgage Holders Association or the Free Legal Advice Centre, are all telling us a very different story.  Those organisations are saying that this is not good.  In 75% of cases they say that customers have reduced options as a result of having their mortgages sold to a vulture fund.  The doors have to be closed.  The banks are lining up to sell, and the vultures are hovering, ready to pick on the carcass of the economic catastrophe that happened in this State.  We, as legislators, have a duty to protect citizens and to do that in a balanced way.  Putting the code of practice, which has been in place for 28 years, on a statutory footing is the correct way to deal with that.</p></speech>

However, what we have seen in terms of approaches being taken to comply with the CCMA, and in terms of coming up with restructuring arrangements that either have transferred as part of a sale or were put in place post-sale, is that the retail credit firms are complying with the CCMA, engaging effectively with borrowers and offering a range of options.  Within the banks today there are different options and preferences in terms of how different borrowers are being treated and the solutions being put in place.  That is the case in banks and non-banks; there is no difference.  We can see that restructuring arrangements are being put in place.  It is perhaps worthwhile to discuss how we have been engaging with both the bank and the potential buyer in the case of those most material loan sales.  Permanent TSB and Pepper have both been here to discuss the transaction that took place last year, which was a significant transaction involving loans that had primarily been restructured at that point.  We had a very high level of engagement with Permanent TSB, and will continue to have very high levels of engagement with any potential seller to make sure that the risks to individual borrowers in that circumstance are understood and are being mitigated, and that commitments are made by the purchasers to ensure that those risks continue to be mitigated and addressed in longer term, post sale.  The Deputy is correct that we are in the early days of this process, but our engagement through the process, certainly for the most significant sales, makes sure that those risks are understood and that there are commitments from both seller and buyer.  We can discuss that further if it is helpful.</p></speech>

The Central Bank report of last April discussed those in long-term arrears of more than 720 days.  The Central Bank itself has said that more than 50% of those people are likely to lose ownership of their homes, through voluntary or non-voluntary repossession.  That is a significant number of people, and represents some 15,000 homes.  No loan is safe from sale to a vulture fund.  There is nothing to prevent AIB, Permanent TSB or Bank of Ireland from selling a tracker mortgage or group of tracker mortgages in the morning because they believe them to be loss making.  There is nothing that can be done to stop that from happening.  In some European countries that would not be allowed.  Austria and Denmark, for example, do not allow banks to sell performing loans in that way.  Can Mr. Sibley comment on that?</p> <p>  The Department has made known its view on the issue of the constitutionality of the legislation.</p><p>I am mindful that the Department, or at least the Minister on the advice of the Department, told us the same thing when we discussed removing the bank veto.  However, in 2016 the bank veto was removed and we allowed people appeal to the courts and have debt reduction imposed on banks.  We were told that would not be constitutional.</p><p> The committee must do its own work and we have a preliminary view on the retrospective nature of the legislation and how it impacts on contracts.  It is worth putting on record that this view does not state that the proposal is unconstitutional.  We must wait until we have the full advice.  With respect, the problem here is that the Department and the Central Bank, which has a role in consumer protection, are batting for the banks.  While property rights are provided for in the Constitution, they are subject to clear limitations where social justice or the common good come into play.  That is why legislation was introduced in 1976 providing that a married person needed the consent of his or her spouse before selling the family home.  A clause in the Constitution relating to social justice and the common good allowed contractual rights to be torn up and it was specified that the consent of a spouse was needed before a house could be sold.</p><p> The constitutionality of this legislation must be tested in the courts.  We have been here before with Part V, when we were told that it would be unconstitutional.  We were also told that removing the veto would be unconstitutional and we have been told by the Department that it has been advised that this legislation would be unconstitutional.  This should be tested in the courts and we should allow it to proceed because the social good is not served by allowing thousands of struggling homeowners' loans to be sold to unnamed vulture funds which refuse to come before this committee.  None of us knows who they are.  These are vehicles that are set up only weeks before the sales go through.  We know the banks are rubbing their hands and could not believe that Permanent TSB got away with selling performing restructured loans.  They are now all lining up to do the same.  That is what is happening and unless we take action, we will see this calamity unfold.  This legislation is part of addressing that.  </p><p> On Deputy Michael McGrath's comment, if this committee agrees to move the Bill to Committee Stage, I hope the Department will proactively try to shape the legislation to ensure it has the best potential outcome, even if Mr. Tobin may have reservations about it.  This was done previously when the Department opposed the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill and subsequently became involved at a later stage.  I hope there is a point where our paths meet and we can work together to have this legislation enacted.</p></speech>

We are simply giving the Deputy our advice as to our view of its constitutionality or otherwise.</p> <p>  I do not accept the Deputy's view that we are batting for the banks.  We are trying to take a holistic view of the potential implications of this legislation.  We are very mindful of the potential implications for people who are in mortgage arrears.  We are concerned that there could be increased repossession if banks cannot sell their mortgages.  That is one category.  We are also very mindful of people who have existing mortgages, particularly those on standard variable rates who may end up having to pay more by way of higher interest rates because the banks find it more difficult to raise funding.  We are also very mindful of people who wish to take out a mortgage to buy their first home in the future.  As a result of this legislation, the number of lenders in the market may be reduced or there may be higher interest rates.</p><p>I fully accept and understand why the Deputy's focus is on those who are in mortgage arrears.  However, while we must think of those people, given the potential radical nature of this Bill, we must also think of everyone else who has a mortgage and the implications for them.  We must also think about all of those young people who do not yet have mortgages but who would like to have one and what implications this legislation may have for them.</p></speech>

I am just reading on the RT&Eacute; website that the Bill has already been passed by the D&aacute;il.  It passed Second Stage but we are now scrutinising it before Committee Stage.  People following proceedings may conclude it has passed but it clearly has not passed.  We are here to examine, test and try to progress the Bill, or otherwise.  We have a series of briefing documents, including one from the Department of Finance running to 22 pages, a four-page opening statement from the Central Bank, and an European Central Bank opinion of nine pages.  Many of the important points were covered by previous speakers.</p> <p>  The intention behind the Bill, from listening to Deputy Doherty and others, is to deal with the people who are in distress and unable to comply with the original terms of their mortgage and who find their loans being transferred to a vulture fund to enable banks to say they no longer have non-performing loans on their books.  However, as Senator Kieran O'Donnell outlined, the view of many members of the committee, at least for as long as I have sat on it, is that vulture funds have a different agenda.  They are not typically in for the long haul, unlike banks which have branches and a presence, are looking for new business and participate in communities to a greater or lesser extent.  With vulture funds, it is a case of getting in, disposing of the assets and getting rid of the people in the houses being sold, whether tenants or owner occupiers, and, having extracted as much as possible, getting out of the country.  In AIB's Project Beech, a vulture fund is paying 30 cent in the euro for the debt and I presume it will chase all of those loans.  The State still owns three quarters of AIB.  The hit for the write-downs on AIB's loans has been taken by citizens, the shareholder of the bank.</p> <p>  Viewed from the State's perspective - this probably applies more to the Department of Finance -  when tenants or owner occupiers have to leave properties and subsequently present at a local authority seeking housing, the State incurs a cost.  Has an impact analysis or examination of non-performing loans been carried out?  It is fine to try to reduce the percentage of non-performing loans and there are many ways to do that, including restructuring and debt write-down.  Nearly every bank has been before the committee and they all said they would not write down debts on an individual basis.  They will not offer to sell people their loans for 30 cent, 50 cent or 70 cent in the euro, but they will offer these loans to vulture funds.  Last week, the Governor of the Central Bank pointed out the value of having foreign investors because foreign money takes the risk and is coming into the country.  I had not heard that point of view previously.  Ultimately, people will be dispossessed and lose their homes.  Maybe they made bad calls or took on too much debt.  We acknowledge that but if they turn up at a local authority, the State has to rehouse them.  Do the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government consider the possibility of the State acquiring some of the non-performing loans from the banks and dealing with them because ultimately we are passing on distressed loans?</p></speech>

I am looking at statistics for new mortgage lending.  Back in 2006, we were lending around &euro;39 billion in mortgage lending.  That figure now stands at around &euro;8.7 billion, which is a substantial increase on 2013 when the figure was &euro;2.5 billion.  We are probably not back to normal levels of mortgage lending.</p><p>Clearly, what was happening in the so-called bubble years was completely unsustainable and obviously the legacy of that casts a very long shadow.  It has impacted on so many peoples' lives in really awful ways.  The reality is that a lot has been done.  As the Central Bank representatives have said, more than 111,000 mortgage restructures already have taken place.  The personal insolvency legislation that was put in place here has been widely praised internationally.  The Abhaile scheme being operated by MABS is helping.  It should be noted that we have cases of very long-term arrears of four and five years here, which are not seen in other countries simply because others tend to repossess property much quicker than we do.  </p><p> It is an absolute challenge to resolve some of these issues but it is beyond the purview of the Department of Finance to suggest more structures that could be put in place.  That would probably be a matter for our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Clearly the nature of banking in Ireland is changing right now.  On foot of the financial crisis, the traditional banks have shrunk back from lending in a whole range of areas.  They are being challenged by FinTech companies and others.  The likelihood is that the role of non-banks, and I use that term very broadly, across the whole area of banking and not just mortgage lending, is likely to increase in the future.  We may all wish that the traditional high street banks are the ones with which we have to engage forever more but that is not going to be the reality in the future.  It is quite likely that people will be dealing with purely online banks very soon.  It would be a mistake to think that there is only one type of institution that should be able to offer lending services in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am not sure why Mr. Tobin is responding to me in that way because that was not the point I made.  The point I made was that lots of people out there are potentially going to be affected by the transfer of loans to an entity that may not have the same longer-term interest as the entity from which the loan originated.  By and large, the bulk of the &euro;39 billion, which is a staggering figure, was primarily borrowed from the pillar banks at the time.  I accept that some of them are no longer operating on this island but back then FinTech entities were not doing what they are doing now.</p> <p>  Of course, we can all look back at that time and ask what the banks were doing in throwing money at people with very few guarantees in many cases.  They inflated the price of property enormously.  I was a local councillor at the time and the price of property in south Dublin increased enormously because the banks were lending too much money.  If one could get &euro;500,000, one borrowed it and that meant that house prices rose to &euro;800,000 and so on.  These are figures that people in other parts of the country would find staggering but they were quite low at the time in parts of the area I represented.  The banks lent out money which inflated the prices and ultimately, the whole thing came crashing down.  People were left with enormous debts and the value of their properties collapsed.  We know all of that but the point I was trying to make is that people will be turning up at the doors of public representatives, be they councillors, Deputies or Senators, whose homes are repossessed and we will have to find them a house.  The State will either build them a house or accommodate them by way of the HAP or RAS schemes.  The Government should be taking that into account and not allowing some loans to be transferred to vulture funds when those funds are possibly only getting involved to earn a quick buck.  There should be some other vehicle that takes the non-performing loans off the books of the banks and deals with them.  We may need a NAMA-type operation but I get the impression that such a vehicle does not exist.</p></speech>

Certainly from our perspective, some of this may be more appropriate to our colleagues in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I would contend that the State is already very involved in the housing market in Ireland and I would be concerned that when we make interventions in the housing market, there tend to be quite a lot of unforeseen consequences.  It is not only with this Bill that we think there could be unforeseen consequences; it is always a risk when one is dealing with the property market.  I am not sure that the Department of Finance would be recommending any further intervention in the property market right now.</p></speech>

It argues that the draft Bill is essentially a copy and paste of the outdated voluntary code of practice.  What is the Central Bank's view on the code of practice?  Does it deem it to be outdated, voluntary or otherwise?</p></speech>

In 1991 approximately 60% or almost two thirds of mortgage loans were with building societies.  I was not around at that time and not many people who were around at that time are still with the Central Bank but I understand that there was a concern around some of the benefits associated with having a loan from a building society in the context of the demutualisation that was happening in that period.  I think that was in the minds of those who were setting out the code.  The mortgage finance market today is clearly very different today and is much bigger.  It is many multiples of the size it was back in 1991 and there are no operating building societies in the State now.</p><p>Securitisation, the use of collateral, did not feature in the 1990s.  It is a big feature now.  The sophistication of the euro system support is there and, indeed, is acting as a lender of last resort.  Using mortgage collateral has all changed.</p><p> As I understand it, we looked at the code back in 2012 in our review of the consumer protection code and decided at that point that we did not want to put it on a statutory basis.  My personal view is that we should have removed it.  I do not believe it is good practice for us to have voluntary codes that are not being complied with.  We should not have them.  We should have dealt with it then, but we did not.  Our view is that it is being superseded by the nature of how the financial system has changed and, importantly, in the protections that are in place regardless of whether one has a loan with a bank or a retail credit firm.</p></speech>

The full suite of its powers could not be imposed on a voluntary code.  Mr. Sibley rightly said both in his opening statement and just now that it has been superseded by a number of statutory powers through codes, legislation and otherwise, which allow the Central Bank to enforce its full suite of regulatory powers.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses saying there is no single benefit for an individual borrower from this legislation?  There is nothing in it for them at all.  We understand that it annoys banks.</p></speech>

I care about the functioning of the system, how the system serves the economy and consumers, and ensuring that the events that happened in Ireland never recur.  We are trying to give a view in the round of our perspectives on the functioning of the market and how this Bill connects with that functioning.  As I said earlier, I understand why there is a nervousness about this issue and the narrative.  Indeed, I am keen to see the MABS submission and obviously would take that into the increasingly intensive work we do with the retail credit firms.  We are saying that from a regulatory protection perspective, what we expect of firms, bank or non-bank, exists whether a person's loan is with a bank or non-bank.  The protections and our expectations are the same.  We will be increasingly intrusive in our supervision based on the increasing prominence of the retail credit firms to make sure that is the reality.  As has been mentioned and is already the case today, the retail credit firms are writing business in the State today.  We expect that in the business being written and the business being bought, the individual borrowers are treated in exactly the same way and are subject to the same protections.</p></speech>

Would that be a reasonable assessment?</p></speech>

There are some differences between the banks and non-banks in terms of the prominence of certain solutions.  However, all firms, bank and non-bank, are engaging and offering restructuring.  We can also see, and I appreciate that I am talking about individuals here, that as a proportion of the loans that are in distress, currently there is no greater propensity to take legal action by the non-banks than the banks.  It is about the same.  I appreciate how it feels for anybody in those circumstances, but that is the evidence we see.  As I said, we are keen to understand what MABS has submitted and we will take it into our ongoing supervision.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Central Bank is very much involved with the ECB as it is part of the ECB.  Is there anything in its statement?  We did not read it out but I read it.  It is full of nice European jargon and plenty of references to articles, treaties and so forth.  Ultimately, it is obvious that it is not keen on it, and it does not say anything different from what either the Department of Finance and the Central Bank has said.  Is there anything Mr. Sibley wants us to pick up on from its statement?</p></speech>

Under the provisions of the Central Bank's codes any lender, whether it is a bank or not, that intends to sell the loan must notify the borrower two months in advance.  The lender must provide the borrower with the name and address of the buyer of the loan.  If it is going to be serviced by a different party, the lender must provide the contact details for that party as well.  If a borrower is on an arrangement and is meeting its terms, we have very strong expectations for the arrangement to remain in place when the loan is sold.  If the borrower's position changes and he or she is not able to meet the terms of the arrangement, the situation is assessed in line with the CCMA and the borrower's circumstances are taken into account.  Some repayment model that best suits the changing needs or changing financial position of the borrower is then introduced .</p></speech>

For instance, it is confusing that we cannot find out who the beneficiaries of the sale of the Project Glenbeigh portfolio are.

That is why it is so important that any engagement between a borrower and a credit servicing firm, including the process of making decisions around restructuring, is regulated activity and subject to our codes.

The witnesses have made assumptions about increases in interest rates, repossessions, etc.  Could they envisage these properties being sold to vulture funds and flipped?  Could that increase repossessions as well?  The decision could be made overnight.  Somebody is going to pull out of the market.  These vulture funds will make hard business decisions.</p></speech>

Like Mr. Sibley, I fully understand that people may have concerns about their loans being sold to anyone other than the bank they are used to dealing with.  However, the reality is that when loan-owners buy loans there is a profit motive.  They want to realise a benefit as quickly as they can.  To be quite frank, repossession is not a quick process in Ireland.</p></speech>

It is overheated.  A firm might make a business decision on that.  If it owns a lot of properties that are highly valued, in light of the impact of Brexit, etc., it may project that housing prices will fall.  It may make the decision to sell, which could lead to a lot of repossessions.  Could that happen?  Mr. Tobin is very certain about repossessions.</p></speech>

One thing which was overlooked is that while the identity of the purchaser has not been disclosed, there is enough information out there to ascertain the type of purchaser.  It is what we call "patient capital".  It is a long-term pension fund investor that is interested in a very consistent yield rather than flipping an asset quickly.  That is quite important.  The business model of a lot of private equity firms is based around restructuring-----</p></speech>

I do not want to use up my time with that.  I fully understand how they work and the models they use.  I am trying to ask a simple question.  If the vulture funds decided the market had peaked and to sell off many portfolios, could that lead to increased repossessions in the housing market?</p></speech>

Their business model is based on restructuring the portfolio rather than trying to repossess.  That is why the repossession statistics are so low.  They typically sell to somebody else who is looking for a long-term yield rather than a short-term asset play, that is, a quick flip.</p></speech>

I would like to discuss the impact on the economy of introducing vulture funds in the first place and then allowing them to gain a greater foothold.  Has the Department carried out an analysis of the cost of the tax loopholes, for example, under section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997?  How much do they cost?</p></speech>

I am not aware of an impact assessment of section 110.

I am aware that a number of changes have been made to section 110 in recent years and in general.  Deputy Pearse Doherty was probably heavily involved in quite a number of them.  I imagine that, as part of the legislative process, an analysis would have been carried out of section 110.  I am not aware if costings were made.  Like any and all of these legislative provisions, they tend to be kept under review on an annual basis as part of Finance Bill process.  That is probably as much as I can say.</p></speech>

It is something at which we should look as a committee.  I probably took it for granted that the Department would do this.</p> <p>  My next question concerns the loans identified as fitting the non-performing criteria.  Are the delegates satisfied that all of the loans sold fit the non-performing criteria?  Ultimately, the rationale for vulture funds is that we must reduce the level of non-performing loans.  Do we know that this process is not reducing the level of performing loans?</p></speech>

There probably is not much of an incentive for banks to sell performing loans as they are making money from them.  There certainly could be an incentive to sell non-performing loans because the banks may consider they are not making a return on them.  I imagine that in general a bank would want to keep performing loans, unless it was exiting the market.</p></speech>

It was part of its EU-mandated restructuring plan.  As Mr. Tobin said, these transactions occur, but they are generally the exception rather than the norm.  In that case there was a very specific reason related to the state aid implications for the bank.  Such occurrences are the exception.</p></speech>

We would expect them to try to re-engage with the borrower to the extent that they could do so, work through the individual circumstances and restructure appropriately according to the individual circumstances of the borrower and work it out as much as possible.  If the borrower did not engage or if the loan was simply unaffordable, he or she would end up either going through the personal insolvency or legal process.  I expect the process to be followed in the same way by a bank or a non-bank, regardless of where the loan resides.</p></speech>

They are most welcome.  </p><p>The Department of Finance's submission states:</p><blockquote>The Bill is overriding or abrogating vested private property rights.  Constitutionally, this can only be done in a proportionate manner and where justified by the exigencies of the common good.  After consulting with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance is of the view that the interference proposed by this Bill is disproportionate and therefore unconstitutional.</blockquote> <p>Essentially, on balance, so far there seems to be a complete clash of views between the committee and the delegations.  Their view of the vested private property rights under discussion in this context - private property rights and the assets of funds - is that they are entirely superior to the rights of borrowers whose mortgages are being purchased by the funds.  That is my reading of it and the delegates should correct me if I am wrong.</p><p>Both institutions have carried out some detailed work on the funds.  Do they have studies of them that could be made available?  If we could read them, perhaps they might give us a better insight into why the institutions are batting so heavily on the funds' side.</p><p>All of the supporting documentation is in the same vein.</p><p> I am sure the Department of Finance has carried out some kind of assessments of the funds which are buying in to Irish financial institutions, securitising debt and so on.  On oversight of the banks and the Department, I am sure the Department has broadly considered the status of these funds and come to a view that they can properly buy the assets of Irish financial institutions.  As I understand it, when one is carrying out due diligence on a matter one must look at what is happening all the way around in the transaction.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell can correct me if I am wrong.  Assuming that the Department has done the work on the funds, what has it done to assess the economic impact of the actions of the funds on distressed mortgage holders or non-performing loans?  As Mr. Tobin stated, many of these people have restructured mortgages and they are paying them down.  It is likely that the funds buy the loans at a discount of between 30 cent on a euro and 60 cent on a euro.  I ask the witnesses to refresh their memories in that regard.  I am sure Mr. Tobin is aware of the relevant figures for these acquisitions.  What work did the Department carry out in terms of looking at the profile of mortgage holders who are adjudged to be non-performing even though their loans have been restructured and are being paid down?  The crux of the dispute between members of the committee and the Department is that we cannot fully understand the perspective of the Department on this issue.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her questions.  On the constitutionality point which was the first issue raised by the Deputy, obviously, we consulted the Office of the Attorney General and it was on foot of that consultation that we came to the view that the Bill is disproportionate and, therefore, likely to be unconstitutional.  The sale of mortgages is currently carried out with the consent of the owner.  Consent is effectively irrevocably given pursuant to the mortgage contract when it is entered into.  As the Deputy is aware, that tends to be what currently happens.  When one takes out a mortgage, one signs the contract, the terms and conditions of which state that the mortgage may be sold on.</p> <p>  The extent to which property rights may be interfered with is, in our view, dependent on what is proportionate or, essentially, the extent to which the interference is justified and necessary.  There is a justification to interfere with such rights in order to prevent the sale of a family home, such as in a case where the home is being sold without the consent of the spouse.  The power to interfere with property rights in order to prevent the family home from being sold already exists in law.</p></speech>

The bank or brokers commenting on that transaction stated that it was profit and loss neutral and resulted in a quarter percentage point increase to capital and was, therefore, capital accretive.  We have much commercially sensitive information but I am unsure how much of it I may share as, ultimately, it is the bank's information.  I am trying to see whether there is any way I could aggregate the information or try to help the committee by providing some kind of analysis on it.  If it is acceptable to the committee, I will take that issue away and consider what we could usefully do in that regard.</p></speech>

That information is split between bank and non-bank.  We do a significant amount of work on mortgages within banks and non-banks.  Most recently, we published the review of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, in the second half of last year.  That was based on our work in non-banks and we can discuss it further if that would be helpful to the committee.  Clearly, we will do more work in terms of the intrusive supervision which we undertake.  We will continue to publish the data on what is happening in the system and, obviously, keep under review our ability to publish our findings from our ongoing work.</p></speech>

As members are aware, the CCMA is a statutory code that seeks to ensure that the interests of borrowers who are in or facing arrears are protected.  The main finding of the review was that for borrowers who engage with their bank or non-bank lender, the CCMA is working effectively and as intended, particularly in regard to the sales of loans by regulated lenders to what were, at the time, unregulated loan owners.  As has been mentioned on several occasions, the data contained in the CCMA report indicates that there were 110,000 restructures and that 87% of those borrowers are meeting the terms of their arrangements.  The report also found that banks and non-banks continue to put arrangements in place and engage with borrowers throughout their relationship with them.  In addition, it found that banks and non-banks have frameworks in place that support borrowers through transparent and open engagement and communication with the borrowers.</p><p>We have found that existing arrangements are honoured.  When a loan sale is affected and a portfolio of loans is sold from a regulated bank to a non-bank the finding, at the point in time in October of last year, was that the existing arrangements are and continue to be honoured by the non-bank.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses accept that there are competing rights in the Constitution?  Do they accept that it is now widely held internationally that shelter is a fundamental human right?  That right is recognised in the international convention on economic and social rights.  It has also been recognised constitutionally in a series of court cases down the decades, for instance, that the vested private property rights do not always trump public rights, human rights or the social rights of the Irish people.  It may be decided that a road or something like that is a public necessity and, therefore, a compulsory purchase of land may be in order to give effect to the road.  The witnesses have told us about focusing on the transactional nature of the sale to the funds.  What they are not telling us is what thoughts or examination they have given to the people whose mortgages are being sold on?  Do the witnesses agree that economic precariousness is one of the great difficulties of this era?  Jobs have become more precarious, people's access to housing, reasonable rent, affordable mortgages and so on has not become much more difficult in Ireland and globally, possibly, partly as a result of securitisation of a lot of financial assets. </p> <p>  It has become one of the fundamental threats to working democracy that one does not have a situation where there is an appropriate balance between the single individual, family, couple or person who entered into a mortgage and the financial institution with which they entered into it.  That is why the committee has frequently focused on some protection of customer rights.  Have the witnesses any sense of what they could offer to customers, who possibly were loaned too much money back in the day by banks that were very careless and subsequently went bust?  Very often that situation was not the fault of the people who took the mortgages because stuff came in their letterboxes telling them how much they could borrow and so on.  There is a context and history to how so many people got into difficulty.  Do the witnesses have something additional to offer somebody who already feels precarious because they have been in mortgage difficulty and possibly lost their job?  We know from all of the different hearings that the witnesses and ourselves have attended that people struggle to re-establish themselves financially.  A lot of the people who are paying are doing that.  Is there something that the witnesses can offer people who are concerned about the vested private property rights?  They might also show an equal concern for the precarious situation that mortgage holders are finding themselves in.   Instead of improving, unfortunately, the situation seems to be getting worse rather than better.</p></speech>

I am sure there have been many debates in the Oireachtas over many decades on whether those rights are too strong or strong enough.  We are simply trying to give the committee our view on the constitutional provisions as we understand they now exist.  Obviously it is a matter for the Oireachtas and Government if they wish to propose constitutional amendments on shelter for-----</p></speech>

Is Mr. Tobin suggesting that the Department's point of view is that property rights trump individual, human, family, personal and social rights?  There is a very wide constitutional view that those rights have a very significant status.  We recognise private property rights but we also recognise human rights in terms of individuals, families and children.  It is a matter of huge distress to many people at the moment that the number of homeless children is continually increasing and children now spend a long time in homelessness.  One of the reasons people on the committee feel strongly about the Bill is that as this is now growing with the securitisation of an increasing amount of financial assets people who end up having to give up their homes, as a consequence of these sales - and this is what people are terrified about - will end up homeless with their children.  There is a view in the Constitution on human rights as well as property rights. </p></speech>

As has been previously said by a number of people, I am not a constitutional lawyer.  We are merely trying to put forward the fact that there are strong property rights in Ireland's written Constitution.  That is a consideration that needs to be taken into account in terms of this Bill and is intended to be helpful to the committee.  It is a statement of fact really.  I do not know if the Central Bank representatives want to say anything.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Tobin accept the following?  Article 43.2.1&deg; states: "The State recognises, however, that the exercise of rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice."  Article 43.2.2&deg; states: "The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good."  There is a view of property rights in the Constitution.  I do not think any of us has any problem with that.  We want to see the exercise of balance.  As the Department of Finance is tasked with the economic good of Ireland I reiterate that precariousness in a modern economy, not just in Ireland, is one of the features that would appear to be undermining democracies.  Democracy is also an absolute value of the Constitution.  I recognise that the Department of Finance's first brief is the economic.  The Department also has a brief to consider what is happening to Irish society in terms of the common good.  Does the Department have any suggestions to offer?  The committee would love to hear how we can balance the rights, and reflect and endorse the rights of the individuals whose mortgages are being sold on and who feel even more precarious, as a consequence of reading in the newspaper and knowing from other media, that it is likely these particular funds may well sell on within a timespan of five to seven years.  This is like the sub-prime stuff in the United States; when it was first talked about in Ireland people could not even believe that it would exist here.</p><p>We are, however, looking for a solution that would allow the Bill to give comfort to those affected in order that they would be less among the precariat.</p></speech>

We are certainly not convinced that the measures proposed in the Bill are proportionate.  It is important to consider a proportionality test in connection with the Bill.</p> <p>  The issue of society becoming more precarious is a concern.  In considering the Bill we have been careful to think not only about those in mortgage arrears but also about others with mortgages and those who one day would like to get one.  The circumstances of all the people concerned could be described, in a variety of ways, as precarious from time to time.  They also need to be considered in terms of the possible implications of the Bill, should it be passed.  It is important that we do not just think about one category of mortgage holder.  When we are thinking about legislation potentially as radical as this, we should think about the implications for all categories of mortgage holder.</p></speech>

The language used could equate to an effort to scaremonger in getting the message out about banks not being able to raise money, interest rates going up and the next mortgage applicants not being able to apply to obtain a fair deal.  The coverage was absolutely horrendous and unnecessary.  We came here to listen to what the Central Bank and the Department had to state about Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill and learn from it to determine whether we could in any way make progress on it, with the co-operation of the Department.  However, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance have a very set view on it.  Rather than getting lost in the legislation before us, let us examine what it is trying to achieve.  It appears that we are up against the right and might of the bank.  Do the delegates believe a person with a loan has the right to know where it sits and who owns it?</p></speech>

Equally, if the loan is to be serviced by another party, the contact details of that party are also given.  That is very clear.</p></speech>

It is critical that borrowers know who they are engaging with and who they should deal with if they have queries, want to discuss their particular arrangements or need to engage regarding their particular circumstances if in difficulty.

I want to know who they are.  If my loan with a bank is sold to another party, I might know who that party is in Ireland and who I have to deal with but I do not know who owns the note at the end of it.  I do not know the reach of all of this.  The Irish people have a right to know.  Mr. Sibley might refer to the construct put on purchases by the banks and others in the world of finance but I am asking whether the borrower should know in the first instance.  Are we prepared to allow the banks to hide behind all these entities?  The borrower should ultimately know the party he or she is dealing with.</p></speech>

The reality of the situation is what it is.  I appreciate what the Chairman is saying and this is why we have focused on ensuring it is clear whom the borrower has to deal with.

As much as we could, we have tried to ensure the identity of the owner is clear but it is a matter of identifying the owner of each vehicle and who the shareholders are in the banks.

It is a great mystery to the individual, who is not well versed in the language of the world of finance.  Further mystery and secrecy are added by virtue of the fact that a party who is benefiting from the loan, by way of profit from the sale of the loans, is not known to the individual.  Mr. Sibley might say that is the way it happens in the world of finance but we should examine what happens in the world of the individual and the rights of that individual.</p></speech>

The next matter is the right of the individual to speak to the fund or representative of the fund, and the right of that individual not to be treated as a second-class citizen when dealing with that company.</p><p>I have to tell the Central Bank and the Department that the agents of the funds who are here, regulated and so on have a history of treating people very badly.  It is not possible to get in touch with them directly by phone.  If a person talks to one individual today, he or she might talk to another individual tomorrow.  A customer who repeats the same story over and over and expresses a desire to have his or her rights fulfilled and information given is constantly stalled in that process to the extent that people now have to get financial advisers or solicitors or come to people like me and other Members of this House and the Seanad as they cannot deal with them.  What infuriates me is that the Central Bank gives its side of the story, as it were, without acknowledging that there is a real problem which cannot be papered over any longer.  When an individual writes to the Central Bank, it will not take up his or her case or comment on it.  The person then writes to the Department, but it is driven by policy and so on.  Who is going to stand up for the customer and his or her rights?</p></speech>

We have given our view, in which I think we have been balanced in trying to look at the issue in the round, particularly the protections in place for consumers.  I am talking about owner-occupiers primarily in respect of the coverage of the Customer Contact Management Association.  As for the information provided for us, I have read all of the submissions the committee has sent to the Central Bank which we very much encourage and welcome.

The approach we have taken through all arms of the Central Bank to make sure those borrowers who are in distress - a very large number in distress are protected - are being dealt with in a humane fashion, that their individual circumstances are taken into account and that they are offered restructures to deal with their individual circumstances and put them on a sustainable path.  That has not been possible for every customer, but more than 110,000 owner-occupier mortgage accounts have been restructured.  There are still unfortunately - it is desperately unfortunate - some borrowers in deep arrears who continue to need to work through the problem.</p></speech>

If the protection was as good as Mr. Sibley describes, these Bills would not be coming forward.  The answer is always the same. </p><p> I want to move to the right to negotiate with the bank because this is critical in the context of Deputy Doherty's Bill.  The banks are not engaging in the way they are pretending to.  Too many people are telling us the same story about the lack of engagement for it to be true that they are engaging.  They are, therefore, not engaging the way they should.  What is wrong with forcing every bank to work out a sustainable position for the loans where they can?  In the context of that right for an individual to work out the loan, why do the banks not do that?  They do not use the full extent of the options they have.</p></speech>

Some of the correspondence I have seen has related more to investment and buy-to-lets than to owner-occupiers but there are considerable protections.  There are requirements in place for banks to be engaging with their borrowers.  The evidence across the system is that they are.  Many other protections and supports are available.  We can see an increasing use of the insolvency service and personal insolvency arrangements, which are being put in place to support borrowers who are in distress and, in the vast majority of instances, keep them in their homes.</p></speech>

They do not return phone calls, they take forever to deal with issues, and they wear down the individual so that at the end of it, he or she is beaten.  If an individual is beaten by the system, having tried it, his or her family is beaten.  It has terrible social consequences.</p></speech>

The reason for this and the other Bills that are coming before us is Oireachtas Members are being approached by individuals who are telling us this story.  We hear about the stress.  We witness them crying with their children, in courts all over the country in the context of repossession.  Deputy Doherty's response to it is this Bill.  The response of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance is that they are doing all they can, the whole world will cave in if they do anything to upset the banks and Bills like this are left behind because when all fruit fails, bring in the Constitution.  That will surely scuttle the Bill.</p></speech>

I am saying this to the Department of Finance.  That is what is going on here.  It is amazing how quickly Mr. Draghi, I think it was, wrote to us.</p><p>Over there, they jump out of their skin to protect the banks by writing to committees such as this but whenever we try to protect the citizens of the State against a banking system that brought us to our knees, we get no response whatsoever.  They have loads of opinions when they want to undermine the efforts of this House to bring about a balanced situation for people who are desperate, who have had to go before the courts and who have been bullied and intimidated by banks and the people who represent them.</p><p> In an earlier remark to a member, Mr. Tobin said he was here to speak truth to power.  I think I am speaking truth to power on behalf of the people I represent.  It seems to me that the banks have all the cards and they are dictating what happens.  The citizen is looking for some tilt in that balance, so they can feel we are there for them, we understand their pain and we will do something about it.  The world will not fall in if a version of the Bill which Deputy Doherty is bringing forward were to pass in the House.</p></speech>

We have tried to set out, in a clear way, what we feel are the likely implications of this legislation.  Clearly we disagree on this.  There are a lot of borrower protections in place in Ireland.  There is a very, very low level of repossessions relative to other European countries.  I have no doubt there are people who, as the Chairman described, are in mortgage difficulties and are experiencing extreme hardship.  That is a terrible fact but, over the past number of years, there have been concerted efforts by various Governments to improve the situation.  I am sure there is still more that can be done and we are certainly open to ideas.  Unfortunately, we cannot come in here and tell the committee that this is great legislation when we think there are substantial flaws in it.</p></speech>

There is another side to this, which other members of the committee and I have described during this meeting and others.  We are simply asking that what we say be recognised.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton made a point about the Constitution and the citizens of the State.  By ignoring the plight of those people who are so marginalised by this State, it undermines the State and its institutions.  Someone has to reach out to ensure that this body of people are assisted, by legislation or regulation, to have a life in spite of their bad mortgage.  They went into a bank for a loan of &euro;100,000 and came out with one for &euro;200,000 and one or two cars.  One cannot say it was the people who were at fault because they were all at fault, including the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and us as politicians.  We are making an effort to ensure this is reasoned out and that those who want to pay, rather than those who do not, get a fair deal from their bank.</p><p>As a shortcut, however, the bank, with the sanction of this House, is able to dispose of loans overnight.  In the context of Deputy Doherty's Bill, I am simply asking that the Department of Finance look at the social consequences of this, and not just concentrate on the financial institutions within a silo.  There are social consequences to homelessness, kids on the street, families in hotels, 140,000 on our housing lists, and buy-to-lets being sold with people being asked to leave by the banks. </p></speech>

A lot of forbearance was shown to people in mortgage difficulties.  This was hugely important for keeping our society together during a very difficult time.  We are open to suggestions and ideas, but we can only give an honest opinion of this legislation, which is what we have been asked to do.  Some of the matters the Chairman raised are policy matters for the Government of the day and we serve the Government of the day, whichever party is in power.</p></speech>

It posted collateral, and needed to do some engineering in order to do so, with the ECB.  That resulted in eurosystem funding being provided to the banks in order for them to maintain liquidity and be able to honour deposits, for example.  They would pay interest on those loans in the same way as interest would be paid on any loan.  They were borrowing from the eurosystem and paying interest on those loans, but I would differentiate that entirely from the private transactions under discussion.</p></speech>

The banks should have within them the skill sets to sort out these loans.  They should have a responsibility.  They undertook irresponsible lending.  The ordinary mortgage holder looks at this and sees the banks getting off the hook for their mistakes by flogging the loans on to a fund.  The loans are gone and not the banks' problem any more.  There is a view among many people that the banks did not do enough in terms of putting arrangements in place for hard-pressed mortgage holders.</p> <p>  In some jurisdictions, instead of selling mortgages to funds, they are extended to 30 or 40 years and measures are put in place to keep people in their homes and restructure the banks' balance sheets.  People have attachments to their respective institutions.  They are Irish based.  The witnesses might point out that their shareholdings change, but there is that degree of familiarity.</p> <p>  This is in the Central Bank's domain.  Let the banks take responsibility for their reckless lending by putting in place alternative, longer term arrangements.  Many of the people who approach us ended up with mortgages that they should never have got.  Rules have been introduced and people say that they find some elements draconian.  The rules are not perfect, but there are elements that are working.  People believe that selling to funds is effectively a get-out clause for the reckless lending of individual banks so that they do not have to take responsibility for giving out loans that they should never have supplied.  The loans are being sold on to a fund.  Ordinary people are very nervous that their loans could be sold on time and again and that they would end up having no idea who they were dealing with.  Does Mr. Sibley understand?  Reverting to the Chairman's original point, how do we improve the lot of the person who is hard pressed and ensure that his or her loan is dealt with by the institution that made the loan to him or her on day 1 and that it takes responsibility for its actions?  The borrower is required to fulfil his or her requirements under the terms of the loan.  We are coming to a point where the banks are getting their second wind but many of those people whom we are dealing with are not.  Does Mr. Sibley understand my point?  Has the Central Bank examined ways of restructuring loans into having much longer durations and encouraging the banks to come up with more imaginative approaches instead of just selling loans on to funds?</p></speech>

Let us compare that with where we are today.</p><p>It is clear that significant effort has been made for mortgage holders and small and medium sized enterprises, SMEs, when one compares the number of people in distress and accounts in difficulty today to the position that pertained at the heights of 2012 and 2013.  Some might not like the outcome of that or how that engagement has worked, but a huge amount of restructuring has been done.  Approximately one owner-occupier mortgage account in six that is held within the banks has been restructured and approximately nine out of ten of those are meeting the terms of that restructure.  Such loans started being restructured in 2012 and 2013, at which time many of them were interest only, part payment, or to which temporary forbearance applied.  The dial changed on that because of the engagement of the Central Bank, this committee and other State agencies to ensure that the solutions being put in place to help borrowers stay in their homes were addressing the underlying issues.  Measures such as a period of short-term forbearance to give the borrower time to get back on his or her feet, longer-term forbearance in restructuring the loan through split mortgages, extending the terms, arrears capitalisations and economic concessions have been put in place and there is much evidence of it happening.</p><p> We still have a circumstance whereby, unfortunately, too many borrowers are still in distress.</p></speech>

There are potential solutions.  I look at what is coming out of insolvency services.  I am sure insolvency is a very difficult process to go through but much work is being put in by the Oireachtas in setting up that process and refining it to ensure it is working effectively.  More people are using that.</p> <p>  The most important thing is for borrowers in distress to engage with their lender, whether a bank or a non-bank, because they are required to do so.  I appreciate the Chair's comments on that topic.  The lenders are required to consider the individual circumstances of the borrower and are required to try and put in arrangements which work for those individual circumstances.  We will always listen to and look at evidence where that is happening because a bank or a non-bank is required to do that.</p></speech>

The danger of term extensions is that it puts the borrower in a circumstance where the overall cost of credit is going up because they are paying interest for longer.  Another question that arises is how a borrower will pay if their term of repayment pushes into retirement when his or her financial circumstances have deteriorated.  Term extensions are a valid and viable solution but need to be tailored to the individual borrower's circumstances.</p></speech>

It goes into the detail of some of the definitions and issues around enforcement and regulations, which is helpful as we continue to look at this legislation.  I welcome that.</p><p> Mr. Sibley spoke about the impact of this Bill on financial stability and there has been much commentary about that.  I outlined earlier that the intention of the Bill was not to deal with the issues of securitisation or the impact thereof, ECB collateral and a number of those other issues he identified.  He said that would go a long way to addressing the concerns of the Central Bank.  </p><p> Appendix 3 of the Central Bank's submissions deals with some of the definitions.  Is there anything else, in Mr. Sibley's view, that needs to be addressed?  The core part of this Bill prevents a lender transferring a loan directly to a third party, whether a vulture fund or otherwise, without consent.  If the committee determines, based on its own legal advice and the committee's view, to pursue this legislation, does Mr. Sibley want to add anything else?  I made the point earlier that it is my intention to have that area which was of greatest concern to the Central Bank excepted from the legislation.</p></speech>

We have a broader concern about the functioning of the market for all.  The retail banks in Ireland, certainly the domestically-owned ones, are currently largely deposit funded.  There is a restriction on the banks' ability to raise funding from a Eurosystem perspective, as well as a potential restriction on being able to exit the market for new entrants.  That is something to bear in mind.  We have talked about that already but I wanted to make sure there was no misunderstanding.</p> <p>  We have concerns from a financial stability perspective as to what would happen in the event that a bank was to get into difficulty.  How will this Bill interplay with a resolution and what would happen after a resolution event, or if we were dealing with a firm that was likely to fail?  I appreciate there is some mention of that in the legislation.  We have concerns as to how we would deal with a particular circumstance around financial distress.

I have talked about the issues which the Bill was crafted not to impact and those need to be clarified, but if that was accepted, why would there then be a need for a wider impact study?  I understand that if the intention of the Bill was to impact on securitisation, or ECB collateral, or different ways in which the banks can secure finance such as covered bonds and so on, there would be a wider impact but this Bill is straight up and down.  Under its terms, a bank cannot sell to a vulture fund or another bank without the agreement of the customer.

We talk about regulation and the code of conduct and so on.  I accept that they are in place.  I accept the two entities are regulated in exactly the same way, although special purpose vehicles might be exempt from the regulation but I will highlight the issue another way.  Is AIB likely to put up my standard variable rate loan by 2.5%?  Which organisation is most likely to do that?  That is where the risk appears.</p> <p>  Mr. Sibley may be able to clarify the point.  I am hearing now that a fund that bought a certain number of buy-to-let loans from one of the banks &ndash; I will not mention the bank by name &ndash; is now issuing letters asking for the arrears to be paid within 30 days.  If the arrears are not paid within 30 days then the organisation will appoint receivers.  This is standard practice of the vulture fund now.</p></speech>

It is difficult for us to get into the specific details at the committee.  We will certainly respond on the specific question asked and we are engaged with that particular entity in respect of what is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.719" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040200002#VV00300"><p>I appreciate what Mr. Sibley is saying.  We have a sale by a main bank in this State to a vulture fund.  It involves buy-to-let mortgages that were in arrears.  The bank could do the same thing in the morning.  It could have done exactly the same thing but it has not done so.  However, I understand the vulture fund is doing it.  Contractually, the fund has the right to instruct the borrower to settle the arrears within 30 days or it will appoint a receiver over the properties.  That is why people do not want their loans sold to vulture funds.</p></speech>

Clearly, we are talking about investment properties.  The right to appoint rent receivers is in many of the bank contracts and has been exercised by the banks on rental properties already to a significant degree.  We can argue the wrongs and rights of it but the ability to appoint a rent receiver is stitched into the majority of buy-to-let lending arrangements.  It does not apply to all banks.</p></speech>

This is nearly a strategic default.  The idea is that the fund calls in all of the arrears within 30 days.  That is next to impossible for someone who is trying to manage through an arrangement.  These individuals are making repayments.  However, the idea involves an instruction to clear up arrears in 30 days or else a receiver will be appointed.  Then, when the fund appoints the receiver, it does not have to go through the court system.</p></speech>

One would expect that if a borrower was engaged or up to date in terms of the restructuring arrangement agreed with the lender, then that scenario would not arise.  However, I do not know the specific circumstances to which Deputy Doherty is referring.</p></speech>

The report identified that more than 50% of those in long-term arrears of two years or more are likely to lose possession of their homes either through voluntary surrender or repossession.  Does the Central Bank still hold to those figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040200002#WW00300"><p>What we can see is that there are well over 20,000 accounts that are more than two years past due.  A significant proportion of these are going through the legal process now.  I am unsure how that plays through.  Certainly, at the moment we can see from what is coming through the court system that not all cases go through the courts system.  Less than half end up in a court order.  Some are withdrawn or restructured or paid on the steps of the court.  One can see that if a borrower is in deep arrears to that extent, the potential for loss of ownership exists.  As I have said several times today and during other committee appearances, the most important thing is to try to engage with the supports in place.  It is important to engage with the lender and use the advice and practical solutions from the personal insolvency service to try to keep it to a minimum.  This is a harsh thing to say but at the end of the day, if we want a secure lending system &ndash; which I think is what we want on the basis of some of the other discussions we have had in these Houses - then that security has to mean something.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Sibley believe that a loan that is performing and has not fallen into arrears should be allowed to be sold?  Should there be protection for such a loan so that it cannot be sold on without consent?  Such safeguards are already in place in Austria and Denmark.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.726" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019040200002#WW00500"><p>Maybe it would be worthwhile doing a real comparison across the jurisdictions of how the mortgage market works.  It works very differently in different jurisdictions.  We talked before about how there are long-term fixes in the system here and how they are funded.  A great deal of really good information can be drawn from cross-country comparisons.  I am genuinely of the view that we have a system today under which mortgages come through both banks and non-banks and that this will be increasingly the case.  It is important that regardless of whether a loan has originated in a non-bank or was purchased by a non-bank, it should work in the same way.  It is important that those involved comply and have the same code and regulations and requirements as the banks in terms of the treatment of the borrower.  In that sense, I am okay with loans transferring.</p></speech>

I see that as a fair comment.  It is different from actually saying that the Attorney General is saying the Bill is unconstitutional, which is what some of the headlines have suggested.  There is a risk.</p> <p>  We all know what the Constitution says.  Property rights are protected under the Constitution but the protection is also limited.  The real question is what is the common good and what are the limitations of social justice.  That is what needs to be tested.  Anyway, that is fair comment.</p><p>Does Mr. Tobin believe banks should adhere to the Central Bank's code of practice on the transfer of mortgages which, more or less, is this legislation?</p></speech>

It was put in place at a time when, as I understand it, building societies were demutualising and there was concern that if individuals' mortgages were sold, they could lose out on a windfall cash gain when a building society was demutualised.</p></speech>

At the time the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, was the majority shareholder in three of the banks.  I will read the response again.  It states: "Notwithstanding its voluntary nature, I expect that best practice dictates that the code be applied by all institutions to all classes of residential property."  The then Minister for Finance said this and obviously the reply would have been approved by the Department's general secretary or Secretary General; regardless of whichever version Mr. Tobin wants to use, it does not make much of a difference.  The then Minister said the code should be applied.  The change of heart seems to have occurred when somebody actually said: "Do you know something?  Since 1991 no bank has ever applied this code and maybe we should do something about it."  As soon as somebody says we should do something about it, officials are telling us that the sky will fall in.</p></speech>

I am very happy to be involved in this.  As to how we hope we will assist with the committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the general scheme of the companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill, in some respects the report we published last October overlaps with the committee&rsquo;s current deliberations.  There is no doubt, however, that some other aspects of our report which had a different focus may not overlap.  Nonetheless, we thought it would be useful to give an overview in the written statement of the general report.  One of the areas in which the committee might have a particular interest in considering the scheme of the Bill is the recommendations we made on what we described as the core regulatory toolkit that financial and economic regulators should have, and I might focus on this.</p> <p>  The background to the report published in October last year was that, after extensive consultation on the content of our current programme of law reform, which was approved by Government in 2013, a number of submissions asked us to look at the whole area of the regulatory powers of financial and economic regulators.  While the general background to the report was no doubt heavily influenced by the financial crisis that emerged in 2008, many of the submissions that we were sent in respect of the consultation on that fourth programme also recognised that, other than the Central Bank, which has very significant regulatory powers, there are other regulators that did not have as wide a regulatory toolkit.  I refer to bodies such as the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, although I know that in some of the literature there is a debate as to whether one could describe the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, as a regulator as such.  It certainly has some of the attributes of a regulator.  We were also very conscious of the fact that while obviously we have been through huge trauma as a result of the banking crisis, the next major crisis of systemic proportions for the State might not come from the banking sector.  The focus of our report therefore was not just on financial regulation but on other sectoral economic regulators as well.</p> <p>  We are very conscious that we are an advisory body and that what we recommend and include in our report, including draft Bills, are therefore matters for others to determine as to whether there will be any law reform arising from our recommendations.  Of course, these are matters for members of this committee and other Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are aware that a number of recommendations of the report are under consideration.  On page 3 of the paper we circulated to the committee, we mention just some of the main recommendations, including the establishment of a statutory corporate crime agency and the idea that financial and economic regulators should have the power to impose significant financial sanctions and to make regulatory enforcement agreements.  As I mentioned, the committee may want us to look at the latter area.  We also looked at our existing fraud offences and made recommendations as to how offences under the theft and fraud offences Act might be amended.  Then there is the question as to whether a statutory system of deferred prosecution agreements should be introduced.</p> <p>  I will make just brief comments on the proposal in the commission&rsquo;s report on a corporate crime agency because I know to some extent from the deliberations that have taken place here that there has been a debate about the overlap with the ODCE&rsquo;s reforms in the corporate enforcement authority Bill.  The commission&rsquo;s proposal on a corporate crime agency was focused on issues such as major corporate fraud and corruption-type offences and the need for a separate agency to examine these kinds of offences.  We certainly did not make a recommendation directly related to reform of the ODCE.  We were very conscious that this had been debated in the Government&rsquo;s 2017 paper on measures to improve the effectiveness of the response to so-called white-collar crime.  We understand, therefore, that this issue of a corporate crime agency, or what could be described as a serious fraud and corruption agency, is being considered by the group chaired by the former Director of Public Prosecutions, James Hamilton.  We understand that this group is due to report later this year.</p><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their attention.  We are very happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Egan, chairman of the Company Law Review Group, to give his presentation to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Egan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019040200002#G00300"><p>This afternoon I appear as chair of the Company Law review Group.  Beside me is Mr. Vincent Madigan, who like me is a founder member of the Company Law Review Group and review group&rsquo;s secretary, Ms Tara Keane.  The Company Law Review Group was established on a statutory basis by section 67 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 and continues under chapter 4 of Part 15 of the Companies Act 2014.  The review group consists of members who have an expertise in and an interest in the development of company law, including practitioners such as lawyers, accountants, chartered secretaries, users of company law such as business persons and trade unions, regulators, that is, implementation and enforcement bodies and representatives of Departments, including the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  A number of professional and other bodies nominate members and the Minister makes appointments as well.  The secretariat is provided by the company law development and EU unit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We work to a work programme which is determined by the Minister in consultation with the review group.  The review group presents its recommendations on matters in its work programme to the Minister.  The Minister reviews the recommendations of the group and then decides the policy direction to be adopted.  Members of the review group other than the chair are not remunerated in respect of their membership.</p> <p>  The review group meets between two and four times a year in plenary session, with most of our work being carried out by committees of which there are currently five.  They are related to corporate governance, corporate insolvency, a statutory committee which is a standing committee dealing with ongoing matters, a corporate enforcement committee and the Part 23 committee, which relates to public companies which are dealt with under Part 23 of the Companies Act.</p> <p>  Our statutory functions are set out in section 959 of the Companies Act 2014, which include: a requirement to monitor, review and advise the Minister on matters concerning the Companies Act; the amendment of the Act; the introduction of new legislation on the operation of companies and commercial practices in Ireland; the rules of court; judgments of courts; issues arising from the State&rsquo;s membership of the EU; international developments in company law; and other related matters.  In so doing we must seek to promote enterprise, facilitate commerce and simplify the operation of the 2014 Act, enhance corporate governance and encourage commercial probity.</p> <p>  The Bill, the heads of which are under discussion today, to establish the new corporate enforcement authority as an independent company law compliance and enforcement agency is one of several measures announced on the 2 November 2017 in measures to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s corporate economic and regulatory framework.  This is pursuant to a policy initiative of the Government rather than a proposal resulting from one of the Company Law Review Group&rsquo;s reports.  The Bill, however, does include a number of provisions to give effect to certain of the recommendations in review group reports or derived from those reports.  I refer specifically to the review group&rsquo;s report on shares and share capital which was prepared in the first instance by a committee of which I was then chair, a report on corporate governance matters and a report on the protection of employees and unsecured creditors where Mr. Madigan was the chair.  Our competence to speak to matters today is focused on Parts 3, 4 and 5, which deal with those respective reports and recommendations either contained in or derived from them.</p> <p>  To bring the committee up to date, the way the review group has worked in the past has been on two-year programmes with a big report at the end of two years.  In the paper that I submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s meeting, I give the headings of the various reports that have been submitted.  I took office in June 2018, by which stage the review group had produced 16 annual reports and eight special reports, most notably the report that gave rise to the general scheme of the Companies Bill which was published in 2007 and eventually became law as the Companies Act 2014.  That was probably the most intense period of work of the review group as its refocused company law away from the minority of companies which were public companies and instead focused it on the private company.  That resulted in a section-by-section, root and branch reform of the law.  The review group feels a special affection for the 2014 Act.</p> <p>  Most recently, the review group delivered its annual report for 2018 to the Minister in compliance with the Companies Act.  It contained a code of conduct that we applied for in the conduct of our proceedings, a submission on the review of the Limited Partnerships Acts, a submission on the shareholders&rsquo; rights Directive 2017/828 and a report on the UNCITRAL Model Law on cross-border insolvency.  I look forward to discussing the Bill, in particular the heads in Parts 3, 4 and 5.</p></speech>

Is there any liaison on the international side given the fact of cybercrime on the Internet and the global nature of it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.764" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Raymond Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019040200002#G01000"><p>In terms of overlap and liaison, there is no doubt that there would be very important liaison if a corporate crime agency was to be established.  The report that we carried out did a lot of consultation with people who had been involved in examining some of the very serious issues that arise on the regulatory side.  What we discovered from some of the regulators was that they were very capable of examining those areas for which they had functional responsibility, in terms of regulating banks and other financial institutions.  The competition commission has functional responsibility to look at competition law, mergers and takeovers, and various other bodies which have a regulatory role in various economic sectoral areas.  What they all said as well was that there was a risk that even though they might be looking at all of those detailed areas, certain areas such as major fraud matters, which would not be within their responsibility as regulators could in a sense fall between the cracks.  That is why the commission made a recommendation that there ought to be an agency that would be responsible for looking at those areas.  That would be quite separate from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, as it currently stands or the corporate enforcement authority if it is to be established under this Bill, because the corporate enforcement authority would still just have responsibility for the enforcement of the Companies Act, as amended.</p> <p>  That was the issue that arose in the consultations we had with a number of the regulators that we consulted with, and therefore the conclusion the commission reached was that it recommended the need for a separate agency that would be responsible for examining issues that fall outside the remit of the existing financial and economic regulators.</p></speech>

I refer to the communication between the regulatory agency and the businesses in question.  If, for example, we take what happened ten years ago with the banks, I am interested to hear what type of communication takes place?  Is it real-time type data that they request or are the systems sufficiently sophisticated that they can provide such data?  From my experience in the private sector, what happened ten years ago was that the communication of data was perhaps two or three months behind.</p><p>Again, this is anecdotal and from my own experience.  One very significant thing that was done in the intervening years was to try to get the systems up to speed such that there is almost real-time communication, that when one goes in takes a snapshot one can find out exactly what is going on, as opposed to in three or four months&rsquo; time.  This negates any risk.  Is there any development in this regard?  If Mr. Byrne cannot answer that question, I fully understand.  I know it is quite broad, but just as a matter of interest.</p></speech>

That was not part of our function and we would not really be competent to do that.  However, one issue that certainly comes up when one looks at the history of regulation in Ireland is resourcing.  This was one of the reasons we added in our recommendation that when it comes to the establishment of a corporate crime agency, resourcing is a very important matter.  Something we are not competent to decide is what the level of resourcing should be, but these are the kinds of issues involved.  I refer to the expertise within any of the bodies - the existing regulatory bodies and the body proposed here in the form of a corporate enforcement authority.  Has it sufficient resources, and would a corporate crime agency be given sufficient resources as well?  We certainly know about this from history, certainly the history of the financial crisis.  There were issues as to whether existing powers were being used appropriately but there was also no doubt about another issue as to whether there was appropriate resourcing of the bodies that were charged with responsibility for enforcing financial regulation in the State.  Other than at the very high level of resourcing, we could not comment on these issues surrounding resources, technology and the capacity of regulators to ensure they have the information.</p></speech>

Again, anecdotally, this may be there already, but from the committee&rsquo;s point of view, it is important that the organisations themselves and their systems be framed and set up in such a way, insofar as possible, given they work in a commercial environment and we have to be mindful of that, that real-time reporting could be generated.  That may be the situation in 2019.  I know that this was a problem at the time, that there were lags of three, four and five months, or whatever it was at the time.</p></speech>

In his concluding comments he spoke about international best practice and said both the OECD and the EU have strongly advocated that financial and economic regulators should have at their disposal an effective regulatory toolkit, and that the key components of such a toolkit are the powers to impose administrative financial sanctions.  Does he believe that the heads of the Bill on which we are conducting pre-legislative scrutiny will provide for this?  Is that too blunt a question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-02a.770" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Raymond Byrne" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019040200002#H00500"><p>Of course, it is a matter for the committee to decide whether the conclusions the commission made in its report should be implemented.  I refer to our analysis of international best practice, including many reports that have been published by the OECD and at EU level.  We then looked at the most recent literature we could find, some of which has been carried out by Professor Chris Hodges in Oxford, for example.  That information and that research indicate that these kinds of powers are the most effective in order to generate the kinds of results that would deliver as far as possible the kinds of regulatory systems we all want, whereby organisations being regulated live up to those kinds of standards, whether in respect of compliance with company law or financial services law.  That was certainly the evidence we had from a lot of the submissions we had received and the literature we looked at.  It would appear that this is not included in the draft heads.  Again, we are very conscious that these heads are going into the 2014 Act, but our understanding is that while the existing powers in the 2014 Act give extensive powers, for example, to company inspectors appointed by the High Court, the ODCE and the proposed corporate enforcement authority would not have those powers.</p></speech>

We are at the very first stage of the legislative process, so any information we can feed back to the Minister will be very important.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a question of Mr. Egan or Mr. Madigan - whoever would like to answer it.  The general scheme does not include a number of recommendations made by the Company Law Review Group.  Are there any in particular to which the witnesses would like to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention and which they feel could have been given more consideration?  As I said, we are trying to make this the best legislation possible.  The role of this committee is to scrutinise what is before us, and then we welcome any feedback we can get from the experts.</p></speech>

They are very comprehensive.  Like Senator Reilly, I have been reading through them as we talk.  I have just two points.</p> <p>  First, not to sound too crass or to the point, there is a general perception portrayed in the media, as we are all aware, that Ireland is soft on corporate or white-collar crime.  We all read the newspapers and listen to the news every day of the week.  I am curious about the witnesses&rsquo; thoughts as to whether or not this perception is true when Ireland&rsquo;s position is compared with EU standards and our sisters in the EU.</p> <p>  Second, do the witnesses believe that the Garda has enough resources to tackle financial and corporate irregularities and criminal acts?  It seems to have been pointed up that we might be behind the curve in this regard, particularly when compared with perhaps Britain or similar-type countries.  I am curious about the witnesses&rsquo; thoughts on both these areas.  They have spent a lot of time looking at them.</p></speech>

Some of them have received significant prison sentences.  Let us compare this with the situation in other countries.  We sometimes think about the United States and Mr. Madoff in this regard.  Mr. Madoff pleaded guilty to certain crimes but, by comparison, in terms of the size of some of the other countries we are looking at, there have been very few prosecutions of very senior bankers.</p><p>In fact, some of those countries began with the idea of having only financial settlements.  We have made recommendations that regulators ought to have the ability to impose significant financial sanctions on corporate entities.  In Ireland, what happened is that some of the more significant resourcing was put into criminal prosecutions and resulted in criminal convictions.  There have been some convictions, very recently in relation to some of the rate-fixing scandals in the UK but they came very late to that.  It is not that I want to give us all a pat on the back of our heads, as it were, but at the same time we should not say that nothing was done in terms of white-collar crime.</p><p> There is no doubt that there is an issue around resourcing.  The commission is not competent to talk about what level of resourcing the Garda or the regulators ought to have, but as I mentioned before, that is certainly something that we said must be part of the equation, that is, the appropriate resourcing of bodies if they are being set up by legislation.  If a new entity is being created out of the old ODCE then a major question has to be the appropriate resourcing.  In the past, the perception was that white-collar crime or senior executives within organisations were not really being prosecuted, but there is no doubt the experience in recent years has been that there have been prosecutions and convictions and very significant resourcing.  As the Director of Public Prosecutions has pointed out recently, very significant resources of her office have been spent over the past ten years in bringing those cases to trial.  All those resources were put in place but it is another question as to whether there are sufficient resources to address all of the issues that arise.  There is no doubt that those trials that did go to conviction were very expensive trials, but the State did spend considerable resources in that area.</p></speech>

We learnt that in the Estimates there will be an extra &euro;1 million applied to the new statutory body that will be set up.  We pressed the Minister on whether there would be enough finance available and she stated that if there is a demand for it, it would be made available.  In fairness to her, she did put those fears to rest last week.  Would Mr. Egan or Mr. Madigan like to comment on that question as well?</p></speech>

With regard to the resources of the Garda, I have no information and I would not be competent to respond on that.  The question was if we are soft on corporate crime.  The bit that I can speak about is whether I believe that the law we have in Ireland is of a high standard compared with OECD international standards.  I am of the view that it is.  There are a number of threads that feed into this answer.  First, the 2014 Act was the result of an exhaustive section by subsection analysis of all of our existing company law.  Historically, we used to copy what the UK did and sometimes we would just copy it almost word for word.  More and more, the law that we have in terms of our company law, securities law and insolvency law is in fact generated in the EU.  That is not to say it is up to the EU to do it, but there is a rigour in the drafting of the law.  In terms of the companies Bill, if we go back to the report on company law and enforcement from 1998, one of its recommendations was that at least once every two years there would be a companies Bill just to do a bit of catch-up and this is an example of that in terms of all the little tweaks and fixes that are being done.  I believe that the statute law that we have and the whole body of companies legislation we have stands up to scrutiny and any comparison.</p></speech>

However, I am concerned, for example, when one looks at HSBC and the fixing of rates.  It was difficult enough to catch the company.  There was also Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.  However, in the context of Ireland we had less than a handful of people facing short enough prison sentences.  The State was practically defunct afterwards.  We had to get bailed out.  We are comparing chalk and cheese to a certain extent in terms of how we have dealt with some of these guys.  There is also a pile of other banks on which I could comment but I will not mention names.  High profile heads of banks were described as running fiefdoms and they have not gone anywhere else, apart from still having a good time in Ireland.  It is not without merit.  There has been a big shift to try to bring us somewhat up to speed but we are still a long way behind.</p></speech>

As previous speakers said, there is a sense out there that corporate white-collar crime does not get pursued in the same way as other crime.</p> <p>  I very much welcome the report and many of the recommendations in it.  The witnesses speak specifically to two areas where they feel the power is available to the Central Bank to impose administrative financial sanctions of a serious quantum such as &euro;10 million or 10% of turnover and &euro;1 million to the individual and the power to enter into regulatory compliance agreements but those are not available to the regulatory authorities.  I very much agree with the suggestions in that regard.</p> <p>  I also very much like the idea of being able to do the equivalent of the Probation Act to enter into a stay of execution and see whether a company will clean up its act.  That is not being in any way soft on white-collar crime.  There is a significant problem at the moment with insurance, which I accept is not the remit of the witnesses.  We called for a dedicated insurance fraud squad in the Garda.  What the witnesses are speaking to here is another group within the Garda who would be specifically looking at corporate crime.  Would that corporate crime agency lie within the Garda or would it be parallel to the Garda?  How would it operate with the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB?  Who would it answer to?  I ask the witnesses to answer those questions.</p> <p>  I do not know if the witnesses are in a position to answer this question, but do they have any information available now or it could be provided later on how many convictions with serious consequences, that is, prison sentences, have been made for corporate crime in the years 2014 to 2018?  Have we seen the benefit of the 2014 Act in terms of it having a net effect?  I speak as someone who works in both sectors.  There is a vote in the Seanad.  I do not want to be rude and not be present for the reply to my questions.</p></speech>

I am aware that the Director of Corporate Enforcement or a member of his team who has given evidence before this committee has provided some information.  Over the past 20 years there has been a sea change in rudimentary compliance with company law for making sure that there is timely information, which means that any one of us now is able to click onto a website and in practically every case we would be able to find a company&rsquo;s accounts and the names of directors.  There is that level of transparency and there is an immediacy of information.  In addition, the Irish law, as well as having copied British law for many years, has introduced, for example, restrictions on directors.</p><p>A statistic that was quoted here was that between 2007 and 2018, 1,860 directors were made subject to restriction orders and more than 240 were disqualified.  It is not the same as sending people off to jail but if one can get people off the pitch unless they comply with conditions, that has to be a positive move.</p></speech>

Senator O&rsquo;Reilly asked about the structure of the proposed corporate crime agency which is separate from the corporate enforcement authority.  The proposal that the commission put forward would be that it would be a multi-disciplinary task force type agency that would bring under one roof the different kinds of skills that would be required in terms of investigation and prosecution all the way from, if one likes, end to end in terms of investigation and prosecution.  There is no doubt that under the current arrangements the Garda has very specific skills.  Some of the regulators liaise with the Garda in making reports.  Of course there is a very skilled unit on corporate crime within the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  What the commission was proposing in its report last October was that there could be an agency which would have all of those under one roof from the very beginning.  That was modelled very much on the model of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  It is not that it will be reporting to CAB but that the model would be comparable with the CAB type of model.  It would be multi-disciplinary and a task force-type agency.</p> <p>  It is very clear that in terms of compliance with company law, there has been, as Mr. Egan said, a sea change in the last 20 years or so.  If we look at prosecutions outside the company law area, again the number of prosecutions that we see being talked about in the courts, where executives of companies who are engaged in tax fraud and in tax evasion, who are actually getting prison sentences, who are being prosecuted under regulatory powers of different regulators, there is no doubt that very serious convictions on indictment are being brought.  There may not be a huge number of people who have served prison sentences.  However, again we need to look at that in the context of the overall regulatory approach that criminal conviction ought not to be regarded as the only mechanism by which we ensure our compliance with legislation of a regulatory type.</p> <p>  The other proposals that the commission looked at in its report were recommendations looking at all of those other aspects as well as tightening up on some of the areas of criminal law.</p></speech>

Is that working in collaboration with the ODCE?  Do you think that is the way forward?</p></speech>

That is certainly something that is done and can be done through various mechanisms, sometimes in legislation, sometimes through memorandums of understanding.  That is certainly something that works quite effectively in a lot of situations.</p> <p>  In terms of the corporate crime agency, there is no doubt that if it does have those kinds of skill sets under one roof then it can work very effectively with the existing regulators.  That would be extremely important, as well as the issue of proper resourcing.</p></speech>

Obviously the regulatory bodies probably did not have the wherewithal to be able to deal with that.  Where are we now on that, if that was to happen tomorrow?  A financial institution collapsed and it was stated the last day that the body itself did not have the capacity to be able to deal with that doomsday scenario because obviously it was never envisaged that that doomsday scenario would happen.  It actually did happen.  In hindsight, if that doomsday was to happen tomorrow, in the opinion of the witnesses where would we be?  If they are able to answer that.</p></speech>

One of many things that did happen after 2008 is that, not just at national level, very significant new powers were given in 2010 and, following that, in 2013 to the Central Bank.  Also at EU level issues around the supervisory mechanism that now comes out of the European Central Bank where the pillar banks are being looked at very closely including where rules about the capital ratios and the ratios that the banks actually hold.  Those have certainly been strengthened at EU and international level.  So there have been significant responses.</p> <p>  One could say two things.  The next crisis may not be in financial services but that in so far as the regulatory system both at national level and at EU level in terms of the single supervisory mechanism reforms, those have certainly strengthened the capacity to intervene earlier before there would be a collapse.  There is specific legislation in the financial services area to deal with liquidation of our banks and before that actually happens, to address issues like capital ratio.  I cannot say in particular that the commission examined that issue.  However, we have been very conscious as we went through our analysis that a huge number of reforms had taken place.</p> <p>  The other aspect of this is of course that in terms of the regulators that are involved in enforcing financial and economic regulation in Ireland, our analysis was that they all needed a core set of regulatory tools.  The ones that we mentioned in the submission to the committee would have been the ones where we felt there was a gap in some of those regulators.  That would be something that we found from the literature.  That is quite important in terms of prevention.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Larry O'Neill, chief executive officer, CEO, of the South County Dublin Partnership, Mr. Joe Saunders, manager of the ILDN, Ms Anne Fitzgerald, CEO of the Ballyfermot Chapelizod Partnership, and Mr. Eamonn O'Reilly, CEO of the North, East and West Kerry Development and vice chairman of the ILDN.  I am CEO of the Dublin North West Area Partnership and chairman of the ILDN's employment and enterprise committee.</p> <p>  This paper is also part of a second paper that will set out for the Government a model for national employment services based on the not-for-profit model delivered by local development companies, LDCs.  The service will be characterised by a more targeted approach, nationwide coverage and an initial focus of resources on communities in which the number of employed, underemployed and those on welfare payments remain high.</p> <p>  Members have received a copy of the full paper and I will read a summary version.  The ILDN is the representative body for the country's 49 not-for-profit local development companies that deliver community services across the country.  LDC boards comprise local, voluntary directors alongside public sector personnel and, in many cases, employers, unions and elected representatives.  They link to local economic and community plans and local community development committees, ensuring wide-ranging oversight and democratic accountability.</p> <p>  Each year, LDCs support approximately 15,000 community groups and 173,000 individuals by delivering &euro;330 million worth of State programmes, many for jobseekers, including the back to work enterprise allowance, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, RSS, local employment services, job clubs, community employment and jobs initiative.  Currently ,19 LDCs manage 23 local employment service, LES, contracts.  The remaining three are also managed by not-for-profit organisations.  These activation supports are integrated with other social inclusion supports, facilitating jobseekers to simultaneously avail of complementary services such as training, childcare and health promotion.</p> <p>  In 2017 Indecon International Economic Consultants completed reviews of the local employment services and job clubs across the country.</p><p>It should be borne in mind that in 2016 the local employment service, LES, had been altered considerably from its original purpose and formulation in focusing on the long-term unemployed to a caseload and purpose reformatted for crisis times.  The evaluation was not focused on the LES model as it has been designed but rather on a reformulation that had been rapidly constituted.  We are now in an era more akin to what the LES had originally been designed for and this submission, while addressing the content of the evaluation, will have a focus on the employment services model required for today's operating environment, as I alluded to.  The value of the LES and jobs clubs under review in 2016 was approximately &euro;25 million.  Combined, the services employ approximately 400 qualified and experienced staff.  In 2016 the LES assisted 47,025 individuals, while jobs clubs assisted a further 19,663, giving a combined total of approximately 66,000 unemployed individuals in 60 separate locations across the country.</p><p> Indecon reported that the LES had achieved a placement rate of 28.8% against a target of 30% set by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It should be noted that only employment for more than 30 hours a week is included in this figure.  Excluded and not measured are jobs for less than 30 hours and placements in training, education and other necessary progression activities for those most distant from the labour market.  It is against this background that the 28.8% achievement figure is independent evidence that the performance of the LES and jobs clubs is excellent when compared with similar operations nationally and internationally.  Some 75% of LES clients reported that their interaction with the LES had motivated them to seek work or undertake further education or training.  A further 71% of LES clients said LES supports had improved their employment prospects.  Some 89% of employers surveyed reported that the LES had helped their organisation to find suitable candidates to fill vacancies.  Some 83% of employers reported that the LES had provided an efficient recruitment service for their organisation.  The two Indecon reports are more than 300 pages long and while there are many findings with which we could engage in more detail, the focus, rightly, is on the future.  In that regard, Indecon has made seven recommendations.  We will use our time to discuss their merits or otherwise.</p><p> The first recommendation is that there be a merger of jobs clubs and the local employment service.  The recommendation is that, given their close relationship, consideration be given to merging jobs clubs with the local employment service.  ILDN believes this recommendation would provide for a more integrated service for jobseekers.</p><p> Indecon recommends that LES and jobs clubs contractors should adhere to best practice governance.  ILDN fully supports this recommendation and notes that all local development companies are registered companies with voluntary boards of directors.  They are all registered charities.  All local development companies with an LES or jobs club contract hold the Q Mark standard.  As the companies hold contracts for several programmes across many funders, there is accountability, including to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Companies Registration Office, the Revenue Commissioners, the European Social Fund, the Charities Regulator and funder audits, while there is oversight through local community development committees and linkages with local economic and community plans.</p><p> On resources for the LES and jobs clubs, Indecon states: "Given the very significant reduction in the levels of unemployment, we believe this should be reflected in the overall resources provided for LES by the State".  ILDN fundamentally disputes the logic of this assertion.  As the level of employment recovers from the various crises, those who are most job-ready return to employment first and require the lowest levels of intervention and support.  Local development companies and their LES operations work with those who are most distant from the labour market.  Lack of marketable skills allied to social barriers requires deeper and longer intervention than that required in a recovering economy, with a 16% unemployment rate.  At this point in the post-recession environment, the marginal cost of assisting others to access the labour market rises.</p><p> With regard to the recommendation that reads, "focus on the most disadvantaged activation and other client groups who are not currently obtaining assistance from other State-delivered/funded programmes", ILDN agrees with the configuring and resourcing of employment services in this way.  Given the current buoyancy of employment creation, the support of those not currently on the live register or who are able to access what the International Labour Organization calls decent work should be an actively pursued policy objective.</p><p>The report's recommendation that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection should consider multi-annual contracts in order that delivery agents can plan effectively is welcomed by the ILDN whose members already successfully operate multi-annual contracts, such as the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP.</p><p> On the configuration of local employment services, we would reverse the order of recommendations 6 and 7 to give more time to future services.  Indecon recommends that amalgamation of services may be required to achieve greater economies of scale.  The ILDN notes that there are multiple numbers of T&uacute;s, rural social scheme, RSS, and SICAP contracts  While economies of scale should be explored, the grounded and local nature of T&uacute;s, RSS and SICAP by county and in agreed lots or areas in local development companies are major contributory factors to their success.  The contracting Departments, the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection itself, can testify to the effectiveness and efficiency of contract management by small teams in each area.</p><p> Indecon recommends that active consideration be given to an open public competitive procurement model for the future provision of services, and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has indicated it is preparing to follow this recommendation and procure for services within three months with a view to having such contracts in place for 1 January 2020.  The ILDN makes the following observations.  There are many good examples of State-funded programmes that are not contracted through an open procurement model, particularly in the labour activation area.  If there is to be a new procurement process, it should keep the needs of jobseekers and value for the taxpayer at its core.  This will require an objective assessment of all inputs and deliverables.  Currently, effectiveness of employment services is evaluated by a single indicator: placement in employment of more than 30 hours per week.  If commissioning is to be considered, it must take full account of the objectives of the service and the costs of delivering all parts of that service, including the elements of the journey to job readiness.</p><p> International experience in competitive contracting of employment services by a payments by results model has yielded unsatisfactory and unintended results.  I refer the committee to relevant academic literature, in particular the work of Greer and others.  The downsides of a privatised, pay by results model include removing experience and eliminating community organisations with a track record from competing.  Local development companies, as delivery agents for Government, are generally prohibited from retaining a profit on most of their programmes, including the local employment service, LES, and thus their lack of reserves will remove them from a payment by results model.  Gaming the system by creaming through prioritising the low-hanging fruit, parking those most distant from the labour market and coercion of those who wish to build a career rather than accept low-paid precarious work are among the methods identified in the research.</p><p> While open commissioning may initially appear attractive in cost terms, these are quickly offset by increased and often unclear procurement costs.  More crucial, however, is the likelihood that the taxpayer will be tied into expensive, inflexible contracts often designed for a different phase of the boom-bust cycle.  They compete with existing State-funded initiatives to the detriment of the latter.</p><p> The ILDN recommends that whatever procurement model is devised, it needs to take cognisance of the social inclusion aspects of delivering an employment service targeted at people most distant from economic activity, and the not-for-profit contract model operated by the Department of Rural and Community Development for SICAP.  Local development companies, LDCs, given their national coverage, provide a ready-made and workable solution to the challenge of reconfiguring employment services to include large elements of social inclusion work with targeted cohorts.  The success of the T&uacute;s, RSS and the back-to-work enterprise allowance schemes are current examples, offering value for money and agility to the contracting Department.</p><p> Any changes to the current model require a greater lead-in time than proposed, given the need for an ongoing service to jobseekers, the rights of employees and the proper planning and development to be undertaken by boards of local development companies.</p><p> Above all, the LDC capacity for full wrap-around service integration is required to meet the needs of today&rsquo;s jobseekers.  The need for such an approach is independently identified by the 2018 EU country report on Ireland.</p><p>It reads: &ldquo;Some progress made, with the presentation of the Action Plan for Jobless Households, but groups furthest away from the labour market still require an integrated approach to helping them enter it."</p><p> The Irish Local Development Network recognises that public employment services need ongoing adaptation to meet the changing needs of jobseekers but points to the success of the not-for-profit community model since 1991 and its greater effectiveness over a privatised, payment by results model in addressing deep-rooted unemployment.  The reconfiguring of the community-based model for current challenges offers jobseekers, employers and the State the optimum solution, which is accessible and locally based but has national coverage, is agile, has high governance standards, is linked to local democratic processes, is values-driven and has high personnel skills.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present today.  We are happy to take any questions members may have.</p></speech>

My colleague is Ms Caroline Kennedy from PAUL Partnership, and she is a jobs club leader.  We are going to split the presentation between us.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for inviting us to speak.  We are here as representatives of the SIPTU local employment service, LES, and the jobs clubs national committees, which represent our colleagues throughout the country.  The committees comprise partnership and non-partnership LES and jobs clubs.  The history to our being here is as a result of meetings we have had with Deputies Brady and O&rsquo;Dea and we thank them for facilitating our attendance today, which is much appreciated.</p> <p>  As background, we have written to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection on a number of occasions requesting a meeting to discuss the proposal of her Department to replace the community-based LES and jobs clubs with an open, public competitive procurement model for future provision of services.  We eventually received a reply offering an opportunity to meet an official from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This meeting took place on Wednesday, 20 March, and the Department official was accompanied by two colleagues.</p> <p>  Our presentation sets out the reasons both the LES and jobs clubs should remain as a not-for-profit model within the community.  It is an honour to be invited to Leinster House in the same year that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann celebrates its centenary.  The LES and the jobs clubs may not have been around for 100 years but we are approaching the quarter century, having been set up in the mid-1990s, and the end document refers to 1991.  We have been very much a front-line, person-centred service.  We have always operated in a not-for-profit structure and are an integral part of our local communities.  We would like to give the committee a brief history and background to the LES and jobs clubs and to describe how we operate.</p> <p>  The interim report of the task force on long-term unemployment of February 1995 laid out the template for the LES, which led to the jobs clubs model being developed to compliment and support the service.  The report has survived multiple key marks and the clearing out of our offices, and it is our bible.  In fact, it has multiple parentage in the sense that it crossed two Governments, given the early 1990s was a fairly tumultuous time, and there are many claims to the success of that document.  The report reads: &ldquo;The aim of the Local Employment Service would be to provide the gateway or access point to the full range of options which should be available to enable a long term unemployed person return to the world of work &ndash; these include guidance, training, education and employment supports&rdquo;.  Although many years have passed since the publication of this report, the values and the ethos it set down for the new service back in 1995 still very much prevail to this day, in particular being client-centred and responsive to the individual needs of clients.</p> <p>  It has been these clear values and operating ethos that have enabled us to be a successful service.  Time and again, we have been able to adapt our operating procedures to changing circumstances and official requirements while remaining constant to our overall values and operating ethos with a view to increasing a person&rsquo;s potential employability.</p><p>We are the gateway for unemployed persons because of our location within areas with typically high unemployment levels.  We are ideally located when people come looking for support or wish to undertake short job market training courses such as Safepass or forklift driving, for example.  Many of our long-term unemployed clients have been able to escape long-term unemployment and re-enter the world of work by undertaking such courses.  A significant percentage of those who use our services to access programmes such as the community employment scheme and T&uacute;s will gain full-time employment thereafter.  The LES and job clubs did not set themselves up to be the experts in all of these diverse areas.  The aim was to establish effective networks with all key stakeholders and other service provider.  The network approach has continued to the present day.</p></speech>

I am based in Limerick where I am the job clubs co-ordinator.  I will run through some aspects of how we operate and what we do on a day to day basis.  </p> <p>  The job clubs service is a community based not-for-profit model.  The local employment service, LES, and job clubs are local supports for jobseekers that match clients with employment, education and training opportunities within their locality.  The LES operates in 25 areas, while the job clubs operate in over 40 locations throughout Ireland.  Ours is a public employment contracted service which is operating successfully with a not-for-profit ethos.  We are based in the heart of communities throughout the country, with local offices in communities such as Moyross and Mayfield, urban centres like Clondalkin and more rural areas in counties such as Kerry and Mayo.  As both services are rooted in the community, it enables them to have a greater insight into the needs of the individual and the community and issues that may impact on the employability of the individual.  We have built a wealth of local knowledge of the local services and supports available to the individual.  This allows for collaborative working relationships between multiple services.</p> <p>  The LES and job clubs work with clients in using a person-centred approach, with the emphasis on providing a range of personalised, tailor-made supports.  We support our clients in availing of informal and formal certified training programmes.  Many clients also take the first step back into employment through engaging in various labour market programmes such as the community employment scheme; the rural social scheme, RSS, and T&uacute;s.  The LES and job clubs support clients to make this progression.  The LES has worked with Departments to deliver specific training programmes to meet employer and client needs, thus securing sustainable employment for clients in their locality.  The community employment scheme, RSS and T&uacute;s programme are the backbone of many services operating in communities.  It is often in these services that the routine of getting back to work, building confidence and having a sense of belonging and purpose creates the stepping stone to further training and employment.  The supports available to jobseekers through the LES and job clubs include progression planning, guidance and mediation, addressing barriers and building confidence, training and education, as well as access to labour market programmes such as T&uacute;s and the community employment scheme.  We also provide assistance through practical job search supports such as designing CVs, interview preparation and mock interviews, as well as through post-employment supports, providing access to financial support and information provision.</p> <p>  The recent Indecon report acknowledged that unemployment levels had fallen nationally.  According to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, the unemployment rate currently stand at 5.3%.  However, our experience as practitioners on the ground shows that there continues to be a client group which is very distant from the labour market.  Those in this group often present with multiple barriers to employment which can include having no work history, limited educational attainment, limited English language skills, homelessness, low literacy levels, lack of confidence and low self-esteem, age, transport access difficulties, lack of childcare supports, ill health and, in some instances, addictions.  The currently favoured &ldquo;work first&rdquo; approach, where only full-time employment for more than 30 hours is considered to be progression, is extremely difficult for those who are encountering a variety of barriers.  This is where both formal and informal supports are required to work with the individual.  The LES and job clubs recognise that the career progression journey for those who are most distant from the labour market begins with the focus on working with the clients where they are at, using a person-centred approach.  </p> <p>  The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, INOU, services research report of 2016 recognised the expertise the LES had developed in supporting people who were long-term unemployed.  The report notes that a good example of effective inter-agency and organisational work is the link with local job clubs.</p><p>The employees of both the local employment service, LES, and job clubs are highly qualified, trained and experienced with a vast range of local labour market knowledge, established successful networks and work in the heart of the community.  Both services have a workforce that is adaptable, innovative and values the empowerment and person-centred approach towards sustainable employment.  LES and job clubs have a proven track record of responding to the needs of Government; through our flexibility and adaptability we have proven that we are responsive, proactive and with the ability to meet the evolving demands of those who are unemployed &ndash; this is evidenced through the increased capacity of clients who were referred to the services during the height of the recession. </p><p> As the Indecon report states, the objective of the jobs club is to provide a range of services and supports for jobseekers and for employers.  There are four elements to this service, formal workshop training; one to one engagement; CV preparation; and, a drop-in service.  Clients are referred to engage in these supports through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the local employment service. </p><p> Formal workshop training covers a variety of topics including identifying individual client skills and local job opportunities; understanding the interview process; CV preparation; application forms; using the Internet to search for job; and, group participation and motivation.  The one to one engagement that is provided offers practical and personal support to clients on a one to one basis and this can include everything from structuring CVs, job applications, job coaching and pre-interview support.  The clients are assisted with the preparation of their CV.  This is often the initial engagement in the activation process for clients.  Many clients avail of the drop-in service where they can use the facilities and resources such as Internet access, computers, phones, printing and they can also use the JobsIreland website.  Most of our facilities around the country were very busy last week with clients preparing for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's National Jobs Week, with jobs fairs running throughout the country.  Our facilities enable clients of the service to be ready to properly engage with potential employers at the job fairs.</p><p> The Indecon report states that the clients surveyed for the report on their experiences with job clubs agreed their response rate exceeded typical response rates, showing that 21.5% of clients responded to the survey.  The results speak for themselves.  Some 80% of clients said the job clubs supports had improved their prospects of getting employment; some 79% of respondents stated that their engagement had motivated them to find work or undertake further education and training; some 77% of clients said their participation boosted their self-esteem and self-confidence; some 26% received assistance to find work for more than 30 hours per week; and 23% received assistance to find work under 30 hours per week.  These statistics demonstrate the positive impact that job clubs have on clients who engage with us and are supported in their journey towards employment.</p><p> The Indecon report further highlights the positive relationships we have developed throughout the country with employers.  Some of the findings are as follows: Some 79% of employers said that job clubs helped their company to find suitable candidates for available jobs; 81% of employers established effective ongoing relationships with job clubs staff; 86% of employers became knowledgeable of the support services available to them; 75% of employers gained employees who perform well and are reliable; and, 60% of employers filled vacancies they could not fill otherwise.</p><p> Let us consider the impact on the unemployment rate by job clubs and the local employment service.  In January 2012, the unemployment rate stood at 16%.  Through the combined work of Intreo, the local employment service and the job clubs, the rate fell to 9.3% by the summer of 2015.  This equates to a reduction of 6.7% and is prior to the introduction of the Department's for profit employment model.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Donal Coffey, who will speak about the local employment service.</p></speech>

The local employment service is a unique service model that is delivered by highly qualified staff who offer a customised person-centred service while being cognisant of the complexity and multi-dimensional causes of unemployment and how this impacts on individuals and communities.  The skilled staff focus on active listening, understanding and interpretative skills to facilitate clients who are most distant from the labour market to address the issues and barriers which affect their ability to access employment, education or training.</p> <p>  Future level market changes will continue to have a significant impact upon those who are already categorised as being most distant from the labour market.  This underscores the need for a guidance-focused mediation services for those most in need, namely the model practised by the local employment service.</p><p>We believe that this unique model should be available throughout the State and that a proposal from the ILDN in its paper, Responding to the Jobs Crisis: Local Development Companies working in Partnership with the Department of Social Protection, dated 15 November 2013, should be revisited.  This paper proposed extending the LES to areas of the country which currently do not have this service.  We believe that the LES is a proven model of best practice and one that should be available throughout the State.  This would allow for the development of a bespoke employment service based upon local area need.  Murphy and Deane stated in 2016:</p><blockquote>In the crowded and increasingly competitive activation space the LES is very well positioned, integrated and embedded in the communities of interest with highly and relevantly skilled staff.  Current EU policy affirms the LES in the landscape of activation policy and services, restates its core and unique selling point: its closeness to its customer base, its specialist skill set and its integrated position within the topography of community, voluntary and statutory services. </blockquote><p>A major element of the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work 2016-2020 plan focuses on the consolidation of existing activation services and expansion of same to new groups including: one parent families; people living with a disability; jobseeker transition recipients; part-time employees and qualified adults.  This element is reflected in one of the policy recommendations contained in the Indecon report on the LES, which states: &quot;We recommend that LES should in future focus on the most disadvantaged activation and other client groups who are not currently obtaining assistance from other State delivered/funded programmes.&quot;<br/><br/>We view this as a positive element to the report as the groups listed are the very people that the LES was established to work with, its original client base.  The current skillset of the LES is well placed to meet the needs of the groups listed as it is what the service has done for more than 20 years.  The Indecon report highlighted that 75% of LES clients state that their engagement with LES has motivated them to find work or to undertake further education or training, while 71% of LES clients said that LES supports had improved their employment prospects. </p><blockquote>The skill set and guidance/counselling orientation of the LES shows that it is the best qualified, and most ready, to re-embrace the following target groups; long term unemployed of more than two years, youth unemployed, those with educational disadvantage and specific, sometimes gendered, barriers (older long term unemployed men, female lone parents and qualified adults).  Migrants will be of increasing relevance.  The LES is particularly well placed to respond to such needs and work with local goals and targets and focus on the very long term unemployed. (Murphy and Deane, 2016: 13)</blockquote><p>An analysis of the Mayo LES discovered that the service cost &euro;871,480 but returned a minimum of &euro;1.9 million to the State.  The probability formula used for this study is also used by the UK Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion, the equivalent of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  This organisation is trusted, and indeed favoured, by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection as it was hired for its cost modelling work for JobPath, according to Murphy and Deane. <br/><br/>In April 2016, the Ballymun Job Centre conducted an analysis of its LES to discover the gross and net cost of the service.  A conservative study approach was adopted as not all job-placed clients were counted.  Even with such a conservative approach, a net cost of &euro;125,626 was generated.  This is also from the Murphy and Deane report in 2016. <br/><br/>The Indecon report of 2018 shows that the cost per full-time employment placement is &euro;2,544 and this figure is further reduced when part-time employment is factored in.  This figure compares well to the &euro;3,718 per full-time employment placement attributed to the private JobPath service.  It is important to note that the figure of &euro;2,544 does not take into consideration savings the State will make in less welfare transfers and income it will receive from tax receipts.  The Indecon report outlined that the LES achieved a progression rate of 28.8% into full-time employment, that is working 30 hours or more per week.<br/><br/>The examples I have given briefly outline the monetary benefits provided to the State by the LES.  However, when measuring the true worth of an employment service, it is vital to recognise the existence of non-monetary value.  The non-monetary value inherent in a community based, not-for-profit employment service helps to create social and economic benefits for the wider community.</p><p>However, when measuring the true worth of an employment service it is vital to recognise the existence of non-monetary value.  The non-monetary value inherent within a community based, not-for-profit employment service helps to create social and economic benefits for the wider community.  Such a return cannot be achieved through a payment-by-results employment service as it is and can only occur through a service that is client centred, holistic and not motivated by profit. <br/><br/>It should be noted that the capacity of the LES to work within its original ethos and guidance model was impacted by the economic crises.  The restructuring of F&Aacute;S saw LES being subsumed into Intreo.  Adaption by the LES to the Intreo administrative architecture and case management system has meant a narrower interpretation of outcomes, as there is an emphasis on only counting full-time employment of 30 hours or more as an outcome <br/><br/>A policy recommendation arising from the Indecon report for both LES and job clubs is that active consideration should be given to an open or public competitive procurement model for the future provision of services.  The Minister and officials in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have stressed that an open or public competitive procurement process must occur due to the perceived requirements of EU competition policy and rules pertaining to state aid but we would question this.  A clearer reading of EU guidelines on competition policy and rules pertaining to state aid outlines how member states can work within the EU procurement environment while still protecting services of general interest.  It is our view that the LES and job clubs fall into the category of services of general interest<i></i>and so can be protected from an open or public competitive procurement process.  Services of general interest expressly include services provided directly to the person, such as social assistance services, employment and training services, childcare, social housing or long-term care of the elderly and people with disabilities, according to Murphy and Deane. <br/><br/>We have a lot of concerns about the impact of open or public competitive procurement to the community and voluntary sector.  In the UK, open or public competitive procurement or commercialisation and privatisation of many community and voluntary sector activities has had a hugely detrimental impact on the work and independence of the sector.  Open or public competitive procurement contracts, such as the original JobPath tender, make payment conditional on results, thereby inserting a profit motive, and insist on a minimum company turnover per annum.  In the original request for tender for JobPath<i></i>in 2014, a minimum of &euro;20 million in turnover per annum was needed for any would-be bidders.  Any future open or public competitive procurement that may arise from the Indecon report with such a condition attached would automatically exclude the community and voluntary sector from participation and would see the wholesale closure of the vastly experienced and successful LES and job clubs network. </p></speech>

We believe it is essential that the LES and job clubs are provided with the opportunity to continue with the successful model of providing a community based, not-for-profit employment service.  We endorse the work of the ILDN in acknowledging that the future of public employment services is best served within a not-for-profit model.  The national committees of LES and job clubs has a number of recommendations for the Oireachtas committee, the first of which is to ensure the continuation of a not-for-profit, community-based model with equal recognition given to all progressions.  We also recommend that all client groups including one-parent families, people living with a disability, jobseeker transition recipients, part-time employees, qualified adults, underemployed people and those from new communities should be assisted, as well as the most disadvantaged activation clients and other client groups who are currently not receiving any State assistance.  We recommend the provision of a person-centred service with an engagement model based on need rather than set time limits.  Our fourth recommendation is the use of multi-annual contracts for forward planning and stability of employment, as per the Indecon report, and finally, we advocate a partnership approach with the Department's systems to provide an improved client-centred service</p></speech>

This committee was delighted to be able to facilitate the ILDN and SIPTU, both of which have made excellent, compelling and comprehensive presentations today.  I congratulate them on that.</p> <p>  I have a number of general questions.  Mr. Coffey mentioned in his submission that SIPTU had a meeting with departmental officials on 20 March, after a number of futile attempts to meet the Minister.  What was the outcome of that meeting?  Did Mr. Coffey get any sense that the Government has changed its mind about the public procurement issue?  That is, in my view, a fiction.  Is the Government still holding to its view in that regard?  Mr. Coffey said that some people are referred directly for employment while others are referred for further training, education and so on.  What is the percentage breakdown in that regard and has it changed with the end of the recession?  Has there been a significant change in recent years?</p> <p>  The witnesses do not agree with some of the Indecon recommendations, most notably a reduction in resources because unemployment has fallen and the obligation to engage in public procurement.  They argue that the recommendation to reduce resources because employment levels have improved is fatally flawed.  The initial purpose of the LES was to assist those people who were the greatest distance from the workplace, in other words, those who were long-term unemployed.  That focus obviously changed during the recession when the LES had other categories of people to deal with but now the LES is back to its original purpose.  The Indecon report's recommendation is based on the LES as it was at the height of the recession, not as it is now.  Indeed, that is reinforced by the fact that Indecon recommends that the LES focus on the long-term unemployed.  I fundamentally disagree with that proposal from Indecon, for the reasons stated.  While economies of scale have a certain attraction in theory, in the context of changes made to MABS and its sister organisation, the jury is still out.  In that sense, I would be very hesitant about getting into economies of scale here.</p> <p>  On the public procurement question, I agree with the witnesses.  If we have a system of public procurement along the lines suggested in the Indecon report, which is apparently supported by the Minister, we will completely eliminate the community and voluntary sector.  The sector will not be able to participate or compete.  I believe that the explanation relating to EU rules is fictional.  I agree with the witnesses on that as I read those rules recently and employment services clearly fall within the definition of services of general interest.    </p> <p>  It has been suggested that the Government wants to proceed with a latter day, reheated version of JobPath and that this will be the focus for the future.  I want the Government to know that Fianna F&aacute;il is strongly opposed to that and will not support it.  We have a great habit in this country of fixing things that are not broken.  We do not fix a lot of the things that need fixing and we have developed a habit of fixing things that are not broken.  The LES and job clubs model is clearly not broken and there is no need to fix it.  </p></speech>

The critical part of this process will be the Minister's appearance before us on Thursday.  As such, it is important that we hear what the groups have to say so that we can put their concerns, observations and questions to the Minister.</p><p> Unfortunately, this is an ideological battle, the seeds of which are long planted.  In 2012, the unemployment rate was 16%.  There was a 6.7% decrease in that rate through schemes before the onset of the privatised model, that being, JobPath's Turas Nua and Seetec.  When the Minister claims in the D&aacute;il that JobPath has been the most successful labour activation scheme in the history of the State, I refer her to these statistics.  They raise a question about why the then Government did not consider expanding the successful schemes.  It did not do so because it was ideologically driven to privatise and hand this work over to the payment-by-results model.  We are here because of JobPath.</p><p> Let us consider other statistics.  The Indecon report showed a placement rate of 28.8%.  This related to employment of over 30 hours and did not include other activation measures, for example, training, education and other key components that break down the barriers facing individuals who have been away from the workforce for a time and address their specific needs.  These critical components have not been taken into consideration.  Under JobPath and the privatised model, a mere 14% placement rate has been set as the target for Turas Nua and Seetec.  These figures are polar opposites.  The Minister deems them successful even though they are not reaching their target of 14%.  The number of people who have engaged with Turas Nua and Seetec and have been placed in long-term employment of 12 months or longer shows a massive fall.  According to the figures provided by our colleagues in SIPTU, finding someone a placement in full-time employment of 30 hours or more costs &euro;2,544 under the LES, which does not take into consideration savings from other activation measures, for example, training and education.  This is money well spent and represents just a fraction of the cost under JobPath, which is in excess of &euro;3,718.</p><p> Reading through the Indecon report, I was struck by the role of the mediator.  I deal with many people who have gone through JobPath not once, but twice.  Now people are being referred to JobPath for a third time.  Their individual needs in terms of upskilling or mental health issues are not being taken into consideration.  The mediator can refer someone for counselling.  That is important, as it cuts to the chase and deals with individuals' needs, yet there is no scope for it in a privatised setting.  This is another stark difference between JobPath and the LES.</p><p> I agree with most of what our guests stated.  However, I wish to make a couple of points on procurement.  In the Indecon report, no argument is put forward for opening this sector up to public procurement.  Not even the suggestion of EU procurement rules stands up.  This recommendation seems to have come out of thin air.  We need legal clarification from the Minister.  The &euro;20 million condition for the JobPath tender cannot be used if the Minister puts it out to public procurement.  The not-for-profit model is the one that works.  As Deputy O'Dea stated, if it is not broken, do not fix it.</p></speech>

Two points jumped out at me, the first of which relates to Indecon's recommendation that we should move to an open, competitive public procurement model.  I immediately thought of the national children's hospital, broadband and CervicalCheck.  What a great model.  Look at the results it has already provided.  What a recommendation.  I really liked the challenge to the idea that we must move to a competitive public procurement model because otherwise we would fly in the face of perceived EU requirements under competition policies and rules.  Our guests have put forward a good challenge to that.</p> <p>  I just mentioned to Deputy Brady something that we had not done yet, namely, invite Indecon to attend in order that its representatives might discuss the recommendations in the report.  All of the boxes it states must be ticked by services in reducing unemployment locally are already being ticked by existing schemes, which have had fantastic results.  Before the for-profit model of employment activation was introduced via JobPath and so on, there was a 6.7% reduction in unemployment between 2012 and 2015 through the methods provided by our guests' organisations.  Compare that with the reduction achieved by Seetec and Turas Nua.  These figures beg the question of where Indecon gets the idea that we must move to a public procurement model.</p> <p>  I will ask a question and perhaps someone involved in the jobs clubs will answer it.  The submission contains a list of client groups that present with multiple barriers, for example, limited education, no work history, homelessness, low literacy skills, age, distance, ill health and addictions.  Disability is not mentioned.  Will someone comment on ability programmes and how they are funded?  If they are not funded by the organisations represented, why is that the case?  How is disability addressed?</p> <p>  It is very clear that the model the witnesses have presented to us is one that works with communities and human beings as opposed to a punitive for-profit model that leads to an "I, Daniel Blake" result in many cases.  We recently saw evidence of how Seetec and Turas Nua were panning out for our communities.  Witnesses have appeared before us, with a scheme from Wicklow describing the detrimental impact of the privatisation of labour activation.  It does not work.  It is a for-profit model and is not about the people or their communities.  Clearly, Indecon's report tells us that our existing model gets results.  If it is not broken, why try to fix it?  All of this is being done because it is ideological.  There is an idea that we must do what the EU tells us and undertake everything on a competitive public procurement basis.  The evidence provided in these submissions refutes that.  I thank our guests for providing it.</p></speech>

Despite these angelic good looks and this baby face, I have been a public representative for 20 years.  I have used the services in Louth, predominantly in Drogheda but also in Dundalk, a great deal and I have referred, as have other public representatives, many constituents through those services.  Public representatives with some experience do not refer constituents and use services such as the local employment service, LES, and jobs clubs if they do not work.  All of us around this table know, and have the evidence from our work, that these services do exactly what is said on the tin.</p><p> I am concerned this review draws conclusions and makes some recommendations that are not embedded in the narrative of the report.  By that I mean the proposition there would be a competitive public procurement process for labour activation schemes and the types of sustainable supports that are required, and that they would be put out for public tender is a little bizarre.  I say that from a number of perspectives.  There is significant evidence and enough evidence objectively analysed in the Indecon report to justify not only the continuation but also the strengthening of the LES and jobs club model throughout the country if we are to address the very deep and entrenched problems we have in terms of the number of jobless households in this country.</p><p> We tend to congratulate ourselves every month when the live register figures come out and when we drill deeper into the CSO data in terms of the very welcome and growing employment rates in this country, but we also wilfully ignore the fact that one in six households in the country are jobless, which is a huge stain on our society and a problem in terms of our economic and social cohesion into the future.  Successive Administrations have not managed to deal with that.  As I have said repeatedly, the idea of work is not necessarily only about the weekly or monthly pay packet but also about the dignity of work and the contribution that work makes to our society.  The LES and jobs clubs have an enormous role to play now and in the future in reaching those hard to reach citizens who require wrap-around, customised, tailored services that the pay by results profit-driven model cannot address in any way to anyone's satisfaction.</p><p> I am not convinced either that an open procurement system is required.  It is not required at all based on points the witnesses made and points made by Deputy O'Dea and others.  I am convinced that at the top of the system - I do not necessarily mean the political system - there is an ideological motivation that insists that private is good and public or community-based approaches are bad.  That is unfortunate.  The reality is, and I will be upfront with the witnesses, a political campaign needs to be run over the next short period to convince the political system and the higher echelons of the public service that we need to maintain and grow these types of services that are critical if we are to address the issues that those one in six jobless households face because it is only through this community-based activation model that this can be done.</p><p> Will Mr. Bowe elaborate on the fact that the network has developed a proposal for an ongoing community-based activation programme?  It is very important in the context of what we are facing into over the next few weeks and months and the challenge to the system that the Irish global development network, the LES, the jobs clubs, SIPTU and others who favour this approach would outline precisely what it is that Mr. Bowe, and indeed I, are in favour of and not only what we are against.  It is important that those of us who believe in this system should articulate that and ensure we are leading the debate on this and not only responding.</p></speech>

I have had a great fear regarding the activation process for many years.  The witnesses will be aware that it started off in France.  It was first mooted many years ago and our Government took it on as being the way forward.  Even the European Anti-Poverty Network at the time critically analysed it in terms of what would happen.  Since then we have seen &euro;149 million being spent on JobPath.</p> <p>  I have a few questions for the witnesses.  Have any of them seen the contract between the Department and the private companies that have - we have to name this - displaced many of the services that were provided by the local employment services in communities?  We have never been able to get the full details of the contract in terms of what was promised.  What do we need to do to stop the privatisation of activation services?  Collectively, we have to do that, one way or the other.  It has not worked here and it has not worked in any other country.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the Indecon report.  How reliable are the data and the statistical information in the report?  I suggest the statistical information in it is inaccurate.  To take the example of a county such as Mayo, the report identifies there were 65 pathways to work referrals in 2016 when in fact there were 650.  Also, it states there were only 5% attendance rates which would obviously be brutal but in fact the attendance rates in Mayo were 80% to 90%.  In the context of the report being done only over one year, would it not be common and good practice for a report to be done over a number of years to get an accurate picture of where things were at?</p> <p>  I am reluctant to give the report credibility and it certainly should not inform the way we go forward in terms of activation and job services.  Are the witnesses aware of any plans the Department has drawn up because the report cites there is a surplus of staff in regard to the numbers on the live register as they are?  Are discussions taking place with staff or the union around what will be done?  Are the witnesses aware if the Department has drawn up a plan for the dismantling of the existing structures in terms of redundancies, lease agreements, contracts with service providers and the disposal of assets?  I would like answers to those questions.  </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presence here and for the very good work they do.  The displacement of the services within the local employment services through the privatisation of them is disgraceful.  Within the local employment services, how open can the services be when they are dependent on the Department for funding?  I have a problem with that in that perhaps people are being forced to collude with the pathway they are being brought down in terms of the provision of services.</p></speech>

Like many others, I know the work they do is thoughtful, effective and has a meaningful impact.  As well discussing this issue and speaking to people who have navigated unemployment and found support form local employment services and jobs clubs, I had the opportunity in the past to work with Wexford local development network in dealing with a group of rural unemployed young people.  What was striking about that was that space was made to listen to them as a group and to examine what the joined-up supports might be for those who were young and unemployed in rural Ireland.</p><p>That listening capacity should be used to taper the supports offered to the needs of the individual and particular contexts.  That is what the local employment services have done and it is important.</p><p> The straight statistics show that the progression rate into employment achieved by the LES, at 28%, is far higher than the equivalent figures for the for-profit services.  Will Mr. Bowe or any of the other witnesses comment on that?  The presentation on job clubs noted that 26% of participants found employment of 30 hours or more per week and 23% found employment of under 30 hours per week.  In addition to the progression rate of 28.8% for users of the local employment services, that is, those who have progressed into employment of 30 hours or more per week, do large numbers of users of the Irish Local Development Network move into employment of less than 30 hours per week?  We know the importance of building labour market attachment for those who may be lone parents or caring.  It is the foundation for a pathway into employment in future.  The 15 hours of childcare that is available is helpful.  Many who start with a 15 or 20 hour working week benefit on their journey back.  Perhaps the ILDN representatives might comment on that cohort.  Again, the blunt measure of 30% has not captured it.</p><p> I was struck by some of the other information, including that 89% of employers said they had been provided with a suitable candidate.  Let us consider the kind of revolving door experience for employers and jobseekers who have navigated the other system.  Suitable candidates are being provided and suitable employment and options are being offered.  I was struck by the emphasis placed on equal recognition being given to different outcomes.  For example, an outcome relating to someone returning to long-term education is important.  How does the ILDN check this given that the system does not allow us to capture the detail as it should?  How can the ILDN monitor those kinds of impacts?</p><p> Other community supports are offered through the local development networks.  Have the ILDN representatives seen any ancillary benefits for those who have navigated the systems?  What are the knock-on effects on those who may be either younger or older than working age but whose family members are navigating the system?  We know there have been distressing impacts on children and older people when they see others navigating the system or penalties within another system.</p><p> I want to discuss the issue of procurement.  The European directives provide scope in this respect.  The witnesses quoted community workers' research.  Reference was made to how services of general interest are allowed and that is completely correct.  It is interesting.  JobPath was the first time competitive tendering was used and European directives were cited as the justification.  In fact, social services are explicitly excluded from the competitive tendering obligation.  As we go down a privatised route, it is true that it becomes more difficult to roll back from it, which is an important issue.  I am bringing forward legislation this week relating to competitive tendering, which is not the most appropriate route.</p><p> I am concerned that the Indecon report only used the term "cost-effective", an out-of-date phrase, when the term currently used is "most economically advantageous tender".  There is scope within the European directives to make price and quality of equal value in determining these decisions.  Will the ILDN comment on the kinds of quality criteria that should be put in place if we go down that route?  Again, as I said, competitive tendering is a blunt instrument and an inappropriate route.  My legislation this week aims to make "price and quality" the default mode with "lowest cost" becoming an exception rather than the rule.  I agree with others that the case has not been made for competitive tendering.</p><p> I will finish by pointing to one or two of the key potential advantages in this regard.  It was stated clearly that the people who are most distant from employment require a different quality and level of support.  I note the unemployment rate had been reduced from double figures to single figures through the work of local employment services and job clubs before any private for-profit actors became involved.  In that context, we were debating the just transition in the Seanad earlier this week.  Climate change measures may be taken that could require the retraining of large numbers of people to enable them to move into new sectors.</p><p>Will the ILDN representatives discuss how a joined-up approach offered by the local employment service and jobs clubs could be of support as people transition from certain industries into new careers and options?  There is a certain flexibility when an organisation is not operating for profit because it does not have to answer to shareholders.  I support the idea of multi-annual funding as recommended by Indecon, but I know that there is more scope when people do not have to answer to shareholders with returns each year.  Will the ILDN representatives comment on this issue?  How will the local employment service respond to new needs, including the impact of Brexit or climate change or the closure of a sector?  Is there flexibility in that regard?  Can a service not constrained by an obligation to provide quarterly returns deliver better?</p></speech>

I am conscious that some of the comments made are relevant, specifically as we look at the design of a new programme.  The ILDN has welcomed the idea of having a multi-annual programme.  We cannot look at what happened in the past four of five years and say we are going to repeat it for the next four or five as we will be looking at a different problem.  We had a recession and high unemployment levels, but they have come down.  Mr. Bowe referred to the expression "post-recession".  We are in a different situation.  The problem we are facing is that many people who are long-term unemployed come from geographical and economic areas that would have traditionally had high unemployment rates.  They still have high unemployment rates.  Some individuals come from a background of intergenerational unemployment.  These issues will not be addressed in the same way as they would be for someone who lost a job for a year or so and then retrained, re-skilled and re-entered the labour force.  We are looking at a different issue.</p> <p>  One major concern I have relates to the references in the Indecon report to centralising, economies and efficiencies.  It needs to be the exact opposite.  A more local response is required, not only of the employment service but also in engaging with other providers of services in areas.  The people with whom we are dealing are further removed from being employable.  The problems are intergenerational and long term.  There is work to be done for those of school age today if we are to assist communities that have suffered the effects of long-term unemployment.  We need to work that far back into the system, rather than only with the person on the live register.</p> <p>  The presentation made by the ILDM highlights how one of the key advantages stems from being community and locally based.  It comes from the connections with others organisations in the local area.  That is important and probably not reflected adequately in the Indecon report.  That is my view of the report.</p> <p>  We will start with SIPTU.  Mr. Coffey should feel free to join in.  We will work across the members of the deputation.</p></speech>

There was no definite outcome from the recent meeting with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Deputy also asked about employment and training and the percentage difference.  I can only speak from the perspective of Limerick, but there has been a difference.  Last year's figures suggest we are looking at a 25% transition into employment.  There are still 10% to 15% who are engaged in activation and training programmes.  The percentage has not changed in recent years.  We still have approximately 10% to 15% engaging at that level and it is not recognised in the work we do.</p> <p>  I will address the comment made by Deputy Smith on people with disabilities.  We work with people who are referred to us and on the live register.  Generally, people in receipt of a disability payment do not fall into that category.  Often people who present to us have a hidden disability.  We engage with and support them as best we can.  We often refer to the EmployAbility service which is a specialised service for people with disabilities.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

On my way here this morning I saw the statute of Countess Markievicz outside the building.  I made reference to the centenary.</p><p>As well as being the first Minister for Labour, she was the first woman Minister for Labour and from the west.  I pay tribute to Ms Noreen Parker who is also from the west.  She is our SIPTU person and travels the length and breadth of the country representing the community sector.  I also pay tribute to her colleague Mr. Eddie Mullins.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the current Administration, like the previous one - I will use a phrase used by our friends in the North - seems to be a cold house for trade unionists who do not seem to receive much of a welcome.  Our colleagues, the community employment supervisors, have been trying to have an issue sorted out since 2008.  It is now 2019 and it still has not been resolved.  Although it is not one of the issues we are discussing, it is important to raise it.  All they are asking for is a pension entitlement.  Some of them have been working for almost 25 years and they still do not have it.  I note that the issue has been raised with the committee also.  The Minister's father was a trade union activist.  She might, therefore, like to revisit the issue, perhaps over a cup of tea and with a warmer welcome.  It is more important to listen and follow up for my trade union colleagues who are working at the coalface.  If issues are not taken seriously and not followed up, we could end up in a similar situation like that in France where there is mayhem and chaos on the streets with the <i>gilet jaunes</i>.  The powers that be should remember what they should be doing.</p></speech>

We will circulate it as a paper.  I will briefly cover some of the key points made within it.</p> <p>  There was a point made about local development companies, of which there are 49.  We are non-profit bodies to be found in every community in Ireland.  We are to be found in every urban and rural setting.  We reach into every parish and group.  We have national coverage that the Department has identified as a priority in the delivery of employment services.  We have the necessary infrastructure which can also deliver economies of scale because we have the capacity and staffing required.  We can do with more in the areas in which the LES is not funded.  That service is only to be found in 25 locations.  With a little additional investment, we could upscale to expand and provide services in the counties in which there none available, including Roscommon and Leitrim.</p> <p>  An important aspect of the local development companies is their boards which are made up of employers, representatives of trade unions, healthcare and education services and local bodies.  Local public representatives also constitute part of the boards.  We have that local knowledge and investment.  Local development companies are both big and small enough.  </p> <p>  I refer to all of the research conduction into social inclusion which is the core purpose of local development companies which are not for profit bodies.  They do not provide employment services only.  They do not provide education and disability services only.  They deal with all matters pertaining to the promotion of social inclusion.  That is important because it speaks to the need for the wrap-around services the most excluded in society require.  They require services throughout their lifespan which local development companies can offer on an integrated basis.  That means providing services for the families and households with which we are interacting and which include early years education, preschool, national school and secondary school services, as well as in making the transition to third level and in working with young people who are early school leavers.  It is not that we do one thing - the purpose of this meeting is to look at employment services - we do much more in working with those most distant from the labour market.  When one works with people most distant from the labour market, one misses the impact of all of the other factors mentioned.  What is unique about the local development companies is their ability to work with such persons throughout their lifespan.</p><p> We are non-profit bodies.  What does that mean?  We do not make a profit, but in one sense we do.  It is the social benefit that accrues from our work to the communities we serve.  It is not a cash dividend for shareholders but a social benefit for communities, individuals and citizens of the State.</p><p> We were asked what we needed to do.  We are at a crossroads.  As a society we have to decide the services we will provide.  It is a matter of political will in deciding which model we will choose.   That is why this opportunity to present to the committee is of considerable value.  It is a political choice as to whether we will go for the for-profit or stick with the non-profit model.</p><p> On public procurement, there is a mixed view.  In late 2017 the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection went to tender with a national programme for persons with disabilities.  We deal with the programme, although not always under the headings under which funding is available.  Under our programme headings, it is an important target group.  There was a public procurement process for the national ability programme which was restricted to non-profit companies.  Therefore, as late 2017, there was a precedent for how we should do it.</p><p> I emphasise that we have wrap-around services throughout a person's lifespan and can demonstrate the outcomes.  We have an evidence base for our work that has been established by the capacity of staff and their strengths over 20 years.  We have the infrastructure to deliver.</p></speech>

The local employment service and jobs clubs do not receive national coverage, unlike most other programmes such as SICAP, T&uacute;s and the RSS.  The LES is available in some areas; in the areas where it is not available coverage is provided by SICAP and other programmes.  The union side of the house also welcomed this.</p> <p>  I will answer some of the questions asked.  When one is talking about jobs for under 30 hours a week, it certainly has an affect on rural areas because some people are involved in tourism, which employment can be precarious.  While the system recognises this - we can track such employment on the system, as Ms Kennedy stated - it is not taken into account in the reports such as the Indecon report, which is a pity.  As alluded to by everyone, it is about improving quality of life, rather than merely having a paid 30-hour a week job.  There is a lot more to it than that.</p> <p>  On climate action, the fact that they are integrated companies, as Ms Fitzgerald mentioned, means that we can bring it across to the rural development and LEADER programme sides.  In the past few years we have engaged on ecotourism, rainwater harvesting and biodiversity.  It means that, as the Chairman mentioned, as integrated companies, we can respond to local needs.  We are delivering on national policy in a way that is community-led which is a real advantage.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the long-term unemployed and others.  We also have other programmes, as Ms Fitzgerald mentioned.  For example, we have a moving-on project under the programme for employability, inclusion and learning, PEIL, an initiative for women returning to the workforce who are not on the live register.  It is a successful programme, through which over 100 women have come.  We are in a flexible position.  We are managed by voluntary boards, the members of which are driven by and focused on the needs of the local areas they represent.</p></speech>

I have made a list of sorts.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea referred to economies of scale.  This economy of scale is an imaginary development that has happened in the United Kingdom where one of the impacts of the work programme has been the destroying of local community groups.  That applies to both urban and rural areas.</p><p>Mr. Bowe and I have visited some of them over there and I have relations with groups in Liverpool and London.  They have been put to the pin of their collar to stay open to the public.  The work programme has sent people to these charitable organisations for training without contributing to the training, yet it claims the benefit when somebody gets into a job.  I would not like to see that repeated here, but there is a sense that an element of that is happening in Ireland.  We know the not-for-profit sector has served the State very well in providing services the State could not provide either at a local area or an economic level.  These services range from mental health services to ordinary health services to lifelong learning to dealing with migrants.  Somebody asked about disabilities.  We run individual personal support, IPS, programmes for people with disabilities.  There is an array of stuff out there on which we have worked and we will continue to work on it.  That is where we should be.</p><p> Regarding procurement, there is some sort of illusion that the EU is directing that this must go to public procurement.  That is not correct.  Mention was made of the recent one, but SICAP is a model that was approved by the Attorney General, so this is not just something that was taken off the shelf and run with willy-nilly.  It was approved by the Attorney General.  We have given senior Department officials copies of the entire suite of procurement documents so they can understand exactly how SICAP operated for a not-for-profit organisation.  We would like to see that happen.  We welcome the Bill that has been introduced that brings into effect an EU directive.  As the Chairman knows, I have been talking about this for a long time.  Ireland is one of the few countries that has not adopted this directive.  We are out of step because we are not actually looking after the social inclusion and the social services parts of the tendering process in Ireland.  We go spectacularly for the buck only.  My final comment would be that there is a history and level of skill among our staff.  We work in a society.  We do not work in an economy and we want to continue to work in a society that cares for the least well-off.</p></speech>

The first thing that comes out of multiple comments is members' concern about whether the findings of the Indecon report necessarily lead on to the recommendations, particularly the one to consider a privatised model.  Our reflection on that is very clear.  It is a <i>non sequitur</i>.  The proposal to move automatically to consideration of competitive procurement does not arise from the evidential findings in the report.<br/><br/>I want to address a number of societal challenges that members have raised, such as climate change, Brexit, factory closures or automation.  These things are coming down the line.  The LES and jobs clubs model has worked especially well because it is not just a job-first model.  It works with people in employment so those people in precarious employment or bogus self-employment or those whose jobs are at risk are part of the client base.  In that regard, every local development company has a link with its local third level college and education and training board, and ILDN is linked in to several colleges in the institute of technology and university framework.  We are very concerned about the societal changes that come down the line and the need for reskilling as opposed to just a job-first approach.<br/><br/>Regarding that job-first approach, we have the Indecon findings but we also have a research arm of the State, namely, the ESRI.  I want to quote from its proposal from January 2019 for research for pre-employment supports.  It says that as employment increases, those who remain unemployed are likely to experience multiple barriers to labour market participation, meaning that employment is far from an immediate and realistic prospect for many of them.  It goes on to say that for these groups, job creation alone is not sufficient in ensuring full employment.  That reflects the concerns of many members about how we conceive the issue.</p><p>In that regard, local development companies stand ready to offer national coverage to the new cohorts who need to be brought in and who, as citizens, deserve a national employment service.</p></speech>

If we have missed anything, please come back to us.  I am sure members will do so.  Deputy O'Dea reflected on figures.  I hope I have his question right.  I can confirm that the figures for the LES and the jobs clubs in 2017 and 2018 are comparable to the outputs for 2016.  They are probably not quite as high as the figure of 28.8%, but given that the cohort is becoming more difficult, one would expect it to be lower.  The figures still stand up in terms of the numbers that both the LES and the jobs clubs are delivering.  The target is 40% for the jobs clubs, not 30%.  "Remarkable" is the word I would use to describe outputs given the scale of the budget and what has been delivered.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Nash, there will be an information campaign - I do not know if we like to use the word "campaign" - with all of the Senators and Deputies over the coming weeks to try to convince them and the Government about a correct way forward, not just a self-serving interest on our part but on behalf of clients.  We want to convince them that the for-profit sector is not the way forward.  I say that as someone with 30 years in this business, both at the front line and now as the CEO.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh asked two questions.  We have never seen the contract so we have no idea about it.  She asked a question about the figures in the Indecon report.  That is an interesting question.  If we look at the two reports, which run to 300 pages each, there are definitely figures and commentary with which one would disagree, but in the overall scheme of things, what the Indecon report says is that a service such as this is required.  One tries not to get caught up in some of the parts with which one might disagree.  Overall, I believe the figures are reasonably accurate in the broadest sense.  We would disagree with some of them.  I do not know if that answers the Senator's question.  It is easy to have a go at things on specific pages, but if we look at the some of thrust of it, one would accept some of the figures.  We would strongly disagree with how some of the recommendations evolved out of the report, but we have commented on that.</p> <p>  Some of the other questions, such as those from Senator Higgins, were dealt with by Ms Fitzgerald.  There is a choice for elected representatives at this time, not just the Government.  What do we want to do with the most vulnerable in our society, the 5%?  We are all very much of the view that just because we have full employment, we cannot move off.  For a relatively small investment, groups like ourselves or the community can work in a not-for-profit way and deliver a multitude of benefits that may not all be about employment.  They might be about changes in lifestyle, households, families, benefits and children.  The Government must grasp that it is not about the money at this time.  It is not for profit.  It is about what we want to do with the 5% in our society.  That is where we play a part and what we are committed to.  Others play a role in that as well.  I hope the collective part of the D&aacute;il can bear in mind that just because we have X, we still need to provide services for the 5%.  It will pay dividends down the road.</p></speech>

Deputy Brady clearly indicated that this is part one of a two-part process.  We will address the Minister next week.  It is very important to be fair and compliment the witnesses on the presentations because while we have the Indecon report, we are looking forward to the future of some sort of new employment service.  I do not like to pick out one individual but Ms Fitzgerald indicated very clearly the range of services and the contacts that ILDN and the various companies have at community level.  In respect of dealing with people who are long-term unemployed where there are greater barriers, she explained that type of local infrastructure very well.</p></speech>

This has been a learning process for me.  When the local employment service, LES, started, it was a gateway for people in the community to reach information on jobs because in Cork they would have had to travel into the city centre, which would have made it quite difficult.  That was the idea behind the LES that it would reach out into the community.  Roll on 20 plus years and the gateway is different.  It is the gateway into communities, including the difficult to reach section of the population.  A lot of services available through the LDC partnerships could actually be channelled through our offices, especially because we are linked with the unemployment service.  The live register is a universal church and we meet a lot of people.  The LES is very useful and I believe the Government underestimates its potential.</p> <p>  I knocked the cold house, but I thank front-line staff in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the former F&Aacute;S who have always worked very closely with us.  As a front-line worker, I acknowledge them in this forum.</p></speech>
