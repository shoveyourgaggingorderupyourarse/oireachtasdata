The purpose of the first session of today&rsquo;s meeting is to examine equine welfare, while the second session will focus on the development of the hemp sector in Ireland.  The committee will hear from representatives of My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue on equine welfare in the first session and representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc on the development the hemp sector in Ireland in the second.</p> <p>  From 28 February, the legal requirement for mask wearing in all settings has been removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use a face mask, particularly in crowded areas.  While the easing of restrictions has removed the general requirement of maintaining a 2 m physical distance, the public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important everyone in the parliamentary community continue to be respectful of other people's physical space.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means they will have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  They are expected, however, not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chairman's direction.  Witnesses should follow the directions of the Chairman in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that, to the extent that is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in respect of participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  During the first session, we will hear from the following representatives of My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue: Ms Martina Kenny and Ms Deborah Kenny, co-founders, and Mr. Eoin Cullen, director.  I invite them to make their opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.  My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue, MLHR, was set up in 2011 by its co-founders, me, Deborah Kenny and Cathy Davey, because we realised there was an urgent need for a dedicated horse rescue in Ireland.  MLHR is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming unwanted, neglected and abused equines, pigs, dogs and other animals.  We believe all animals deserve the five freedoms, namely, freedom from hunger and thirst, from discomfort, from pain, injury and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress.  We have created a safe haven for our rescued animals on our three farms, where we ensure each and every one of them has a life worth living.  MLHR is constantly growing, and the demand for our services increases in line with our growing reputation as one of the best animal welfare organisations in Ireland.  We have expanded our operations to include three rescue centres - two in Kildare and one in Cork - run by our team of dedicated farm managers and invaluable volunteers, who have rescued thousands of animals from brutality and cruelty.</p> <p>   Why are we afraid in this country to call out something for exactly what it is?  We allow suffering and cruelty to be inflicted by people on horses, dogs and other animals in our society.  We must do whatever we can to reduce the number of people of all classes and backgrounds who do this, be that in horse racing, so-called sulky racing, dog-racing or dog-breeding businesses, or by owners of horses and dogs who reside in our cities, whether in privately-owned homes or council-owned properties.</p><p>The State seems to be happy to allow animals to be abused, with little or no enforcement of the law in situations where is it glaringly obvious who the perpetrators are.  For example, more than two weeks ago, MLHR volunteers had found a dead foal in the canal close to Bluebell in Dublin, one of many drowning incidents of young horses we have had to deal with over the years where a horse is left with no water and slips into the canal.  We also had to rescue War Celeste, a horse that no doubt some members will be familiar with, who was found abused knee-high deep in excrement in a disgraceful condition and emaciated.  It is glaringly obvious that people are abusing these animals in our society yet they rarely pay the price for their crimes.  So much of the wickedness that has lain hidden and protected in society is finally being exposed by brave and honourable people, yet the area of animal welfare remains our blind spot as a nation.  When it comes to defenceless horses and dogs, we in MLHR believe the State is not doing enough and must do more.  The world has changed and we need to change too.  The horses of Ireland are being starved, neglected, beaten and dumped by all sections of our community and we are calling those responsible out for what they are.</p><p> We have worked extremely hard over the years to foster positive relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, county councils and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as these organisations have great powers in the area of animal welfare.  We work closely with garda&iacute; all over Dublin and throughout the country to assist in equine seizures and welfare call-outs and we have given a presentation on equine welfare and all relevant legislation to many garda&iacute;, including the graduating class of 2018 from the Garda College in Templemore.  We work closely with Dublin City Council and its newly established animal welfare unit, assisting it in the areas of both equine and canine welfare and this relationship is benefiting many animals every day.  MLHR takes every equine that is seized and pounded in the Dublin City Council area after their five days, ensuring the animals are not destroyed.  This is a great accomplishment and shows how well the two entities work together.  MLHR sits on Dublin City Council&rsquo;s animal welfare oversight committee, as well as on Kilkenny County Council&rsquo;s animal welfare committee.  We would eventually like to see every county council have an animal welfare unit and we would like to see a dedicated Garda animal welfare unit.</p><p> We work with both T&uacute;s and Nua to provide work placements and we have also hosted groups of inner-city youths for a day on the farm with instruction from our farrier, equine dentist and one of the Dublin city horse carriage drivers that we work with.  This has been hugely well received and we plan to continue this work in the future.  We work with the Travelling community in many different counties and we hope to continue this work on a greater level.  Throughout Covid we did Zoom classes with schools around Ireland and we can see the great interest out there among young people for more knowledge of and interaction with animals.</p><p> Education and awareness are key.  We want to create an educational space at our centres as we know education will positively assist the mental health of young people as they become adults and that it will help their understanding of animal welfare.  We also want to involve adults who experience negative mental health and social skills issues.  MLHR is a place where everyone fits in and is welcome; a place where no one judges and where everyone supports each other.  Last year alone, MLHR took in 400 animals on top of the hundreds already in our care.  We have amazing fosterers who help to ease the burden of numbers on our farms but we are constantly in need of more space, land and funds as we grow and as the number of rescued animals grows.</p><p> Last year our running costs were in excess of &euro;400,000, which did not include salaries.  We received a small Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grant of &euro;26,250.  In comparison, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, for example, received &euro;668,500 and &euro;615,000, respectively.  Everything else we fundraise and it is a constant struggle to keep up with our huge running costs.  We have been a volunteer-run organisation up to recently but we currently employ five staff to help with daily operations.  MLHR has proved consistently since its founding in 2011 that it is so much more than what it started out to be.  Adaptable and resilient under great pressure, MLHR has become one of the most well-known and highly respected animal welfare organisations in this country.  We are trusted by the public because we are unfazed by any obstacles thrown in our way and people know that if they contact us, we will be there for those animals in need.</p><p> Actions we believe that are needed to help improve the implementation of the legislation are as follows: enforcement by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; local councils countrywide; and organisations such as MLHR working together.  This work should tackle indiscriminate breeding; chipping and passporting; horses on public land; clear signage in troubled areas; prosecutions; and heavy fines.  We are saying it out loud and clear: MLHR needs more Government funding.  What we get is completely inadequate for the services we provide and the work we do.  We need our Government to sit up and take note.  These ongoing equine issues are not just going to go away.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#B00200"><p>I thank Ms Kenny and I compliment MLHR on the work it is doing.  I take issue with the paragraph on the second page of the submission.  Maybe it was not intentional to send this message but it states: "The horses of Ireland are being starved, neglected, beaten and dumped."  The vast majority of horses in the country are extremely well looked after.  I fully accept that we have an issue and we have an issue with all animals, be they horses, dogs or whatever but the vast majority are well looked after.  The way that paragraph was written implies that the majority of horses are being neglected, which is not the case.</p> <p>  I would have a big issue with the fact that microchipping of horses is not being enforced by the Department.  The last time I asked the question I was told that 19% of horses in the country were not microchipped.  When someone finds an instance of cruelty and the owner cannot be traced it makes it difficult to prosecute and I cannot understand why this is not being enforced by the Department.  Every cow has to be clearly identified, for example.  If an inspector or departmental official comes onto a farmer's land and he does not have all his cattle clearly identified, he will be prosecuted straight away and suffer a severe financial penalty.  It baffles me that this is not being enforced because if it was enforced, it would be a lot easier to bring the people who are mistreating horses to justice.  I am not telling Ms Kenny her business because she is obviously good at it but this is something MLHR should keep the pressure on the Department about.  Microchipping is provided for in legislation and every horse is meant to be microchipped.  There was a "Panorama" programme a year and a half ago, which showed a horse that had broken its leg racing in Fairyhouse and a number of years afterwards it appeared in an abattoir in the UK.  Those things should not happen and if horses were microchipped they would not happen.</p> <p>  Ms Kenny's points on funding are extremely well made.  With the number of cases MLHR is dealing with, the budget it has is miserly.  Deputy Martin Browne and I work with Tipperary County Council, which has a vet who looks after animal welfare.  Unfortunately, we have encountered a significant number of incidents.  The county council will say it does not have the funding to impound the horses.  It is an issue that needs to be co-ordinated.  If a county council is moving to impound horses it cannot be worrying about the budget to do it.  If there is cruelty there then the situation has to be dealt with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#B00300"><p>I welcome the guests.  I asked for them to be brought before the committee as part of its agenda because I had seen the work they had done.  It came in light of the frequent discovery of abandoned horses in County Tipperary.  As the Chairman said, we have seen this in recent years and there was one particular location that kept coming up, although we have seen instances of neglect in various other parts of the county as well.  You would have to have the hardest of hearts not to be totally outraged by what has gone on and there are few people who would not be outraged by it but it seems to continue on a daily basis.  Various arms of the State are involved in dealing with breaches of animal welfare.  These include the Department, local authorities, animal rescue organisations such as MLHR and the Garda.  There has to be buy-in from animal owners as well.  To get an idea of what is needed to address these ongoing acts of neglect and cruelty, could the witnesses give us a description of what happens and who they contact when they get a call about a horse that has been abandoned or that is in neglect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Cullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#B00400"><p>When we first get a call in and if we know the exact area, we will contact the local Garda station to see if they are able to attend the situation.</p><p>We will also try to contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to let its officials know.  We log every incident that comes to our attention.  Unfortunately, one of the main issues with contacting the Garda is that while garda&iacute; are fantastic, they do not know enough about the animal health and welfare legislation to help us on a regular basis.  A number of garda&iacute; in different counties are looking to learn a lot more about that legislation and want to get more involved.  That is fantastic from our point of view.  Those garda&iacute; want to do it.  However, at the Garda College in Templemore, only half a day is spent on animal health and welfare legislation.  That is all prospective garda&iacute; learn as part of their training.  It used to be a day's training but that has been cut back.  Unfortunately, the knowledge required to allow garda&iacute; to dive on board is not there but as soon as we have a conversation with them, help and inform them, they will get involved.  We then get in touch with local authorities and local councils.  They are the people with whom we would look to get in touch.</p></speech>

We find that if a member of the public gets in touch about a cruelty case, the Garda will direct them to one of the larger animal rescue organisations.  The member of the public is then sent back to the Garda and told to get in touch with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the representatives of which suggest the person concerned should call the Garda.  This is the sort of chain that is going around.  We want everybody to work together.  We need a system where people are not fobbed off to the next person.  Once My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue is involved, we do all we can to give people help and to answer them.  We have to do that.  The public have become very aware of animal cruelty.  They want help and ask for it every day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#C00500"><p>What is our guests' experience of the availability of the Department, the council and the Garda when they contact those organisations?  Do they come quickly or is it a long, drawn-out process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#C00600"><p>It depends on the time of the day.  We provide an after-hours service but other organisations finish at 5 p.m. and that is the end of that.  It depends on the time of day.  If we know garda&iacute; in the area concerned or have worked with the Garda in that area in the past, the response is amazing.  Dublin City Council has an animal welfare unit and that has already proven it is working.  Those guys are there until at least 8 p.m. but we will help too.  There are garda&iacute; in areas who will help.  That is good.</p></speech>

Is all the information fed up a line that includes the Garda, the local authority and the Department?  Is it a more haphazard situation?</p></speech>

If the situation is serious and garda&iacute; get involved, they will organise a PULSE number.  They will set the chain in place by getting in touch with Department officials and try to get a Department veterinarian to visit the location in question.  There are Department veterinarians all around the country.</p></speech>

As soon as we get a call from the public or the Garda, we keep all the information logged.  We usually get in touch with the Department and a garda in the area.  The Dublin branch of the Garda is amazing in that respect.  If we need anyone to come on board and help, we will make a call.  After hours, it is us who receive calls.</p></speech>

I do not think there is enough knowledge on the part of the officials as to what is involved.  A certain garda may not know who he or she must contact.  We always try to help as much as we can but not everyone is clear on exactly what steps are required.  It also depends on the severity of the case.  If it is only a matter of a stray horse, the Garda will not contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It will contact the pound for stray horses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#C01200"><p>I will move on to public awareness and consultations with various horse-owning sectors.  It is important that everyone is singing from the one hymn sheet.  Are the programmes in existence effective in highlighting the abuse of animals?  What more could be done to make the public, or even the Garda, more aware?  Mr. Cullen spoke about the training new recruits are undertaking in Templemore.  Are the programmes in place effective with respect to the general public?</p></speech>

We run our programme via social media and for the past 11 years, we have got our message out to people through social media.  We are not hiding the fact that there is serious cruelty going on.  We let the public know because they need to know.  They need to know who to call and talk to.  Social media is the way to send that message.  We feel there should be something out there in certain areas through advertising in bus shelters, dole offices or other places where information can be seen to show that the Government, the Garda and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not accepting the mistreatment of animals anymore.  Clear signage needs to be out there to tell people they can be fined or imprisoned for animal abuse.  There is nothing out there at the moment.  There is nothing to tell people not to go into public parks with certain animals.  Those signs are required.  There are horses in public parks all over the country and the owners say, "Well, it is a park."  That is dangerous.</p></speech>

The legislation itself is very good but it is not widely enforced.  Garda&iacute; need more education on the legislation and the powers they have as authorised officers.  Not enough garda&iacute; realise they are authorised officers who have more power than any of the animal organisations, such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA.  We need better education for training garda&iacute;.  We bring presentations to Garda stations around the country.  We give hour-long presentations to all the new recruits in Store Street, Mountjoy and the Bridewell Garda stations.  Those presentations include bullet points on the legislation because those garda&iacute; do not have enough knowledge in that regard.  Many garda&iacute; are interested, and are becoming more interested, because they see exactly what is going on and recognise the need for them to get involved.  Better education for garda&iacute; is important.</p></speech>

In many instances, there is a case for a good and clear prosecution.  As we have said, not enough animals are chipped and have passports.  In some cases, there is a chip which indicates a clear owner or the owner in question admits owning the horse.  The rate of prosecution in such cases has dropped.  We get everything ready with the farrier, dentist and veterinarian.  We prepare for a prosecution to help the Garda.  Everyone should help the garda&iacute;, who are very good authorised officers.  We must push for prosecutions and heavy fines.  It is up to the Government to do that because it is the only way it will work.  We must hit people in the pocket and show them we are not taking it anymore.</p></speech>

I do not want to be critical, and there may be an element of poor phraseology or bad wording here, but I must comment on the portion of the opening statement in which Ms Kenny said that the horses of Ireland are being starved.  That is a general comment and I am a horse owner.</p><p>The powers that be at home tell me that I put my priority on the horses more than I do on the house.  I have been told that by the people who go shopping and have the trolley full of dog and cat food before we start buying anything for the house.  I am only one of many very dedicated, committed horse owners who as I say, in many cases, prioritise the horse and the horse&rsquo;s care maybe over the humans in their lives.  The way it was worded was unfortunate but we will leave it at that. <br/><br/>The Chair also mentioned that in all aspects of the equine sector the problem is the identification.  As with all aspects of life, when it comes to criminality or anything the people who comply are the dedicated owners who will have their horses checked and everything will be in order.  The ones who will end up at the witnesses' door are those who are not traceable.  In that regard, even for horses that are chipped there is no continuity of change of ownership.  The Chair mentioned the War Celeste scenario and situation.  War Celeste went through Tattersalls.  It had been chipped.  One would imagine that for a horse that went through Tattersalls and was actually sold for nearly &euro;250,000 it would be just a matter of reading the chip to identify an owner.  However they were not able to identify an owner.  How does one overcome that problem from a traceability scenario for horses that are actually chipped?  How do the witnesses overcome the scenario of horses left in the park to run wild and when they come into their care they are not chipped?  What power have the witnesses over that horse if no owner is identified?  They do the teeth, the hooves, they get the farrier and whatever.  Would they or some of the powers in enforcement have the power, assuming an owner will turn up later, to spay or geld that animal?  Do we have the power to go that far?  In my opinion that might help in solving the problem of the wild or unidentifiable horses or unowned horses<b>.  </b>I do not know whether you have that much power.<br/><br/>Finally, in its submission My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue says it is providing education at its centres.  Who comes to the education sessions?  Who recruits?  Who decides who comes?  Is it open days for schools?  Does it identify certain people within the community, or advertise for interest?  When it states it is educating people at its centres, who is being educated?  Would the witnesses like to get involved in a broader element of education where they become regular visitors to schools, nationally?  Is that something they would like to do?  Education is often offered as a solution for most problems but financially or through limited numbers we always end up talking about educating a minority or a very small number of people.  Unless it is broader it does not have the desired effect.  Could they see themselves in a position where they would be able to become a travelling roadshow visiting all schools in the country?  Who are the people they are educating at the moment?  How are they recruited and how do they find out about this or how do they get them in?</p></speech>

We do understand there are amazing horse owners out there.  Some of our own volunteers &ndash; there are 70 of us &ndash; are in the racing industry and have beautiful horses and that without a doubt is the way it is.  However, we deal with a great many abused and neglected horses.  Just recently we came across a farm type of livery that had about 150 horses on it.  Half of those horses were starved and neglected.  Only last year we helped the garda&iacute; in Kilkenny with another case where there were 110 horses starved and neglected.  Those words, when they come through us, we are dealing with hundreds.  Ireland is overpopulated with horses.  There are a great many doing well.  They are loved absolutely and they are beautiful horses.  We were in Punchestown today showcasing War Celeste but a great many of the horses we deal with on a daily basis are in a terrible state.  They are in our housing estates, on farms, everywhere.  It is quite scary that one person would have so many.  It is a case of the summer comes, see who makes it.  They can be sold for little or nothing.  We are sorry for saying that but we deal with an awful lot of such cases.</p> <p>  In regard to the children and the schools-----</p></speech>

Initially when one contacts people like that they say that she was sold on.  In accordance with the legislation when a horse or any animal is sold the passport needs to be changed into the new owner's details but it does not happen all the time depending on whether or not the buyers intend to sell the animal on again.  If they do not, depending on their purposes, not everybody changes the details of the passport and this is where the details tend to get lost.</p> <p>  War Celeste went to a couple of different auctions and was bought on.  The person who bought her had no interest in looking after her.  She was left with 11 others in stables.  We had another incident where seven thoroughbreds were found in a wooded area in Naas.  When the chip was scanned it was to a very well-known owner.  However there is no way of proving that he put them there because he said he had moved them on a long time ago.  They just seem to change hands.  They can end up in urban areas in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  They can end up anywhere.  It is a difficult one because there needs to be enforcement at the time of sale to say one must change the passport details now, today, because when they buy them they are just told they need to change it within a certain amount of time.</p></speech>

Traceability and microchipping go together.  One cannot have one without the other.  When an inspector goes into a yard or wherever, there should be a register for the number of horses there and the owner has to be responsible for them.  That has to happen if we are going to make improvements on horse welfare.  One cannot just say that one gave that horse away; one's responsibility cannot stop there.  There has to be an official record of where the horse went.</p></speech>

It is still officially registered to me.  Can they not follow me?  That would put the pressure on me if I ever sell a horse in future to make sure the paperwork is filled out before the horse goes.  Can they pursue the person who they have official documentation for?  Can they say that Paul Daly owns that horse, they cannot take my word for it if a sale is not recorded.  Can they do that?</p></speech>

It is difficult for the Garda to prosecute on that basis because they are saying they sold that horse on to somebody else and they might have a receipt to say they sold it on but they do not have a name or a number and do not know where that person lives.  That is where we hit a block.  That is why we are saying that if a horse has to be chipped or issued a passport, whoever that horse is chipped to or named on the passport is the person at fault.  That is where we want it go back to.</p></speech>

My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue does a very good job.  Like all previous speakers, I believe that anyone who has a horse loves their horse.  People love their animals but many do not have the ground or the facilities to be able to look after them.  Is cruelty to animals a bigger problem in urban areas or in rural areas?  I know that local authorities get funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for veterinarians.  Do they play any part in regard to animal welfare in particular in regard to horses and animals?</p></speech>

I commend the witnesses on the great work they are doing.  They are doing fantastic work but it would be remiss of me, like the two previous speakers, not to take them to task on the couple of lines relating to animal welfare.  I appreciate that they are at the coalface and are seeing the absolute worst but right across Ireland, we are very passionate about our horses and 99.9% of horse owners look after them as well as any member of their family.</p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses in relation to funding.  It is a huge challenge and &euro;26,000 is a derisory sum.  I will take that up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The amount of money that is given to the ISPCA has been a bone of contention for me for many years.  I live not too far away from the national sanctuary in Longford and I see the great work being done there.  There is an opportunity for the witnesses here.  They have proven themselves and have put in the hard hours on the ground.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullen mentioned that enforcement powers are available and that he is happy with the legislation.  The issue is more a case of education for the courts staff, judges and garda&iacute;.  I have a couple of questions in that regard.  Can the courts stop somebody from owning horses?  Is there provision within the legislation to stop people from keeping animals or if they clean up a mess, can they start all over again?  </p> <p>  On the 400 horses that the witnesses took in last year and micro-chipping, I appreciate everything they said in that regard.  When departmental representatives were before this committee I told them that I knew of one horse owner with 40 horses.  He wrote to the Irish Horse Register, which registers sport horses and draught horses, to explain that out of those 40 animals, 20 were still registered to him even though he advised that they were not.  That is an issue.  Out of the 400 horses that came to the sanctuary, how many were micro-chipped?  </p> <p>  There is an opportunity for the witnesses in the education space although I appreciate that their numbers are small, with only five full-time staff.  In terms of getting additional funding, the areas of riding for the disabled, mental health and therapy riding could provide opportunities.  I admire the work the witnesses are doing with the Traveller community.  They are ideally placed to move into that space but I concede there is not an awful lot more they can do with the staff they have and it is very much a funding issue.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back to us with a proposal for development.  I have seen first-hand the benefits of therapy riding and it is great to see.  </p></speech>

In urban areas, the problems are in parks, backyards and so on.  There are certain areas all around Ireland that have horses in them and it is very hard on the councils and garda&iacute;.  In rural areas, the problems would be on large farms where the farmer just breeds and breeds.  There would be a few stallions in with some mares and they just keep breeding and it gets out of control.  They will then sell whatever survives.  On the basis of the kind of cases that we attend with the Garda, I would say that urban and rural areas are very much equal.</p> <p>  On the local authorities, a lot of them have taken the problem on board and have taken us on board.  They are really listening.  I will be in Kilkenny tomorrow with Kilkenny County Council which is trying really hard.  We are working with two sets of Traveller communities.  There is a huge horse issue in what is a small and very compact city and we are trying to deal with that.  There is a lot happening, even in terms of education.  Even though we are only a small organisation with five staff, we do a lot.  Lots of schools contact us because they enjoy it.  Ours is not a place where the animals are kept behind bars.  It is very much a walk-around place where people can pet a pig or a goat.  That has changed people's attitudes and helped them, in many ways.  That is where the education part fits in.  We are very much hands-on with the animals and that is very important for mental health, among other things.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, one of the biggest issues for us is that we are not authorised officers.  We do not have an authorised officer but that is something we would love to get involved in.</p> <p>  One of the questions was around education, who we are educating and whether we would be interest in a travelling road show.  We would be 100% interested in that.  In terms of who we are educating, we go into schools.  We have been invited into number of schools to give talks.  As Ms Kenny said, youth clubs from the Dublin 8 area have visited our centre.  They met farriers and dentists who have tried to educate them on how to take care of a horse, what is needed and what is involved.  We have given presentations to the Traveller community and to garda&iacute; too.  We are trying to educate a broad variety of people.  Getting involved in travelling around the country and visiting schools is something we would love to do.  We would love to be involved in that.</p></speech>

I am from an area where horses are tied up, are being jockeyed around the place and where sulky races take place.  I am seeing that and am in it so I know how to talk to people.  We are not afraid.  We are told many times by various people to be very careful in certain places or we are advised not to go in but we march right in.  It is the only way.  We have to do that; we cannot be afraid.  We are beyond being afraid in certain areas or with certain people or communities.  We have to take a stance, not be afraid and speak out, loud and clear.  This can be done when we have good garda&iacute; on our side.  That is a fantastic thing.</p></speech>

They are bringing us a very important perspective on equine welfare in the broadest sense.  We spend a lot more time than I would ever have envisaged at this committee talking about horses, from all different perspectives.  It would be useful, if the opportunity ever arose, for the committee to visit one of the farms because often it is only when one is physically somewhere that one gets a true sense of it.</p> <p>  I would like to get a better understanding of where the problems lie.  The issue that comes up when I speak to local communities who have found a horse in poor condition or dead is that they are passed from pillar to post.  They are moved between the local authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and back to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and sometimes they go around in circles.  I gather from what the witnesses are saying is that there is co-ordination between the different statutory agencies.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

The garda&iacute; have then told them to get in touch with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Meanwhile the animal is dying and that person is in a frenzy.  When they contact us, we try to find out what is happening.  We ask if they have video footage or photographs and ask them were they are located.  We have volunteers all over the country and we try to send them to the location, if it is something bad, or we see if there are garda&iacute; available.  Garda&iacute; are our key because we do not have authorised officers.  We are not authorised officers ourselves.  We use garda&iacute; as our authorised officers.  We should have authorised officers ourselves at this point given that we are the largest horse rescue body in Ireland but we do not.</p></speech>

A lot of the problems we are talking about, including the funding problem, stem from the fact that different bodies can pass the problem on to somebody else and not take responsibility.  Is it the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the local authorities?</p></speech>

I happened to be in the D&aacute;il yesterday when Deputies Mark Ward and Gino Kenny raised a Topical Issue matter on the Clondalkin Equine Club, which I have an interest in because I got an opportunity to visit it some time ago.  It is an example of best practice, where the local authority, the Department and the local community came together with horse owners in an urban environment in which there was previously a tradition of horse neglect.  They turned that into a very positive story, yet if they do not get &euro;60,000 very quickly, they may have to close that operation.  Some &euro;60,000 in the context of the budgets we deal with in this place is a pittance.  It is not to ordinary families but it is in respect of the overall figure.  The Department is saying it sorted some money out for capital works and it is now up to the local authority, while the local authority is saying it does not have that money.  These guys are being directed to the lottery or things like that.  Is there a vote in the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

Last August, I wrote to this committee requesting that as part of these hearings, we invite people from My Lovely Horse Rescue to appear before the committee because I have had dealings with the group locally in Cork.  I see the unbelievable work being done, to be fair, and it is very good the committee invited the group to appear before it because these are very important issues that need to be discussed and highlighted.  I thank the organisation for the work it has done in Cork.  It was instrumental and successful in getting the pound, which had left Cork city to move to Longford, back to Cork.  I have been regularly contacted by people who are very upset by the conditions in which they have seen horses being kept.  The neglect and abuse are horrific.  I sometimes get photographs and, to be honest, they are so horrific they cannot be believed.</p> <p>  We are against the clock.  There is one garda in Cork, who works on this matter.  She is brilliant but she is the only garda I have met, or the only person working in the local authority or Department, who actually understands the law and the way it should be implemented.  When I contact this garda she is on top of it, but if she is not on duty there is no one else to go to and I have to ring around as a result.  We have the Control of Horses Act.  The Garda are dealing with the owners, which was discussed earlier.  I mean no disrespect, but it should not be up to My Lovely Horse Rescue to train hundreds of garda&iacute; who come out of Templemore every year in what they should be taught.  Templemore is a training college for garda&iacute;.  It should be doing its job.  I have raised this matter locally at joint policing committee meetings with Cork City Council, the superintendent and the chief superintendent in Cork.</p> <p>  The representatives made a point about enforcement and responsibility.  That is key.  We have to make people accountable.  They said the Act is good.  Much of the time legislation is bad, but what we have is good legislation that is not being implemented or enforced.  One of the proposals I am making is that the committee write to the Minister for Justice-----</p></speech>

There are no codes at present.  The Garda has not yet been given the codes in order that, when cases go to court, the number of people being brought to court and the number of prosecutions can be recorded.  We need the data if we are to ensure enforcement.  I ask that that happens.  I apologise that I have to leave because we are voting in the Chamber.  I thank the representatives for the unbelievable work they and all their volunteers throughout the island are doing.  There are some really great people out there.  It just shows the care that people have for animals, especially horses.</p></speech>

Their organisation is wonderful.  I am a major advocate for animal welfare and I have been involved in equestrian sport for many years, but that is a separate matter.  I acknowledge their enormous work.  The one great thing about Irish people is that, on the whole, the majority of them - I know there are many cases where they do not - love animals, especially horses and dogs.  I have been involved in other animal welfare charities and I know the challenges faced by charities when they have professional full-time staff versus volunteers.  There is always a little conflict, particularly around governance issues and all of that, which are an ongoing challenge.  Much of that has been tidied up.  Quite a few animal welfare charities have been involved in issues around governance, although not the organisation represented today.  These issues do not arise deliberately but happen because of the possible synergy or merger between the voluntary sector and professional full-time staff in a very keen body.  I always acknowledge that but everyone is well-meaning and the My Lovely Horse Rescue charity is an exceptionally good one.</p> <p>  I will only share one or two issues because otherwise I will be repeating myself.  As I said, My Lovely Horse Rescue is a very good organisation.  I have looked it up and followed up some of its work.  I would like to hear briefly about three issues relating to enforcement.  If they have covered it, I ask our guests not to go back over it.  I was speaking in the Seanad and I apologise for just arriving.  There was an issue with a certain amount of reluctance on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who said they did not have the expertise when they were challenged with issues around this.  There were also conflicts with people involved in cruelty or abandonment of animals who were part of a bigger Garda operation to do with other issues of criminality where there were layers of issues and, suddenly, the Garda turned a blind eye.  Such issues were considered as being way down the pecking order and not being as important for some.  I do not agree with that strategy.</p> <p>  I did some work two or three years ago that I am happy to share with the witnesses.  I surveyed every one of the 31 local authorities and ascertained what funding they were receiving from any Government agency.  I was quite shocked by the high level of it but was more shocked by the fact it was not all drawn down.  In some cases, there was a suggestion at the end of the year that it could be used for other purposes.  Will the witnesses share with us their relationship with the local authorities?  They are very important outfits in respect of policing and control, and they have certain responsibilities, but I was somewhat shocked by the amount of money going directly to local authorities that they were meant to redistribute to welfare charities.  Is there a need for reform of that?  What is the representatives' experience of that?  I do not know if they receive any subvention from local authorities or centrally from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The issue I would like to hear about is the relationship of My Lovely Horse Rescue with the local authorities.  How do the witnesses find it?  Could it be improved?  Is there potential for more funding?  Where is their strand of funding from the local authorities and what is their relationship with those bodies?  That is the gist of it.</p> <p>  Again, My Lovely Horse Rescue is a brilliant organisation that does brilliant work.  It is highly thought of and people instantly know it.  A colleague in my office today asked if she could attend when she heard representatives of My Lovely Horse Rescue were coming in.  I said I would send her all the material but she was excited and delighted, as was her daughter, who is involved in some sort of horse welfare initiative in Clonsilla.  I will link the witnesses in with that too.  I thank them for their time and for appearing before the committee.  Well done on their work.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council has been very good to us and, amazingly, bought us our first horse van as it recognised that we needed van to help them as well.  We will invoice Kilkenny County Council for certain things that we have done for it but we do not get an awful lot of money from anybody.  All of our money basically comes through the public and some companies.  We are very much a fundraising-type of organisation, which is awful because we must spend so much time thinking how we can pay a bill rather than give consideration to the issues that we really need to think about.  That is a full-time thing for us.  Even though many of us have jobs, families and whatever, we give our all to the organisation.  No matter what, we never panic that we will not make things work or worry about closing down.  I am one of the co-founders, and Ms Deborah Kenny is another, but we have always said that we will never blackmail the public.  I mean that I have seen other rescue organisations say that they are at risk of closing their doors because they have not got enough money.  We do not do that and have always found a way.  It would be great if we did not have to worry about the financial problems that we encounter on a daily basis.  We are here for the animals and we want change.</p></speech>

That is difficult question to answer.  One cannot really do so unless a person is underage.  A person must be aged 16 to own a horse.  There is nothing to say someone cannot own a horse regardless of whether he or she lives in a city centre or a rural area.  Technically, there are rules but anyone can buy a horse and keep it once the horse has been chipped and has a passport.  The owner will say that he or she will keep the horse in a stable but the grass may be in County Carlow or somewhere else.  Technically, there is no way to stop a person owning a horse.  It is not about stopping people from owning a horse; it is about educating them to look after a horse properly and have the proper facilities to take care of a horse.  It is not about stopping an individual from having a horse unless he or she is particularly cruel and, therefore, should not own one.  It is more about making sure that everyone is educated and has the facilities to take care of their horses properly.  That is what we strive for.</p></speech>

The Clondalkin Equine Club cost more than &euro;500,000 and there is no need for anything like that.  First, we do not believe in a horse organisation in an urban area having a load of stables because there is no need for them and things can be done much cheaper.  What a horse needs is a bit of land, grass, to be cared for and to have shelter.  We have come across an awful lot of associations that say they will need 30 stables but there is no need for them.  The problem now is that the Clondalkin Equine Club is trying to maintain such an expensive building, which is sad, and it only has room for 20 horses.  Members of my organisation are in Clondalkin quite a lot so we know that there are dying horses in fields and some of their owners are children.  Another problem is that there is no traceability in respect of children because they get horses for free.  It is now almost summer and many foals have been born and many kids will get them for free, which is something that happens all over Ireland.</p></speech>

They should but only in a controlled manner.  The Clondalkin Equine Club has control of the situation in Clondalkin but, as Ms Kenny said, it only has room for 20 stables.  In Clondalkin, a lot more than 20 kids want to be involved in the care of horses.</p></speech>

We all know that there is a housing situation and, therefore, all land is taken up.  How do we deal with the situation?  The children end up tying up their horses in parks or in a stable in their back gardens.  There is an amount of stables in back gardens all over Dublin city.</p></speech>

At the outset it is important that I clearly set out the responsibilities concerning hemp.</p> <p>  Cannabis and industrial hemp both derive from the species cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.  Hemp has lower concentrations of THC which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects.  Cannabis, which includes hemp, is listed in Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, as amended, which means it is subject to the strictest level of control.  Legislation on cannabis, which includes hemp, is not a matter for this Department and it would not be appropriate for us to discuss any issues on the legal aspects that govern hemp.  It should be noted that it is an offence to cultivate, import, export, produce, supply and possess cannabis, including hemp, except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Health.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regularly receives correspondence from interested parties on various aspects of the subject, including the legislative position and the potential commercial development of the industry.  On foot of this interest, the current programme for Government includes a commitment to fully explore fibre crops such as hemp and consider whether these crops have a viable market.  It is from that perspective that the Department is interested in examining the viability of growing hemp for fibre.</p> <p>  In August 2021, the Department wrote to several stakeholders inviting them to submit their considered views.  In the letter of invitation the stakeholders were asked to include in their submission responses to the following questions: what markets exist for fibre from crops including hemp; the strengths and weaknesses of fibre crops so the classical strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats or SWOT analysis; and what is the scalability of the Irish fibre crop and hemp industry but taking into account market size and value, industry processing capacity and adequate economic returns for all along the supply chain.</p> <p>  The consultation process is ongoing and a report is near completion.  When the report is finalised it will be presented to the Minister for his consideration.  It would not be appropriate for me or my colleagues to discuss any aspect of the consultation process until such time he has considered the report and made a determination on the programme for Government commitment to fully explore the potential for growing fibre crops such as hemp and whether there is a viable market for these crops.</p> <p>  Hemp has a number of uses.  Hemp can be used in construction, marine construction, car manufacturing, paper, food, animal bedding, clothing, drinks and in the health, pharmaceutical, biofuel and cosmetics industries.  Hemp oil, which is derived from seeds, is used in health supplements, personal care, cooking and also in industrial usage such as linseed oil in paints.</p> <p>  In terms of the hemp industry in Ireland, while the area sown between 2016 and 2019 increased considerably, 2020 saw a more than 50% decrease in the area sown when compared with 2019.  My Department's basic payment scheme data, from which we derive our information, indicates that there was a further slight decline in area in 2021.</p><p>Hemp is included as an eligible crop under the basic payment scheme.  For comparative purposes, the areas sown to hemp and Ireland&rsquo;s main crop, spring barley, are included in the table in the Department submission.  From 2015 to 2019, the area grew from a very low 17 ha to 314 ha.  It subsequently dropped to 164 ha in 2020 and last year decreased slightly to 153 ha.  In that same period, if it is compared with spring barley, we had 132,000 ha in 2015.  That decreased to 94,636 ha in 2019, predominantly due to a swing towards higher yielding winter crops.  It increased significantly in 2020 to 140,000 ha and 116,000 ha last year.  Apart from some interest at national level, there is also increasing interest at international level, with the European Commission recently hosting a public meeting on the production of hemp and market opportunities.  While the meeting was to be focused on fibre crops, much of the discussion centred around food.  While many positives were put forward on the future potential of the sector, many similar problems exist in other European countries as are present in Ireland, including, for instance, access to processing facilities.  Currently, Ireland does not have fibre processing facilities.  These are required to be in close proximity to hemp growers.  Any development in relation to a processing facility must be industry led.</p><p> On the area sown internationally, in 2016 more than 100,000 ha was sown globally, with China, Canada, the USA and Europe being the top four.  The global area sown in 2019 mirrored Ireland.  It almost grew threefold to 275,000 ha, with China, Canada, the USA, Europe and Russia being the main growers.  Of note is a drop in area sown in the USA from 2019, where it was almost 60,000 ha, to 2020, where it was 20,000 ha.  These areas are also small in an international context and show hemp is currently very much a niche crop.</p><p> On the legislative position, I mentioned earlier hemp was governed under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017.  Current legislation in Ireland does not allow for the growing of hemp unless a specific license has been granted by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Health.  That licence contains strict conditions, including, for example, the location where the hemp crop can be grown.  It cannot be grown in a roadside field.  It must be a number of fields in from the road.  In addition, the cultivation of hemp is restricted to varieties having less than 0.2% content of THC.  It should be noted this limit will be increased from 0.2% to 0.3% for eligible crops under the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We have conveyed that information to the Department of Health.</p><p> By way of additional information, in 2018 this Department carried out a broad consultation with relevant stakeholders as part of an examination of growing hemp commercially in Ireland.  This consultation was conducted following a request from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Petitions.  The consultation included the Departments of Health and Justice, the HPRA, Teagasc and the two representative bodies for hemp in existence at that time.  A clear view arising from respondents involved in regulation during that consultation was that the domestic hemp industry should continue to be controlled and regulated by the Department of Health and that the stringent controls in place on growing hemp should continue.  This strict regulation is in line with the situation in many other countries.  Detailed analysis of the economics of hemp and its ability to provide a meaningful income all along the supply chain was lacking in that consultation.  The detail on how scalable an Irish hemp industry would be was also lacking in the responses received at that time.</p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to come before it to discuss the development of the hemp sector in Ireland, and I or my colleague will answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Farm diversification is a key strategic direction within the Teagasc statement of strategy for 2021 to 2024.  Our rural development department, which is part of our rural economy development programme, aims to support farmers with diversification opportunities through farm business options webinars and in-person courses held throughout the Teagasc regions.  Teagasc has developed numerous fact sheets on farm diversification, including one on industrial hemp.  We work with industry to develop these opportunities and have been part of the organisation of a national hemp conference in 2019 and have been again in association with Hemp Cooperative Ireland on 8 April.</p> <p>  Teagasc, and An Foras Tal&uacute;ntais before it, has a history of hemp fibre research in the crops programme dating back to 1960.  Over that time there have been three different areas of research of hemp.  The first was conducted by Michael Neenan, who was interested in using the hemp fibre for paper and textile production between 1960 and 1966.  The second era of research was carried out by a researcher called Jim Crowley between 1997 and 1999.  He was interested in hemp as medium density fibreboard, MDF, material.  More recently, between 2008 and 2012, Dr. John Finnan was interested in research on hemp as an energy crop.  All of this research was geared towards the agronomy of hemp, though there were different uses of hemp in mind.  This work has shown that hemp can be grown well in Ireland and has established the basics of crop production in terms of sowing dates, seed rates, varieties, harvesting techniques etc.  It has also shown that the crop can be grown with little or no requirement for plant protection products, although if grown more widely, pests and disease could become a problem.  It has also established the crop nutrient input requirements that are now included in the Teagasc green book, entitled Major &amp;amp; Micro Nutrient Advice For Productive Agricultural Crops, with the relevant table shown in the appendix.  It should be noted that in the three cases above, no significant cultivation of hemp resulted, due primarily to the lack of a local or domestic market for the fibre.</p> <p>  Hemp fibre is a low-density material and therefore not well suited to long-distance transport to processing facilities.  To deliver a significant increase in hemp production for fibre markets will require investment in processing facilities to extract the fibre as well as the development of local markets to turn the fibre into products.  In addition to fibre, hemp may offer opportunities to develop novel products, in particular from the flowers, leaves and seeds, which would not present such a transport challenge as the fibre.  Cannabidiol, CBD, oil is extracted from the leaves and flowers of the crops, the harvesting of which is currently not allowed under hemp cultivation licences.  Therefore the development of a significant CBD industry will require some legislative changes.  These alternative markets are an area of ongoing research, and our food programme recently received funding from the Department to carry out a project called Innovative food friendly processes of hemp CBD extraction and evaluation of hemp as a source of functional food ingredients.  The project is led by Teagasc and involves researchers from UCD.  The total funding allocated is &euro;591,000.</p> <p>  Additionally, we plan to investigate the functionality of hemp protein to identify if there are specific market niches to which it is suited.  We plan to do this as part of the Department funded Unlocking Protein Resource Opportunities To Evolve Ireland&rsquo;s Nutrition, U-Protein, project.  It is a large programme we have going on around plants as sources of protein.  As part of that project we will look at the functionality of hemp protein.  That is a multidisciplinary collaboration between Teagasc, University College Cork, Maynooth University, NUI Galway, the University of Limerick and Queen's University Belfast, as well as ten industry partners, that commenced in November 2020 and received funding of almost &euro;3 million.  Obviously, that is not all for hemp-related work.  There will be some additional work in an EU-funded project lead by Teagasc that is currently in contract negotiation.  We will be actively disseminating the research findings from these projects when they are available.</p> <p>  As with any crop or product, markets, together with the necessary infrastructure, are critical to encourage farmers and give them the confidence to grow the crop.  However, as outlined above, the crop grows well in Ireland, and given the right financial returns, growers would be interested in growing the crop.  There are many claims made for the carbon sequestration potential of the crop.  We have done some very limited work in this area which indicates it sequesters slightly less carbon than grassland, but these results require further validation.</p><p>The net carbon sequestration will also be dependent on the system in which the hemp is being grown, that is, grassland or tillage land, and the soil type on which it is being grown, namely, organic or mineral.  It should also be noted that as far as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, methodologies on which our national greenhouse gas inventories are based are concerned, the carbon contained in most crop products is assumed to be released back to the atmosphere once harvested.  That stands in contrast to harvested wood products, for example.  If such products are used in construction, the carbon is assumed to be sequestered.  That is a difference between hemp and forestry or harvested wood products.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present evidence to it this evening.  We welcome any questions members may have.  My colleagues, Mr. Caslin and Mr. Spink, who are more knowledgeable on this topic than I am, will come into their own at that stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#K00200"><p>I thank the representatives from Teagasc and the Department for coming in.  We have already had debate on this issue at the committee, particularly with hemp growers and advocates on its potential.  I have grown hemp here and in Greece, so I know a little bit about the matter.  It is very easy to grow.  Once the seed makes contact with soil and it is firmed in, it grows.  I do not particularly want to connect it with the word "weed", but that is what it is and it grows well.  We have to be responsible about advocating for it and how it is grown and managed.</p> <p>  I will deal with my questions for the Department first.  I got a sense from the Department that there was a certain reluctance in respect of this crop.  I do not know why that is the case but it is the sense I got from reading departmental circulars and the opening statement provided by Mr. Moloney.  He referred to the programme for Government, which states that this will be explored.  Mr. Moloney did not say that, but I am familiar with the programme for Government and it does mention of this.  Mr. Moloney stated that he is not in a position to share this and that with us.  I respect and understand that, but we, as a committee, have to take an overall view based on the information available to us at this time.  I am not sure whether people are convinced about hemp but there seem to be a lot of people who are excited about it.  When one drills down into it, however, there are difficulties.  We know it is easy to grow but there are issues in terms of processing it.  Close proximity to a processing plant is a requirement.  We know it has to be set in away from roads.  Mr. Moloney outlined that in detail.  He presented figures in respect of hemp and spring barley for the period from 2015 to 2021 and told us that it peaked in 2019 terms of hectares sown.  I will ask a few questions and our guests might answer them all at the one time if that works for them.  Is there any reason for the peak in 2019?  Does the Department have qualitative research and information that tells us it peaked and then slowly went down?</p> <p>  There is great excitement in respect of hemp.  It may be the case that there is not enough information but there is a view that it has potential in terms of fibre material, printing, horticultural and other matting, horticultural mulch and quality seed.  What knowledge does the Department have in respect of security and quality of seed?  There are many hemp seed variants.  What is Mr. Moloney's knowledge of the current supplies of hemp?  Where is hemp seed being sourced?  Is hemp seed being harvested here?  Where is it being harvested?  I ask Mr. Moloney to share details in that regard.</p> <p>  I thank our guests from Teagasc for appearing.  Teagasc prepares a number of fact sheets.  It did a very extensive one in respect of hemp.  I was very excited by it.  I do not know if or when it will revise that factsheet but it gave great hope and excitement in this regard.  In his opening remarks, Dr. O'Mara referred to diversification.  Farmers are always looking to diversify and consider new crops but those crops have to be profitable and sustainable and have a future and, ultimately, a market.  It is about getting that critical mass and buy-in.  I do not know where that can happen and what the opportunities are in that regard.  Ultimately, Teagasc is involved in research and development.  That is one of its key roles.  Dr. O'Mara referred to An Foras Tal&uacute;ntais and the earlier research that was done.  I ask him to circulate to the committee Teagasc's most up-to-date factsheet on hemp because I think it covers a lot of the area we have been discussing.</p> <p>  The U-Protein research project being undertaken by Teagasc in conjunction with UCD and other places is exciting in terms of the funding being committed by Teagasc and the potential for synergy.  There is significant growth in new protein in the sports sector.  Even aside from human consumption, there are significant opportunities in the context of animal feeds.  We know from the United States and Canada the opportunities that exist in that context.  It is clear that Teagasc does not have to reinvent the wheel.  A significant amount of research has already been done on this.  Much of the industry is already getting into the area of sports nutrition, as well as human dietary and nutritional requirements.  The most promising reports about which I have read relate to animal nutrition.  I know that work is ongoing with universities in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Belfast.  When will that information come?  Where is Teagasc at in that regard?  What is the timeline involved?  More important, what is the financial commitment in terms of innovation, research and resources that Teagasc has invested in this market?  How is that reflected in its ambition for the product?  It would be very helpful if our guests from Teagasc were to share that information.</p></speech>

There was an extraordinary increase from 67 ha in 2018 to 314 ha in 2019.  We do not normally see that margin of swing.  We have no definitive answers on this, but our opinion is that, as the Senator stated, there was great interest in crop diversification.  The level of beef prices may have been a factor.  There was a 3% increase in tillage area last year and we think much of that came from mixed tillage and beef enterprise.  Farmers were looking at margins and backing tillage as having a better margin than beef.  Farmers were seeking to diversify.  The level dropped off the following year, probably because of the returns.  The market was not returning enough on investment.  I have referred to spring barley because it is the staple main crop and any potential new crop has to be compared with it because it is the area that will probably be lost to gain hemp or any other crop.  That is the basis for giving that comparison.</p> <p>  As regards seed, the seed can be harvested but, unlike in the case of cereals, it cannot be used for propagation - it has to be used for processing.  I have responsibility for seed certification schemes.  Farmers can use home-saved seed, whether it be potatoes, cereals or whatever, for the following year's crop.  That is not possible in the case of hemp.  We have had several engagements with the representative organisations and I know one aspect they would like changed relates to the THC content of the seed.  That might allow them to use a greater range of varieties.  That may happen next year with the change in the basic payment rules, going from 0.2 to 0.3 THC.  All the seed is imported.  We do not cultivate the seed here.  The seed is imported to OECD standards.  I have not had direct contact from the representative bodies in respect of the quality of the seed.  They have not raised any issues with me in that regard.</p></speech>

We will certainly make that fact sheet available to the committee tomorrow.  As he probably saw in our written statement, most of our past research was in respect of hemp and its potential use as a fibre source for paper, energy or whatever.  Our main interest related to how one would grow the crop and the parameters in that regard.  The more recent relevant research we have relates to the food or feed characteristics of the crop.  I ask Mr. Spink to expand on the details of that.  Before he does so, I will point out what we are trying to do in this area.</p><p>We are trying to create facilities, the infrastructure and a support system for entrepreneurs and innovators who could use any food or crop.  We have good facilities in our research centre in Ashtown, dealing with the extraction and processing of foods.  We have invested approximately &euro;10 million over the past three to four years in what we call prepared consumer foods facilities.  We have good facilities that could be used by people at a testing or small manufacturing scale for processing grains, seeds or whatever it might be, purifying them or extracting components from them, and for packaging them.  There has been very little work with hemp at the facility but the resource is available.  We have good expertise relating to the characterisation of seeds, feed or whatever it might be, so that we can identify their properties.  That expertise is being brought to bear on some projects.  I mentioned U-Protein.  Mr. Spink knows more about than me.  He might outline investment in that research.</p></speech>

We have another large EU-funded project that will start soon.  The development of plant proteins has been a significant focus for us for more than a year and is ramping up.  We are interested in how we can effectively extract plant proteins.  It also uses some of the facilities in Moorepark.  The work on protein would have applied primarily to milk until now.  We are trying to identify what we can grow in Ireland.  Can we grow crops with particularly high-value proteins?  How are they extracted?  What are the markets?  This looks at high-value products, including sports nutrition and whatever other markets there might be for proteins that we can effectively grow and extract.</p> <p>  We are also looking at agronomy, which is how the crop is grown, how that affects the amount and quality of the protein, how it is processed, and what it can be used for, so that we can effectively identify raw materials to be used by large food manufacturing companies.  There has been a significant increase in plant-based foods, as I am sure the committee will be aware.  Many of those are based on imported crops.  We are focused on ensuring that the raw materials come from Ireland and the value goes back to the Irish growers rather than being imported.</p> <p>  I have not come equipped with information about the total value.  I was not expecting the question.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time and other members want to contribute.  I think that is exciting.  That is an enormous amount.  Is the committee to take it that the witnesses are ambitious and believe there is potential?  The hemp crop provides high-value protein.  It is a new market and provides diversification.  Are the witnesses reasonably confident that this is exciting, challenging and that there are real opportunities?</p></speech>

I will try to be as brief as possible.  The overwhelming sense I get when dealing with this issue is that there is a lack of enthusiasm and certainly a lack of drive, which is bewildering, considering many commentators suggest that this could be an important crop for diversification, farm incomes and climate action.  Everything that has been done seems minimal.  This is not directed at just the Department or agencies, but applies across the board.</p> <p>  Mr. Moloney mentioned some very low numbers earlier, with 300 ha in 2019.</p><p>He gave a rationale that perhaps this was due to the low price of beef that year, and the fact that there was not a market and that people moved out from it.  He further said that the assumption is based on any future growing of the crop replacing spring barley production.  Which is it?  Who diversifies and where does Mr. Moloney see the potential for hemp growth?  Is it in areas where spring barley is not being grown?  It was my understanding that the type of area that would be most suitable might be the likes of the Border region, the midlands, even into the west, which would not have a high prevalence of tillage farming at the moment, and that it would actually be a diversification from meat or even dairy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#N00200"><p>I am over the crop policy area.  From a tillage perspective, tillage farmers are always looking for diversification.  They look at what can improve their farm incomes and they are keen to look at alternatives.  On that basis, they would look at the crop to see if it is feasible for tillage farmers to grow it.  They have the techniques of growing crops, they have the equipment, and they are ready made to engage.  They will, however, compare the returns from hemp with spring barley, which is the crop they would most replace.</p> <p>  With regard to livestock farmers, it is not for any one sector as it can be grown by beef farmers and, as we heard Senator Boyhan say, it is a relatively easy crop to grow.  There is a low level of inputs.  Mr. Caslin might have more detail on that but it is a relatively easy crop to grow.  It does not take the expertise that would be needed if, for example, somebody who was a beef farmer wanted to grow malting barley in the morning.  It can be grown in marginal areas and I am aware that is grown in places in County Kerry and the west of Ireland.  There is tillage in Kerry as well, however, around the Listowel area.  We have not said that any one particular sector is more suited and my comparison with spring barley was predominantly just to show that if it is a tillage farmer, this is what he or she will be comparing it to.  At the end of the day, they are going to look at the margin of this crop versus what they are currently doing, be it finishing cattle or raising store cattle or whether they are growing barley or any other crop.</p></speech>

There have been claims made by the representative organisations with regard to carbon sequestration.  It is the buzz thing in relation to the climate debate but we have not seen hard facts or evidence to show that.  Dr. O'Mara showed the limited research and how it is comparable to grassland.  It is a low input crop as well, with low levels of pesticides and little or no fertiliser as such.  It is environmentally friendly in that regard.  Yes, it does tick that environmental box but by how much?  Is it comparable to grassland or will it sequester more carbon?  We have not seen the evidence to back up that claim in relation to carbon sequestration.</p></speech>

In respect of farm incomes, there are two parts to the hemp crop.  The Government has committed to an exploration of the fibre element of it.  We heard very strong evidence with the representative organisations that this is a fundamental mistake because asking anybody to grow a crop and to discard, potentially, half or more of the value of the crop would not be entertained.  Dr. O'Mara spoke about looking at the by-products.  Does the Department see scope to examine the entire crop in the context of looking at this from a farm income perspective?</p></speech>

There are regulatory issues around the other elements that are income streams, which are not in the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  Again, it would be for the Department of Health to consider issues in relation to the other income streams.  Some of those are constrained by way of regulatory issues.  At the moment, there is fibre and seed.  That is the licence provided for by the HPRA.  In this programme for Government, we are strictly limited to looking at the fibre element.</p></speech>

The issue has gone as far as the European Court of Justice, which made a ruling that suggests we are wrong in this regard.  The Department of Health may be appealing that.  Does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine not have an opinion on that?  Does it simply let the Department of Health deal with this and say that whatever happens happens, even though there is an acknowledgement that this could be an important income stream for farmers and could play a positive role in agricultural emissions?</p></speech>

We gave our view on whether products should be allowed at a certain THC content, which at the time I believe was 0.3%.  We gave our opinion at that stage.  Where we are consulted we certainly will give an opinion and we will work with our Government colleagues on the development of the sector.

If we took the same view on wind energy, for example, we would not have any in the State.  Going back to the premise that this could potentially be very beneficial to the environment and could be very beneficial to farmers and to local economies, does the Department not see any role at all for the State to intervene in order to kick-start and assist the development of a processing element of the industry?</p></speech>

It has been mentioned, and I believe he has accepted, that the research done by Teagasc in this area has been limited.  The obvious question is whether Teagasc plans to expand that level of research, and what will that look like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#N02200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  While the research has been limited, in the area of growing the crop I believe it is reasonably comprehensive.  We know how to grow the crop.  Of course one can always keep looking at new varieties or new plant protection products but I do not believe there is a huge gap in knowledge there around growing the crop</p> <p>  On the uses of the crop, the area we have not researched in the past was the use of the crop in the food industry.</p><p>The research we have under way at the moment is in that space.  Perhaps Mr. Spink will wish to comment further on that.  I will go back to the environmental question the Deputy asked.  There is a bit of uncertainty around the level of carbon sequestration.  Some research we have done suggests that is about the same as for grassland but that is really only half the answer to the question the Deputy asked.  If we are to compare it with a livestock enterprise such as a beef or dairy farm, it must be remembered there is a lot of emissions from ruminant animals.  A hectare of a beef enterprise's land will result in about 4 tonnes in emissions while a hectare of a dairy enterprise's land will result in 8 tonnes.  A hectare of a tillage enterprise land will be responsible for very little emissions in comparison with animal enterprises.</p></speech>

That is probably the main thing but it would be much lower, perhaps 1 tonne or so.  There are far fewer emissions.  The sequestration side of the balance sheet is probably about the same as it would be for grassland but there is a bit of uncertainty around that.</p></speech>

It is probably similar for hemp but there are high levels of uncertainty around that.</p></speech>

That is a third factor to take into account.  If it goes into building material, it is probably going to be there for 20, 30 or maybe 40 years.  If it was a wood product being used for construction timber, it would then be counted as being sequestered or locked up for up to 100 years.  The same does not happen with hemp or many other such crops, even if they are to be locked up.  They are not treated like for like.  It is not getting the same advantage when the fibre is used for long-term construction uses like that.  In some ways, it is an anomaly but production of the crop is very small so the impact it would have on our national inventory is very small in the short term.</p></speech>

It is really about finding the use for it first.  The carbon sequestration benefit of using it for construction material is very much a spin-off or co-benefit.  The big challenge is getting it used in construction.  That is the thing.  We need to get the horse first.  The cart will follow.

I do not even know what a hemp plant looks like.  We had the representative bodies in and it seems to me that the kernel of the debate and the issues we will have if this is to have any kind of feasible future is the fact that the plant is covered by the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017.  I hope the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong because, as I have said, I do not even know the make-up of the plant but it has high levels of protein and the seed oil has many uses.  It strikes me that looking at this from the perspective of the fibre alone is like doing a consultation or feasibility study on growing barley for straw.  Am I right in saying that?  The value of the barley is in the head and, from what I have heard, the situation is likewise for hemp.  If it is to be a feasible crop, the farmer will not be growing it for the fibre but for the head.</p></speech>

With regard to barley for straw, there is a scheme where it is chopped for &euro;100 an acre.  That is the value of the straw but the grain is worth more than &euro;300 a tonne at the moment.  The difference here is that people are given a licence to grow the crop for the straw, in the main, and for the seeds, which are to be used for industrial uses.  The other parts of the plant are not provided for under that licence.  Farmers are prohibited from harvesting those elements under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</p></speech>

I will again use that analogy and say that I cannot see any farmer buying in to grow barley for straw or to grow hemp for fibre.  If it is to be a feasible and viable crop that yields a return, he or she is going to have to be able to sell, process and utilise the entire crop to maximise his or her income.

However, if we grow that seed and produce hemp-derived products, such as hemp oil or a CBD product, that contain any trace of THC, they will be illegal.  The move at EU level will increase this allowed level from 0.2% to 0.3%.  The exciting thing is that more varieties will be available to us to research and to grow.  These may be high in CBD and low in THC.  That is an exciting opportunity which we will have fairly soon, under the next CAP.</p></speech>

The point I am trying to get is that, as long is this falls under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, the agricultural potential is limited.</p></speech>

There is an issue there with regard to investors and insurance in this industry and in getting people involved.  It creates a level of fear among potential investors that if there are trace amounts of THC in hemp-derived products, it will be illegal to sell them on the market.</p><p>We also have the situation whereby, if flower heads are being transported along the road, those farmers are transporting cannabinoids, which is illegal.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could potentially stop those farmers from transporting a trailer-load of flower heads if there were any trace amount of it at all.  That creates a bit of angst among growers and processors.</p></speech>

Is there an appetite within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to try to right that wrong?  I would call it a wrong.  There is no point doing feasibility studies and consultation processes as we know the outcome at this stage.  Is there an appetite within the Department to overcome this major problem and at least talk to the Department of Health?</p></speech>

Where the difference lies is in the THC content.  As Mr. Caslin outlined, some countries have a low threshold of 0.2%, 0.3% or 1%.  Currently, as I understand it, the threshold here is zero.  We will certainly help and give our feedback but the ball is not in our court.  We do not own the ball.  We are not responsible for the licensing of that product.  It is primarily a matter for the Department of Health to consider the restrictions and whether they are justified.  We had a consultation process on the regulations in 2018 and it was felt at that time that the current regulations should continue under the auspices of the Department of Health.  If there is a viable alternative crop, we are certainly there to offer help and support.  We are following the programme for Government, which referred to fibre crops.  Hemp is only one of those.  Flax and linseed are alternatives and that is what we have concentrated on to fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government.  It is not within our remit to change those regulations, but if the crop is viable and we can help, we will consult our Government colleagues.  It is not in our hands.</p></speech>

Its representatives have talked about the sequestration value.  One of the hemp organisations that came before the committee told us that, if it is used as a rotation crop, there is a big increase in the yield of the following year's crop and less nutrient input is needed.  Has Teagasc done any research into whether that would be the case?</p></speech>

We did not specifically include it in a rotational experiment but introducing any non-cereal crop into a cereal rotation will result in an improvement in the following year's crop, usually just over a tonne a hectare.  That is the result of a break in cereal diseases in the rotation.  We would not expect crops such as hemp, beans or oilseed rape to be particularly different from each other.  Invariably, using such crops will reduce fertiliser requirements and increase yield following a non-cereal crop.  It would have a value in a cereal rotation in the same way as other non-cereal crops.</p></speech>

Ideally, it would be sown from early to mid April after the last frost, because that can set the crop back as it is growing, and harvested in September or around the time of the National Ploughing Championships.

It also outcompeted any weeds.  One of the advantages of the crop is that it gets ahead of any weed seeds.  We need rotation crops within tillage systems, so it is ideal as a rotation crop.  The taproot of the hemp helps improve the soil structure and improves aeration within the soil, so it has many benefits that way.</p></speech>

It may just be me but I think the Department is a little dismissive of the development of the hemp industry.  It has called it a niche crop and it seems to me there is no real intention of moving away from that position.  It also said there was little evidence in the consultation showing how it could provide a meaningful income all along the supply chain.  That seems short on ambition to me because at the same time the Department has funded Teagasc to do research on it.  Is the Department giving adequate attention to the big potential for the growing of hemp in this country?</p></speech>

The Department seems very dismissive.  Everybody else seems to think there could be huge potential in the growing of hemp but the Department described it as niche.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#P02300"><p>At 150 ha, it is very niche.  It is not widely grown.  The maximum area grown was around 300 ha.  I would not agree we are dismissive.  There are difficulties with this crop that do not occur with any other crop.  If I wanted to grow a crop of oilseed rape tomorrow morning - it is a bit late for that now - or if I wanted to grow a crop of maize tomorrow morning, I could get seed and a contractor or, if I had my own gear, put it in the ground and harvest it.  Hemp is a completely different crop and it is not treated the same way.  Farmers have to apply for a licence, which is only a one-year licence and only allows them to grow the crop for certain purposes.  The representative organisations would contend that the most valuable parts of the crop are prohibited.  I have said from the outset, and I have to continue to repeat myself, that is not within the remit of this Department to tell farmers they can now grow it for whatever reason they want or that they do not need a licence.</p><p>We can give our opinions, if asked, about that and we will.  Mr. Mac Aodh&aacute;in may have engaged with them more than I have, but I have met representative bodies and given them whatever support they need.</p><p> The crop is eligible under the basic payment scheme, so people are able to draw payment on that.  With the tillage incentive scheme we announced earlier in the year, land that had hemp grown on it last year is eligible if an eligible crop is put on it this year.  It would be eligible for that &euro;400 payment in that case.  Dr. O'Mara has outlined the funding the Department has put in, and in total that is certainly a significant amount of money that is being put into research for the crop.</p><p> Again, when we have asked about scalability and feasibility, it ultimately gets down to getting growers to plant the crop.  It comes down to brass tacks and whether somebody will make a comparable or better income from this than what he or she may be doing.  Those figures must be substantiated.  To be fair to the representative bodies, they are enthusiastic about this and said there would be demand for 10,000 ha or this, that and the other.  A business proposal must be developed.</p></speech>

It is leaving it with the Department of Health and plodding along with what has happened over the past couple of years.  Unless there is a drive from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine itself to change this, there would be no confidence that a farmer would decide to double or treble his crop.  Until there is a change on the departmental end, we will be having the same conversations over and over.  It will not be classed as anything other than a niche crop grown on a small scale.  The potential is there to expand the industry big time if the Department gives confidence to others.</p></speech>

There is talk about potential but we have not yet seen that backed up with financial information indicating the great potential for the crop to be grown on a wider scale.  We are not the drivers of the change; we are not in control of the licensing or the regulations.  The product is being dealt with and the result of the previous consultation in 2019 was a view that it should continue to be controlled by the Department of Health and dealt with by the HPRA in the licensing aspect.  I cannot see how we can change that from within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is not within our gift to make those changes.</p></speech>

There are similar strict regulations governing hemp and not just in Ireland.  They are across other countries.  The uniformity probably relates to CAP regulations, where there has been acknowledgement of and increased THC content in the seed to give a greater diversity of varieties that can be grown.  That is only for the basic payment regulation, as such.</p></speech>

In 2018, as another example of the same crop, there were 124,000 ha sowed, so that dropped to 94,000 ha sowed in the following year.  There would have been a change in crop balance with respect to other crops.  Farmers may have switched to winter crops on the basis of yield, as such, and spreading their workload.</p> <p>  We might start seeing a significant drop in cropping area.  That happened in 2012, when there was a 50,000 ha drop, and last year, when there was a 9,000 resurgence in cropping area.  That has stabilised over the past couple of years.  We analyse why that is happening and in that case it probably came with the abolition of milk quotas and farmers looking at profitability within the farm gate, as I mentioned.  They may have made the decision that dairying was more profitable than tillage, which led to the switch in that case.  In this case I suspect the drop in hemp was down to the market in what to do with that product.</p></speech>

Why has there been a lack of demand for hemp following the three research projects Teagasc mentioned?  Is it purely a lack of need or were there other difficulties, such as legislation or the public perception?</p></speech>

It is needed by farmers and in the right structures.  There is a price for a kilo of beef, for example, or a litre of milk at the dairy co-op.  If a farmer brings grain to the co-op, he or she gets a price per tonne and there are quality parameters in all those industries.  Those structures are not currently there with hemp so farmers growing it now do so in a vacuum.  They do not know what the market or the options will be.  There are limited artisan-type markets around hemp, with some producers producing small amounts of CBD and hemp oil.  The fibre is the key area and there is no use for that fibre.  In a way it is a pity.  If it is grown for botanicals, seed and CBD, all the fibre is being left on the ground.  It is a lot of carbon that is being allowed to biodegrade on the ground.</p> <p>  Ideally, we should have some kind of an industry to give confidence to the growers so they know they have a market outlet for it.  That would be a market for utilising the fibre and locking it up as hempcrete or insulation material in buildings, for example, and maybe building modular homes using the likes of hempcrete.</p><p>We have the lime in the country.  Lime is mixed with the shivs or hurds and water.  We have all the ingredients to produce the material in the country such that we do not necessarily need to use so much concrete in buildings.  What we really need is to give confidence to people so they will move into the houses built with hemp.  We need engineers and architects to be confident about all this as well.  We are agronomists within Teagasc, so I am not too sure about the level of understanding of using hemp and living in a hemp house within those fraternities or industries.  It has been done.  We are not starting from scratch here.  It has been done in other countries.  There are hemp houses around Europe, including Ireland.  The first in Ireland was in County Longford.  Many more have been built since.  A lack of confidence is the key to why the markets have not evolved to the level we would like to see.</p></speech>

It has been claimed that hemp has great potential for retrofitting, construction and installation.  Has Teagasc data to back that up?</p></speech>

It considered the use of hemp for MDF.  It was quite a success, but there are competing sources of fibre.  When we were considering hemp some years ago, we were doing so from an energy perspective.  We were looking into mixing hemp with the likes of miscanthus or wood sawdust to make pellets for energy.  In retrospect, it is a waste of very valuable material just to burn it as a pellet in a biomass boiler.  We have heard a lot about the crop over recent years.  There are so many options, from food and feed to fuel and fibre.  Confidence will be so important.  There are legislative issues.  There is a lack of confidence among potential growers because they do not see the market at present.</p></speech>

It is for the Department.  To go back to the 2018 consultation, it was said there is a lack of evidence to prove a meaningful income could be provided all along the supply chain.  Can Mr. Moloney expand on the evidence sought and the research the Department carried out to ascertain that?  How high did it set the bar?</p></speech>

We did not set a bar; we asked for the evidence to be provided to us to show the scalability.  In other words, we asked the representative bodies to show us what they felt the industry's prospects were and to back up their views.  It is fine to say the crop will make &euro;1,000 per acre or hectare but the statement has to be backed up by sound data.  It was a matter of determining the margin at the processing end and whether the crop is viable.  Everyone will have to make money out of it for it to be viable.  We did not set any bar.  The bar was basically for the representative bodies to give us the information and back it up with the facts and figures.</p></speech>

Are the French governed by the same regulations that apply to us regarding the way in which the crop can be harvested?  Could the representatives from Teagasc state whether there is an economic model coming out of France indicating the return per hectare?  By comparison with the overall tillage area in France, 18,000 ha is still small.</p></speech>

The regulatory arrangements cross over into drugs regulation.  As identified earlier, the bars can be set by member states at different levels; there is no uniformity, but there is uniformity on the varieties that can be grown for the basic payment scheme.  In France, the 18,000 ha have crops with a THC content of 0.2%, but each member state could and does have a different level for THC content for the products.</p></speech>

We have the Single Market.  The crop is governed under the CAP so I cannot understand how it is treated differently in different EU countries.  I am not questioning the decision.  Obviously, the Council of Ministers will make a decision on crops but I find it hard to understand how there cannot be uniformity.

In France, Germany, Lithuania and other countries around Europe, the hemp industry is combined with other industries.  In the Normandy area of France, for example, the hemp industry has been combined with the flax industry.  There is processing capacity there.  Where the industries can be combined, the same type of equipment can be used for decortication.  That is what is making it work in the countries in question.  About four companies in Ireland are importing the fibre from hemp.  There is one in Monaghan and another in Kerry.  The companies are using the product for insulation material.</p></speech>

In France, it is the straw component that is being separated through decortication, and the fibres are being used for insulation and building blocks.  We are importing hemp building blocks from a Belgian company, IsoHemp.  A good critique or study could be done on what we are importing.  The industry specialists who met the members some weeks ago will probably have figures on that.  We more or less come from the agronomic side and do not focus on what the different markets are returning.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are talking about retrofitting many houses to bring them up to a high building energy rating.  That is where I see the opportunities in construction.  This is probably where it all needs to be explored a little further.  The role in retrofitting, and perhaps modular homes and new builds, needs to be examined.</p></speech>

While responsibility is left under the Department of Health, we will never be able to build up the industry.  There is so much uncertainty.  Farmers will not have the confidence to invest to increase the crop yield enough to make blocks or insulation.  Therefore, we will have to continue importing the material.</p></speech>

A critical mass of the crop is needed to justify building a decortication plant.</p><p>Many things could be done under one umbrella at a site, as with a biorefinery.  A site could be producing the construction material and processing the fibres.  On the same site, one could be processing the food components into hemp oils, and potentially processing the flowers, if allowed, into CBD.  All the constituents of the plant then would be used, which would make the economics far more favourable and give confidence to the market.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the members who participated in the recent visit to Moldova and Romania.  Senator Regina Doherty and Deputies Brendan Howlin and John Brady travelled along with me.  I also acknowledge Darren Kelly, the policy official to the committee, who travelled with us, our ambassador in Bucharest, H.E. Paul McGarry, who looked after logistics while we were there, and the clerk to the committee, Mr. Barry Kavanagh, who helped to pull the programme together.  In particular, I thank the people of Moldova and Romania who gave us a great welcome and a privileged insight into all the good things taking place in both countries in response to the humanitarian crisis.  The committee will have an opportunity today to hear the members who were part of that programme give their insights and observations.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, many of the predictions and observations we heard in Moldova and Romania are coming to pass.  Ireland also faces challenges regarding how we greet and welcome Ukrainian refugees and put together proper programmes for dealing with them.  If there are learnings from Romania or Moldova, this meeting will be an opportunity to discuss them.  We have produced a report on our visit, which will be published within the next week.  We met many representatives of NGOs and government officials and ministers.  Their key insights and observations will be helpful in the overall conversation.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet, ambassador of the Republic of Moldova to Ireland, and her colleagues.  I also welcome H.E. Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan, ambassador of Romania to Ireland, and his colleagues.</p> <p>  Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Before I call on H.E. Mrs. Miculet to make her opening statement, I acknowledge the presence of H.E. Mr. George Zurabashvili, the ambassador of Georgia, who is very welcome.  It is good to see him again.  We will now open the meeting with the opening statement of H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet.</p></speech>

I am especially honoured to be in this legislative body today as my people and country celebrate national state flag day today.  Our flag is a major official symbol of our independence and sovereignty.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for taking the initiative to discuss, in the committee&rsquo;s sessions on March 15 and today, these extremely important issues for my country and also for organising the visit of a cross-party delegation of the committee to Moldova to show solidarity with us and find out how the situation has evolved in my country and what more can be done to support us.<br/><br/>I also express our most sincere appreciation to the leadership of Ireland for the involvement and the assistance announced for Moldova in managing the flow of Ukrainian refugees by relocating 500 refugees from the Republic of Moldova to Ireland and for targeting &euro;1 million for the Republic of Moldova out of the assistance allocated by the Irish Government for the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.  In addition, I thank the Irish people, including members of the Moldovan diaspora, for collecting and sending humanitarian aid to my country.  Our gratitude also goes to the RT&Eacute; television news crew and <i>The Irish Times</i>newspaper leadership for providing to Irish society comprehensive, on-the-spot information about Moldova&rsquo;s response to refugee flow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as we meet today, further tragedy is taking place in Ukraine and this tragedy is difficult to put into words.  The world has recently witnessed even more shocking atrocities committed against civilians in Ukraine.</p><p>It is hard to believe that all of these crimes are happening in the 21st century, just at our border, in our neighbour and friend Ukraine.  Meanwhile, some dangerous incidents and attempts to destabilise the situation in the Transnistrian region were registered recently.  These pose high security risks for my country.</p><p> Let me reiterate that our country's position on the war in Ukraine is clear, firm and leaves no room for interpretation.  The Republic of Moldova strongly condemns the war of Russia against Ukraine and demanded from the first day of military aggression that this war has be stopped.  My country has voted in favour of diplomatic statements condemning the war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and co-authored resolutions adopted at the UN.</p><p> The Government of the Republic of Moldova has provided to Ukraine humanitarian aid worth 24 million lei in two instalments.  These are in Odessa, which is near my country, and in Vinnytsia on the other side.  It is ready to help our neighbours more.  Millions of people have been forced to flee their homes in Ukraine because of the war.  At our meeting on 15 March, I briefed the esteemed members of the committee on our actions.  I stated the Republic of Moldova had firmly demonstrated its commitment and engagement in ensuring international protection for those seeking refuge in Moldova.  The government has taken co-ordinated action to manage transit and refugee flows from Ukraine.  State institutions, tens of thousands of people, volunteers, police officers, public servants, medical doctors, mayors, executives and ordinary citizens all mobilised to help.</p><p> Since the onset of the conflict, more than 425,000 refugees have crossed into Moldova.  Some have been assisted to travel onwards to other countries, including through pledges made by EU countries to receive refugees from Moldova in an effort to share responsibility and reduce pressure on neighbouring countries.  Ireland is included in this.  The Republic of Moldova continues to host more than 95,000 refugees.  Of these, 91,000 are Ukrainian and we also have other nationalities.  With the inter-agency support of international organisations present in Moldova, a response mechanism is being implemented to assist Ukrainian refugees.  The mechanism includes measures on protection, accommodation, transportation, education, health and cash-based interventions for refugees.  It is important to highlight that cash enrolment in Moldova has been growing rapidly since the programme was launched at the end of March.  The figures for cash enrolment vary from country to country.  They are not as big or as high in Moldova as elsewhere but the mechanism exists.  The goal is to provide cash for approximately 150,000 refugees as well as for Moldovan host families who have opened their homes to refugees fleeing Ukraine.</p><p> Many high-level dignitaries of international organisations and our partner countries who visited Moldova have praised the authorities for the robust emergency response at our borders and within the country.  They expressed their appreciation for the remarkable solidarity in this regard.  At the same time, I am obliged to highlight that this figure of 95,000 refugees is far too large for us and we do not know what to expect with developments near Odessa.  Members can probably easily understand this because they can compare it with the number of refugees in Ireland.  The number in Moldova is four times bigger.  The influx of refugees is placing enormous pressure on my country.  Given the scale of this crisis, we need additional support from the international community to be able to provide appropriate assistance and keep the country stable.  It is important for all of Europe to have a stable Moldova.</p><p> I will name a few urgent needs.  We need to strengthen existing national systems to enable them to respond efficiently.  For example, 50,000 children have been enrolled in schools so the education system needs support.  The health system, the police and many other parts of our national system are also involved in the process.  We need to continue relocation of the refugees   Up to 19 April, more than 1,000 had been relocated to countries, including Lithuania, Austria, Germany and Latvia.  I have requested a meeting with the leadership of the Department of Justice.  I have not yet received a reply but I hope it is coming.  I want to discuss with it Ireland&rsquo;s refugee relocation mechanism, which is the responsibility of that Department.  I know from being here that when Ireland does something it does so nicely and efficiently.  This is probably why it took a bit of time to put the mechanism in place.  I am quite sure it will be operational very soon.</p><p> We are asking our partners for direct financial assistance.  We thank Ireland for helping us in this regard.  Generally speaking, I want the committee to understand what we mean by this.  We were confronted with a situation whereby big sums of money were announced.  Some people were asking the authorities for this money.  Sometimes international special mechanisms are very slow.  This is why those who assisted us bilaterally were of great help.  Everything was very pressing and money did not arrive.  Every situation and system response to the conflict is different.  Some international organisations are more used to providing tents.  In our case, refugees were hosted in homes.  This is why another type of response, such as cash interventions for host families and refugees themselves, is necessary.  We are working on this and we are grateful the organisations are flexible and are adjusting their activities.</p><p>Fortunately, during this difficult time, Moldova has not been left alone and receives assistance in many ways.  I mention one such initiative, the support conference for Moldova held in Berlin on 5 April.  It was organised by the German Federal Foreign Office and co-hosted by the German, France and Romanian foreign ministers.  We thank you for that.  That conference was aimed at mobilising immediate international support for our country but it went beyond that.  It was aimed at helping us with those other challenges Moldova faces right now relating to the war in Ukraine, which is a conflict at our border.  In this context, we also express our appreciation to the Irish authorities for the assistance and support provided to Moldova within this initiative.  Ireland participated and we are grateful.</p><p> It is clear the war has not only devastated Ukraine but also deeply affected Moldova, with a serious impact on people's lives.  It has raised prices for food, fuel and energy.  We are also facing the disrupted imports and exports from the eastern markets.  That is why we are now looking for some quick solutions to open other markets for our products that we used to export through Ukraine to other parts of the world.  In our assessment, we will feel the consequences of the war for a long time.  Therefore, we need the support of our partners to strengthen our resilience.</p><p> Despite all difficulties and crises, we continue consistently to implement the government&rsquo;s reform programme with the aim to succeed in building a competitive and resilient country that values its people and invests in them.  Allow me to underline Moldova has applied to join the European Union during this difficult time, willing to confirm it wants to be part of the free world, values democracy and believes that in the family of the European Union it can ensure freedom, security and well-being for its citizens.  The decision of the Republic of Moldova to apply for European Union membership has been taken in exceptional circumstances, as I have highlighted, but this step fully corresponds with its long-standing European aspirations and strategic European choice that members know about.  Within Moldovan society there is a strong sense of expectation and renewed hope linked with the possibility of obtaining EU candidate status.  In this context, we are grateful to the EU member states, including Ireland, for their firm and vocal support of our European aspirations and perspective.</p><p> In the context of EU work on the assessment of Moldova&rsquo;s application for membership, as a first step at this important stage, on 22 April, Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilia handed over the completed EU questionnaire to the head of the EU delegation to the Republic of Moldova.  The questionnaire was completed in just 11 days.  This speed clearly shows the determination of the president, government and the whole Moldovan people to do the utmost to bring our country to the European family as quickly as possible.  The Republic of Moldova hopes that the European Commission will recommend and that the June European Council set to be held on 23 and 24 June will take a unanimous positive decision to grant Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia candidate status or potential candidate status.  In this context, we are counting primarily on Ireland's support to approve granting EU candidate status to Moldova.</p><p> We are fully aware, as I said previously, that the accession procedure is long and complex and we are willing to embark on this path.  What we need now is a political decision that will be guiding the country for years ahead.  We need a clear target and strong political message to mobilise everyone, including society, the business community and authorities around the European integration process.  As many members shared with us in the last session, it happened with Ireland as well, at a due time.  From this perspective, please allow me to convey to the committee that my government would greatly appreciate Ireland&rsquo;s further support in managing the refugee flow that is the main topic of today's discussion and also for Moldova&rsquo;s advancement of the co-operation process with European Union.</p></speech>

Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#E00300"><p>Chairman, distinguished members of the committee, Mrs. Miculet, I am delighted to have the opportunity to follow up on our discussions of 15 March.  I like to think the consistent exchange with me and my fellow ambassadors of Ukraine, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Poland added momentum to members' decision to travel to the countries affected by the humanitarian crisis.  I congratulate the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and its leadership on its critical role in responding to the needs of the Irish people to stay tuned to the horrible realities of the war in Ukraine and to remain updated on European Union endeavours to support the people of Ukraine and sanction the aggressor.  Although separated by geography, Romania and Ireland are together in these endeavours and contributing to the strong and unprecedented unity of action of the European Union.  We may be far apart, at the two extremities of the European Continent, but the ugly realities of the war have shown how close we are and how close we should be in defending our common values, namely, the liberties of our citizens, the democratic backbone of our public lives and the independence and sovereignty of our countries for which our ancestors gave their lives.</p> <p>  With these and upcoming challenges ahead of us, Ireland and Romania should work even closer together.  This is already happening.  I praise the decision of the committee to send a delegation of its members to Romania and to the Republic of Moldova to witness first-hand how the authorities and peoples of these two countries handle the humanitarian challenges posed by huge numbers of Ukrainians who are fleeing the war to safety.  Together, we stand with Ukraine but I am sure that after the meetings in Chiinu, Palanca, Suceava, Siret and Bucharest, Romania and the Republic of Moldova will have an even larger place in your hearts and minds.</p> <p>  Allow me to mention in this context, as Mrs. Miculet did previously, the joint initiative of the Romanian, French and German Governments to raise awareness to the particularly sensitive and difficult situation in the Republic of Moldova in the context of the Russian aggression in neighbouring Ukraine.  Following the Moldova support conference organised on 5 of April in Berlin and co-hosted by the foreign ministers of Romania, France and Germany, many countries, including Ireland, pledged specific support to the Republic of Moldova via the Moldova support platform.  I take this opportunity to thank Ireland for providing substantial support to the Republic of Moldova in the context of the humanitarian crisis but also in the process of joining the European Union.</p> <p>  The joint support for the Republic of Moldova is only one of the many areas in which Romania and Ireland will work closer together in the future.  Later this afternoon, senior officials in the ministries of foreign affairs of our two countries will hold political consultations.  It may appear to be a coincidence, but this shows the intensity with which our two countries are prepared to work together.  In less than a month, the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania, Mrs. Daniela G&igrave;tman, will travel to Dublin to engage with her counterpart, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and also to meet this committee.</p><p>A delegation of the European affairs committee of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies is also scheduled to come to Dublin to consolidate the dialogue at the parliamentary level.</p><p> Our bilateral relationship grows stronger and the recent trip of the delegation of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to Romania was a consistent part of this process.  One obvious conclusion after this trip is that our two countries will continue to support the European aspirations of the people of Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova.</p><p> I thank the committee again for the invitation.  I am looking forward to taking members' questions and listening to their comments.</p></speech>

We will open up the conversation now.  Deputy Howlin will be followed by Deputy Brady.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.230" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#F00300"><p>I thank both ambassadors for their presentations and, more especially, their assistance during our visit.  Of the many visits I have made over my parliamentary career, it was one of the most impactive.  The members who travelled talked privately before this meeting.  All of us took some time when we came home to reflect on the volume of issues with which we were presented.  On my behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of everyone else involved, I thank all those we met, both in Romania and Moldova, for their absolute openness.  There was an extremely open, frank and inclusive discussion on all of the realities and all of us came back with a sense of professionalism and generosity in meeting an unprecedented crisis.  That view is expressed in our report which will be published imminently.  I hope the ambassadors will convey to their Governments and, more especially, the peoples of both their nations our awe and admiration for the way in which they have gone about meeting this unprecedented crisis.  We came back determined to redouble our efforts in explaining the depth of the crisis, which is unprecedented in modern European history, but also to see how we can assist matters.</p> <p>  I will deal with a number of specific points.  I do not know if we have an update on the 500 refugees Ireland has undertaken to accept from Moldova and whether they have arrived here.  That was one of the issues we said we would follow up on as soon as we came back.  Perhaps the ambassador, H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet, has an update.  If not, I suggest we make direct contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs to find out what is happening in that respect.</p> <p>  The second issue, one we were all mindful of, is that while there is substantial international support mediated through international organisations, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, there is a dearth of direct support to the Governments of Moldova and Romania, particularly the former, to meet the pressures.  We had an extraordinary meeting with the Moldovan health minister, Dr. Nemerenco, who described in great detail the pressures on the health system as it was opened up to the 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who are now in Moldova.  In the context of the country's population and capacity, the pressure is enormous.  We need to give direct support to deal with that.  The ambassador referred to the education system and other state systems.  Direct government-to-government financial support is needed in addition to the support provided through international organisations.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the issues we were mindful of are that the conflict may migrate towards Odessa, that Odessa, a large modern city, may be attacked and that the consequences of mass migration from Odessa through Palanka into Moldova would overwhelm Moldova, bluntly, if it arrived at a scale of 100,000 people per day.  Romania is already planning to support Moldova to ease the pressure there but we all need to be part of that easing of pressure because should that happen - please God, it will not - it would be a human catastrophe.  As we have seen, rockets landed in Odessa last weekend.  When we were in Palanka, a 30-minute drive from Odessa, that possibility was made abundantly clear to us.  The stated ambition of creating a Russian corridor through to Transnistria in Moldova, which was at the edges of our fears, is now a potential reality to which we need to be alert.</p> <p>  All of us understood the scale of the support Romania was providing but we were taken aback by the professionalism and organisation we saw, particularly in Suceava.  At the Siret crossing point, we were concerned about a range of issues, including the security of migrants coming across and the potential for exploitation.  The organised and professional security cordon that ensured nobody could enter the Siret region without proper identification, etc., was hugely impressive.</p> <p>  On the issue of supports, I was struck by the useful initiative of the UNHCR in providing Ukrainians coming into Moldova or Romania, once registered, a card with $100 per person per month.  This approach has a variety of positives.  It gives the individuals concerned independence and protects their dignity, which is extremely important, but it also helps the local community by providing spending power within it.  That is vital.  Is that model working and is it extensive enough?  How can we support it?</p> <p>  My final question is on practical steps we need to take.  It struck us as odd that there are so many direct connections between Ireland and Romania and none to Moldova.  Is a direct air link to Chiinu in the pipeline or is there anything the committee could usefully do in relation to that?  Creating markets would also be practical.  We had the great pleasure of sampling a great variety of Moldovan produce - food, drink, etc. - when we were there, which would certainly have a market here.  Maybe we could seek to assist with that as well.  Those are my opening thoughts.</p></speech>

Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy so much.  I was impressed by the fact that the committee decided to visit Romania and Moldova.  As I told the Deputy at our previous meeting, the focus in regard to the particular issue of humanitarian assistance should be on Moldova.  Romania is supporting and partnering with Moldova.  We are careful, which is the reason Romania, along with Germany and France, decided to initiate the Moldova support platform.  That is the urgent need and it is an issue I said a few words about in my introduction.</p> <p>  The second issue is the European perspective.  Everybody knows this is a long road but the European perspective should be clear.  Romania and other European countries, including, I am sure, Ireland, will support that and convince other European countries that are much more sceptical that we - Romania, Ireland and other European countries - should be together with the Republic of Moldova and Georgia.  Let us not forget about Georgia, one of the first countries to be affected by Russian aggression.  It is the role of the embassies of our countries to maintain momentum and keep attention on the region - Ukraine, of course, and the Republic of Moldova but also Georgia - as high as possible.  Let us not forget about Georgia.  It may not be affected by the humanitarian crisis to the same extent as Romania, Poland and the Republic of Moldova, but it is important.</p><p>I spoke with my colleagues in Bucharest and Suceava who praised the fact that members of the committee were there on the field.  It is not easy.  People are keen to stay in their offices to watch and comment but I am here to praise the fact that the committee decided to visit and witness the hardship of the people in Moldova and the complexity of the processes.  </p><p> As we discussed last time, Romania has put in place a complex mechanism to assist.  There are six groups in the chancellery of the Prime Minister dealing with children, elderly people, housing, schooling and students.  All the sensitive human issues are covered and the six working groups are co-ordinated by the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister travelled to Kyiv yesterday.  The Ukraine foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was in Bucharest.  We are in close co-ordination with Ukrainian officials to see what is needed in terms of practical assistance to carry on the war and also refugees.  We have started to discuss the future.  We should talk more about the future and be optimistic while providing the necessary assistance, both for the people in Ukraine and those who travel to safety from Ukraine to other countries.</p><p> I do not have specifics on the UNHCR mechanism.  I know the Romanian Government is looking to the Romanian people who are hosting.  There was a recent decision to increase the allocation for food and rent to people who decide to host.  It is to encourage Romanians who host Ukrainians to carry on doing so because at some point they may become a burden.  We should carry on with the hospitality but resources are necessary.  My Government is looking into that.</p><p> I will stop there and I can come back later.  I thank members for the opportunity to praise the committee and its work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#G00200"><p>I agree with Dr. tefan's sentiments about this committee, which so quickly responded to the meeting we held here.  In just a few days, I heard that the Chairman and members decided quickly to visit Moldova, Palanca and many other places.  They now know what they talking about, having seen the reality.  I was personally touched but the visit was appreciated by the entire country.  We have just started our parliamentary connections.  The committee delegation was probably the first group of parliamentarians to visit Moldova so that was also very important and touching.</p> <p>  Deputy Howlin was correct about developments in Odessa.  Yesterday a bridge connecting the south of Ukraine, near Odessa, with Moldova was destroyed.  Therefore, Palanca, which the delegation visited, is now the only crossing point for people from Odessa if they need to flee to Moldova.  It is very narrow and has not been adjusted for thousands of people.  We are trying to manage the situation today but also to evaluate what might happen.  We pray it will not be needed.</p> <p>  Cash enrolment is probably the most useful and appreciated assistance in the country.  I will give some information to compare with the kind of help given by Ireland.  It is very different.  We give 2,000 leu monthly, which is &euro;100, to refugees.  To people who are hosting refugees, we provide 3,500 leu, more than &euro;150, which is not very much.  Previously, people helped out without any kind of cash support.</p> <p>  I am very grateful that Deputy Howlin raised the issue of markets.  We are working very closely to open new markets for our products.  Some Moldovan products are already available in Ireland.  We are looking to enhance that.  That is my job but because of the Covid pandemic, I was not able to do much in this area.  I am sure that with the support of this committee and other committees that are more focused on commerce, I will be able to do further work on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#G00300"><p>I thank the ambassadors.  I commend Romania and Moldova on the hospitality shown to me and my colleagues on our recent visit and the expertise, openness and honesty shown by all the organisations, individuals and politicians we met.  We had very frank conversations.  It is a visit that will stay in my heart forever.  It is one thing to watch the news and see the horror unfolding in Europe but it is a completely different experience to see a mother and her two or three children come across the border at Palanca or Siret carrying a plastic bag and crying her eyes out, not knowing where she was going or what the future holds, when she may go home or whether she will see her husband ever again.  That is something that will stay with me forever.</p> <p>  I had another very striking engagement in the refugee centre in Chiinu when I met a woman who, I think, had two children.  She had spoken to her husband the previous evening.  He is on the front line in Ukraine defending his country.  She had not heard from him since.  As she was speaking to him, missiles were falling around him.  It was very real and horrific.  I can only imagine the trauma those people are experiencing.  I commend the hospitality that both countries have shown to the refugees who are fleeing for their lives with only a few valued possessions.</p> <p>  We engaged with many organisations in Romania and Moldova.  As Deputy Howlin said, the openness from everyone we met was striking.  I will deal with the two countries separately.  Moldova is a country that has very little in the way of finance and is extremely poor but it was very apparent that the warmth and generosity shown to the refugees have been striking.  Over 425,000 people have crossed into Moldova, of whom about 100,000 have decided to stay there given its proximity to Odessa and the southern part of Ukraine, which, unfortunately, is coming under more and more pressure.  As the ambassador said, the bridge that was struck yesterday just below Palanca was struck again this morning to ensure it was completely destroyed.</p><p>In recent days we have also seen potential false flag operations in Transnistria.  I refer to the destruction of two telecommunication towers.  There were reports this morning that there was an attack or attempted attack on the largest weapons depot in Europe, which holds more than 20,000 tonnes of Soviet air ammunition.  There are reports that there may have been an attack on it this morning.  To my mind, these are all potentially false flag operations because Russia has stated that to try to stabilise the situation in Transnistria, it may not stand idly by.  To my mind, that means there is potential for Russia to open up that land connection from Mariupol right across through Odessa and into Transnistria.  The concerns that generates are significant.</p><p> I was struck by a genuine and simple request from all those we met in Moldova in respect of the need for hard cash.  It is striking that in her opening statement H.E. Mrs. Miculet welcomed the &euro;1 million that has come from Ireland in humanitarian assistance.  That is a drop in the ocean.  I think it was Senator Doherty who stated in our engagement in Moldova that the amount is actually an embarrassment.  I agree that it is an embarrassment.  In the context of dealing with the poorest country in Europe, for &euro;1 million to be given in humanitarian assistance is pitiful and an embarrassment.  I repeat my calls in that regard.  I think all representatives of the committee were speaking in unison on this issue while we were in Moldova, stating that this needs to be addressed immediately.  There needs to be a substantial amount of money from Ireland and the EU to Moldova to help with the humanitarian crisis and the fantastic response that has been made.  That monetary assistance needs to be forthcoming.</p><p> Some of the NGOs we met, including Plan International, expressed concerns in respect of vulnerable people, including unaccompanied minors, crossing the borders and the potential for trafficking.  That concern was expressed by some of the organisations there.  Unfortunately, it is a reality.  It is happening.  There have been reports of it taking place.  This issue needs to be addressed, given the volume of refugees coming over the border.  The organisations stated that proper vetting of people dropping off goods or collecting refugees at border points needs to be put in place in order to ensure the potential for trafficking is completely eliminated.   The organisations stated that there is massive goodwill coming from Ireland and right across Europe but their appeal to members of the public who wish or need to do something is for them not to go directly to border crossing points because that adds complications in terms of trying to avoid the potential for trafficking or the picking up of unaccompanied minors by people who should not be there.  Trafficking is a threat.  It is a matter that needs to be considered and stricter and more rigid procedures must be put in place.</p><p> As regards the 500 refugees Ireland has agreed to take in, I will follow up on the point made by Deputy Howlin.  It was a concern while we were in Moldova that although the announcement that Ireland will take in 500 refugees is welcome, it seemed to come from nowhere.  The figure was not based on anything in particular. Have those 500 refugees now landed in Ireland?  It was a concern when we were in Moldova that the announcement was made but there was no movement on it.  H.E. Mrs. Miculet may be able to update the committee in that regard.  I am also concerned that her request to meet the Minister for Justice has not been responded to.  This may be a matter on which the committee can follow up.  Given everything we have stated and seen in the context of the crisis that is unfolding and the additional pressures on Moldova, that request should be acted upon immediately.  The committee needs to follow up on that because it is concerning that the request has not been responded to, let alone the meeting granted.  </p><p> As regards Romania, its openness, honesty, expertise and commitment to deal with the situation are second to none.  Everyone we met was so open and excellent.  We visited a refugee centre in Bucharest.  There is a fantastic operation in place there.  The level of volunteers not just in Moldova but also in Romania was stark.  There were schoolchildren going straight to the refugee centres at the end of their school day in order to help out.  It was striking.  A matter that struck me in the context of our engagements in Romania was the significant costs.  We were told it had cost between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million up to that point.  I am sure that figure has been exceeded at this stage.  Like in the case of Moldova, very little assistance, if any, has been forthcoming from the EU.  Indeed, we were told there were no additional funds or money coming from the EU and that Romania had been told it had to use up its existing cohesion funding before a request for funding could be considered.  That is really concerning.  Billions of euro are being pumped into providing weapons for Ukraine, and those weapons are needed, obviously, but we do not see a parallel level of funding going to help deal with the humanitarian crisis that, unfortunately, is evolving as a result of the war.  That seriously needs to be looked at because more than 777,000 refugees have crossed over into Romania to date.  I refer to the additional infrastructure in terms of road services and everything that will be needed to cater for that massive increase in population.  Existing cohesion funding is now being sidetracked to deal with the crisis.  This is a serious issue that needs to be immediately addressed by the EU.  That will be borne out in our report.</p><p> This morning, we saw that Russia cut off the gas supply to Poland and Bulgaria.  In Moldova, it was striking how dependent the country is on that gas for the production of electricity.  We were told  the gas supply is being provided free to Transnistria but the bill had been passed on to Moldova.  Are there serious concerns now that the gas supply to Moldova may be cut?  It was striking that Moldova is very dependent on that supply.  Is Dr. tefan concerned that the supply to Romania may be cut off?  What contingencies have been put in place?  How dependent is Romania on that supply?</p><p> This has been a very useful engagement.  I have probably left a lot out in terms of my questions.  It will probably take me a while to analyse it.  I am still analysing some of our engagement but it was a very useful trip and there are many things that will stick with me.  I know I have related a couple of stories already.</p><p>There was another young man in Moldova as well, who was 17 and just missed the military age in Ukraine.  He and his mam managed to bring their dog with them.  He was sitting on a bus heading to Spain.  They barely had a word of English, let alone a word of Spanish.  They did not know where they were going or what the future held for them.  It is very striking when we hear figures, statistics and of horrors and we should remember we are dealing with real humans whose lives have been turned upside down.  We do not know what the future holds for them.  There is a massive humanitarian crisis in the region that this horrific war has generated.  The response from the international community, including the EU and Ireland, is lacking to say the least.  It must be addressed.</p></speech>

I saw a picture of the day as he watched the address of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the car he described.  I thank him for the words of solidarity he expressed to us and appreciation.  He described precisely the situation in Moldova, including the emotions people are feeling, as well as our needs.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  We welcome any food or assistance from Ireland or other countries.  There are different mechanisms, as I said.  One is the platform for Moldova that was initiated recently.  The EU mechanism is still active for Moldova to receive assistance.  There was a question regarding the mechanism for relocation.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of the matter.  I assume nobody has been relocated or otherwise I would see it noted in the papers I constantly receive from the ministry.  I assume it is because of the holidays and a reply indicates the letter was received.  I will probably have a meeting.  I understand the ministry for justice is working very hard on the Irish mechanism for refugee flows.  I am optimistic and quite sure we will manage with the committee's help to discuss the topic.</p> <p>  On the question of Transnistria, it is a very tense and complex situation right now.  It is probably the most important development that is now followed by everyone and not just Moldova.  It is followed by all our partners, the EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, mission in Moldova.  Just after those incidents, the OSCE mission called for everybody in general not to take any actions to undermine the trust and work that has been achieved up to now in the management of this conflict.  Yesterday the Moldovan President called a supreme security council meeting.  After that, Moldovan President Maia Sandu held a briefing, stating that all appropriate state agencies are on alert.  They were also given additional tasks, including to be more vigilant, investigate and take all measures needed from our side.  At the same time the President called on our people to stay calm and not to use false sources of information.  That is very important in such situations.</p> <p>  Our President also stated we are looking to use existing mechanisms, including the 5+2 format etc., to settle the conflict.  This means we are still looking to diplomatic and political solutions for the region.  We do not control the Transnistrian region but they are our citizens and it is our territory.  We are concerned and working with partners to approach these incidents that are seeking to destabilise in the best possible way.</p> <p>  I reiterate my words of appreciation and gratitude to the Romanian authorities, as has been mentioned.  There is a connection and we are working together in providing support.  This support, by the way, is not just in the area of managing the flow of refugees.  Romania is working hand in hand with us in the European accession process, which is already at the level of parliaments.  There was a meeting and they expressed an intention and a readiness to help us in this process at the parliamentary level.  The Chairman asked in a separate letter what we will need in the process towards further European integration.  I replied by saying now it is a question of deep assessment and we are completing those questionnaires.  There will be an assessment and we will need help at the level of parliaments and other authorities in future steps.  I will bring that to the committee's attention in time.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the energy resilience of my country.  It is one of the major topics we are working on.  There was and still is an energy crisis in my country and the members may have discussed this with authorities.  Prices of gas have risen to a level but probably not every European country pays that price.  We have only one source of gas, which makes us very vulnerable.</p> <p>  There are steps being taken to diversify.  Romania is on one side stocking some gas for us and the European Union announced that if there is a purchase of gas for European countries, Moldova would be included in the mechanism.  On the electricity side, I am also pleased to say our electricity system was connected to the European system just recently.  That helps us a lot.</p> <p>  At this moment, the European Union perspective for us is the cornerstone of everything.  It is why we repeat our plea for support and for a European perspective.  We will do our homework and it will be for the benefit of the entire European region.  That is probably what Ireland expects from us.</p></speech>

Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#J00300"><p>I was touched by Deputy Brady's stories of his trip to Romania and the Republic of Moldova, and how it affected his view of the region.  I hope we can work together in future and he will travel there in more normal and peaceful times to see what else we can do for our countries and the region.</p><p>I will be brief and try to address the two questions.</p><p> The Romanian Government is keeping track of the expenses, so I have the figures.  A sum of &euro;70 million has been spent on refugees.  Romania has provided &euro;100 million to the Republic of Moldova to assist our neighbours in handling this humanitarian crisis.  We know that the European Union is doing its best.  It may do more, of course.  There are all these pressures - the members know that better than I do - on spending, military support and refugees in Poland and other countries, so there are huge challenges.  I tend to see the positive side of the story in that the European Union acted in a united way.  Of course, it may not have taken some decisions with the speed needed, but it is on the right track.  With everybody here, and with our leaders pushing and co-ordinating at the European level, we can do more - that is for sure.  The fact that we are interacting here today is a clear sign of unity and of our joint concern for countries such as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia.  There is a lot of work ahead, but I think we are ready.</p><p> As for energy security, Romania has been a strong voice in the European Union in looking at this issue for at least ten years.  Nobody paid attention.  We know from some facts that Germany, which is a very important country, did not pay too much attention to those concerns and now Europe is paying the cost because a number of European leaders admit they cannot simply cut commercial ties with Russia.  That is highly problematic.  I will not get into that discussion, but we are reaching that red line now with Poland and Bulgaria being cut off from Russian gas.  We have been concerned about the issue for some time and looked into it years ago, not necessarily on the brink of the war, with the Republic of Moldova.  As H.E. Mrs. Miculet said, we now have the gas connection and there is a gas pipeline, so we will be able to help the Republic of Moldova as much as we can.  The good thing is that we are not as reliant on Russian gas as other European countries are.  Romania has natural resources, so we are looking at other alternative resources.  That has been a major policy concern for Romania.  I am not saying we have addressed it properly, but the attention was there and we moved closely to reduce the dependency as much as we could.  Of course, there is debate in Romania as to "What will happen if?".  I think Romania is better prepared than other countries and we can help our neighbours if necessary.  It is to be hoped, however, that the committee and the leaders of this country will push that onto the European agenda to warn other countries, or the big countries, that we should move ahead from oil and gas from Russia and look elsewhere.  I know the United States is providing assistance and gas.  Let us see how we can handle this critical issue together.</p></speech>

I know the latter has indicated but I want to take members who went to Moldova and Romania first.</p></speech>

There is nothing surer than seeing something for real, for yourself, to raise the temperature of the emotions you feel.  Deputy Brady has expressed in a lovely way the impact that meeting the children and the refugees personally and listening to their stories has had on how we feel.  I will not speak for my colleagues, but not happy is how we feel, or definitely how I feel.</p><p>Both ambassadors are incredibly gracious and diplomatic and would not be in the jobs they are in if they were not, but that is tinged, from my perspective, with a lot of anger, not just at our own response in helping neighbouring European countries on the front line but also at the European Union and, to my mind, its complete lack of financial support for the countries neighbouring Ukraine.  It is an absolute insult for the European Union to tell member states to use their cohesion funding that is desperately needed for the reasons the Cohesion Fund is there in the first place in place of giving real financial support for refugees, particularly along the countries bordering Ukraine.</p><p>The reality for me and the takeaway from the visit is not only how beautiful the part of the world the ambassadors come from and live in is, and it definitely requires return visits in normal times, but also the generosity of the people in their part of the world, more so from Moldova than Romania, who have so little but who are giving so much.  It puts me to shame and causes me embarrassment that I find myself in a country that has taken in 25,000 refugees and we are already telling the country that we are creaking at the seams.  Moldova has 91,000 refugees and a smaller population that has the generosity to put refugees in their own homes.  They do not have to have special rooms, special buses or the nonsense we go on with in this country.  I applaud the ambassadors' respectfulness in the response they have given to the statement we made nearly a month ago that we would take an extra 500 refugees with special needs from Moldova.  From my latest inquiries with the Department of Justice yesterday, I understand we are still tinkering around the edges of trying to find somewhere to put them, while the people and citizens of Moldova and Romania have them staying in their sheds and have not grumbled about the fact that they will look after them.  We are still tinkering around the edges as to where we will find to put them.  The committee should praise the humanitarian responses of the peoples of both Romania and Moldova, and indeed probably Bulgaria and Poland, countries which we have not even got to speak to or see yet.</p><p>What we should do next is bring in the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Justice and Housing, Local Government and Heritage and meet with the European Commission to find out exactly what the hell is going on, and not only with streaming funds to look after the refugees.  I am emotionally engaged now at a level at which I certainly was not before my visit.  To my mind, this war could have been over if the EU had made decisions a lot sooner.  If it actually wanted this war to be over today, it would be over today.  The likes of Poland and Bulgaria and the absolutely brave and singular stances they have taken in response to Gazprom are something we should all applaud and ask to be repeated by every other European country.</p><p>What probably struck me most, apart from meeting the refugees, the volunteers and the other people who were giving, and probably the most impactful person to me was a lady I met in Romexpo.  I think she could have single-handedly organised the response herself she was so effective and such a lovely and honest person.</p><p>I do not think we have really decided from a European perspective that this war should be over.  The things that need to be done should have already been done.  With respect to the visit and the people we met, the next steps we should take are to resolve some of the issues that were presented to us during the tour.  Probably the most impactful was the need for cash.  As Deputy Brady said, we were accompanied by a gentleman from <i>The Irish Times</i>who reported at an emotional level I do not think I had seen in <i>The Irish Times</i>before that, which was really appreciated.  When he asked me one day about the &euro;1 million we were clapping ourselves on the back for having given the Moldovan Government, I thought it was buttons and an embarrassment.  We should be doing so much more, whether at a European level or an Irish level.  It is an embarrassment that our local Red Cross in Ireland has fundraised &euro;30 million in recent years and the Irish Government is clapping itself on the back for giving the Moldovan Government &euro;1 million.  I am sorry.  I know the witnesses are being diplomatic, but it is an absolute disgrace.  It is definitely something we should take on board.  Having now met the ambassadors on the return from our trip, when we release our report this week, the people who can give the answers to the questions we raised while touring Moldova and Romania a number of weeks ago should be around this table, and we should do that sooner rather than later.  I commend all the people of Moldova and Romania and all their efforts.</p><p>My final comment is to H.E. Dr. tefan.  The deputy foreign affairs minister we met the day we were leaving told us that Romania has been banging the table for ten years trying to get the French in particular and the Russians to feel and to hear the message it has given.  The deputy minister said that Romania finally felt vindicated that they have woken up and finally seen the threat Russia poses.  I contend that they still have not acted on the acknowledgement of that threat.  If anybody is dragging their heels on the European Union's response that is needed, it is probably the Germans and French.</p><p>The reality should be borne home by the other member states that we can no longer tolerate what is happening and that the decisions we know need to be made must be made now.</p></speech>

Ireland will be friends forever to Romania and Moldova.  We can rely on Ireland to work together for our countries and for Europe, which is what this is all about.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned some large countries in Europe.  Countries like Romania, Ireland and others that may not be as influential can work together, push the agenda and change the course of history.  My role is to engage with Ireland and build a partnership, which is why I mentioned in my opening remarks that there would be a dialogue between the directorates-general and that our Secretary of State would be coming to Ireland.  I hope that the committee will be available on 18 May to celebrate and see where we are and what we can do for our countries and Europe.  More is coming.  Ireland is realising that it has partners.  Europe is our home.  It was mentioned that refugees were coming to Ireland via Moldova and Romania.  Europe provided us all with a home.  We may be located in one room at one level and others may be located in another, but we cross one another more and more in the kitchen, in the hallways and in the garden.  We need to do more for our neighbours and inhabitants.</p> <p>  I appreciate members' visit to our countries.</p></speech>

I will continue in line with my ambassadorial colleague's comments on our deep willingness.  I have worked a great deal on enhancing parliamentary connections.  Ireland has such a strong democracy.  I have witnessed it and its parliamentary activities for three years.  That is why I would love our Members of Parliament to take some of the good experiences from Ireland.  I finally managed to have a friendship group from the Irish side.  We have always had one on the Moldovan side.  Some of this committee's members have already visited my country.  The group's list is open, so they can join and we will push together.  I am looking forward to our first meeting &ndash; it will probably be online &ndash; and Irish parliamentarians will continue the discussion that they started in Moldova.  In this way, we will come closer together as nations and parliaments.  As I have often said in interviews, despite the fact that Moldova is not a rich country, we have found a window of opportunity to have an embassy in Ireland because it is our intention to come closer to this nation.  Our diaspora was brave.  It came to Ireland first and we came after it.  Now, we have that bridge.  I am looking forward to working closely with the committee in advancing our bilateral agenda.</p></speech>

Like everyone else, I have been following the invasion and looking at it geographically.  Palanca, which my colleagues visited, is close to the sea and not far from the southern tip of Transnistria.  In the context of Transnistria, what are Mrs. Miculet's concerns if the invasion continues?  Transnistria goes three quarters of the way up the border between Moldova and Ukraine.  If a corridor connects southern Transnistria to Odessa, Russia can move both east and west.  Will Mrs. Miculet speak about defending in the case of such an eventuality?  It would be easy for Russia to move east or west from Transnistria if it becomes connected to Russia.</p></speech>

These incidents in Transnistria did not start just a few days ago.  Rather, they started a little earlier.  We have had false bomb announcements and alarms.  We are following the situation closely and with constant vigilance.  When more pronounced incidents like explosions happen, the first to step in was the OSCE, which called on us not to do anything that would undermine trust.  I am pleased to say that, probably in a few days' time, a mission formed by OSCE structures will visit Moldova and, within its competence, evaluate the situation.  The EU is following that and I have heard that the US Department of State is also following it.  Everyone is following it.  The Russian Federation made a statement speaking about respecting our independence and sovereignty.  We are doing what the state is supposed to do.</p> <p>  We are a neutral country and our defensive power is within those limits.  That is why we are trying to stabilise the current situation and call for calm among people in Moldova and Transnistria despite the incidents.  We are assessing the situation in general.  We are assessing all statements concerning the corridor the Deputy mentioned.  The state authorities, including the Supreme Security Council, are probably considering all scenarios, but those considerations are not public at this moment, so I will not elaborate on them.  I can only say that the situation as it stands is complex.  That is why we need support of any type, including this public meeting of a European committee, to support our independence and neutrality and call for a calm situation in Moldova, including in Transnistria, because Europe needs a stable country there.</p></speech>

There was a public message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to calm down and not to react or start putting the blame on different people.  There was a debate and I think the Moldovan President was accused of putting the blame wrongfully.  If would be very difficult if something starts.  It was mentioned that people from Odessa may flow into Moldova and that would overwhelm the country.</p> <p>  I would not comment on Russian plans, of course.  It is very difficult to think Russia will stop or that it would be satisfied with what it has so far.  It looks like the Russian agenda is to build this corridor.  We have been seriously concerned about this and also in terms of the refugees that Moldova will be the first affected, so we have to be prepared for that as well.</p></speech>

I thank the two ambassadors for coming before us and for their previous contributions.  We can see from the report that a significant amount of due diligence was done by the group that travelled.  It was a very useful piece of work and this is a follow-up on it.  In regard to where the conversation started, it started during the pandemic with regard to the Conference on the Future of Europe and, obviously, we have had not only a humanitarian disaster but it has been an absolute game-changer.  The one good thing to come out of a terrible situation is the fact that the world, including Europe, seems a lot closer and we all see the necessity of being able to co-operate with each other from the point of view of getting to a better place.  We have to co-operate on the basis of the humanitarian nightmare that these two countries are dealing with.  Like other speakers, I commend them on the work they have done and for what is, in real terms, the heavy lifting.</p> <p>  On some level, there is no need for a huge number of questions because the ambassadors have stated what their countries need.  In fairness, Dr. tefan said the focus needs to be on Moldova and that there is a need for resources.  A number people have stated explicitly that the money that is being offered up, particularly here, does not cut the mustard in any way, shape or form and is not good enough.  Mrs. Miculet also went into some detail in regard to the forward planning that Moldova needs to consider.</p> <p>  We had a fair bit of conversation on the worries about what Russia will do, and I get that none of us can necessarily game-play that.  I have no doubt there is a huge amount of preparation being made in that regard.  One of the points I want to raise relates to an issue raised by Deputy Duffy.  Given the worries the two ambassadors are talking about, there have been not only the false flag operations and whatever that might mean with regard to Transnistria, but there is also the attack on the bridge close to Palanca and it was said that that route is cut through.  From where the two ambassadors see it, there is going to be an influx of refugees from Odessa which would be very difficult to deal with in regard to how they will travel and so on.  What needs to be done?  We are hoping we do not have to deal with the nightmare situation but this war has shown we are dealing with one nightmare after another and it makes absolute sense that preparations are made.</p> <p>  As regards the asks, we need to do our best.  The two ambassadors have been very straightforward in regard to the meetings that are required and specifically in regard to the money.  It would be absolutely wrong if we and the State did not follow up on that.  It would be an abject failure from Ireland and the rest of the European Union if we did not do all of those pieces that are necessary.</p> <p>  I get where Senator Doherty is going in regard to the fact there needs to be a ramping up of sanctions to ensure we put the maximum pressure on Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s regime at this point in time.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right.  All of our state authorities try to work not only on what happens today, but to look ahead and to consider all possible or impossible scenarios because we are realistic in approaching the situation.  With regard to our future needs, I was looking at that bridge yesterday on the map and saw that it was also a way to go from that part of Ukraine to Romania and to other parts.  If that is cut, they can come only through this narrow Palanca area because on the other side, as the Deputy said, is Transnistria.  It is very narrow.</p> <p>  I spoke yesterday with the leadership of my ministry, who have a big role in these activities, and they told me that further relocation is one of our priorities and concerns.  We have to take into consideration that more refugees may suddenly, at one moment, come to our country.  That is why we must consider relocation.</p> <p>  There are two tracks with regard to developing assistance in Moldova.  As I said, one is the immediate need in regard to refugee flow and another is the support platform for Moldova.  One is helping Moldova just to survive itself because we still have that impact of the Covid pandemic, followed by the energy crisis, when we were not cut off but our prices were raised to $1,000.  On energy resilience, we need help and support.  As I said, we are also looking for new markets.  All of this is just for the country itself to survive.</p><p>This country is taking care of citizens on one hand and dealing with refugees on the other.  Both these pillars are very important to us.</p><p> There is probably an appropriate place in this second pillar of energy resilience and helping to build stronger capacity for our state agencies.  The issue will probably be discussed in more depth in the Moldova support platform of which Ireland is a part.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and other agencies that are participating in the platform can probably provide the committee with more concrete information on what was requested through that mechanism.  It is not only dealt with bilaterally but via the platform, which we hope will work better in putting all needs together and seeing what our partners can do to work together and respond, strengthening our resilience as a state in general, keeping us stable and aiding us in dealing with the flow of refugees.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for keeping an interest even if they were not on the trip.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the committee has a critical role in bringing these issues and stories to the public and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments.  Especially after their trip, the members sense what is needed there and the lack of funds in countries that may be affected even more seriously.  Russia is unpredictable and we should expect the worst.  Let us prepare for the worst and let us see.</p> <p>  I know Ireland is militarily neutral but I appreciate that it is not neutral when it comes to values and our approach.  Romanians and Moldovans really appreciate the fact that from the very first moment, Ireland's position was clear and its engagement on the right side of history was clear-cut.  Now we have to find ways together in bilateral terms, which is our offering here today, and also at European level, to find out how to move the European Union project along together and how to advance it in countries like Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine, when the time is right, of course.  It is a thorny process.  We must also find out how to protect ourselves from dangers in the future.  It had me scared a little bit when Russia announced the exercises in the waters off this island three months ago.  Bad things may happen to all countries regardless of their position in Europe.  Let us work together to fend off these dangers in the future.</p></speech>

What Ambassador Miculet is talking about are particularly detailed asks.  Would it be possible for the committee to get a look at them?  I am referring to the asks from the support platform.  Could we play our part in that respect?  Maybe it is not possible.</p></speech>

It is a matter of making sure that Moldova survives.  For the want of a better term we have had a perfect storm.  As regards Russia we talked about energy resilience but this is an energy crisis meeting a geopolitical crisis and climate change.  I am sorry to use the term South Ossetia in respect of Georgia.  My point is that we wonder why Russia cares about this little strip of land, but it is about the sphere of influence.  If we look at the history of hybrid attacks in Estonia or even certain other things that have happened throughout Europe, it is the realisation that it is not only a smaller world but also a more dangerous one.  We have all said previously that when we are looking at Mariupol we could be looking at pictures from the Second World War.  It could be Dresden.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p>  On accession, we could see at the Conference on the Future of Europe that some of the language was very protective.  Some of that might relate to the likes of Hungary and fear, with the European Union saying it needs protection, particularly in respect of the rule of law.  Some of the earlier language was almost to the effect that Europe needed to get its house in order and be unified before it would facilitate further accession.  People saw that this was dreadful language, and that whatever about the western Balkans, it was particularly dreadful in respect of Moldova and Ukraine, and even Georgia and other states that are looking for this at present.  I accept that the Copenhagen criteria are what they are and there probably needs to be a greater level of engagement.  However, not only the language but probably the politics of that is moving on.  We should obviously play a part in that regard.  It is going to be a long and difficult journey.  Moldova needs to be facilitated but first and foremost it needs to be able to survive.  It is absolutely necessary that we play whatever small part we can in furthering those arguments.  I commend Romania, Moldova and the other neighbour states that are doing a huge amount of heavy lifting.  We need to look at ourselves and where we are falling down.</p></speech>

I can follow up with my colleagues who are putting together a programme of action as is usual with aid works, and I may be able to give the Deputy more details.</p> <p>  On accession I agree that it is not an easy decision.  We are realistic.  However, there is a new environment in terms of security and in general in the world and especially in Europe.  Now we need new political approaches, definitely.  Decisions will probably be taken that will differ from what was the case before 24 February.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has such a crucial role in Ireland's voice as regards giving us candidate status.</p><p>I kindly ask the committee to consider it very carefully to help us to survive and to do our best in the future to become a fully fledged member of the EU.  We do not ask for shortcuts.  We just ask people to realise how critical the European perspective is for us.  It is a long process and we will go through it as required, without shortcuts.  We do not ask for them.</p></speech>

It is absolutely heart-wrenching.</p> <p>  The accession journey is arduous and difficult but in my humble opinion, prior to the invasion is was rudderless and going nowhere in a hurry.  There is some momentum building.  It is important that we all, the diplomatic corps and public representatives, push to try to make the most of this opportunity to tangibly push this issue further despite the strict criteria.</p> <p>  I thank both of our guests for their excellent presentations.  My experience of this committee is that its members are deeply committed.  The ambassadors appreciate that we understand.

This was a very important meeting.  There will also be an important public element to it when we publish the report on our findings and what we have learned.  We are very grateful.  I thank both ambassadors for being with us today.  Our knowledge of Romania and Moldova has increased no end, including places such as Chiinu, Palanca, Iai and up as far as Siret.  This has given deeper meaning to the relationship between Moldova and Romania but also, within the European Union context, the importance of solidarity and the words that were used today.</p> <p>  I thank the members for their engagement this morning.  We will continue these discussions.  Follow-up is key.  One point that we picked up in various meetings with politicians in Moldova and Romania was that they were talking about the future.  Yes, there was an acknowledgement of the present difficulties and challenges but they were talking about the future.  There was a considerable degree of hope in those deliberations around rebuilding and working together more closely, irrespective of geographical distances.  One thing I learned at a personal level was that we have a lot more in common that we have differences.  We will continue to work with H.E. Mrs. Miculet on EU involvement and the different signals and suggestions from politicians around bridging the gaps, which are certainly not insurmountable.  We look forward to meeting the politicians when they come here, and with Mrs. Miculet and Mr. Zurabashvili.  We will keep a close eye on the Ukrainian application as well.  The suggestion to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the committee would be a good next step.</p></speech>

That is no problem.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile; there is no strength without unity.  We look forward to strengthening this partnership and we will work together more closely.

We are grateful to the Romanian and Moldovan Governments for their suggestions about what we can do.  There is no magic formula here.  This is wartime.  We are dealing with a refugee crisis in developed countries which is not the norm.  Even NGOs are having to reposition in order to help.  We will remain vigilant and stay in touch.</p></speech>

My remarks will be along the lines of that letter.  We are talking about the secondment of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  I had a number of confidential conversations with the CMO about his future plans.  This was in the context of our working relationship during the pandemic.  I naturally have such confidential conversations with colleagues about their personal situations from time to time and, of course, I respect confidentiality in such circumstances.  Towards the end of February, the CMO indicated to me that he was thinking of stepping down from his current role and was considering a possible role in the university sector that could make a continuing contribution to improving public health capacity in Ireland.  He proposed a secondment from the Civil Service to an academic post in a university that would enable him to use his knowledge and experience to help strengthen public health leadership in Ireland and to deepen relationships between the university sector, State agencies and international organisations in the field of public health.  As is common practice in the university sector, he envisaged that some research funding would be made available to support this work.  I was supportive of this proposal as the Covid-19 pandemic clearly illustrated the need for strengthened public health capacity not just here in Ireland, but globally, and I believed that Dr. Holohan could make a significant contribution in that regard.  </p> <p>  I contacted the Secretary General of the Department of Health, who advised me that he was dealing with the matter.  I had no further involvement as the detailed arrangements were a matter for the Department of Health.  The Department of the Taoiseach had no other involvement nor did I discuss the proposal with anyone except the Chief Medical Officer and the Secretary General of the Department of Health until there were media reports about the matter towards the end of March.</p></speech>

As I am sure he is aware, it is very important for the functioning of this committee that senior civil servants such as himself make themselves available and accept our invitations to appear.  I thank him for appearing.  When did Mr. Fraser first become involved in discussions with the CMO about his future work plans?</p></speech>

It was a fairly general conversation and I do not really remember the content other than that he was thinking of moving on.  It was a fairly brief conversation.

In fairness, this accords with what Mr. Fraser has said but, in paragraph 20, Mr. Watt says that it was in February of 2022 that the CMO entered into detailed discussions with the third level sector.  He says this followed on from initial discussions he had with the CMO in August 2021 regarding his future work plans, these involving the Secretary General to the Government and himself as Secretary General of the Department of Health.

When civil servants reach a position at the top of a Department, they traditionally stay there until retirement.  I know Mr. Fraser's circumstances and the question is not about him.  Is there a position in the country now where we must look to see what to do with very high-level and qualified civil servants if there are only seven-year terms, as there are now?  What posts would they fill afterwards or is there a public issue that must be considered?</p></speech>

We had a position where the default and almost exclusive outcome at the end of someone's term at a high level was to retire but people are now being appointed at a younger age or from outside the public service.  There are term limits and the position is now different.  It is a problem for the public service and the country because it is potentially a significant disincentive to people who want to join the public service.</p></speech>

What should we do as policymakers to ensure there is not such uncertainty about what happens to senior civil servants?  I know Mr. Fraser is going off and we wish him well in his role in London.  I know the case of Dr. Holohan, the CMO, is slightly different but it is an issue that will continue to arise.  Do we need some form of a public policy response to this?</p></speech>

There is a policy and everybody has terms of appointment that govern what happens when the term is up.  It is somewhat imprecise at the level of individuals and what they must do.  Dr. Holohan was doing this and people have to try to find something else to do.  We do not want people in a post forever and that is not good.  Neither do we want to put people in a position where they are disincentivised from serving in senior roles because they cannot plan their career.</p></speech>

As the Chairman and the previous speaker has said, it is really important that the work of these committees is not impeded or frustrated.  It is disappointing that for the first time in as long as I am member of this committee, at well over a decade, we have had to seek compellability because another Secretary General is refusing to attend this committee at this point.  Mr. Fraser is before us, however, and I welcome his comments.</p> <p>  I will go back to a question that has been asked.  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan, Mr. Fraser stated his recollection was that he, the CMO and the Secretary General at the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, did not have a meeting.</p><p>In what form was your conversation with Dr. Holohan at the end of the summer?

It just sounds like three people is one too many for a conversation like that but I could be wrong.  If you want, I will check my diary but my recollection is that I just met the CMO privately.

I am looking at the paragraph and by the way, I apologise in advance if it turns out that I did have a meeting and I just do not remember it.  I am pretty sure I met the CMO and I am quite sure I would have spoken to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, either on the phone or otherwise.  I see him quite a lot.  I just do not think there was a three-cornered meeting.  A three-cornered meeting sounds like a far more formal thing than what I recall.  I think I had a private conversation with the CMO but as I say, I apologise if it turns out that there was a meeting that slipped my mind; so be it.  I do not think that sentence says there was a meeting.  It uses "involved" as the verb and I think involved probably means telephone conversations.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt goes on to say that both "the Secretary to the Government and I indicated our strong support to facilitate and help where possible.  The understanding was that this would involve a public policy development role outside of the Department of Health.".  How was Mr. Robert Watt aware at that stage, in August 2021, that you, the Secretary General of the Government, had indicated your strong support to facilitate, where possible, this role?</p></speech>

Are you now telling us that you had a telephone conversation with Mr. Watt following your meeting with Dr. Holohan about him moving on to a position in academia at that point in time?</p></speech>

That is a far more generic sort of proposal than the proposal which I understand has given rise to the controversy, which is the secondment proposal.  I only discussed the secondment proposal, the specific one that we are now engaged in talking about, in February.</p></speech>

It goes on to say: "Both the Secretary to the Government and I indicated our strong support to facilitate and help where possible."  I want to know how Mr. Robert Watt knew what you told Dr. Tony Holohan.  Did you phone him and say that you had met Dr. Tony Holohan?</p></speech>

We were in the middle of a pandemic and we were meeting more than once a week so I could have said it then or I could have rung him; I do not know.

That language, to me, is quite familiar.  Deputy O'Callaghan spoke about civil and public servants moving on.  It is quite familiar language and it is quite generic language.  It could mean, for example, a role in the WHO or in the EU.  It could mean any number of things.</p></speech>

What Mr. Fraser says, to paraphrase his opening statement, is that he had confidential conversations with the Chief Medical Officer at an early stage last year.  Towards the end of February it was indicated he was thinking of moving on, and in March Mr. Fraser contacted the Secretary General.  Now we learn he contacted the Secretary General as far back as August of the year before work in relation to the Chief Medical Officer moving on.</p></speech>

I would point out the sentence the Deputy is quoting back to me states that he indicated he was stepping down from his current role and was considering a possible role in the university sector.  This is more specific and it happened in February.  This is what I was speaking about when I rang the Secretary General.</p></speech>

The Secretary General, who refuses to come before the committee, makes it very clear that Mr. Fraser was aware perhaps not of the complete details but much of the information at an earlier stage.  Therefore, both statements are, in a way, conflicting.  We are trying to get as much information here as we possibly can.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is, of course, the line manager of the Chief Medical Officer.  He is the head of the Department for administrative purposes.  Quite appropriately, I rang the person whose responsibility these matters were.  He told me he was dealing with it.  I did not ask him to do this or to look after it.  Other representatives, not the Deputy, have said this.  That is not what happened.  I rang the person who is responsible for these matters and he told me he was dealing with it.</p></speech>

To go back to the question, in August, February and March, and it became known at the end of March, Mr. Fraser did not mention a dicky bird to the Taoiseach that the Chief Medical Officer was thinking about moving on.  Is that right?  I do not know how many telephone conversations Mr. Fraser has with the Taoiseach, or how many WhatsApp and text messages, or meetings and informal meetings.  Not one word was mentioned to the Taoiseach during this period.</p></speech>

I cannot swear blind that I did not - but I do not think I did so - indicate at some point to the Taoiseach that he was thinking of moving on.  I could not swear blind about this from August onwards.  I am not saying I did.  In terms of conversations with the Taoiseach, I had very few conversations with him in March, far fewer than normal because the Taoiseach, for a variety of reasons, was away on official business for much of the period the Deputy is speaking about.  So no, I did not discuss it with the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

This is Circular 27/2021, which indicates the new secondment policy for services being implemented.  The first key principle is that all secondments will be temporary in nature and in general will be for a period of six months up to a maximum of five years.  As Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach, how can a secondment be open-ended given this circular that was issued and which is legally binding?</p></speech>

Those questions are as follows.  Who makes the decisions within the State?  For whom are the decisions made in the State?  There is a strong feeling among the general public that there is an inversion of the democratic authority in this State.  There is concern that the decisions are being made by unelected people without the necessary democratic oversight by the elected individuals in the State.  The second element of that question is that there is also a group of people close to Government, who may be insiders and who may have a different experience of how they are treated by comparison with the general public.  For most members of the general public who want to go for a job such as this, they need to take part in an open competition.  I do not know any member of the public who would be able to sit down and have a job designed for them personally, with a budget of this amount paid by the State.  That experience is not shared by the vast majority of people in the country.</p> <p>  There are two big questions here.  This is not the first time we have seen this in the context of the Government.  It is the latest in a long list of similar occurrences.  The Zappone affair was another example of it in recent times.  There is so much power vested in those who are unelected that many people feel what is happening makes "Yes, Prime Minister" looks like a documentary.  It is absolutely outrageous that any civil servant would refuse to appear before the committee to answer questions on their actions.  These are the elected representatives of the people who are tasked to hold the State to account.  There is no accountability when we cannot ask questions and have them responded to.</p> <p>  In Mr. Fraser's view, is this particular role unique?  Can he give another example of a similar role?</p></speech>

I am trying to explore the whole area of the secondments and will rely on his experience as a Secretary General since 2011.  I will start off where Deputies Doherty and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n finished with regard to Circular 27/2021.  It would be great if that was made available to the full committee in order that we can have a deep understanding of exactly what is in Circular 27/2021.  When Deputy Doherty asked, Mr. Fraser said it was not a legal document or one did not have to legally comply with it.  Then he said one should comply with secondments.  It outlines what a secondment should be.  Is there any oversight?  Does anybody scrutinise whether a secondment post complies with the relative circular before that secondment takes place?</p></speech>

First, it is the responsibility of the senior management of the Department to abide by the rules around secondment.  As I said to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, secondments are not bad and trying to share experience and develop people and organisations is good.  Ultimately, sometimes one needs sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All organisations are audited as well.  These things are looked at in a number of ways.  The essence of a secondment is that a person moves organisation on the same terms.  While it is good for the person concerned, it also means there is a sense he or she can come back to where he or she came from.  It is an opportunity to learn and develop rather than to leave the organisation.  That is the general reason for secondments.</p></speech>

At that point would Mr. Fraser have been aware of the time limit?  Was a secondment mentioned?  If so, what was the time limit or how long it could, potentially, have been?  Mr. Fraser said he was aware that the CMO said that he did not want to come back but what was the duration of a possible secondment? </p></speech>

On secondment, academia or international organisations, the conversation in August was of a more general nature.  It was not specific.  The issue of secondment came up in February.</p></speech>

As Deputy Doherty pointed out to me, it was a public policy development role that he was talking about.  There is a number of things that it could have been but it was not as precise as it became.  I understood that he felt that it was time to move on from being Chief Medical Officer and I think that we can all understand that is not an unreasonable thought for him to have had at the point.</p></speech>

I accept the questions Deputies and Senators have asked me about how this decision was made and what it meant.  From my point of view, I think that there is a good case for more research funding for research into pandemics, preparedness, etc.  The case for that is, in a way, separate and I know that they have been conflated.  If a particular person had left after two years, I do not believe that we would not still be providing research funding.  At least I hope that we would still be providing because funding should be provided on the merits of the topic and not due to the fact that a particular individual holds a particular post.  I do not think that is right and I do not think that is what happens either.  We do some research in the Department of the Taoiseach and it is certainly not attached to any particular official's tenure, nor should it be.</p></speech>

In terms of the possible impact on public finances, we heard that this would cost &euro;20 million over the lifetime of the secondment.  We can only deal with what could have actually happened.  Perhaps that could have changed but we must deal with this matter now.  Such a large sum would have a significant impact on public finances.  Is Mr. Fraser aware of other initiatives taken by Secretaries Generals that would have had such a potential impact on public finances where the Minister would not have been fully across the detail?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, if one is the Accounting Officer for &euro;22 billion then I am quite sure one is involved in much bigger decisions than I am.  I have a budget of between &euro;35 million and &euro;40 million with most of it being non-discretionary.  I have a small amount of funding for research, which we allocate to the shared island initiative mainly.  The Government will know about that and the Taoiseach knows about that as it is a very important issue from his point of view.</p> <p>  The overall research spending in the State is, I think, &euro;950 million by Government.  I cannot say that every single euro goes across the desk of a Minister.  There should be proper processes for allocating the money and I am sure there is but it is &euro;950 million so quite a substantial sum of money is spent every year on research.</p></speech>

The board has not met since 2016 but I understand that it was never properly wound down.  The minutes of the last meeting in 2016 indicate that its work was in some ways only beginning and there was a lot of talk about the introduction of key performance indicators for Secretaries General.  I ask Mr. Fraser to comment on the disappearance of the Civil Service Accountability Board with no real comment and to confirm whether it has concluded its work.</p></speech>

The board has not sat for quite a while.  I do not know why and cannot explain that.  It is obviously not entirely up to me.  It is no longer, I think, in the Government's policy called Civil Service Renewal.  We try to work hard on performance management for Secretaries General.  We try to have strategy statements, indicators and processes around that.</p></speech>

I ask these questions against the backdrop of health services in the country.  We are spending very valuable time at the moment investigating where the CMO was going to go, the conditions on which he was going to leave, whether he was entitled to leave, and his salary.  The question arises as to whether or not the HSE, the Department of Health or whatever else was going to make a provision for his salary in a positive way.  Is that correct?  Would that be normal?  Are there precedents for that?</p></speech>

I realise that Mr. Fraser does not have a direct role in this, but it could have been referred to him.  It was referred to him, or run past him, as they say nowadays, in the course of the events, apparently.  Well, he is well aware of the matter and agreed - or did not agree, as the case may be.  I presume he agreed.  In those circumstances, again, we are talking about a time when the health services in this country are on their knees.  There are waiting lists as long as your arm.  One of the things we tried to do in the month of January was to avail of the opportunity to rebuild the health service, and that needed a plan.  That needs the Secretary General of the Department and key people around him or her to deliver the quality and standard of service that is required.  Does Mr. Fraser agree on that?</p></speech>

We are going very close to that at present.  We are going very close to it in the Department of Health.  For example, nobody responsible, with the exception of your good self, wants to come before the committee to talk about the issue.  This is despite the fact that everybody knows there is an urgent need to deal with health service issues now and that whatever can be done needs to be done as a matter of urgency.

I am a member of the committee the same as everybody else.  I have the same rights as everybody else and I am raising the question.  I am doing so because everybody else in the country is talking about the issue of the health service at present.  We have found at every meeting of the committee for the past 12 months individuals prepared to take steps to address the issues, do something about it and prove they could do something about various issues under their remit.  We are here today after a certain length of time, heading for 1 May, and we do not seem to have a plan.  Six months of the year have gone.

I appreciate that he is busy.  All Deputies appreciate that civil servants are busy and cannot be attending numerous committees every week.  Nor can they pick and choose which committees they appear before and I thank Mr. Fraser for coming before the committee.</p><p>I asked a parliamentary question over the vacation as to whether the proposed professorship of public health strategy and leadership at Trinity College Dublin would be proceeded with and whether the Minister for Health would make a statement on the matter.  Fortuitously I received the reply last night.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The establishment of a professorship within Trinity College Dublin is a matter for the University itself as an autonomous Higher Education institution that controls its own staffing requirements and academic affairs.  The Minister for Health has no role in deciding on these matters. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Fraser might not be surprised by that reply.  Was he surprised at the fact this role was being created and at this synergy, to say the least, between the Department of Health, the Chief Medical Officer and Trinity College in developing this unique position?  Mr. Fraser clarified to Deputy Doherty what he learned and when he learned it.  Was he surprised this new role was being created in the way it was and that essentially Exchequer funding was going to be expended on the professorship, albeit indirectly, by seconding Dr. Holohan?</p></speech>

He will recall that in October 2020 there was what was perceived by some people, and some in the media, as something of a stand-off between the Government and NPHET as to whether there would or would not be another lockdown.  The T&aacute;naiste made a much-commented-on appearance on the Claire Byrne show.  Suddenly, notwithstanding this stand-off, some would say the Government caved while others would say it just accepted the public health advice, and there was a lockdown.  In December 2020 and at the start of 2021, the Government differed from the advice of NPHET and many blamed it for the fact that people socialised and so forth, as people usually do at Christmas.  Was there a feeling in the Department of the Taoiseach, or did Mr. Fraser as the most senior civil servant there discern any concern, that there was a type of erosion of the authority of democratic government or that it was somehow being challenged by NPHET, whose role ordinarily would be to advise the Government but which instead was essentially telling the Government in public what to do?  Was there any concern about that or did Mr. Fraser discern any concern in the Department of the Taoiseach about that unusual inversion of authority in a democratic state?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the Claire Byrne show.  That, in itself, illustrated a certain amount of concern.  Of course, those were tense times, but everybody was doing their best for the country.  It was an unprecedented situation and, of course, there was frustration.  I am sure there was frustration on all sides and, most particularly, for the citizens of the country who were asked to do so much in such a difficult time.  The Deputy and I both know there were emotional ups and downs, if we are in the emotion business, over the entire period.</p></speech>

I believe we would agree that he played a very prominent role.  Did Mr. Fraser ever discern a feeling in the Department that his role had become perhaps too prominent, that he was a threat to the authority of the Government and perhaps a new position had to be found for him outside of government?</p></speech>

Many people felt a greater allegiance to what he had to say, and felt that his word was that which ought to be followed rather than that of the Government.  There was huge confusion about what was law and what was guidelines.  Of course, the T&aacute;naiste fell victim to it when he attended Ms Katherine Zappone's party across the road from where Mr. Fraser works.  All of that created a lot of confusion about the authority of the State and the authority of a democratic government.  Essentially, who was in charge was not clear.  Was there any relief that this potential problem had been averted?</p></speech>

I refer to what Mr. Fraser discussed at the beginning of the meeting.  Previously, when people left or retired from the public service they usually went into retirement, but now everything has become more fluid.  People come and go in the public service and their tenure is shorter.  Politicians have a cooling-off period, and even some political advisers have a cooling-off period, whereby they cannot work for a private entity immediately after carrying out a political function because there might be a perception of a conflict of interest.  Does Mr. Fraser think it would be advisable to develop something similar for civil servants?  Some would say they, too, have a more detailed knowledge of how the State apparatus in the Administration works, something that could be very desirable in the private sector and something which could create a conflict of interest.  I am not saying that people should be prevented from continuing their careers, but that there should be a similar cooling-off period for public servants to what is there for politicians.</p></speech>

I would have to check the details for the Deputy, but his point is well made.  I believe there are such arrangements in place.  However, I am not an expert and I would have to double check.  I am a member of the Outside Appointments Board, by the way, but it does not meet very frequently.  That is one of the reasons I am not clear.</p></speech>

Is the VHI in the private or public sector?  Arguably, it is State-owned.  I am not suggesting either of them has done anything wrong or breached any rules - far from it.  However, it surprised me that there was no cooling-off period involved in their move.  That is just my personal reaction.  It strikes me that it would be beneficial if there was.  That is just one minor example that happened to coincide with Dr. Holohan's.  There are many people who were key figures in the Covid-19 response leaving the HSE, and there appears to be many people leaving together.</p> <p>  However, to revert to my question, Mr. Fraser would agree with me that procedures around this would be advisable and potentially beneficial in the public interest. </p></speech>

There is a significance in what Mr. Watt points out here, that the Secretary to the Government was told certain things.  He comments on it in his report.  I want to go back again to the circular which was spoken about here.  The circular was issued on 23 December, 2021.  It is not an old document but is a recent circular that was sent out.  Would that have been sent to every Secretary General?</p></speech>

All secondments will be temporary in nature, all secondment advertisements will be sent to the Civil Service HR division and, in general, an advertised position should be circulated to all staff.  It is very clear on the steps that one has to take.</p> <p>  Let us move then to the letter of 16 March to Professor Linda Doyle, which is a public document so I presume I can refer to it.  That proposal or letter of intent sets out the agreement to the secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan and in the second paragraph Mr. Watt writes: "I recognise that agreement is conditional on the approval of any necessary authority within the University."  I am not asking you to comment on this, Mr. Fraser.  I am setting a scene here as to where all this started.  The authority mentioned here is only the university.  The superannuation arrangements and alignment with contractual terms and conditions relating to the position of CMO is addressed by the Department of Health, is what it says here.  However, the letter of intent goes on to state clearly, under the proposed agreement, what the Department of Health commits to.  It actually commits to the secondment and to continuing to pay the salary at its existing level.  It refers to "salary terms and conditions equivalent to the position" on the date of signing of the agreement and also commits to "improvements, awards or regrading that may apply to the position of Chief Medical Officer over the course of the secondment".  It commits to making an "annual, ring-fenced allocation of &euro;2M for the duration of the secondment, to be administered through the Health Research Board, a body under the aegis of the Department of Health...".  It goes on to talk about funds to provide for Dr. Holohan's salary "until his retirement".  It asks that Trinity College would provide an office on the campus and that it would provide administrative support for the position.  That is what was stated on 16 March 2022.  All of that is what has brought us to this juncture and this examination.  Let us be clear about this.  It was advanced to a stage where the final document was to be signed at the end of March.  The letter refers to the appointment of an officer in the Department of Health to work on details "such that a final agreement is signed prior to 31 March 2022".  All of this was advanced, apparently, without any sanction from anyone except the Secretary General and it flies in the face of Circular 27/2021.</p><p>That is the backdrop to this.  Questions have been asked about the remit of committees.  It has been suggested Circular 27/2021 does not define the involvement and role of this committee clearly; it does.  I am saying that because I am moving now to the recent happenings.  In the public arena we have been fed a diet of smoke and mirrors, obfuscation, spin and a determined effort by Government to cloud the issues here.  The issues are clear.  They were set out on 16 March.  They are set out in the document dated 21 December.  It is quite clear that there is an issue here that should be dealt with by this committee.<br/><br/>On 12 April 2022, the Secretaries General were asked for information.  They were told about the invitation.  On 13 April 2022, Ministers were informed.  They were advised that they might need to appear depending on what might be said by the three Secretaries General, Mr. Fraser being one of them and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform being another.  There is an apology there; the Secretary General is not available which is fine.  Then there is Mr. Watt.  They were the three.  We then asked for information just to inform the committee to put us into a position where we clearly understood what was going on, our role within what was going on and our oversight role as a committee.  To say that some showed utter contempt for what was going on is an understatement.  Deadlines were not met.  Information was not given.  Requests for further information were not acknowledged.  Telephone calls from the secretariat here were not returned.  I think that shows an awful example to those at a junior level within the Civil Service where they should be seeing exemplary conduct from Secretaries General.<br/><br/>I now turn to the political situation and comments that were made before I get back to Mr. Watt's letter of last night at 8 o'clock.  It is regrettable that the Taoiseach used the words he did because this committee - I am sure it is the same for every other committee of the House - is about its business.  It is about accountability and transparency, and bringing before the committee various witnesses depending on the subject matter and doing it in a constructive, courteous fashion, getting to the truth of the matter.  It would seem that there is no appetite in Government to get to the truth of this matter.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach has suggested that we should wait until the independent report is completed following due process at which point we can get the report and discuss it.  That stands in stark contrast to the treatment of a Minister who asked for due process but was sacked.  If that does not show double standards, I do not know what does.  Therefore, the committee has a remit.  It must answer the questions from the public in the context of the belief that there is a senior cabal of politicians and civil servants who are ignoring the due process, ignoring the Oireachtas committees and just doing as they please.<br/><br/>Last night's letter from Mr. Watt to the committee as usual provides a lot of packing.  There is a lot of stuff in there, some of it irrelevant.  He states: &quot;I have answered questions on these matters at the Health Committee and I do not believe it is reasonable for me to be asked to attend a different sectoral Committee to answer questions on the same issue.&quot;  He is not being asked to answer questions on the same issues.  He is being asked to address the issues that are of public interest and of concern to the people of Ireland.  He is being asked by a parliamentary committee, taking its task responsibly.  He has been asked to appear before it to clarify matters.  The circular letter puts him right in the frame to be asked to attend this meeting.  <br/><br/>That answers that part of his letter.  This is not personal.  I just need to do my job as Chairman.  It has been made seriously difficult by the attitude of Ministers, the Taoiseach and senior civil servants.  He states:</p><blockquote>	I understand that it has been practice for some time now that one committee should look at each particular issue under its terms of reference rather than duplicate examinations of issues.  I'm sure you would agree this is neither in the public interest, nor is it efficient use of members' or public servants' time. </blockquote><p>I put it to Mr. Fraser that he has eaten up an enormous amount of this committee's time and indeed the time of the clerk and the people who serve this committee by not answering letters, by not giving information and by having everyone here chasing after the information not being responded to and the numerous telephone calls that are not returned.  There is no dispute between the health committee and the finance committee.  There is a clear line of responsibility for both committees.  I would suggest, as I said earlier, all of it is contained not only in that circular, but in the title of the committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  If ever we needed to look at public expenditure in this case, and reform, by God we need to do it now.<br/><br/>A politician cannot go anywhere publicly without someone pointing out the disgraceful behaviour of some politicians and some civil servants.  I wonder if this attitude gave rise to the decision by those in the HSE, whom the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, wanted to meet, not to meet her.<br/><br/>Mr. Watt's letter continued:</p><blockquote>	I hope that we can carry out our respective duties in a respectful and courteous manner&hellip; issues that arise in a professional, factual, and policy focused manner, without unnecessary and distracting personal commentary. </blockquote><p>None of this is distracting commentary.  None of this is personal.  None of this is outside the realms of being courteous to everyone.  I find it a shocking state of affairs that this committee has to sit like this and work its way through nonsense and through all the misinformation and spin in order to try to get to the truth.<br/><br/>I go back then to the report from Mr. Watt to the Taoiseach.  I hope the Taoiseach and his officials will ponder on what has been said at this committee.  Point No. 20 in his submission states:</p><blockquote>	This involved the Secretary to the Government and myself as Secretary General of the Department of Health.  [That implicates Mr. Fraser.] ...  the CMO has an outstanding record of public service on behalf of the Irish State.  Both the Secretary to the Government and I indicated our strong support to facilitate and help where possible. </blockquote><p>Again, he refers to Mr. Fraser as Secretary to the Government.  The report also states:</p><blockquote>	In early March, the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed open ended secondment arrangements... </blockquote><p>The circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which I refer to again, has other things to say about that.  He then commits the research board: &quot;...with details to be agreed between all three parties.  It was never envisaged that this salary would be paid directly on the Vote of the Department of Health.&quot;<br/><br/>Yet it would be seen to be paid from an agency under the remit of the Department of Health.<br/><br/>Point No. 43 refers to &quot;the Public Service Management Act 1997, which stipulates that the administration of Government Departments is a matter for Secretaries General&quot;, and I do not dispute that.  He is not a lone ranger, however.  He is a manager within a system that is accountable to the people through Oireachtas committees, and he should be accountable to the Government, if it is interested at all, particularly given the sums of money involved.<br/><br/>In point No. 44, Mr. Watt indicates:</p><blockquote>	It also has been suggested that the Taoiseach and other members of the Government were &quot;kept in the dark&quot;.  The Secretary to the Government was aware of the proposed secondment move (but not of course the precise details) and I understood that the fact of discussions regarding the CMO's future plans were known in the Department of An Taoiseach.  I assumed that key decision-makers were aware of the proposal but of course not the precise details. [...]  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and asked me to confirm that I was working on the details.  I confirmed &quot;yes&quot;.  I inferred from this that this had political support in Government Buildings. </blockquote><p>Everyone seems to be running a mile from that one.<br/><br/>In point No. 56, Mr. Watt states:</p><blockquote>	...it is disappointing that some commentary alleges erroneously that I failed to keep the Minister appropriately informed.  The Minister was informed of the proposal for Dr. Holohan to take up a professorship at TCD in advance of the announcement and was supportive. </blockquote><p>I wonder if the advance announcement the night before was his way of informing the Minister, as he did with us last night at 8 p.m., sending us the email that he sent.<br/><br/>This brings me to the final point.  After all that, the committee was available to Mr. Watt and others such as the Minister to come before it.  It is a two-way street here and people get the chance to clarify their positions.  They get a chance to put the facts before the general public because it is a public meeting.  We all get the chance to learn from mistakes because nobody gets it right all the time.<br/><br/>We are now faced with the investigation to bring what the terms of reference refer to as &quot;learnings&quot; from this.  It has been a debacle from start to finish and it has cast a shadow on Dr. Tony Holohan, for whom I have the greatest respect.  Even the commentary over the past few days in the D&aacute;il has been nothing short of an attempt to cloud the matter, as I said earlier.  I find it truly shocking that senior politicians and civil servants do not see beyond the position they are currently holding and cannot understand that the public is furious about what is going on.  It is not so much about Dr. Holohan but the carry-on of Ministers, comments of senior civil servants and particularly the misleading commentary put to the D&aacute;il by the Taoiseach when he speaks about a &quot;witch hunt&quot; in three committees taking this up and his referring to what should or should not happen.  I made the point that this committee certainly has a remit to be involved.  I ask for Mr. Watt to reconsider his position on attending before this committee.  I ask the Taoiseach and the two Ministers to consider their position on attending before this committee and giving clarity not to me but to this forum as a committee of Parliament with representatives of the public.  I ask that this be done sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>If Mr. Fraser wishes to clarify any point, he should please do so now.  I acknowledge that this is not the first time he has come before this committee when others would not, and I respect him for that.  It is a pity others do not take his example and attend committee meetings when they are asked to do so.</p></speech>

I hoped the Civil Service could have been left behind well reformed and with its members attuned to attending committee meetings but maybe we have a little more work to do on that.  As I mentioned, I recognise Mr. Fraser's input to this meeting.  I will leave it at that unless any other member wishes to come in.  If they do not, we will leave it.  It is unfinished work and as Bertie said, there is a lot done, more to do.  There is certainly much transparency and accountability required.

From the National Women's Council, I welcome Ms Orla O'Connor, director, and Ms Alana Ryan, women's health co-ordinator; and from the Irish Family Planning Association, Ms Maeve Taylor, director of advocacy and communications, Ms Alison Spillane, senior policy and research officer, and Dr. Caitriona Henchion, medical director.  They are all very welcome to our meeting this morning.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I call on Ms O'Connor to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity.  As the committee knows, the National Women's Council is the leading national women's membership organisation, with more than 190 members.  We also convene and chair the Abortion Working Group, a collective of more than 20 civil society organisations and healthcare providers, which was established in 2019.  We collectively submitted to the abortion review as we believe that significant legal changes and practice improvements are required if the health Act is to guarantee equitable, accessible and legal abortion for all women and pregnant people who need it.</p> <p>  We want to take this opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the significant positive change the introduction of abortion in Ireland has brought to women's reproductive rights and to women's lives.  We are at a critical moment now where we can fully realise the overwhelming vote of the Irish public to enable access for all women who need abortions.  As time is limited, I will focus on three key challenges that we believe must be addressed.  The first is the restrictive legal framework.  The second is the national coverage, and the third relates to data collection.</p> <p>  In terms of the restrictive legal framework, instead of creating an enabling legal framework, the law acts as a gatekeeper creating a series of obstacles that prevent access to abortion, disproportionately affecting the most marginalised.  The World Health Organization's 2022 guidance recommends against laws that prohibit abortion based on gestational age limits and is clear that gestational age limits are not evidence-based.  Legal limits are contrary to the ideal model of patient-centred care whereby medical needs are met in line with clinical best practice and patient preferences.  Our strict 12-week window, which is actually just ten weeks from conception, is particularly challenging if you have irregular periods or need to undergo an ultrasound scan, and then in addition there is the mandatory three-day wait.  As with all rigid frameworks, it is women who are the most vulnerable who are impacted the most.  For example, adolescents, disabled women and pregnant people and women in situations of domestic violence who may not have freedom to leave the house.</p> <p>  In addition, the 28-day mortality clause for fatal foetal anomalies is also very problematic.  This clause means doctors are unable to provide abortion care in cases where the life expectancy for the foetus after birth is short, but may not be as short as 28 days.  This has caused significant challenges for doctors in determining eligibility, as well as huge heartbreak for women and families.  We are particularly concerned that the proportion of Irish residents travelling to the UK on these grounds has significantly increased, accounting for a third of all those who had to travel in 2020.  Analysis of the data suggests that the 28-day clause has created a two-tier system whereby for every three women deemed eligible for care here, two are forced to travel to the UK.  We must be clear that rigid gestational limits, mandatory waiting periods and narrow foetal mortality clauses, all serve to impede the ability of doctors to provide urgent care when required, while also placing additional stress on women and pregnant people during a challenging and stressful time.</p> <p>  Furthermore, under the terms of the Act, a doctor who provides abortion outside the specific circumstances laid out in the law may face a prison sentence of up to 14 years.</p><p>This means health professionals, under the threat of prosecution and criminalisation, are essentially forced to police themselves, determining when and whether the statutory criteria for access to care have been met.  That is why we are recommending that abortion be available on request up to viability to ensure that no woman or pregnant person is forced to travel abroad for essential reproductive healthcare.  We recommend the removal of the three-day wait period and the full decriminalisation of abortion care in line with the WHO guidance.</p><p> I will now turn to the national coverage.  At present, just one in ten general practitioners, GPs, are providing abortion services in Ireland and, concerningly, the pool of GPs registered with My Options who provide care to the general public is even fewer than this at just 7% of the overall GP population.  Data shared with the National Women's Council by the HSE in March 2022 show that half of counties have fewer than ten GPs offering the service currently; in some counties it could be as low as one GP per county as the data were provided in a zero to ten range rather than the total number.  Indeed, only four out of 26 counties have a well-developed community network of providers - Dublin, Cork, Galway and Wicklow.  Although abortion providers are very committed, limited coverage is therefore a significant barrier to access.  The reality of poor nationwide coverage coupled with the two-appointment requirement is a heightened burden on women and pregnant people, particularly the disabled community.</p><p> GPs have highlighted the threat of anti-abortion activities as one of the biggest impediments to new providers coming on board.  As such, it is difficult to disentangle the urgent need for safe access zones legislation from the issue of poor geographical coverage.  We are recommending that to address regional barriers to access, there must be focused efforts to improve community and hospital coverage.  Adequate early abortion care should be understood as a core part of our primary care services.  If it needs additional resources from the HSE, they should be provided as required.  Maternity hospitals must also be mandated to provide the service in line with the law.  Where necessary, new medical appointments should be fast-tracked to address any gaps in service provision and the necessary resources should be made available to address the infrastructure challenges.  Safe access zones legislation must be introduced to give healthcare staff assurance that in stepping up to provide this vital service they will be protected from harassment and intimidation.</p><p> Turning to the issue of data collection, we are concerned that the very low number of providers in community and hospital settings is reflective of silent refusal to provide abortion care, which is not being monitored or recorded appropriately and which is impacting on the effective operation of the Act.  Ensuring that conscience-based refusal of care does not hinder access to essential reproductive health services requires a clear, legal and policy framework and this must be urgently developed.  Medical providers should be obliged to record refusals of care on the grounds of conscience and detail the service to which they referred the woman or pregnant person.  We believe enhanced data collection is key for mitigating risks and barriers to service users.  As the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Ireland stated, abortion is "a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible.  The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person&rsquo;s life, health, and well-being.&rdquo;  We recommend expanding the current publicly available abortion data set to include wait times, recording of refusal of care and referral onwards.  Conscience-based refusals to provide care should be monitored by the Irish Medical Council to ensure compliance, and failures to adhere to guidelines regarding swift referrals should lead to sanctions.</p><p> The repeal campaign that led to the landslide "Yes" victory for removal of the eighth amendment from the Constitution was one of the most important social movements in our history for Irish women.  The message was clear - all women should be able to access healthcare at home with their doctors and make decisions regarding their care needs.  That is why we believe the review of the legislation is such a critical moment to deliver on the referendum and to deliver to women the reproductive rights they need.</p></speech>

The Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, is a specialist provider of early abortion care, contraception, specialist pregnancy counselling and other healthcare services.  We have advocated for sexual and reproductive health and rights since our foundation in 1969.  The last time we addressed an Oireachtas committee on abortion, it was to call for the introduction of abortion services.  To be here today to discuss the review of those services feels genuinely historic.<br/><br/>The review clause in the 2018 Act is a wise and prescient measure.  We have insights now from the provision of abortion care that were simply not available in 2018.  There are two key insights.  First, the Act has been transformative for reproductive rights in Ireland and abortion provision is now an established social good.  Second, significant challenges arise for the operation of services from the interaction of the legal framework, health system challenges and pervasive abortion stigma.<br/><br/>To start with the positives, the availability of services to terminate pregnancies and the public funding of those services unambiguously signal that abortion is essential healthcare.  The law provides for access to abortion on request.  Nobody who seeks early abortion care is required to explain or justify the decision about the pregnancy.  We know from our clinics and our pregnancy counselling service how important this is to service users.  The protection in law of these principles is a real strength of the Act.  Moreover, the model of care is working well for those who can access it.  The availability of abortion care within mainstream, local healthcare and without cost helps reduce the stress of unintended pregnancy and the stigma associated with abortion.  In principle, women can choose their provider.  They can opt for a specialist reproductive healthcare centre, such as the IFPA, attend their regular GP or find a GP through My Options.  The introduction of telemedicine has broadened women&rsquo;s access to essential, time-sensitive healthcare in very important ways.  Critical additional supports, including specialist pregnancy counselling and a 24-7 medical helpline, are also available without cost and are funded by the HSE.<br/><br/>However, there are problems.  The Act is modelled on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  This was a restrictive, criminal statute.  That framing gets in the way of access and choice.  Outside sections 9 to 12, inclusive, abortion is subject to prosecution and to harsh punishment on conviction.  Criminalisation of abortion relegates it to the margins of healthcare.  The European Court of Human Rights recognised this in the A, B and C<i>v</i>. Ireland case.  Criminal laws, even when they are not aggressively enforced, create a chilling effect on healthcare providers.  Section 23, the criminal provision, fosters stigma towards the conscientiously committed providers of abortion care and can discourage others from providing abortion.  Furthermore, while the right of healthcare practitioners to deny care on grounds of individual beliefs is recognised as conscientious objection, this implies, very erroneously, that only those who refuse care, but not those who provide it or access it, act with conscience.<br/><br/>The Act is far too restrictive.  The IFPA knows from our services that the vast majority of people who present for abortion care have thought through their personal circumstances, assessed the supports available to them and made a clear decision.  However, section 12 requires that they must first see a doctor and then wait three days.  Therefore, in fact, the gestation limit is eleven and a half weeks.  The waiting period implies distrust of women's capacity to make rational decisions in pregnancy.  It forces doctors to impose delay for no reason related to women's health, even when that delay pushes a woman past her gestation limit.  Most women and girls availing of abortion in Ireland do so well before 12 weeks of pregnancy.  However, crisis in pregnancy cannot be neatly confined to the first trimester.  The IFPA&rsquo;s experience is that the burdens of the 12-week limit disproportionately affect the young, the vulnerable, the marginalised and the disadvantaged.  After 12 weeks, access is narrowly restricted to grounds of health and fatal foetal anomaly.  This is exclusionary.  We know from our counselling services how traumatising this is for those who are excluded.<br/><br/>We also recommend that Ireland follow the recommendations of the WHO in its abortion care guideline, which calls for decriminalisation of abortion in all circumstances.  It recommends that instead of the imposition of mandatory waiting periods, grounds and gestational age limits in laws, access to abortion should be on request.  This would mean aligning service availability with the best interests of women and girls, rather than organising this part of the healthcare system around restrictive provisions.<br/><br/>We also have some other concerns, and I will not repeat some that have been mentioned by our colleague from the National Women's Council.</p><p>One issue we are concerned about is choice of method.  Abortion can be provided through either medical or non-invasive surgical methods.  However in Ireland most women are only offered one method which is home self-management of medical abortion.  This suits most women but not everyone has a suitable home environment and those who do not have a home that is suitable for self-management of care are not eligible for referral to hospital on those specific socioeconomic grounds.  The IFPA provides care to undocumented service users.  Currently, there is a lack of clear arrangements for reimbursement.  This is problematic.  The IFPA is absorbing those costs but this is not sustainable.  We are in discussions with the HSE about this and we hope this will be resolved.</p><p> These inequities in the operation of abortion services must be addressed.  Following the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 we believe the Oireachtas must address the flaws in the legislation and align the law with international best practice and human rights standards.  Moving into the future, the Oireachtas must identify health systems measures to institutionalise the current strength of the service and ensure excellence, leadership, innovation and sustainability into the future.  We should have a model of an excellent abortion care service in Ireland.  We believe the Oireachtas should continue to monitor the operation of abortion care in Ireland to ensure it is equitable, is of high quality and is available, accessible and acceptable to all who need it.  </p></speech>

I wish to deal with the issue in regard to section 11 of the Act dealing with fatal foetal anomalies.  The witnesses referred to the 28-day rule.  I have spoken to medical practitioners who have also raised concerns about this.  The witnesses&rsquo; view is that this section of the Act should be removed or the Act should be amended to take out this 28-day time limit.  It is obviously putting many restrictions on medical practitioners.  The witnesses referred to the issue in regard to the Act where a medical practitioner can be prosecuted for making a decision which does not comply with the legislation.  Do they believe the 28-day rule is a huge restriction in regard to decisions being made?  Is it only a small number?  No matter what number it is, even if it is only one a year, it is one too many.  Do they believe this restriction resulted in people being forced to travel?  Is there any evidence of people being forced to travel in regard to that?</p></speech>

This was certainly one of the issues that people believed would be solved by the referendum, and that people in that dreadful situation of fatal foetal anomaly would not be in a situation of having to travel and all the trauma that goes with that.  This really is a critical one, irrespective of the numbers.  I might ask Ms Ryan to go through the numbers given that this is affecting an important number of people.  I cannot stress enough how important this is for those families and couples in that situation and just how difficult that 28-day rule has made things for them.</p></speech>

Where the person has been refused a termination, there is a review panel.  I was contacted by one medical practitioner who advised me that they are not aware of the existence of the review panel even though it is provided for under section 11.  What is the witnesses' understanding about the review panel?  Is it in existence?  Who is it made up of?</p></speech>

While the right to appeal is there, and that avenue exists, it is not accessible and it means that when you are up against a very tight time limit, particularly if you know that you most likely have to seek care in England where there are also limits, you are most likely going to travel because you would be worried that if you delayed and continued down the route of trying to appeal a decision in Ireland, you might end up being ineligible here.  Then you would be in a terrible situation where you might have lost your ability to travel to access the care elsewhere and you would have been denied it at home.</p></speech>

As to whether the review panel is functional and meeting the needs of families, I cannot speak to that.  I have heard that the operation of section 11 is very restrictive because ultimately it is hard in these cases to say with certainty whether the foetus will survive for less than 28 days.</p></speech>

It appears that this review process is really not working in practice.  There is a requirement under section 18 for the HSE to report annually on the number of reviews sought and carried out under this mechanism.  In year one of the provision, 2019, no reviews were sought.  In year two, only two reviews were sought, one of which was successful and one of which was not.  It appears that this review process is not functioning.  I think that speaks to what the Deputy is hearing on the ground that practitioners are actually not aware of these structures and mechanisms.</p> <p>  If I could add one more point in terms of the operation of section 11, there is important research coming out of University College Cork by Professor Keelin O&rsquo;Donoghue and Dr. Stacey Power Walsh.  It would be useful for the committee to hear from foetal medicine specialists who are providing care under this section.  What they have done is they conducted qualitative research with foetal medicine specialists throughout the country about the operation of the Act.  These practitioners describe the Act as difficult and restrictive and the combination of the language and that definition in section 11 with the criminal provision means that practitioners fear getting a diagnosis wrong due to criminal liability and media scrutiny.  There is a great deal of fear around the operation of this section.</p></speech>

It appears under documents laid in the Houses of the Oireachtas but it does not appear to be published anywhere on the HSE or the Department of Health websites.

The waiting period is not related to women's health, yet doctors are forced to require women to wait for three days regardless of their circumstances.  Most women have made their decision, present to their doctors clearly about the decision they have made and have assessed their circumstances.  The WHO's guideline is clear that mandatory waiting periods demean women and are unrelated to health.</p><p> A wider point that we would make about the law is that, since it is based on a criminal statute, it has a tendency towards disapproval of abortion care.  There is an exception under sections 9 to 12, inclusive.  This weighs heavily on providers and is not something that is present in consultations with patients in other cases.  We believe that a significant improvement to the Act could be a set of overarching guiding principles that establish that access is based on human rights principles of reproductive health, centring the Act around access rather than it being built out from a criminal provision.</p></speech>

There is a proper informed consent process in any procedure, and medical abortion would be considered such a procedure.  A doctor has to go through clearly with the person all of the adverse effects, risks, benefits and everything else involved.  The doctor also has to establish that the person is certain about going through with it.  In a proper consent process, anyone who is not certain or ready to proceed is immediately identified.  Obviously, the person will not go ahead at that time and may say that he or she needs a little more time.  This often happens with many procedures, yet we are not relying on the law to make them take that time.  Rather, we are relying on good clinical skills to identify these situations and communicate well enough to ensure that people understand that they have extra time.  In no consultation do we speak as much about the law as we do in abortion consultations.  We never bring it into any other consent process.  The only other time that the law might come into a consultation would be when dealing with minors, where a doctor might have to apprise them of his or her responsibilities in terms of reporting.</p> <p>  The thing about speaking about the law in abortion consultations is that one becomes used to doing it and almost forgets that it is not a medical part of the consultation.  A doctor has to advise people because they have to understand that there is a 12-week limit, which means that, if the procedure has not worked, they have to figure out what they are going to do quickly because, if they do not, they may find themselves beyond 12 weeks, still pregnant and having taken medication that could cause harmful effects to that pregnancy.  The law is an ever-present part of these consultations in a way that is not related to the medical practice side.</p></speech>

Has the IFPA come across evidence of this?  What needs to be changed?  The whole idea was that people would have the necessary level of care in Ireland as opposed to needing to travel abroad, but people are travelling abroad and there is no follow-up care or structure available here.</p></speech>

When we identify someone attending us who is going to fall outside the legislative conditions and will have to travel, we ensure that there is a catch-all so that we follow up with her from a mental health perspective as well as to offer a physical check-up afterwards.  In the HSE model of care, that follow-up medical care is reimbursable.  Many people might not be aware of this, so it needs to be more widely known.  We are careful to try to bring those people back and ensure that they get whatever follow-up care is required, but it might not happen widely.</p> <p>  As Ms Taylor mentioned, if people are in the small minority who find themselves having to travel, particularly if it is just because they narrowly missed a gestational limit or their foetal anomalies were not considered severe enough, they are more stigmatised than people who had to travel ever were, as they are in this group that is considered not worthy of care here.  They may be less likely to seek aftercare because they feel like they are in that very marginalised position.</p></speech>

I thank them for their work in this area.</p> <p>  It is clear from the import of both presentations that women are still travelling for abortion services.  Perhaps I will start with the IFPA, whose representatives said that this was a minority of women, but there are still women travelling.  Are there data on the number of women travelling abroad?</p></speech>

Every year, the Department of Health and Social Care in England and Wales publish an annual statistical report.  In 2019, it recorded 375 women who gave Irish addresses.  In 2020, 194 women and girls gave Irish addresses.  Almost 200 women travelled during a pandemic to access essential healthcare, enduring all of the financial, physical and emotional burdens of travelling for a health procedure.  We do not have the 2021 statistics yet, as they are published in June of each year.</p> <p>  In addition to what Dr. Henchion said about what these women endure in terms of stigma and ostracisation in the health system, a key issue is that this safety valve that Ireland has used for abortion care for decades is insecure because abortion services in England and Wales are under pressure.  Some of our clients, particularly those in specialist pregnancy counselling services who are travelling, are waiting weeks before they can get appointments at clinics in England and Wales.  We cannot rely on other countries to provide this healthcare.  It must be provided within the Irish health system.  We need to stop ostracising and stigmatising these women and families.</p></speech>

I will probably not get to ask all of my questions, given that there are many that I wish to ask, so I will focus on the opening statement of the National Women's Council and some of the data presented on poor national coverage, which were shocking in and of themselves.  Am I correct in saying that the data that Ms O'Connor presented were data that the National Women's Council received directly from the HSE?</p></speech>

That is shocking.  I thought it would have been much more than that.  Only 7% of GPs who provide care to the general public are registered with the My Options service.  That is even less than 10%.  Half of counties have fewer than ten GPs offering the service, but that is not the worst of it, given that there is a range.  As Ms O'Connor pointed out, the figure could be as low as one GP in some counties.  Before I ask about the reason for this, perhaps she could speak about its impact, particularly in rural areas but also in some urban areas.  If women have difficulty in accessing abortion services through GPs, what impact does that have on the women and their ability to go on to access full services?</p></speech>

For example, there are difficulties in rural areas in just being able to get to services physically because of public transport, the small number of providers, finding out who is providing abortion care and having to make those journeys at a stressful and challenging time.  There are also compounded issues for particular groups of women.</p><p>That is why the abortion working group has highlighted that all the things we and the IFPA are talking about today concerning barriers are made much more difficult, for example, for a disabled woman trying to access a service.  It is made much harder for different groups of women, such as women experiencing domestic violence.  These barriers to access make it much harder for those groups of people and we wish to highlight this aspect to the committee today.  As was pointed out, even the data we have, because they are in ranges of zero to ten - we do not have actual figures - means we are talking about people who must travel long distances to be able to access services and, as I said, find out where those services are.  That is not acceptable for what is not only a key and essential healthcare service, but also one that must be provided in a timely fashion because of its nature.</p></speech>

I support the recommendation that medical providers should be obliged to record refusals of care on the grounds of conscience and to detail the services they refer women and pregnant people to.  That is important.  As much data as it is possible to record  should be recorded, because that will inform us about this aspect.  It should not only inform this review itself, but ongoing reviews of service provision.</p> <p>  The NWCI's opening statement goes on to outline the importance of supports from local maternity hospitals for GPs.  This is an important point.  We also know that not all maternity hospitals are providing abortion services.  My understanding is that the Act itself allows for individual clinicians to conscientiously object but not for institutions to do so.  Would it be the NWCI's view that there is the possibility that some maternity hospitals are institutionally not providing the service, or is this coming down to individuals?  I ask that because I wonder how some maternity hospitals could not be providing any services.  I would like a comment on that aspect first.</p></speech>

In certain hospitals, the lead gynaecologist may be a conscience-based refuser.  There are also issues, however, regarding theatre space and practical measures which the hospitals are not equipped for now.  That has been uncovered by the WHO research report.  Therefore, a combination of factors is involved.  There are probably members of staff who are within their rights to object to providing the service, but then there are also practical and structural issues involving the scheduling of abortions, and particularly surgical abortions.  Hospital-based care is received after ten weeks, usually in the context of medical abortions, but further along, however, it will become a surgical abortion.  Equally, our stance is that service users should always have the preference regarding whether they would like a surgical abortion or a medical abortion.  In practice, however, the theatre space does not always exist.  That would-----</p></speech>

It may well be that capacity issues are at work here.  Where those exist, they must be addressed, and it is for the Minister for Health and the Department to do that.  What I am hearing from the NWCI's opening statement, though, is that only one in ten GPs is providing services, and not all maternity services.  We also do not have sufficient linkages between GPs and maternity services, if some maternity hospitals are not providing the service.  Therefore, that means there will be delayed access for some women.  This is the problem.  We must deal with the capacity issues, but if other factors are at work, whether institutional or otherwise, preventing any maternity hospital from providing these services, then that is not on.  The provision of these services is provided for under law.</p> <p>  Returning to the opening statement from the IFPA, much of what was dealt with in that, and I do not disagree with it, concerned the restrictive nature of the Act itself, its limitations and the consequent limitations it puts on women accessing services.  A review is under way and we had a lengthy discussion with the Minister for Health regarding its nature and extent.  There is a concern regarding how extensive the review will be and whether it will lead to recommendations for legislative changes.  We must wait and see.  Given the IFPA's opening statement, and what we heard in the opening statement of the NWCI, will it be a failure of the review process itself if it does not recommend legislative changes?</p></speech>

For example, and as was mentioned, the legislative framework is creating barriers regarding conscientious objection.  It privileges refusal as the only exercise of conscience and this can play into the wider &ldquo;abortion ecosystem&rdquo;, to use that phrase.  I refer to a situation where there is a separation between providers and non-providers and where the exercise of refusal is privileged.  Those-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#E00700"><p>Yes, and in our view, the two are inseparable.  We cannot simply separate out operational issues as if the legislative framework did not impact them.  The review was included in the Act to draw on the knowledge gained over three years and to look carefully at whether the Act is delivering for the women who need care.  One thing we have learned from the operation of the Act over three years is that those now excluded from care are excluded and stigmatised in particular ways.  Prior to legal abortion, all women who needed abortion care and who had to organise their own care were stigmatised and excluded.  Many were not aware of the supports available under law, such as specialised pregnancy counselling.</p> <p>  Now we have a situation where a small number of people are excluded from what is mainstream healthcare.  I refer to the harm being done to those people from being denied something available from GPs.  This is happening in the context where the law is specifying certain people cannot avail of the service because of the existence of a waiting period, even though the pregnancy concerned is less than 12 weeks.  It means people will just miss the cut-off limit because of the waiting period included in the legislation for no reason related to women&rsquo;s health.  Therefore, it would make absolutely no sense to consider the operational issues without looking at the impact of the law on them.  Dr. Henchion has been clear regarding a situation where, unlike any other healthcare procedure, the law is in the room and in the consultation.  We never talk about the law as much in other contexts.  Therefore, returning to the question of the review not addressing this aspect, it can certainly address things on the fringes but we must also look at the overall picture and the impact of the law in this regard.</p></speech>

I also thank them all for their work over the years.  It is a historic moment for them to be here with the committee not discussing whether women should be able to access healthcare, but how we can improve that healthcare for women in Ireland.  The review was much discussed during the campaign.  Those of us involved in the campaign always stressed the need to have our services based on Irish data and best practice for the Irish experience.  Therefore, it is right and proper that we are here discussing this aspect today and that we are having the review.  I have several questions, and the representatives of the IFPA would be best placed to answer the first.  What kinds of challenges do they see in practice with the 12-week limit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.747" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#E01100"><p>There are a few different challenges.  Without harping on this point too much, but to return to this issue again, the first concerns the three-day waiting period.  We have had women in this situation.  It tends to occur in the context of bank holidays and similar periods, when women present within the 12-week limit, but in situations where they are close to the end of those 12 weeks.  The need to refer them to hospital means that we cannot get them an appointment before their 12-weeks are up.  Even though they have presented to us within the terms of the legal framework, it is still difficult even within that time, plus the three days.  The three days themselves might just put these women over the limit.  This gives rise to situations where it is necessary to have a discussion with somebody to say that if I had been able to do what was required yesterday, it would have been fine, but it is not today.</p><p>That is a really difficult conversation to have with somebody for whom the consequences are going to be financial, social and very difficult.</p><p> The other thing where the 12 weeks really come into play, and I referred to this earlier, is with regard to the people who might have a failed termination.  The risk of failure with medical abortion is between 1% and 2%, depending on gestation.  That is a significant number of women, and we see it.  In the community, we would see people up to nine weeks plus six days, and from then onwards they need to go to hospital.  If we have seen somebody at nine weeks plus, and it is two or two and a half weeks before she can do a pregnancy test to check that it has been successful, she is pretty much at 12 weeks at that stage and if it has failed, she has to travel.  We have given her medication that is potentially teratogenic, which means it could cause harmful foetal anomalies.  We are now telling women they have to travel to continue this treatment.  We are not giving any flexibility to continue that treatment for that person where it has failed.</p><p> Those would be two biggest areas, the people who have narrowly missed it and the people who have had a failed termination.  Again, with regard to the people who narrowly miss it, we would have dealt with people who have had contraceptive failure, the failure of a contraceptive that would stop them having periods.  It is not that surprising that they did not realise they were pregnant on time, because the contraception they were using was causing them to have no periods.  It will take longer for those women to recognise they are pregnant.  There are also women who, due to physiological reasons or medical conditions such as polycystic ovaries, only have two, three or four periods per year.  It will take them longer to discover that they are pregnant than somebody who has a very regular cycle.  The 12 weeks can be very difficult for some people to recognise on time.  It is very difficult if people are just beyond it and it really comes into play, big time, when it comes to the risk of failed termination.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.750" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alison Spillane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#F00300"><p>It varies.  Across Europe, access-on-request provisions tend to be around the 12-week to 14-week mark.  The important thing there is that many of these laws are quite old.  Ireland was significantly behind the times in reforming its Constitution to allow for abortion access.  Many countries across Europe introduced abortion laws in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when less was known about abortion care.  Certainly, at that point early medical abortion did not exist.  Laws generally tend to allow for a period of on-request or on broad socioeconomic grounds and then more restrictive grounds thereafter.  However, it is important to look at what is emerging from the World Health Organization.  Just last month, the WHO published its abortion care guideline.  It has assessed global evidence and clinical best practice with respect to abortion and it has come up with important recommendations about the way the law relating to abortion should function.  One is that abortion should always be decriminalised in all circumstances.  Another is that mandatory waiting periods and gestation limits function as barriers to access and they should not be included in law.</p> <p>  From our perspective, this review is an opportunity to think about the role of law in this area of healthcare.  As Dr. Henchion outlined, the fact the 2018 Act is a criminal statute means it sits in the consultation room between a patient and a doctor in a very negative way.  It hangs over consultations as a ticking clock.  Further along, when one looks at cases of foetal anomaly or risk to health, the potential criminalisation hangs over medical practitioners.  The law should function as an enabling tool, a tool that provides the framework that articulates the rights of people who are entitled to access care and the duties on the State to provide and organise services in a manner whereby they are accessible to all.</p></speech>

First, it depends on the environment in which one is working.  The IFPA has a number of doctors and nurses, we have our specialist counselling team and we are providing this care, so we have a network of supportive people set up.  We have colleagues to whom we can turn to discuss cases, we have colleagues with whom we can discuss anything that is difficult and we have our counselling team for women who are in a lot of distress or have additional needs.  That could be women suffering in domestic violence situations, women with disabilities or women with difficulties with travel.  For all those things we have a support network in place.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, it is almost unconscious that it is sitting there all the time and it is putting a great deal of pressure, particularly in cases where one feels that ticking clock.  There will be women who will say they cannot go into hospital, but one knows they will be past the time when we should see them by the time the three days go by, whereas if one could have seen them straight away that would not have been the issue.  It is there all the time.  In the community we are dealing with the 12-week situation.  That is very black and white.  We are not afraid so much of our judgment being questioned in the longer term because we have to operate within that 12 weeks.  It is much more something one needs to think about in terms of whether that is the reason there are only one in ten GPs opting in.  Is that why so many people do not want to provide services?  Why get oneself involved with something where one has to know the ins and outs of a very complex Act when one can just opt out?</p> <p>  Then one must look at the enabling environment that will allow GPs to do that, which is the proper geographical spread.  If one knows that the local hospital is not providing services, then every time one sees somebody who is over nine and a half weeks one will have to refer her to a distant location and one will have to go through that complex pathway with that person.  That is a deterrent to a GP.  The GP also knows that if the patient has a complication, she will be going into a hospital where this is not a provided service for her after-care if she has bleeding.  One does not know what type of treatment she is going to get, what type of bias she will come up against and what the level of knowledge to look after her is.  It is much more than just asking, "Am I afraid of being prosecuted?".  I am not, particularly.  It is the entire deterrent and the way it forces one to deal with people, for example, the amount of additional blood testing we will do for women who might be coming to 12 weeks after a possible failed termination.</p></speech>

In England and Wales, the limit is 24 weeks but when we look at the data on the time at which women access the service, the vast majority still access it at under 12 weeks.  It is 88% under ten weeks, 6% between ten and 12 weeks and only 2% in the later stage of over 20 weeks.  The idea that a longer gestational limit or removal of gestational limits will mean that service users will wait until the last minute to access care is not borne out by the evidence.</p></speech>

There are particular issues that are faced by GPs in smaller communities, GPs who live closer to their practices and small practices.  There is a range of issues where the criminal law might be more burdensome and where the reasons for non-provision would be different for them rather than for an organisation such as the IFPA.</p> <p>  There is a final point regarding the gestational limit.  Internationally, as Ms Spillane mentioned, in many countries there are specific socioeconomic grounds.  We do not think it is right that women should have to present socioeconomic grounds.  It is a very good thing that in current Irish law women do not have to justify their decisions.  However, there are issues that arise during the first trimester.  Women's lives and circumstances can change.  People lose jobs, relationships fail, family circumstances change, there are different caring responsibilities or opportunities arise.  There are many reasons a pregnancy can become a crisis during 12 weeks.  A woman is then over 12 weeks with a crisis pregnancy, and that crisis has been growing.</p><p>We know, for example, from evidence during Covid of situations of people living in violent relationships.  There are pressures on families, including the current pressures involving inflation and other economic issues.  There are lots of pressures that can come to bear during a pregnancy and then for women to find themselves excluded by a rigid gestation period is simply unfair.</p></speech>

We must try to incentivise GPs and take away barriers that might be stopping them from opting in.  There are other things we can do, including for example, creating a faculty of sexual health that would provide a peer support network for doctors who are providing services who may be geographically more isolated and who could be linked into a bigger group for support.  Another thing we could consider would require legislative change.  In the legislation at the moment, a medical practitioner is defined very distinctly as a doctor but there are lots of other parts of the health service in which specialist nurses or midwives are included in that category.  That would be an enabling part of the legislation, if that was to be done, which would help to broaden the base and protect services into the future.</p></speech>

The research that is being done by Dr. Catherine Conlon in TCD, commissioned by the HSE, which is about gathering those experiences, should form a key part of this review in terms of the changes that are necessary.  We know from talking to our members and to women that the changes we are bringing forward are rooted in their experience and going forward, that is exactly what needs to happen, as it does in other areas of women's health care.  Women's experiences need to lead the reform.</p></speech>

I thank them for their submissions and for their ongoing work over so many years.  In their submissions and comments here this morning, both groups make a really compelling case for the review to include recommendations on the legislation itself, as opposed to the operation of the Act.  We had this debate with the Minister some months ago but his tendency was to restrict it to just the issue of the operation of the Act.  As Ms O'Connor said, this is a really important moment.  We have the experience of the last couple of years and we have to go forward on the basis of identifying the issues that have been highlighted and the shortcomings in the legislation.  The review will not count for anything unless it includes very clear recommendations in relation to the Act itself and the legislative provisions therein.  The committee would be very much at one with the witnesses on that issue.  We have a job to do in making the case for legislative change and amendment.</p> <p>  I wish to take up the points Ms O'Connor made in her opening statement about geographical coverage nationally.  It seems that the figures have remained the same since the legislation became operational.  Is it the case that there is a view that just a number of GPs and maternity hospitals will provide the service and nothing can be done to change that situation?  Have the witnesses had any engagement with any of the GP organisations and the HSE on improving the situation?  Is work being done on identifying why so few doctors are participating and, from the HSE's point of view, why only just over half of the maternity hospitals are providing services?  It is completely unacceptable that there is such institutional resistance.  Has work been done or have the witnesses had engagement with any of those organisations?</p></speech>

That has been an absolutely vital component of bringing more GPs on board.  The WHO research also highlights that the HSE has been very good at being a direct contact for GPs for queries they may have and in providing assistance in a timely way.</p> <p>  The issue of coverage really comes down to some key points around the continued lack of safe access zones which we know is vital for giving GPs and hospital-based practitioners the assurance that if they stand up and deliver this care, they will be protected from harassment and abuse.  GPs have also flagged to us that the issue around the maternity hospitals not providing the service in line with the law has a knock-on impact on primary care provision.  We need to be thinking about fast-tracking appointments if there is a case of conscientious objection at the top, by the clinical lead, in a hospital so that a team can be in place to provide care and in doing so, give the signal to GPs in the local area that there is a referral pathway into a local maternity hospital.  Without having that joined up network between primary and hospital-based care, the picture will not improve dramatically.</p></speech>

Dr. Henchion spoke in very compelling detail about the impact of the time limits, both the 12-week gestational period and the three-day waiting time.  Does she have data showing the number of people who have had to travel as a result of both of those time limits?</p></speech>

The majority of women are presenting well before ten weeks so it would only be a small number of women for whom that would arise.  Out of proportion to that number, however, is the concern about it.  We go to a considerable amount of effort in following up women afterwards to make sure, if their test is positive.  In most cases if they did the test again in a week, it would be negative by then but we are afraid of losing that week.  We are bringing those women in and doing two blood tests on them to check that their pregnancy hormone levels are dropping.  We are actually putting them through anxiety and difficulty, as well as ourselves.  We are doing all of that without any extra fees.  We are doing all of those extra consultations and that is part of the effect of it.  There is extra anxiety for women and for providers.  In our experience, only a very small number of women have come to us thinking they would be eligible but have turned out to be just over the limit or for whom the three days has put them over the limit although it definitely has happened.  I have had those conversations with women but in a very, very small number of cases.</p></speech>

I think most of us would argue that the type of services to be provided should be explicitly set out in any agreement.  We know however that in recent weeks the HSE has come up with a form of words to describe the services that will be provided in the new national maternity hospital and that is they will be services that are clinically appropriate and legally permissible.  I would like to ask the witnesses what their understanding of what "clinically appropriate" would be.  It strikes me that if we are talking about providing services that are clinically appropriate in the new national maternity hospital, then it is a clinician who decides what is appropriate as opposed to the woman herself.  My reading of that is that it is contrary to the legislation.  I do not mean to put them on the spot, but I would like to ask their views on that, because there is a real concern that this thing is going to be wrapped up finally in the coming weeks.  I ask that they might pursue this issue with the Minister for Health because I think it is potentially very dangerous.  Have the witnesses any comment on providing services on the basis of what is decided is clinically appropriate as opposed to what should be available on request with the woman being the active agent?</p></speech>

The NWCI is on record as saying, and all our members are very clear on this, we believe the new national maternity hospital should be a public hospital and that is the only way we can absolutely guarantee that there will be full reproductive healthcare within hospitals.  We have also had the experience of Covid-19 where the Minister and the CMO say certain things should be happening in hospitals and yet that was not the case in regard to maternity restrictions.  We have many concerns about the new national maternity hospital but in particular in regard to the provision of reproductive healthcare.  Similar to the Deputy, we see what could be within the legal definitions about the clinical appropriateness.  That absolutely raises concern.  We already have the experience where we do not have full coverage of abortion services throughout our maternity hospitals.  Now it seems as though we are going to have this new hospital which will be there for the future and which it is likely will face similar issues that we now face in other maternity hospitals.  It is absolutely an issue that the Minister needs to address.  In our view, it needs to go further in that it needs to be a public hospital.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#H00300"><p>To follow on from that, I think it comes back to the issue of sustainability and thinking into the future.  Currently, the National Maternity Hospital is one of the key institutions in regard to the development of excellence in abortion care.  It is a key support to primary healthcare providers and the doctors in the National Maternity Hospital have shown a great deal of leadership in establishing and institutionalising abortion care as part of healthcare in Ireland.  That has to carry forward, regardless of the location and the ownership of the National Maternity Hospital.  That ethos, professionalism and expertise has to transfer with it.</p> <p>  I return to one of Dr. Henchion&rsquo;s points about the need for a faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare and a professorship with specific responsibility for the development of excellence in abortion care.  Going back to Ms Spillane&rsquo;s point about how we cannot always rely on the UK, there are many strains and pressures on services in the UK, in particular in regard to advanced training for later abortion care, which is something that we need to develop here.  We cannot think only about the new national maternity hospital in terms of the legal documents that will establish it and that are part of the move, although those are extremely important.  We have to think about the institutional transfer of all of those skills.  Locating a professorship and faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare within the National Maternity Hospital now would be a really strong way of ensuring the transfer of those skills and excellence, so that clinical appropriateness would be considered within an institution that considered abortion healthcare to be critical to women&rsquo;s care generally.</p></speech>

Before I do, however, on the issue of safe access zones, I noticed that this week or last week the UN Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights published its list of issues ahead of Ireland&rsquo;s review and specifically asked about progress to safe access zones.  That is indicative of how important it thinks safe access zones are in terms of addressing our challenge of national coverage and access to GP care in particular.</p> <p>  I am very interested in this idea of having to declare and having a declaration of a refusal of care or conscientious objection.  I cannot remember who said it - it may have been Ms Taylor - but it is worth reiterating that "conscientious" is probably the wrong word because everybody who voted in the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment did so because they conscientiously engaged with the needs of women.  Maybe if we are talking about changes to the legislation, we have to rephrase that.  Just to be clear, would that include GPs?  Would we require GPs to record their objections?  At the moment how easy is it to access data about who is providing care and what the level of that care is?  Hospitals and GPs are obviously giving different levels of care.  If I am trying to access an abortion today, before I walk into the surgery or the hospital, how do I know who will deliver that service to me?</p></speech>

Going back to what it means for the service user, with any healthcare concern, your automatic assumption is to go to your local GP and assume that he or she will be able to help you but because of the My Options route, it means that you have this additional step to go through.  The knowledge of My Options is quite slim and much of the research shows that there needs to be much greater awareness and a publicity drive around My Options being the first step.  Many service users face additional delays because they do not realise that they have to go through this.  When it is a time-sensitive procedure, not automatically knowing the quick first step that you have to take is actually quite significant.</p></speech>

Ms Ryan touched on a really important point.  Most people who would access any type of care would assume that the first step is to go to their GP and say they have an issue they need help with.  Is the creation of a database that outlines who offers care the wrong way around?  If we are going to look at people who object to providing basic care - I include hospitals in this and I would suggest before putting forward my next proposal that every hospital in receipt of public funds should be offering basic services - should the database not be on who is not providing the service?</p></speech>

It has been a barrier to access to abortion in Italy, where there is a register of objectors.  What has happened there is it has become the default.  When someone qualifies as a doctor, he or she goes on the register because abortion is stigmatised.  It involves additional work and perhaps some additional training, and if a doctor wants to progress his or her career within medicine, he or she will go on the register because people do not want to be associated with that type of healthcare.</p></speech>

We do not know that all those who are not engaged in the provision of care are objectors.  Thankfully, a strand of research is just getting off the ground with providers that will, we hope, identify some of those reasons.</p> <p>  Work and efforts would be better focused on engaging with non-providers through education and values work.  When the services were being established, at the end of 2018 and in early 2019, some significant work was done with the World Health Organization regarding what is called values clarification, that is, understanding the ethics of abortion care and the values that inform that kind of service delivery.  That work generally focused on people who were going to be involved directly in the provision of care.</p> <p>  From our perspective, that work should be resourced and should engage all staff in maternity hospitals, even those who are not involved in provision.  We certainly have experience of clients who have presented to emergency services or hospitals outside of the abortion service in the hospital and encountered inappropriate treatment in the form of stigma and judgment.  Dr. Henchion might wish to come in on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#J00900"><p>If I could first focus on the initial question as to who should be on the register, whether objectors or non-objectors, in principle I really like what the Deputy said but the purpose of My Options is to help women, not to make them have to go through the 90% of people in the country who do not provide what they are looking for in order to see who is left over.  That is important.</p> <p>  It is also important for someone to be able to expect to go to his or her GP for any basic healthcare.  Not all GPs fit intrauterine devices, for example, but they should be able immediately to direct the patient where to go and offer any assistance the patient may need, whether it is a prescription or whatever.  That is where the difference is.  Patients should not have to call reception and be told they cannot see the doctor because a given service is not provided there, without being given anything else.  In fact, that would not even be recorded as a refusal of care because the person would never even get to see a doctor.  If a patient rings a GP practice, which takes a lot of courage, and is just told "No", that will never be recorded anywhere.</p> <p>  The way to resolve this, as Ms Spillane said, relates to proper education, making it core curriculum throughout all medical healthcare curriculums and engaging with non-providers continually to at least say that while they may choose not to provide the service, whether because they are too busy or whatever, these women will nonetheless come in with problems after accessing the service.  They need to know what happened, what their needs are and how to care for them.  The evidence shows the more that people are exposed in some way to this care, the more acceptance will develop and the more likely people will be to have a much broader base in the future.  It always comes down to education in these matters and that is important not to forget.</p></speech>

Part of that responsibility involves reflecting on the impact on the person presenting to them of the decisions they take.  The provisions on conscientious objection are contained in the same section as the provisions on equality and social inclusion.  One of the risks of focusing on the way conscientious objection is presented in the law is, as Ms Spillane highlighted, that there could be a situation like that in Italy whereby people categorise themselves and their medical students as objectors.  It is not good enough that they would never think about that again as a doctor.  There needs to be education and, as Ms Spillane noted, values clarification and further training for those who are not providing the service.  Moreover, there need to be opportunities and a responsibility to reflect on the impact on women of non-provision.  If a doctor is categorised at an early stage, he or she will have to decategorise himself or herself and there is a risk people will be locked into their decision.</p></speech>

Is the existence of groups or agencies that might give incorrect information a problem or a barrier at the moment?  We sometimes term them "rogue" pregnancy agencies.</p></speech>

That is one problem with trying to gather those data.  We certainly have encountered people who have attended agencies they thought were abortion-providing agencies.  They have been brought in for medical appointments, had scans and been told various information about their scans but have been provided with no reports.  It is only over time that they have realised that actually, nothing was going to happen and no progress was being made.  When they tried to get any of that medical information in order to transfer their care elsewhere, they have not had any assistance with that.  Depending on when we end up seeing them, we might say that gestationally they require a scan, and those details could quite easily be at odds with the report they were given earlier.  It is definitely an issue we come across, although not very often.  Luckily, women are quite clued in to the issue and recognise the signs that something is not right earlier than they might have in the past, when there was so much secrecy.  We tend to see them on time, therefore, although it is difficult to know because if they are not on time, we may not see them at all.</p></speech>

What jumps out at me is the sense we are almost back to where we were when we started with the eighth amendment.  Dr. Henchion stated that 90% of doctors do not provide care.  Rather than saying that 10% do, the fact that 90% do not demonstrates the lack of services for women in this country.  Moreover, there is a lack of mandatory provision in maternity hospitals.  When we remind ourselves of why we had a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment and why we needed to ask people whether they should have the right to have a say over their own health, lives, material futures and so on, a question on which we got a huge majority in favour, we need to look at the legislation in this review and address the issues that are holding us back.  Half the population - women and girls - are being held back by this legislation.</p> <p>  Ms Taylor said she thought it was good that socioeconomic reasons were not included in the reasons for which women or girls could seek an abortion, yet when we were dealing with this in committee in the lead-up to the referendum, this was one of the stickiest issues.  It was put to a very close vote and it was some other members and I who really pushed it.  I would have thought socioeconomic reasons would be very important.  When we think about teenagers, migrants, women living with domestic abuse, disabled pregnant people and so on, it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable.</p><p>Maybe Ms Taylor could address that.  </p><p> I will ask a few questions in a row.  The reason for this is that once I hear the answers, I will have to leave to go the D&aacute;il to speak.  My next question is on the impact of the protests outside abortion providers.  Does the panel of presenters here not think the Government is now presiding over a situation in this country where women are still being denied access to essential the healthcare for which people overwhelmingly voted because of anti-choice zealots and religious zealots in the main?  How urgently must that be addressed?  I would have thought that was one of the most urgent and important issues we have to deal with, along with the question of conscientious objection being allowed to block women from accessing abortion care.  We just had some discussion on conscientious objection.  However, do we know from the research carried out by the National Women&rsquo;s Council or by the family planning services how much the criminalisation of abortion acts as a chill factor, rather than the conscientious objection?  If a doctor or a practitioner thought, &ldquo;Well, if I am challenged on that I could potentially face 14 years in prison&rdquo;, how does that chill factor impact on the non-delivery of services?</p><p> I have another question about the scans and the delays women are experiencing because they are not able to get a scan on time.  Is there any evidence that is connected to the fact the scanning services have been outsourced by the HSE to a private company?  Is there any evidence, or am I just barking up the wrong tree, to suggest there is a discrimination against women in maternity services on those grounds?</p><p> My last question relates to the two ancillary recommendations of the citizens' assembly.  They arose from the joint Oireachtas committee before repeal was voted on.  One of them has been partially acted on while the other has not been acted on at all.  One is the provision of free contraception to all those of sexual activity age.  That has been partially acted on, but not fully.  The other relates to the introduction of a non-ethos-based sex education programme at school.  These were looked at and recommended to be implemented because, as is evidenced all over Europe, including in Britain and Holland, where the facilities of free contraception and a non-ethos-based sex education programme exist, the level of crisis pregnancies is reduced.  Could the panel please comment on those questions?</p></speech>

My point was that we would not want to see in law specific socioeconomic grounds, so that one would have a 12-week gestation limit, and then women would have to make a case for abortion on the basis of socioeconomic need.  The gestation limit excludes those in particular who have pressing socioeconomic need for abortion care over 12 weeks.  We need to remove the 12-week limit, so that rather than having a situation where somebody would have to plead for an abortion on the basis of their particular case, they would be able to request abortion without having to justify their decision, the same as in the current situation before 12 weeks.  We know from the international data that most women present well before 12 weeks.  However, in those cases where a pregnancy becomes a crisis after 12 weeks, it is important women have access to care.  They should not need to justify that on socioeconomic grounds.  There simply should not be a gestation limit that makes it an issue.</p> <p>  On the issue of safety zones, I agree completely with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  The protests outside healthcare providers are instances of targeted harassment of women who need healthcare, as well as of providers.  Those who carry out those protests know the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, will not change its policy on delivering abortion care.  They tend to target the hospitals and smaller providers.  This is particularly difficult for providers who are living close to their practices and living within the communities, such as those outside Dublin and in smaller towns and areas.  There is a need for action on that.</p> <p>  I will pass to Dr. Henchion to talk more about the chilling factor and access to scanning.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the ancillary recommendations, which brings us back to the issue of unintended pregnancy as the critical factor here.  At the end of March, we supported the launch of a report by the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA.  This report was called, Seeing the unseen: the case for action in the neglected crisis of unintended pregnancy.  Empowering people to have the means to prevent pregnancy through education and information and through access to contraception care are critical.  I will now pass to Dr. Henchion for more on the contraception, the scanning issue and the chilling factor.</p></speech>

Overall, it is one of those issues that depends on geography.  Where you are in the country depends on what way your scans are going to be provided, as well as who is going to provide them.  In some parts of the country, the maternity unit will provide scans and the doctor will contact them.  In Dublin and some other parts of the country, it is outsourced to a private company.  The contract that company has is supposed to be that it will provide those scans within that three-day waiting time.  It is not supposed to impose an additional delay.  Whereas that might work a lot of the time, there will be delays some of the time.  Everywhere has had staffing issues because of the pandemic, so that may be part of it.  It is not something I could say was either clearly discriminatory or against accessibility or allowing access to abortion.  It is set up specifically to allow access to abortion.  We have a dedicated referral pathway into this company, which is separate from the general pathway in order to get timely appointments.  However, it happens sometimes that there are delays.  That can be delay of maybe up to a week.  That can negatively impact on women in this time-sensitive service.  There are occasionally delays and that is definitely true.  It is difficult but we are not given any information as to what the cause the delay is.  It can be a difficult experience for women when that happens.  In some cases, if we were to go along with that and wait for the scan, it could potentially put women over the legal limit.  In the cases where you would be concerned, you might then contact your local hospital.</p> <p>  Like many issues in relation to the operation of this service, it puts an undue amount of pressure on providers to go way above and beyond what they would normally be expected to do in order to try to make sure the service works for women.  There could be several calls in a day about one person, which might not based on medical need.  They might not be because that person is really sick but, rather, they are based on the law and on the fact that if you do not get on to somebody today, that person is going to miss a deadline.  That is taking up time that should not be needed to be taken up.</p> <p>  Similarly, the administrative burden falls completely on the providers, who have to do additional certification documents and notification documents.  Nobody would mind doing those things, if they were going to provide good data.  However, the only data they seem to be interested in finding is the Irish Medical Council number of the doctor who is doing the providing.  There is no useful information about the demographic of women who are attending for abortion on the notification forms.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s questions on scanning.</p> <p>  I have talked about the chilling effect of the criminal sanctions enough at this stage, so I might pass over.</p></speech>

This legislation has been promised and there is cross-party support for it.  We think it needs to be moved without delay.  We are concerned by the delay in bringing it forward.  In part answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is hard to know the combination of factors leading to the poor coverage we have.</p><p>We certainly believe, and we know from some evidence from the Southern Taskgroup On Abortion and Reproductive Topics, START, for example, that GPs, particularly in rural areas, are concerned about opening and about protests.  This would remove that, and we believe it would assist in broadening the coverage.</p><p> To turn to the issue raised on the ancillary recommendations, which are important, I will say something about sex education.  This has been the subject of many discussions and debates in the Oireachtas.  It is also part of what will be included in the third strategy on gender-based violence.  At this point, it is without doubt that we need a comprehensive sex education programme in primary and secondary schools that is obligatory for schools and is part of the core curriculum.  It is unfortunate that it is one of the areas getting left behind.  In the view of the National Women's Council, it is key for women's health and for wider issue concerning women's equality.  Ms Ryan will discuss contraception.</p></speech>

We also need to focus attention on thinking about how the roll-out to those aged 17 to 25 can be delivered in such a way that everyone can benefit from it.  Part of this is thinking about the network provider.  GPs and women's health clinics should be used.  We should also think about the potential role of pharmacies.  In other jurisdictions oral contraceptives are available without prescription via pharmacies.  They are trusted local community-based health care facilities.  It would be incumbent on us to consider whether there is a role for pharmacists to play if we are to reach all who could benefit from this, especially when they safely deliver the emergency contraceptive as it is.  It would be a good care pathway for them to be able to provide regular contraception consultation as they provide emergency contraception as it stands.</p></speech>

I speak as a former member of the committee, as other speakers have, that dealt with this matter in the context of identifying what that committee tried to do four years ago.  It was based on the absolute need to ensure that the full range of medical supports and services were available to women throughout pregnancy for whatever duration and whether it was a crisis pregnancy, an unwanted pregnancy or whatever.  It was felt that by doing what was done in the manner in which it was done at the time, the service was going to be provided in the way in which the legislation intended.</p> <p>  I listened with interest to what was said on the need to extend the 12-week period.  The previous committee looked at this and an attempt was made to provide services on average and on par with what was available in the rest of Europe.  Some countries differ.  Some are more advanced than Ireland and some are not.  We have to look at the efficacy of the legislation that was passed.  Who is not providing the service as required and dictated by the legislation at the time and as approved by the people?  We must remember that we had to have at the back of our minds at all times the fact the people had the right to approve or reject it.  The best we could do at the time was try to ensure the level of the legislation was sufficient to meet the requirements of women.</p> <p>  I strongly support the point on the absence of robust data.  We need this as a matter of urgency.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to some of the recommendations that were made for which we do not seem to have evidence.  For example, I do not know whether a comprehensive level of sex education is being made available in schools.  I am not sure changing legislation will improve it but we need to put it in place and it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  I am more than a little concerned about national coverage.  The findings at the time, after exhaustive exchanges of views between the various stakeholders, was that national coverage in respect of women's health during pregnancy is essential if we are to address the issues concerned.  If the availability of support services for women's health has changed since then we need to know urgently about the reasons.  We need to have cold hard factual evidence to back up the situation.  For example, we need to know how many women are forced to go abroad for terminations of pregnancies and we need to know the reasons for this.  By "we", I mean legislators need to know this.  The legislators have to stand over this afterwards.  Whatever is done has to stand up to scrutiny and stand up to Opposition appraisal.  It has the right to appraise it but it has to happen this way.</p> <p>  There is also need to try to ensure the level of data being made available addresses the concerns of the committee from four years ago.  Points were raised at the time, all in good faith, by various people and practitioners.  It was planned that some practitioners, for personal reasons, would refuse to get involved in the provision of services.  I recognise that, but it does not in any way absolve us from the need and obligation to provide health services for women who are pregnant and have a right to them.  I was one of the first people in the country to support the introduction of the legislation on the protection of life during pregnancy, which was groundbreaking at the time.  The waiting period was kept as it was for reasons that have been referred to already.  It has been acknowledged that some women seeking a discontinuation of pregnancy may change their minds.  People do change their minds.  It was from a health point of view that it was thought that people wanting to terminate pregnancies immediately should have a waiting period because they may think differently.  This arose from some of the evidence submitted to the committee during the course of the interviews whereby some people were full of remorse afterwards.  It was not the majority of people but it was some people.  In order to address this issue, it was put into the legislation to ensure the highest level of care was made available to women, for or against as the case maybe.</p> <p>  We need to identify precisely the amount of travel abroad and the reasons for it.  We need to look at the chill factor.  This also applies in other countries, including the UK.  Its inclusion is being criticised.  The Irish legislation is pitched somewhere in the middle ground, but we need more information as to how it has progressed over the past three to four years.  We need hard evidence.  That evidence must involve a careful assessment of all that has happened in the past couple of years in order to ensure that in the context of whatever decisions are made, we improve matters.</p><p>We are going to change the legislation, which was not anticipated in the review.  The review was supposed to identify the cause or causes of what might impede the provision of first-class healthcare and support for pregnant women throughout the country, in all circumstances, not by virtue of the fact they are far from where services are available but to try to ensure, insofar as we could, that such services be made available full stop.  We have the obligation as legislators to do that for now and in the future.  I do not want to delay the meeting but the issue of national coverage is one that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p><p> The other issue is I do not think it was ever intended that women would have to justify their need for healthcare.  There were reasons other than those for needing to ensure that the legislation was not as progressive as that in some countries but not as restrictive as that in others.  It is essential that the highest possible level of medical care be made available, whether it involves medical abortion or surgical abortion.  A lot depended on the degree to which these issues were teased out by the previous committee when the people came to vote.  Legislators have to rely on public support for whatever we legislate for at any particular time and that will still continue.</p></speech>

The availability of surgical abortions was also mentioned.  Perhaps Dr. Henchion would like to come in on that.  The point about data speaks to the need to reform not only operational issues relating to abortion access but also the law itself in the form of the 2018 Act.  Data collection requirements are set out under section 20 of the Act.  This provision does not give us any useful public health data on the delivery of abortion care.  It exceptionalises abortion and stigmatises the people who provide that care.  The requirement under that section - I am sure members are familiar with this - is that every abortion that takes place in this country must be notified directly to the Minister for Health within 28 days of its occurrence.  That is absolutely absurd and it is not an appropriate way to collect data on essential healthcare.  It does not happen with any other health procedure, such as heart and lung transplants.  Should we notify the Minister every time we carry out a cervical screen or insert a coil?  It is not an appropriate way to collect data in healthcare.</p> <p>  Such data does not, of course, provide any identifying information about the women who access care but, on every single notification, the doctor who provided care must supply his or her medical council registration number.  What message does that send to providers?  We have talked a lot about conscience, non-provision and the lack of geographical coverage.  What message does that send to healthcare providers other than, "We are watching you"?  It is absolutely not appropriate.  Instead, we need a provision that requires the HSE to publish an annual statistical report relating to trends in service delivery.  We do not need to set out in legislation what types of data we collect, but the type of information that might be useful includes the age profile of women accessing care, the gestation stage they are presenting at and the uptake of contraception.  This information is critical to informing service delivery and safeguarding abortion care into the future.  The current provision is not fit for purpose.  It is not appropriate to collect data about abortion in this way.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.812" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#M00600"><p>That is again an availability issue.  Many people assume that when somebody is in that nine-to-12 week bracket and gets referred to hospital that she automatically gets the option of a surgical abortion.  That is not the case.  It depends on what location she is referred to.  Some maternity units that are providing services do not actually have access to provide surgical abortion.  It can be particularly problematic for women, let us say, who have had a very difficult experience, either with a previous medical abortion or maybe a miscarriage, and are very anxious about the procedure or, again, are very worried about the prospect of failure, which would be higher with medical rather than surgical abortion.</p> <p>  The other issue I want to address relates to that of the youthfulness of the three days in respect of women potentially changing their minds.  A significant amount of evidence shows there is no medical basis for the three days' wait.  It is not just the fact of having a waiting period.  It is the fact the waiting period is mandated in law to a specific length of time that is totally inflexible and does not take anything into account regarding a woman's circumstances.  As I said, these things relate to the availability of referral services and the fact that in certain cases three days means at least a week because, for example, there might not be another hospital clinic until the end of that week.  It may also be the fact that a woman, for example, only has support from a partner at weekends so, again, three days becomes seven days since she cannot come back for the appointment on a Monday or Tuesday because there is nobody to mind her children.  It is all of those things.  It is the inflexibility of it, apart from the principle of it, that is problematic.</p> <p>  This issue should also come under the general principles of good, informed consent.  If we get such consent, somebody who is uncertain should then feel comfortable in saying "I don't know".  My experience is that those people do say "I don't know", and when they are given the information, they very clearly say, "I am still not quite sure what I'm going to do".  I say to them that it is absolutely fine if they need more time, that if they are six or seven weeks pregnant, for example, they have more time, they do not have to come after three days, they can come next week or the end of next week and, if it runs a bit longer, we can refer them to hospital.  We go through all of that with people.  They do not need to be told they must wait.  It is up to good practitioners to make sure that if people need to wait, they get that opportunity.  It is not for the law to decide how long it should be for a woman to decide she is still sure about the decision she was already sure about three days ago.</p></speech>

It was an extraordinary process.  The attention and detailed listening that happened during that process where Members listened to medical experts, civil society organisations and women who had experiences of being denied abortion care, and assessed and scrutinised international evidence, was impressive and phenomenal.  Those of us who followed the citizens' assembly saw the Oireachtas go through a detailed process after that.  Anyone who was on that committee should be very proud of the work it did, the report it produced and the result it had, but we cannot ignore what we know now.  We have had three years of understanding how the law is operating in practice.  The purpose of the review is to look at the operation of the law.  The evidence is showing that the law is getting in the way of the good operation of abortion care services that the committee aimed to produce.</p> <p>  There is a responsibility on the Oireachtas to deeply consider the evidence we now have, namely, Irish data, the experience of Irish healthcare providers and international guidance - there is new guidance from the WHO - and to have an ongoing and monitoring review so we are gradually supporting the mainstreaming of abortion care into healthcare and the destigmatisation of reproductive healthcare generally.  It is a very important role into the future.  The job is not done yet.</p></speech>

I have to agree that we have had three years of understanding how it can operate.  Many of the flaws the representatives highlighted were potentially picked up on three years ago.  We kind of knew this was going to happen.  I hope, therefore, we do not waste this opportunity to fix these issues because that means we will have gone through two rounds where we will not have put in place best practice in the first instance or, in this case, tried to amend the situation.</p><p> I am astonished that so many maternity hospitals are not providing care.  For an entire institution not to be providing care seems to go far beyond what was envisaged regarding conscientious objection, with individuals not being forced into doing something they do not want to do.  To have full-blown maternity hospitals not offering care is not in keeping with what was envisaged.  I ask for some comments on that.</p><p> One of the witnesses referred to the provision of care.  The people not providing it are not just conscientious objectors.  This has come up in recent months with some GPs I have spoken to, both in public debates and privately, whereby they have said they do not have the capacity to do it.  I ask the witnesses to tease that out.  Dr. Henchion mentioned that not every GP offers every service.  From some of the people I have spoken to, my understanding is that they were not providing it because they did not have the capacity to do it.  This does not apply to all.  Some GP practices are pointing patients to other GPs offering the service, which puts enormous pressure on a small number of GPs, in particular those in remote areas who have to deal with it all.  I know that not all GPs offer all services, but it would be incredible if it was 90% of GPs.  If it was mix of conscientious objection and just not being able to do it, I cannot think of any other service that would have 90% saying they could not do it for whatever reason.</p><p> We know that the three-day wait forces a medically unnecessary delay.  I already know the answer to this.  As far as I am aware, for no other procedure is a person required to wait three days.  People may get a major diagnosis and need to take time to consider their care options.  Am I correct in stating that there is nowhere in medicine where there is a required mandatory, legally bound three-day wait for any care?  We all know the answer to that.  I just want to confirm it.</p><p> I do not work in this area, but the 28-day mortality clause seems highly complex and difficult to work out.  We would all agree that it is not right or fair to force families to face that.  It puts the doctor in the situation of saying that it could be 29 days and therefore the pregnancy must proceed.  As an outsider looking in, it seems impossible for a doctor to make a call on the matter.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.</p><p> Many people have found that telemedicine works very well.  It has been a very positive development.  From the witnesses' perspective, how has telemedicine been working?  I do not want to pose a leading question, but we all know where I stand on the value and necessity of telemedicine.  We were at the launch of the UNFPA.  There is a local conversation on telemedicine, but particularly here in Ireland regarding this.</p><p> The WHO recommends an abortion-on-request model as best medical practice.  I ask the witnesses to explain for the sake of the people listening in why that is the best model.  If this is the best practice, why are we not doing it?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for her questions.  She asked about the definition of foetal anomaly and the 28-day limit.  Professor Keelin O'Donoghue and her colleagues would be the best people to talk about this.  They have done some really important research on it.  Regarding the review of provisions within the legislation, Deputy Colm Burke pointed out earlier that it is extremely odd that only one review of a decision about foetal anomaly had taken place and asked whether that was functioning.  That is not unrelated to the definition and the ticking clock that we have repeatedly talked about.</p> <p>  Our director of counselling, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Venables, who is in the Gallery, has spoken about the decision-making process of people who have received the diagnosis of foetal anomaly.  The clock starts ticking.  Doctors need to do scans to determine the diagnosis and to make a determination of whether a foetus is likely to survive more than 28 days.  That is not at clear-cut diagnosis, and very often there are multiple serious anomalies.  In some cases, women or couples have travelled to the UK and a doctor there has said that it fell within the definition of foetal anomaly.  That is extremely difficult for people.</p> <p>  This point was made to the Oireachtas joint committee and the citizens' assembly many times.  It is putting a bright line into law where clinicians are looking at a statute rather than following the normal professional guidance on how to treat a case.  That determination must be made in line with the law rather than in consultation with a pregnant woman about her views because her views do not come into that determination.  That is critical to the determination of risk in any other circumstances.  The reason more people may not be looking for reviews under the law of decisions on the nature of a foetal anomaly is because the clock is ticking and they need to make a decision to travel to the UK for an earlier intervention rather than wait and potentially be told it will not happen here.</p> <p>  The WHO advocates for abortion on request for all the reasons we have heard.  The law gets in the way of timely access.  It gets in the way of good exercise of medical ethics, informed consent and clinical discretion.  It stigmatises women.  As Dr. Henchion said, there is no other procedure in respect of which the law gets discussed so much.  It keeps abortion at the margins of healthcare in ways that are not good for health.  It makes things more difficult for women and forces providers to police and be gatekeepers of the three-day waiting limit, to police and be gatekeepers of the gestation limit, to police and be gatekeepers of the definition of foetal anomaly and risk to health which is also very limiting and we see very few cases reported under that ground.</p> <p>  Having a criminal provision in the background simply makes it difficult and cumbersome.  It creates added time burdens and added administrative burdens.  It uses up healthcare resources on the part of the provider.  It causes stress, anxiety, delay and stigma to women for no health benefit.  It does nothing to change the picture of abortion access.  We know this from all the previous discussions.  When the law is in the picture it forces difficult decisions on women on where and how they will access abortion, not whether.  It forces women into later abortions by waiting.</p> <p>  The WHO guidelines set out that the approach to law should not start with criminal sanctions and then work in enabling provisions, which is essentially what the Act does because it was based on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which was the enabling provision of the eighth amendment.  We are using that model, which was published in March 2018, before the extent of the public support for repeal of the eighth amendment was made clear through the referendum.  The WHO is advocating that laws should be based on principles of rights and access and they should place responsibilities on the State, which already exist.  They should be reflecting the responsibilities that already exist on the State.</p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan mentioned that the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had raised the issue of abortion in Ireland in its list of issues.  There are obligations on the public sector in Irish law.  There are obligations on healthcare providers according to their duty and their ethics.  The WHO believes that the law should be enabling access and should be protecting access to the service.  We need to protect the good elements which we mentioned in the opening statement of funding by the State for abortion and abortions on request without requirement to justify a decision, which are really important principles.  The law should be like the laws in places like the state of Victoria in Australia, which has one of the model laws and which starts with rights-based provisions.</p><p>The law in Spain similarly starts with the rights-based provisions and then goes into the fact that the law is designed to enable access rather than to restrict and criminalise.  That only causes harm, delay, stress and stigma.</p></speech>

One of the things I said earlier in terms of that whole 28-day piece is that termination for medical reasons is a critical issue for women and for our members.  They have raised this matter consistently.  It is the impact it has in the moment but also the message that it sends to people and couples who are in that situation.  It really is a critical area for change in this review.</p></speech>

Dr. Henchion might want to speak to our day-to-day experience of delivering it, but I want to mention that early on in the introduction of telemedicine, we sought feedback from our clients because it was a new mode of service delivery.  The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive that women like accessing care in this manner.  They identified several general advantages and very few or no disadvantages to accessing care.  For many women, it means that it minimises the burden of having to take time off work or education.  Certainly, at the time this research was conducted in summer 2020, many people also reported that it minimised the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, as one would expect.  Women felt it enabled them to access care sooner.  Others cited that they felt it gave them more privacy and reduced burdens in terms of arranging childcare.  The provision of abortion by telemedicine is supported by really strong international evidence.  Really importantly, that evidence base has increased during the pandemic thanks to a major study coming out of England and Wales.  It is working well from our experience.  It is a positive enhancement of abortion care and should certainly be retained into the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#O00400"><p>I will mention two things on telemedicine, the first of which is to point out that it is not restricted to abortion care.  Telemedicine has been widely used since the pandemic particularly.  I would like to say it was really good to see that the HSE very proactively came out at the beginning of the pandemic to make sure that even though there is a restriction in the law saying the woman must be examined, it felt that in the emergency, we could actually still use telemedicine in these situations and still make an estimation of gestation in good faith or refer for a scan without physically having to see every person since it was not going to be safe to do so.  The really clear message was that abortion is the same as all other healthcare and that the abortion providers could act in the same way when providing this service as every other service.  That was really good.</p> <p>  The other thing, to be clear for people, is that I would not like anybody to get the impression that telemedicine is somehow a reducing of a service to women.  It is actually a huge extra amount of work for the provider to make sure that all of the information is being transmitted during the consultation because we so often rely on body language when looking at someone to see whether they look confused and get everything we say.  Much more effort goes into those consultations.  We put a lot of extra resources into making sure we had little links put into text messages, which we could send in order that people could click and read extra information.  We had little video clips showing them what to expect in their packs.  We would have already had information sheets and one pagers for people on how to take their medication at home, advice on what to expect and emergency contact numbers.  We made sure all of those went either by email or text.</p> <p>  A proper package has to be put together in order to have good telemedicine.  That is when we will get really good results.  We have to also be open for business.  We have to actually realise that it is not going to suit everybody.  Some people have no privacy at home and need to get out of it to actually be able to have a confidential conversation.  Some will just physically feel uncomfortable.  People could be deaf.  People will not always be able to do telemedicine.  We need to be very flexible about and also say, yes, we had this conversation over the phone but our door is open.  If a person has this or that issue, we want that person to come in and feel that they are welcome to do so.  We do not actually provide it in a vacuum where people feel they do not know where the service is and where they can go.</p></speech>

My first question is to Ms O'Connor and Ms Ryan of the NWC.  In her submission, Ms O'Connor looked at the interpretation of health and the consequences of it in abortion care.  She cited that of the 6,577 abortions provided in 2020, just 20 procedures were carried out due to risk to life or health.  This would signal an issue we have with how we interpret this definition.  Could the witnesses say a little bit about that?  How do they suggest we rectify this?</p></speech>

In practice, what we have is that after 12 weeks, there is a requirement to demonstrate why a person needs care based on very narrow grounds whether they are the definition of health and risk to health or fatal foetal anomalies.  It is why us, the IFPA and many others in this field are advocating for a move away from those kinds of rigid criteria and instead towards a model that is based on the doctor-patient relationship that allows abortion on request without the gestational limit, which does not have an evidence base and which the WHO recommends against.  To be clear, we disagree with having a model of care that requires the service user to demonstrate meeting very narrow criteria and which really inhibits that person's agency in this whole process.</p></speech>

Apart from removing these criteria, how does the NWC think we can support undocumented people in achieving abortion care?  Can we implement safeguards that would protect them from any fear of engaging with State services?  I want to get the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p></speech>

It comes back to My Options and really ensuring that from the very first point of access with the service, it is inclusive and designed with diversity of needs in mind.  We have a great range of interpretation services being provided through My Options at the moment but there is still additional work which could be done to make sure that it is inclusive of everyone.  At the moment, if a person has English as an additional language, that person sometimes requires a friend or family member to call on their behalf.  That is one way in which the privacy of the service user is impacted.  It might be a particular issue for undocumented people who have English as an additional language.  We should be thinking from the very beginning about the additional challenges people on the margins are facing from the very first point of access.</p> <p>  Going back to the points around coverage, if a person is in a rural area that does not have a GP service robustly in place or lives in a direct provision centre and does not have a PPS number yet or, indeed, a medical card, that person will face challenges trying to use public transport to get to a provider.  It really speaks to the need to think about the coverage issue very seriously if we are to meet the needs of everyone, particularly those who may have additional barriers to transport as well as language challenges.</p></speech>

The representatives from the IFPA mentioned that in most cases, and in the absence of locally accessible care, the only option women might have is home self-management of medical abortion.</p><p>Will our guests say a little more about that and what it means?  How has that affected, for example, victims of domestic abuse or women who do not have safe home environments?  Will our guests expand on that?  They touched on that issue a little; perhaps they would expand further.</p></speech>

Home self-management is the general model of care.  Women attend a doctor and receive the abortion medication.  The first medication is usually taken in the presence of the doctor and the second is taken at home.  If women are receiving care fully remotely, they receive a self-care pack and take both medications at home.  That is the general access model.  Of course, the point we are making is that for many women home is not a suitable environment to self-manage an abortion.  Home can be a place that a woman is sharing.  Perhaps she is sharing with a number of people.  She may even be sharing a bedroom.  Home may also mean a place with a coercive or violent partner.  It can be a place where one simply has no privacy.  These packs are also not suitable for homeless people who may be living in various kinds of unsuitable accommodation.  Many people in such situations would prefer a surgical abortion to a medical abortion.  Medical abortions are currently the predominant treatment available.  For most women, surgical abortion is only offered when there is a clinical indication of it being necessary rather than when there is a preference or a reason linked to their socioeconomic situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#P00300"><p>The Senator asked for clarification on the meaning of home self-management.  The situation is the same as it was prior to the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  In certain circumstances, there are people who still have to travel.  That can be very difficult for them.  Even if it means travelling to Dublin rather than to the UK, the women concerned are still having to travel, which means, for example, that they are not going to be there to collect their kids from school and that they must tell somebody else because they have to make arrangements in that regard.</p> <p>  Telemedicine is an advantage because only one attendance is required and women only need to make contingency arrangements once rather than twice.  It is, however, difficult for women who are coming from a distant location for many reasons.  Such women do not feel that the option is open to drop back into that provider if there is a problem.  They may be faced with a choice to attend a local maternity unit where they know there are no services being provided and where they might potentially face stigma.  That is another part of the issue.</p> <p>  On the non-documented issue, Ms Ryan is right that there is a barrier there in terms of language difficulty.  The simple black-and-white fact is that there is no way for a doctor to be reimbursed for providing that service if the patient has no personal public service, PPS, number.  Many doctors will simply not be able to provide the service because it is not sustainable to provide lengthy consultations for free.  Those women are being excluded unless they have money which in almost all cases, they do not.  It is not all about women who are in direct provision or that sort of setting.  There are students who have been in this country for a year but who do not have PPS numbers.  When this kind of situation arises, they have no way to access services.  It is not only one demographic that is affected.  People should be clear that there are several areas in which this happens.  There needs to be a pathway for the provision of this care if we want women who are resident here to be entitled to it, regardless of their circumstances.</p></speech>

The first relates to the supports for women in those circumstances.  Since before the introduction of legal abortion and currently, the HSE does fund organisations such as the IFPA to provide specialist pregnancy counselling.  It is through that specialist counselling that we hear about many of the barriers women face.  Counselling can be useful for women to work through the particular stresses and anxieties of the unintended pregnancy but also of the delays involved and having to go through the waiting period.  It can help women to deal with the stress of being excluded by the law or of finding the gestation limit has excluded them from care completely.  Many women are not aware of the availability of pregnancy counselling.  Among the clients of our pregnancy counselling service are minors who need to access abortion care, women in direct provision and students.  Our clients include people who lack PPS numbers.  To clarify, the IFPA provides care to people without PPS numbers.  That is currently a cost we absorb.  That is not sustainable into the long term and there needs to be a system whereby there is a clear mechanism and transparency about reimbursement in order that providers are in a position to offer care and are not put in the position of denying it because of the reimbursement issue and a lack of clarity.</p></speech>

The reality is that the Irish people voted for abortion to be a healthcare issue and not a criminal act.  Unfortunately, the Act still criminalises anyone who assists a pregnant person to obtain an abortion outside of the provisions of the Act with a penalty of up to 14 years' imprisonment.  Are there many, or any, other countries in which abortion is decriminalised?  Do our guests think that decriminalisation would help to reduce the stigma relating to abortion?</p></speech>

As we said in our opening statement, we feel that the framing of the Act is wrong and that abortion is permissible in only a limited set of circumstances.  That is entirely the wrong frame within which to legislate for access to healthcare.</p> <p>  The Senator asked specifically about the situation in other countries.  I know it is decriminalised in Canada.  There were also recent reforms in South Korea and New Zealand.  I will prepare a note on that topic and send it to the committee after the meeting, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Criminalisation could impact a partner or a parent who might order abortion pills.  As we all know, that happened to the mother of a young teenager.  She was charged in that respect and the case is ongoing in Northern Ireland.  The likely result will be that medical professionals will interpret the law conservatively and patients will be denied care.  I highlight that issue.  I thank our guests for their comprehensive statements.</p></speech>

This ties into what the Senator just said about Northern Ireland.  Women who are travelling from Northern Ireland in the absence of services must bear the cost not only of the travel into the Republic and the cost of childcare but also the cost of the procedure because such women do not have a PPS number.  Given the absolute lack of provision in Northern Ireland and the fact that a postcode lottery defines whether a woman is in a healthcare area that is providing the limited service available, we have an obligation to provide care for that group of women.  Dealing with the issue around PPS numbers would also have an impact by providing support for women in Northern Ireland who need care and cannot access it in that jurisdiction.</p></speech>

As we approach the ten-year anniversary of the Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act, it is clear how far we have come in terms of the provision of services and how far things have moved in the past decade.</p><p>It is clear that the debate in 2013 was an important precursor to the successful repeal of the eighth amendment because, having been a Deputy, then I recall the level of debate and engagement I had with constituents regarding the legislation.</p><p> I welcome all our guests.  I wish to play devil's advocate a little, and I hope they understand that.  As somebody who voted "Yes" in the referendum, I still think it is important to reflect on some of the issues those of an alternative view might have.  Are there data on the three-day wait period and on how many women might have changed their minds prior to abortions or, indeed, how many may have harmed themselves as a result of not receiving timely access?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.836" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#Q00200"><p>Not to my knowledge, although the IFPA may have some.  On the data question, what is important is the research I mentioned that was commissioned by the HSE and carried out by Dr. Catherine Conlon.  Within that, will be details on the experiences of women.  Within that, it will be our understanding part of that experience is that three-day wait period puts an undue stress on people.  It is something we believe is not necessary.</p></speech>

Similarly, Dr. Henchion answered a question on telemedicine.  We received an amount of correspondence expressing the view that telemedicine, as opposed to direct, face-to-face contact, is a lesser service.  Dr. Henchion has answered on that comprehensively, but she may wish to comment further.  Playing devil's advocate again, a referendum was put to the people and reassurances were provided and a comprehensive set of regulations were legislated for based on the legislation for a 12-week limit and the three-day wait period I have mentioned.  What do our guests say to people who say a referendum was put, these were reassurances that were provided and to look again at those would go against the spirit of that referendum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.838" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#Q00400"><p>As we have said, we were in a certain context in 2018.  At that time there was only knowledge of abortion provision in cases or risk to life.  The only legal framework available was the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  I agree with the Senator that the Act and the debates around it and its enactment were really important in the process of reform.  Prior to the Act, no legislative effect had ever been given to the X case.  We had the eighth amendment and a Supreme Court case.  There was no legislation, regulations or anything in guidance that clarified for healthcare practitioners what they should do in those cases.  For that reason, the IFPA supported three women to take a case to the European Court of Human Rights, namely, the A, B and C case.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was enacted as part of the process to give effect to the ruling in the A, B and C case to give legislative clarity to the X case.  That was a requirement, as members know, of the A, B and C case.  However, once that Act was passed and in operation, a completely different conversation about abortion in Ireland happened because it liberated healthcare providers to talk about what that provision was like and really name the barriers.</p> <p>  It was in the process of discussion of the A, B and C case and of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act that healthcare providers came before the Oireachtas and later the citizens' assembly and talked about the difficulties of working in an environment where the law was in the consultation between a woman and her doctor and the bright line between life and health, the policing of that by healthcare professionals, the ethical and clinical difficulties that brought about and then the impact on women of denial of care.  That was thrashed out after the enactment of the legislation, and, in the context of the enactment, in a way we had not seen before.  This was because there was clinical knowledge and it was much more in the open.  We had doctors coming before the joint committee in 2017 giving evidence about what it was like and what the Act's impact on the operation of services was.  That is the position we are in again, whereas in 2018, during the referendum campaign, a general scheme was produced that March that was very much modelled on the structure of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act but allowing for abortion in much wider circumstances.  That was published before the extent of public support for repeal of the eighth amendment was known.</p> <p>  Following on from that, as lawmakers, Members of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to learn from the evidence of the impact of the law on the operation of services.  From the evidence, it is very clear it does.  Once Dr. Conlon's report and the other piece of research into the experience of providers are published, as well as the evidence presented to the committee today through various submissions and when the committee hears more from hospital doctors and GPs, especially in rural areas, the evidence will shows that the operation of services is negatively impacted by over-restriction in the law.  There is too much law in the law.  The gestation limit acts to exclude women who need abortion care from a necessary health service and forces them into exile.  That is something people very explicitly voted against in 2018.  That is very much what was in most people's minds when they were voting.  There is a responsibility on legislators to learn from the evidence and be confident in the evidence that will be presented in the review but to take responsibility for changing the law if the law is frustrating access and frustrating what people voted for.</p></speech>

On geographical cover, the referendum result was obviously hugely in favour of the proposition and that was across geographic areas as well.  Clearly, as has been mentioned, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Wicklow have adequate and good cover of provision of services.  In other areas and counties it is less so.  It was part of the debate that many people would not wish to access services that are very local to them, especially if they are from a small community or small rural area.  Notwithstanding the population advantage the large cities have, is there evidence people are accessing those services from rural areas partly because they must but also partly because they wish to have that level of anonymity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.840" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alana Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#Q00600"><p>The evidence collected by Dr. Lorraine Grimes and the Abortion Rights Campaign as a survey of service users' experience suggests about 30% of those who responded were travelling four to six hours to access abortion care.  I understand the point the Senator is making that maybe going to a city might give people more assurance their need is confidential, is not a matter for discussion and that their privacy is respected.  Ultimately, however, when we think about the profile of women who require abortions, many will have children, caring responsibilities, some will not have access to a car and others may be disabled.  Nobody wants to be travelling that type of distance to access a key service.  That speaks to why we really need to retain telemedicine so that burden of a two-appointment procedure is mitigated and why we need to remove the three-day wait as well, so it is a single appointment.</p><p>Ultimately, we should be working to a national network of coverage where a woman or pregnant person can attend a local GP practice within her community which is accessible and which offers discreet and confidential care, as one would for any other health reason.  No one wants to travel that distance for what is a routine healthcare procedure.</p></speech>

If people chose to travel to a city for anonymity or whatever their personal reason is, that is absolutely fine but it should be a choice.  It should not be a necessity.  If there was less stigma around the provision of abortion, people would not be anxious about attending their local service for it and they would be able to do that.  As Ms Ryan said, many people lose much of their anonymity because they have to disclose to others if they are to travel that distance because they need help with childcare and they need time off work as it involves more than a couple of hours.  For the vast majority of people, if they were assured of the service being available locally, that would guarantee them far more anonymity.</p></speech>

At one stage, one could not travel down the road and international travel was out.  The representatives from the IFPA stated that there are three years of data.  How will that skew the data?</p></speech>

That decreased almost by half the following year to 294.  We do not know.  When the figures for 2021 are published in June, they might give us more of an indication of the extent to which unmet need is continuing.  We do not know whether that reduction between 2019 and 2020 was entirely due to the pandemic or whether there were improvements in access locally and nationally.</p> <p>  I might flag as well, in terms of the figures we have around unmet need, data provided by an organisation called Women on Web, which provides online access to telemedicine abortion predominantly in jurisdictions where abortion is illegal or heavily restricted.  Between 2019 and 2021, they received more than 700 consultations from women in Ireland.  That speaks to remaining barriers around access as well.</p></speech>

One in ten, as one of the members pointed out, means that 90% remain.  There are four counties - Dublin, Cork, Galway and Wicklow - where there are some limited services but where there are challenges.  There are challenges for GPs, particularly in rural areas and socioeconomically deprived areas.  There are fewer opportunities for people in those areas as well.  Has Dr. Henchion any suggestions in that regard?  How can we open up services so that people do not have to travel to services such as in Dublin, Galway or Wicklow?  I note IFPA's submission, but are there any practical suggestions?  Dr. Henchion was talking in terms of the barriers there in respect of those GPs.  We could nearly do a session on that alone.  Maybe Dr. Henchion might want to comment further on some of those matters</p> <p>  On the other issue, I was not aware of the criteria relating to PPS numbers.  That is new to me.  What is Dr. Henchion suggesting in respect of that matter?  Is she suggesting the use of medical numbers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.847" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#R00700"><p>Students who spend some time in another country, if they do not get what would be the equivalent of a PPS number, they usually get a visitor number or a visitor card.  They can use the card to access medical services in that country while they are there.  That is one cohort that could be resolved.  If, for example, somebody is recently arrived into a country undocumented, that person will still have needs.  There has to be a way of providing something, whether it is an area where they are living or something like that, in order to use.  It can be a separate channel.  It can be a little more difficult to make sure that there are not problems with too many claims, but there has to be a way.  There should be a mechanism for those people to be able to still access care.</p> <p>  In terms of GPs, an individual GP might not have an objection but if he or she is in a practice with two others and those two others do not want to provide the service, it is difficult for that one GP who does not have the objection to provide the service because he or she will have concerns about his or her patient coming back on a day he or she is not there with a problem and being met by someone who says that he or she does not provide the service.  Sometimes it is a little harder to see.  When people talk about entire hospitals or institutions not providing, if one has a relatively small number of obstetricians in a hospital and half of them say "No", that makes it logistically quite difficult to do.  In terms of what needs to be done there, it is about resourcing new roles so that one will meet that critical number of staff required to make the service work.  It is also about task sharing with midwives and nursing staff to make sure that there are sufficient staff to provide it and about training for all so that everybody is clear that even if they do not want to be involved in providing the procedure, they must treat people with respect and be capable of providing all of the aftercare for complication.  As a result, if women go in and are faced with someone who does not provide the service, will not be worried about what that person is going to say and can be confident that everybody in the facility will be able to deal with anybody who has a complication.</p></speech>

Looking the hospital set-up, it is a hierarchical situation involving consultants, etc.  The difficulty is that if the senior clinician is in that position, I would imagine there would be an impact.  The senior clinician has priority in the context of theatre time.  It is also difficult for junior staff to be filling that gap or going against the conscientious objection of that individual.  One can imagine the tension and the difficulty that creates within the system.</p></speech>

That is why it is so important to have somebody appointed who can mentor those junior staff in order that the next generation coming through will not face the same issues.  That is what one wants to try and do to safeguard the service into the future.</p> <p>  On a question asked earlier, the HSE is continuously making efforts to expand the service.  It is involved in conversations with those hospitals.  As far as I am aware, the service started being provided in Sligo hospital recently.  Previously, it was not available there.  It is slow, but they are trying to engage.  Somebody asked if there anything is being done.  They are trying to engage in those areas.</p></speech>

The PPS number issue is something that the IFPA is engaging with the HSE on.  We have raised it with the executive and we can keep the committee informed if there is progress.  We are hoping that there will be progress in that area.</p> <p>  On the idea of sustainability and supports into the future, what is clear from everything that has been said today is that the law makes services available and creates a legal framework for availability, but availability is the minimal requirement in order that services can be provided.  We need to look at the broader requirements of the right to health, which is that healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare services, should not only be available, they should also be accessible and acceptable to women and of high quality.  We need to see removal of the barriers to access but also concerted efforts to build in that accessibility and acceptability, as well as availability and women's right to access care with dignity.  These requirements need to be built in institutionally by means of training and structures and, as Dr. Henchion stated, support and mentoring.  In addition, the Act does not contain an overarching preamble that deals with values.</p><p>Something is needed, whether that is a preamble inserted into the Act or a code of practice on reproductive autonomy and access to healthcare according to human rights guidelines.  The HSE has been making heroic efforts to ensure availability of services, but there is, however, an overarching responsibility to lift our vision and to think about excellence, quality and sustainability in future.  Many structures could be put in place in the health system to do that.</p></speech>

Also touched on was the issue of safe access.  Would the witnesses like to outline some experiences they are aware of?  I refer to challenges women are facing in some areas.  There is no need to necessarily mention those areas, but I think we would all accept it is wrong and that people should be able to access medical care if they need it.  They should not have to go through a gauntlet in doing so, as we have seen in other countries.  It is only starting here, and we would all be horrified if it escalated.  The people in favour of doing that would pick on what they would term, mar dhea, "a success" in one area and then move to another, and so on.  Legislation is being brought forward.  It is important, however, for any overview of the legislation to consider this aspect, which is one of the areas that must be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

We have certainly heard some of the public reporting on protests outside the National Maternity Hospital.  We also know of doctors who have decided not to go ahead with surgeries, on a weekend, for example, because of protests happening outside.  We are not that far away from when we had the referendum and we have also spoken a great deal about the stigmatisation of abortion, so of course these protests cause real concern for women.  We have said this several times today, but this legislation was promised at the time of the original Act and yet we have had this enormous delay.  This legislation must be introduced as speedily as possible because it is part of the frame around the stigmatisation of what is a healthcare service for women.</p></speech>

Nationally representative data collected in February 2022 show that 85% of the public agree that those providing and accessing abortion services should be protected from threats, harassment and abuse.  That is a strong mandate from the public for the introduction of safe access zones.  The cross-party Bill, which has been developed and strengthened on every Stage so far, represents our best opportunity for introducing the legislation in a timely way.  As the Bill enters the D&aacute;il, it is incumbent on all our representatives to support it.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses outline how often failed early medical abortions occur and what the process is for after-care?  What harm can this do to people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.857" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#S00700"><p>The rate of failure depends on the exact gestational period, but it varies from approximately 1% under seven weeks to about 2.5% by the time 12 weeks are reached.  Therefore, it goes up slightly during that gestational period.  In some cases, it is obvious it has occurred because no bleeding has happened and somebody is going to report that quickly.  If it were to happen in the community, then we would quickly refer the people concerned to one of the clinics in the maternity units providing care.  Those units would be extremely responsive in seeing those people quickly.  It is upsetting for people because they thought it was going to be sorted out.  This aspect is part of the consent process, though, so people know about it and we are clear with them about it.  It is stressful, however, because people might then have to wait for a few days for a hospital appointment.</p> <p>  The real problem comes in cases where people may have this experience slightly earlier than they thought.  I refer to situations where people might have had less bleeding than they thought, so then they may be anxious the procedure has failed, when in fact it has been okay.  Even more anxiety may be felt in the opposite situation, where people thought they had enough bleeding, but they did not actually lose a pregnancy and it was still there.  Therefore, there is this whole aspect of first trying to ascertain whether someone is still pregnant.  In a situation where there has been a positive test, the question is whether that is just because of some remaining residual hormone and there is nothing to worry about.  Rather than just adopting an approach of telling people it often takes a bit longer for the pregnancy hormones level to fall and that it sounds like everything is fine and we will just do the test again in a week, we are always in the position of saying we cannot really just afford to wait for a week in case we run out of time.  </p> <p>  Therefore, we must over-investigate people, whether that involves sending them to the hospital for scans or doing blood tests to check whether their hormone levels are dropping.  It means that women are being overstressed and over-investigated.  We are constantly going around with these numbers in our heads.  For example, if a person had a blood test on Monday, I must ensure I get the result, communicate again and ensure that person comes back in on Thursday.  There is nothing wrong with these people.  They are perfectly well and healthy, and we should not be having this major concern about what their blood test results are.</p></speech>

I do not know if it was as historic as the witnesses thought it might be, but it was a useful discussion.  We have covered a large area.  I reiterate that if there are areas the witnesses would have liked to have had the opportunity to expand on, but could not because of the nature of the ten-minute slots, they should, by all means, feel free to come back to us in that regard.  On that note, I again thank all the witnesses for their comprehensive discussion with the committee.</p></speech>
