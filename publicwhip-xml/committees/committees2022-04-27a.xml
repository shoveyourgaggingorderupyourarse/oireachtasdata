The purpose of the first session of today&rsquo;s meeting is to examine equine welfare, while the second session will focus on the development of the hemp sector in Ireland.  The committee will hear from representatives of My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue on equine welfare in the first session and representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc on the development the hemp sector in Ireland in the second.</p> <p>  From 28 February, the legal requirement for mask wearing in all settings has been removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use a face mask, particularly in crowded areas.  While the easing of restrictions has removed the general requirement of maintaining a 2 m physical distance, the public health advice continues to state that maintaining a distance from other people is good practice.  It is important everyone in the parliamentary community continue to be respectful of other people's physical space.</p> <p>  Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  This means they will have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at a committee meeting.  They are expected, however, not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chairman's direction.  Witnesses should follow the directions of the Chairman in this regard and are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that, to the extent that is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts are asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to publication by witnesses outside the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in respect of participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  During the first session, we will hear from the following representatives of My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue: Ms Martina Kenny and Ms Deborah Kenny, co-founders, and Mr. Eoin Cullen, director.  I invite them to make their opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for the opportunity to make this presentation.  My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue, MLHR, was set up in 2011 by its co-founders, me, Deborah Kenny and Cathy Davey, because we realised there was an urgent need for a dedicated horse rescue in Ireland.  MLHR is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming unwanted, neglected and abused equines, pigs, dogs and other animals.  We believe all animals deserve the five freedoms, namely, freedom from hunger and thirst, from discomfort, from pain, injury and disease, freedom to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress.  We have created a safe haven for our rescued animals on our three farms, where we ensure each and every one of them has a life worth living.  MLHR is constantly growing, and the demand for our services increases in line with our growing reputation as one of the best animal welfare organisations in Ireland.  We have expanded our operations to include three rescue centres - two in Kildare and one in Cork - run by our team of dedicated farm managers and invaluable volunteers, who have rescued thousands of animals from brutality and cruelty.</p> <p>   Why are we afraid in this country to call out something for exactly what it is?  We allow suffering and cruelty to be inflicted by people on horses, dogs and other animals in our society.  We must do whatever we can to reduce the number of people of all classes and backgrounds who do this, be that in horse racing, so-called sulky racing, dog-racing or dog-breeding businesses, or by owners of horses and dogs who reside in our cities, whether in privately-owned homes or council-owned properties.</p><p>The State seems to be happy to allow animals to be abused, with little or no enforcement of the law in situations where is it glaringly obvious who the perpetrators are.  For example, more than two weeks ago, MLHR volunteers had found a dead foal in the canal close to Bluebell in Dublin, one of many drowning incidents of young horses we have had to deal with over the years where a horse is left with no water and slips into the canal.  We also had to rescue War Celeste, a horse that no doubt some members will be familiar with, who was found abused knee-high deep in excrement in a disgraceful condition and emaciated.  It is glaringly obvious that people are abusing these animals in our society yet they rarely pay the price for their crimes.  So much of the wickedness that has lain hidden and protected in society is finally being exposed by brave and honourable people, yet the area of animal welfare remains our blind spot as a nation.  When it comes to defenceless horses and dogs, we in MLHR believe the State is not doing enough and must do more.  The world has changed and we need to change too.  The horses of Ireland are being starved, neglected, beaten and dumped by all sections of our community and we are calling those responsible out for what they are.</p><p> We have worked extremely hard over the years to foster positive relationships with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, county councils and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as these organisations have great powers in the area of animal welfare.  We work closely with garda&iacute; all over Dublin and throughout the country to assist in equine seizures and welfare call-outs and we have given a presentation on equine welfare and all relevant legislation to many garda&iacute;, including the graduating class of 2018 from the Garda College in Templemore.  We work closely with Dublin City Council and its newly established animal welfare unit, assisting it in the areas of both equine and canine welfare and this relationship is benefiting many animals every day.  MLHR takes every equine that is seized and pounded in the Dublin City Council area after their five days, ensuring the animals are not destroyed.  This is a great accomplishment and shows how well the two entities work together.  MLHR sits on Dublin City Council&rsquo;s animal welfare oversight committee, as well as on Kilkenny County Council&rsquo;s animal welfare committee.  We would eventually like to see every county council have an animal welfare unit and we would like to see a dedicated Garda animal welfare unit.</p><p> We work with both T&uacute;s and Nua to provide work placements and we have also hosted groups of inner-city youths for a day on the farm with instruction from our farrier, equine dentist and one of the Dublin city horse carriage drivers that we work with.  This has been hugely well received and we plan to continue this work in the future.  We work with the Travelling community in many different counties and we hope to continue this work on a greater level.  Throughout Covid we did Zoom classes with schools around Ireland and we can see the great interest out there among young people for more knowledge of and interaction with animals.</p><p> Education and awareness are key.  We want to create an educational space at our centres as we know education will positively assist the mental health of young people as they become adults and that it will help their understanding of animal welfare.  We also want to involve adults who experience negative mental health and social skills issues.  MLHR is a place where everyone fits in and is welcome; a place where no one judges and where everyone supports each other.  Last year alone, MLHR took in 400 animals on top of the hundreds already in our care.  We have amazing fosterers who help to ease the burden of numbers on our farms but we are constantly in need of more space, land and funds as we grow and as the number of rescued animals grows.</p><p> Last year our running costs were in excess of &euro;400,000, which did not include salaries.  We received a small Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grant of &euro;26,250.  In comparison, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, for example, received &euro;668,500 and &euro;615,000, respectively.  Everything else we fundraise and it is a constant struggle to keep up with our huge running costs.  We have been a volunteer-run organisation up to recently but we currently employ five staff to help with daily operations.  MLHR has proved consistently since its founding in 2011 that it is so much more than what it started out to be.  Adaptable and resilient under great pressure, MLHR has become one of the most well-known and highly respected animal welfare organisations in this country.  We are trusted by the public because we are unfazed by any obstacles thrown in our way and people know that if they contact us, we will be there for those animals in need.</p><p> Actions we believe that are needed to help improve the implementation of the legislation are as follows: enforcement by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; local councils countrywide; and organisations such as MLHR working together.  This work should tackle indiscriminate breeding; chipping and passporting; horses on public land; clear signage in troubled areas; prosecutions; and heavy fines.  We are saying it out loud and clear: MLHR needs more Government funding.  What we get is completely inadequate for the services we provide and the work we do.  We need our Government to sit up and take note.  These ongoing equine issues are not just going to go away.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#B00200"><p>I thank Ms Kenny and I compliment MLHR on the work it is doing.  I take issue with the paragraph on the second page of the submission.  Maybe it was not intentional to send this message but it states: "The horses of Ireland are being starved, neglected, beaten and dumped."  The vast majority of horses in the country are extremely well looked after.  I fully accept that we have an issue and we have an issue with all animals, be they horses, dogs or whatever but the vast majority are well looked after.  The way that paragraph was written implies that the majority of horses are being neglected, which is not the case.</p> <p>  I would have a big issue with the fact that microchipping of horses is not being enforced by the Department.  The last time I asked the question I was told that 19% of horses in the country were not microchipped.  When someone finds an instance of cruelty and the owner cannot be traced it makes it difficult to prosecute and I cannot understand why this is not being enforced by the Department.  Every cow has to be clearly identified, for example.  If an inspector or departmental official comes onto a farmer's land and he does not have all his cattle clearly identified, he will be prosecuted straight away and suffer a severe financial penalty.  It baffles me that this is not being enforced because if it was enforced, it would be a lot easier to bring the people who are mistreating horses to justice.  I am not telling Ms Kenny her business because she is obviously good at it but this is something MLHR should keep the pressure on the Department about.  Microchipping is provided for in legislation and every horse is meant to be microchipped.  There was a "Panorama" programme a year and a half ago, which showed a horse that had broken its leg racing in Fairyhouse and a number of years afterwards it appeared in an abattoir in the UK.  Those things should not happen and if horses were microchipped they would not happen.</p> <p>  Ms Kenny's points on funding are extremely well made.  With the number of cases MLHR is dealing with, the budget it has is miserly.  Deputy Martin Browne and I work with Tipperary County Council, which has a vet who looks after animal welfare.  Unfortunately, we have encountered a significant number of incidents.  The county council will say it does not have the funding to impound the horses.  It is an issue that needs to be co-ordinated.  If a county council is moving to impound horses it cannot be worrying about the budget to do it.  If there is cruelty there then the situation has to be dealt with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#B00300"><p>I welcome the guests.  I asked for them to be brought before the committee as part of its agenda because I had seen the work they had done.  It came in light of the frequent discovery of abandoned horses in County Tipperary.  As the Chairman said, we have seen this in recent years and there was one particular location that kept coming up, although we have seen instances of neglect in various other parts of the county as well.  You would have to have the hardest of hearts not to be totally outraged by what has gone on and there are few people who would not be outraged by it but it seems to continue on a daily basis.  Various arms of the State are involved in dealing with breaches of animal welfare.  These include the Department, local authorities, animal rescue organisations such as MLHR and the Garda.  There has to be buy-in from animal owners as well.  To get an idea of what is needed to address these ongoing acts of neglect and cruelty, could the witnesses give us a description of what happens and who they contact when they get a call about a horse that has been abandoned or that is in neglect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Cullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#B00400"><p>When we first get a call in and if we know the exact area, we will contact the local Garda station to see if they are able to attend the situation.</p><p>We will also try to contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to let its officials know.  We log every incident that comes to our attention.  Unfortunately, one of the main issues with contacting the Garda is that while garda&iacute; are fantastic, they do not know enough about the animal health and welfare legislation to help us on a regular basis.  A number of garda&iacute; in different counties are looking to learn a lot more about that legislation and want to get more involved.  That is fantastic from our point of view.  Those garda&iacute; want to do it.  However, at the Garda College in Templemore, only half a day is spent on animal health and welfare legislation.  That is all prospective garda&iacute; learn as part of their training.  It used to be a day's training but that has been cut back.  Unfortunately, the knowledge required to allow garda&iacute; to dive on board is not there but as soon as we have a conversation with them, help and inform them, they will get involved.  We then get in touch with local authorities and local councils.  They are the people with whom we would look to get in touch.</p></speech>

We find that if a member of the public gets in touch about a cruelty case, the Garda will direct them to one of the larger animal rescue organisations.  The member of the public is then sent back to the Garda and told to get in touch with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, the representatives of which suggest the person concerned should call the Garda.  This is the sort of chain that is going around.  We want everybody to work together.  We need a system where people are not fobbed off to the next person.  Once My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue is involved, we do all we can to give people help and to answer them.  We have to do that.  The public have become very aware of animal cruelty.  They want help and ask for it every day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#C00500"><p>What is our guests' experience of the availability of the Department, the council and the Garda when they contact those organisations?  Do they come quickly or is it a long, drawn-out process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#C00600"><p>It depends on the time of the day.  We provide an after-hours service but other organisations finish at 5 p.m. and that is the end of that.  It depends on the time of day.  If we know garda&iacute; in the area concerned or have worked with the Garda in that area in the past, the response is amazing.  Dublin City Council has an animal welfare unit and that has already proven it is working.  Those guys are there until at least 8 p.m. but we will help too.  There are garda&iacute; in areas who will help.  That is good.</p></speech>

Is all the information fed up a line that includes the Garda, the local authority and the Department?  Is it a more haphazard situation?</p></speech>

If the situation is serious and garda&iacute; get involved, they will organise a PULSE number.  They will set the chain in place by getting in touch with Department officials and try to get a Department veterinarian to visit the location in question.  There are Department veterinarians all around the country.</p></speech>

As soon as we get a call from the public or the Garda, we keep all the information logged.  We usually get in touch with the Department and a garda in the area.  The Dublin branch of the Garda is amazing in that respect.  If we need anyone to come on board and help, we will make a call.  After hours, it is us who receive calls.</p></speech>

I do not think there is enough knowledge on the part of the officials as to what is involved.  A certain garda may not know who he or she must contact.  We always try to help as much as we can but not everyone is clear on exactly what steps are required.  It also depends on the severity of the case.  If it is only a matter of a stray horse, the Garda will not contact the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It will contact the pound for stray horses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#C01200"><p>I will move on to public awareness and consultations with various horse-owning sectors.  It is important that everyone is singing from the one hymn sheet.  Are the programmes in existence effective in highlighting the abuse of animals?  What more could be done to make the public, or even the Garda, more aware?  Mr. Cullen spoke about the training new recruits are undertaking in Templemore.  Are the programmes in place effective with respect to the general public?</p></speech>

We run our programme via social media and for the past 11 years, we have got our message out to people through social media.  We are not hiding the fact that there is serious cruelty going on.  We let the public know because they need to know.  They need to know who to call and talk to.  Social media is the way to send that message.  We feel there should be something out there in certain areas through advertising in bus shelters, dole offices or other places where information can be seen to show that the Government, the Garda and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not accepting the mistreatment of animals anymore.  Clear signage needs to be out there to tell people they can be fined or imprisoned for animal abuse.  There is nothing out there at the moment.  There is nothing to tell people not to go into public parks with certain animals.  Those signs are required.  There are horses in public parks all over the country and the owners say, "Well, it is a park."  That is dangerous.</p></speech>

The legislation itself is very good but it is not widely enforced.  Garda&iacute; need more education on the legislation and the powers they have as authorised officers.  Not enough garda&iacute; realise they are authorised officers who have more power than any of the animal organisations, such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA.  We need better education for training garda&iacute;.  We bring presentations to Garda stations around the country.  We give hour-long presentations to all the new recruits in Store Street, Mountjoy and the Bridewell Garda stations.  Those presentations include bullet points on the legislation because those garda&iacute; do not have enough knowledge in that regard.  Many garda&iacute; are interested, and are becoming more interested, because they see exactly what is going on and recognise the need for them to get involved.  Better education for garda&iacute; is important.</p></speech>

In many instances, there is a case for a good and clear prosecution.  As we have said, not enough animals are chipped and have passports.  In some cases, there is a chip which indicates a clear owner or the owner in question admits owning the horse.  The rate of prosecution in such cases has dropped.  We get everything ready with the farrier, dentist and veterinarian.  We prepare for a prosecution to help the Garda.  Everyone should help the garda&iacute;, who are very good authorised officers.  We must push for prosecutions and heavy fines.  It is up to the Government to do that because it is the only way it will work.  We must hit people in the pocket and show them we are not taking it anymore.</p></speech>

I do not want to be critical, and there may be an element of poor phraseology or bad wording here, but I must comment on the portion of the opening statement in which Ms Kenny said that the horses of Ireland are being starved.  That is a general comment and I am a horse owner.</p><p>The powers that be at home tell me that I put my priority on the horses more than I do on the house.  I have been told that by the people who go shopping and have the trolley full of dog and cat food before we start buying anything for the house.  I am only one of many very dedicated, committed horse owners who as I say, in many cases, prioritise the horse and the horse&rsquo;s care maybe over the humans in their lives.  The way it was worded was unfortunate but we will leave it at that. <br/><br/>The Chair also mentioned that in all aspects of the equine sector the problem is the identification.  As with all aspects of life, when it comes to criminality or anything the people who comply are the dedicated owners who will have their horses checked and everything will be in order.  The ones who will end up at the witnesses' door are those who are not traceable.  In that regard, even for horses that are chipped there is no continuity of change of ownership.  The Chair mentioned the War Celeste scenario and situation.  War Celeste went through Tattersalls.  It had been chipped.  One would imagine that for a horse that went through Tattersalls and was actually sold for nearly &euro;250,000 it would be just a matter of reading the chip to identify an owner.  However they were not able to identify an owner.  How does one overcome that problem from a traceability scenario for horses that are actually chipped?  How do the witnesses overcome the scenario of horses left in the park to run wild and when they come into their care they are not chipped?  What power have the witnesses over that horse if no owner is identified?  They do the teeth, the hooves, they get the farrier and whatever.  Would they or some of the powers in enforcement have the power, assuming an owner will turn up later, to spay or geld that animal?  Do we have the power to go that far?  In my opinion that might help in solving the problem of the wild or unidentifiable horses or unowned horses<b>.  </b>I do not know whether you have that much power.<br/><br/>Finally, in its submission My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue says it is providing education at its centres.  Who comes to the education sessions?  Who recruits?  Who decides who comes?  Is it open days for schools?  Does it identify certain people within the community, or advertise for interest?  When it states it is educating people at its centres, who is being educated?  Would the witnesses like to get involved in a broader element of education where they become regular visitors to schools, nationally?  Is that something they would like to do?  Education is often offered as a solution for most problems but financially or through limited numbers we always end up talking about educating a minority or a very small number of people.  Unless it is broader it does not have the desired effect.  Could they see themselves in a position where they would be able to become a travelling roadshow visiting all schools in the country?  Who are the people they are educating at the moment?  How are they recruited and how do they find out about this or how do they get them in?</p></speech>

We do understand there are amazing horse owners out there.  Some of our own volunteers &ndash; there are 70 of us &ndash; are in the racing industry and have beautiful horses and that without a doubt is the way it is.  However, we deal with a great many abused and neglected horses.  Just recently we came across a farm type of livery that had about 150 horses on it.  Half of those horses were starved and neglected.  Only last year we helped the garda&iacute; in Kilkenny with another case where there were 110 horses starved and neglected.  Those words, when they come through us, we are dealing with hundreds.  Ireland is overpopulated with horses.  There are a great many doing well.  They are loved absolutely and they are beautiful horses.  We were in Punchestown today showcasing War Celeste but a great many of the horses we deal with on a daily basis are in a terrible state.  They are in our housing estates, on farms, everywhere.  It is quite scary that one person would have so many.  It is a case of the summer comes, see who makes it.  They can be sold for little or nothing.  We are sorry for saying that but we deal with an awful lot of such cases.</p> <p>  In regard to the children and the schools-----</p></speech>

Initially when one contacts people like that they say that she was sold on.  In accordance with the legislation when a horse or any animal is sold the passport needs to be changed into the new owner's details but it does not happen all the time depending on whether or not the buyers intend to sell the animal on again.  If they do not, depending on their purposes, not everybody changes the details of the passport and this is where the details tend to get lost.</p> <p>  War Celeste went to a couple of different auctions and was bought on.  The person who bought her had no interest in looking after her.  She was left with 11 others in stables.  We had another incident where seven thoroughbreds were found in a wooded area in Naas.  When the chip was scanned it was to a very well-known owner.  However there is no way of proving that he put them there because he said he had moved them on a long time ago.  They just seem to change hands.  They can end up in urban areas in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  They can end up anywhere.  It is a difficult one because there needs to be enforcement at the time of sale to say one must change the passport details now, today, because when they buy them they are just told they need to change it within a certain amount of time.</p></speech>

Traceability and microchipping go together.  One cannot have one without the other.  When an inspector goes into a yard or wherever, there should be a register for the number of horses there and the owner has to be responsible for them.  That has to happen if we are going to make improvements on horse welfare.  One cannot just say that one gave that horse away; one's responsibility cannot stop there.  There has to be an official record of where the horse went.</p></speech>

It is still officially registered to me.  Can they not follow me?  That would put the pressure on me if I ever sell a horse in future to make sure the paperwork is filled out before the horse goes.  Can they pursue the person who they have official documentation for?  Can they say that Paul Daly owns that horse, they cannot take my word for it if a sale is not recorded.  Can they do that?</p></speech>

It is difficult for the Garda to prosecute on that basis because they are saying they sold that horse on to somebody else and they might have a receipt to say they sold it on but they do not have a name or a number and do not know where that person lives.  That is where we hit a block.  That is why we are saying that if a horse has to be chipped or issued a passport, whoever that horse is chipped to or named on the passport is the person at fault.  That is where we want it go back to.</p></speech>

My Lovely Horse Animal Rescue does a very good job.  Like all previous speakers, I believe that anyone who has a horse loves their horse.  People love their animals but many do not have the ground or the facilities to be able to look after them.  Is cruelty to animals a bigger problem in urban areas or in rural areas?  I know that local authorities get funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for veterinarians.  Do they play any part in regard to animal welfare in particular in regard to horses and animals?</p></speech>

I commend the witnesses on the great work they are doing.  They are doing fantastic work but it would be remiss of me, like the two previous speakers, not to take them to task on the couple of lines relating to animal welfare.  I appreciate that they are at the coalface and are seeing the absolute worst but right across Ireland, we are very passionate about our horses and 99.9% of horse owners look after them as well as any member of their family.</p> <p>  I agree with the witnesses in relation to funding.  It is a huge challenge and &euro;26,000 is a derisory sum.  I will take that up with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The amount of money that is given to the ISPCA has been a bone of contention for me for many years.  I live not too far away from the national sanctuary in Longford and I see the great work being done there.  There is an opportunity for the witnesses here.  They have proven themselves and have put in the hard hours on the ground.</p> <p>  Mr. Cullen mentioned that enforcement powers are available and that he is happy with the legislation.  The issue is more a case of education for the courts staff, judges and garda&iacute;.  I have a couple of questions in that regard.  Can the courts stop somebody from owning horses?  Is there provision within the legislation to stop people from keeping animals or if they clean up a mess, can they start all over again?  </p> <p>  On the 400 horses that the witnesses took in last year and micro-chipping, I appreciate everything they said in that regard.  When departmental representatives were before this committee I told them that I knew of one horse owner with 40 horses.  He wrote to the Irish Horse Register, which registers sport horses and draught horses, to explain that out of those 40 animals, 20 were still registered to him even though he advised that they were not.  That is an issue.  Out of the 400 horses that came to the sanctuary, how many were micro-chipped?  </p> <p>  There is an opportunity for the witnesses in the education space although I appreciate that their numbers are small, with only five full-time staff.  In terms of getting additional funding, the areas of riding for the disabled, mental health and therapy riding could provide opportunities.  I admire the work the witnesses are doing with the Traveller community.  They are ideally placed to move into that space but I concede there is not an awful lot more they can do with the staff they have and it is very much a funding issue.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back to us with a proposal for development.  I have seen first-hand the benefits of therapy riding and it is great to see.  </p></speech>

In urban areas, the problems are in parks, backyards and so on.  There are certain areas all around Ireland that have horses in them and it is very hard on the councils and garda&iacute;.  In rural areas, the problems would be on large farms where the farmer just breeds and breeds.  There would be a few stallions in with some mares and they just keep breeding and it gets out of control.  They will then sell whatever survives.  On the basis of the kind of cases that we attend with the Garda, I would say that urban and rural areas are very much equal.</p> <p>  On the local authorities, a lot of them have taken the problem on board and have taken us on board.  They are really listening.  I will be in Kilkenny tomorrow with Kilkenny County Council which is trying really hard.  We are working with two sets of Traveller communities.  There is a huge horse issue in what is a small and very compact city and we are trying to deal with that.  There is a lot happening, even in terms of education.  Even though we are only a small organisation with five staff, we do a lot.  Lots of schools contact us because they enjoy it.  Ours is not a place where the animals are kept behind bars.  It is very much a walk-around place where people can pet a pig or a goat.  That has changed people's attitudes and helped them, in many ways.  That is where the education part fits in.  We are very much hands-on with the animals and that is very important for mental health, among other things.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, one of the biggest issues for us is that we are not authorised officers.  We do not have an authorised officer but that is something we would love to get involved in.</p> <p>  One of the questions was around education, who we are educating and whether we would be interest in a travelling road show.  We would be 100% interested in that.  In terms of who we are educating, we go into schools.  We have been invited into number of schools to give talks.  As Ms Kenny said, youth clubs from the Dublin 8 area have visited our centre.  They met farriers and dentists who have tried to educate them on how to take care of a horse, what is needed and what is involved.  We have given presentations to the Traveller community and to garda&iacute; too.  We are trying to educate a broad variety of people.  Getting involved in travelling around the country and visiting schools is something we would love to do.  We would love to be involved in that.</p></speech>

I am from an area where horses are tied up, are being jockeyed around the place and where sulky races take place.  I am seeing that and am in it so I know how to talk to people.  We are not afraid.  We are told many times by various people to be very careful in certain places or we are advised not to go in but we march right in.  It is the only way.  We have to do that; we cannot be afraid.  We are beyond being afraid in certain areas or with certain people or communities.  We have to take a stance, not be afraid and speak out, loud and clear.  This can be done when we have good garda&iacute; on our side.  That is a fantastic thing.</p></speech>

They are bringing us a very important perspective on equine welfare in the broadest sense.  We spend a lot more time than I would ever have envisaged at this committee talking about horses, from all different perspectives.  It would be useful, if the opportunity ever arose, for the committee to visit one of the farms because often it is only when one is physically somewhere that one gets a true sense of it.</p> <p>  I would like to get a better understanding of where the problems lie.  The issue that comes up when I speak to local communities who have found a horse in poor condition or dead is that they are passed from pillar to post.  They are moved between the local authority, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and back to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and sometimes they go around in circles.  I gather from what the witnesses are saying is that there is co-ordination between the different statutory agencies.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

The garda&iacute; have then told them to get in touch with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Meanwhile the animal is dying and that person is in a frenzy.  When they contact us, we try to find out what is happening.  We ask if they have video footage or photographs and ask them were they are located.  We have volunteers all over the country and we try to send them to the location, if it is something bad, or we see if there are garda&iacute; available.  Garda&iacute; are our key because we do not have authorised officers.  We are not authorised officers ourselves.  We use garda&iacute; as our authorised officers.  We should have authorised officers ourselves at this point given that we are the largest horse rescue body in Ireland but we do not.</p></speech>

A lot of the problems we are talking about, including the funding problem, stem from the fact that different bodies can pass the problem on to somebody else and not take responsibility.  Is it the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the local authorities?</p></speech>

I happened to be in the D&aacute;il yesterday when Deputies Mark Ward and Gino Kenny raised a Topical Issue matter on the Clondalkin Equine Club, which I have an interest in because I got an opportunity to visit it some time ago.  It is an example of best practice, where the local authority, the Department and the local community came together with horse owners in an urban environment in which there was previously a tradition of horse neglect.  They turned that into a very positive story, yet if they do not get &euro;60,000 very quickly, they may have to close that operation.  Some &euro;60,000 in the context of the budgets we deal with in this place is a pittance.  It is not to ordinary families but it is in respect of the overall figure.  The Department is saying it sorted some money out for capital works and it is now up to the local authority, while the local authority is saying it does not have that money.  These guys are being directed to the lottery or things like that.  Is there a vote in the D&aacute;il?</p></speech>

Last August, I wrote to this committee requesting that as part of these hearings, we invite people from My Lovely Horse Rescue to appear before the committee because I have had dealings with the group locally in Cork.  I see the unbelievable work being done, to be fair, and it is very good the committee invited the group to appear before it because these are very important issues that need to be discussed and highlighted.  I thank the organisation for the work it has done in Cork.  It was instrumental and successful in getting the pound, which had left Cork city to move to Longford, back to Cork.  I have been regularly contacted by people who are very upset by the conditions in which they have seen horses being kept.  The neglect and abuse are horrific.  I sometimes get photographs and, to be honest, they are so horrific they cannot be believed.</p> <p>  We are against the clock.  There is one garda in Cork, who works on this matter.  She is brilliant but she is the only garda I have met, or the only person working in the local authority or Department, who actually understands the law and the way it should be implemented.  When I contact this garda she is on top of it, but if she is not on duty there is no one else to go to and I have to ring around as a result.  We have the Control of Horses Act.  The Garda are dealing with the owners, which was discussed earlier.  I mean no disrespect, but it should not be up to My Lovely Horse Rescue to train hundreds of garda&iacute; who come out of Templemore every year in what they should be taught.  Templemore is a training college for garda&iacute;.  It should be doing its job.  I have raised this matter locally at joint policing committee meetings with Cork City Council, the superintendent and the chief superintendent in Cork.</p> <p>  The representatives made a point about enforcement and responsibility.  That is key.  We have to make people accountable.  They said the Act is good.  Much of the time legislation is bad, but what we have is good legislation that is not being implemented or enforced.  One of the proposals I am making is that the committee write to the Minister for Justice-----</p></speech>

There are no codes at present.  The Garda has not yet been given the codes in order that, when cases go to court, the number of people being brought to court and the number of prosecutions can be recorded.  We need the data if we are to ensure enforcement.  I ask that that happens.  I apologise that I have to leave because we are voting in the Chamber.  I thank the representatives for the unbelievable work they and all their volunteers throughout the island are doing.  There are some really great people out there.  It just shows the care that people have for animals, especially horses.</p></speech>

Their organisation is wonderful.  I am a major advocate for animal welfare and I have been involved in equestrian sport for many years, but that is a separate matter.  I acknowledge their enormous work.  The one great thing about Irish people is that, on the whole, the majority of them - I know there are many cases where they do not - love animals, especially horses and dogs.  I have been involved in other animal welfare charities and I know the challenges faced by charities when they have professional full-time staff versus volunteers.  There is always a little conflict, particularly around governance issues and all of that, which are an ongoing challenge.  Much of that has been tidied up.  Quite a few animal welfare charities have been involved in issues around governance, although not the organisation represented today.  These issues do not arise deliberately but happen because of the possible synergy or merger between the voluntary sector and professional full-time staff in a very keen body.  I always acknowledge that but everyone is well-meaning and the My Lovely Horse Rescue charity is an exceptionally good one.</p> <p>  I will only share one or two issues because otherwise I will be repeating myself.  As I said, My Lovely Horse Rescue is a very good organisation.  I have looked it up and followed up some of its work.  I would like to hear briefly about three issues relating to enforcement.  If they have covered it, I ask our guests not to go back over it.  I was speaking in the Seanad and I apologise for just arriving.  There was an issue with a certain amount of reluctance on the part of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who said they did not have the expertise when they were challenged with issues around this.  There were also conflicts with people involved in cruelty or abandonment of animals who were part of a bigger Garda operation to do with other issues of criminality where there were layers of issues and, suddenly, the Garda turned a blind eye.  Such issues were considered as being way down the pecking order and not being as important for some.  I do not agree with that strategy.</p> <p>  I did some work two or three years ago that I am happy to share with the witnesses.  I surveyed every one of the 31 local authorities and ascertained what funding they were receiving from any Government agency.  I was quite shocked by the high level of it but was more shocked by the fact it was not all drawn down.  In some cases, there was a suggestion at the end of the year that it could be used for other purposes.  Will the witnesses share with us their relationship with the local authorities?  They are very important outfits in respect of policing and control, and they have certain responsibilities, but I was somewhat shocked by the amount of money going directly to local authorities that they were meant to redistribute to welfare charities.  Is there a need for reform of that?  What is the representatives' experience of that?  I do not know if they receive any subvention from local authorities or centrally from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The issue I would like to hear about is the relationship of My Lovely Horse Rescue with the local authorities.  How do the witnesses find it?  Could it be improved?  Is there potential for more funding?  Where is their strand of funding from the local authorities and what is their relationship with those bodies?  That is the gist of it.</p> <p>  Again, My Lovely Horse Rescue is a brilliant organisation that does brilliant work.  It is highly thought of and people instantly know it.  A colleague in my office today asked if she could attend when she heard representatives of My Lovely Horse Rescue were coming in.  I said I would send her all the material but she was excited and delighted, as was her daughter, who is involved in some sort of horse welfare initiative in Clonsilla.  I will link the witnesses in with that too.  I thank them for their time and for appearing before the committee.  Well done on their work.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council has been very good to us and, amazingly, bought us our first horse van as it recognised that we needed van to help them as well.  We will invoice Kilkenny County Council for certain things that we have done for it but we do not get an awful lot of money from anybody.  All of our money basically comes through the public and some companies.  We are very much a fundraising-type of organisation, which is awful because we must spend so much time thinking how we can pay a bill rather than give consideration to the issues that we really need to think about.  That is a full-time thing for us.  Even though many of us have jobs, families and whatever, we give our all to the organisation.  No matter what, we never panic that we will not make things work or worry about closing down.  I am one of the co-founders, and Ms Deborah Kenny is another, but we have always said that we will never blackmail the public.  I mean that I have seen other rescue organisations say that they are at risk of closing their doors because they have not got enough money.  We do not do that and have always found a way.  It would be great if we did not have to worry about the financial problems that we encounter on a daily basis.  We are here for the animals and we want change.</p></speech>

That is difficult question to answer.  One cannot really do so unless a person is underage.  A person must be aged 16 to own a horse.  There is nothing to say someone cannot own a horse regardless of whether he or she lives in a city centre or a rural area.  Technically, there are rules but anyone can buy a horse and keep it once the horse has been chipped and has a passport.  The owner will say that he or she will keep the horse in a stable but the grass may be in County Carlow or somewhere else.  Technically, there is no way to stop a person owning a horse.  It is not about stopping people from owning a horse; it is about educating them to look after a horse properly and have the proper facilities to take care of a horse.  It is not about stopping an individual from having a horse unless he or she is particularly cruel and, therefore, should not own one.  It is more about making sure that everyone is educated and has the facilities to take care of their horses properly.  That is what we strive for.</p></speech>

The Clondalkin Equine Club cost more than &euro;500,000 and there is no need for anything like that.  First, we do not believe in a horse organisation in an urban area having a load of stables because there is no need for them and things can be done much cheaper.  What a horse needs is a bit of land, grass, to be cared for and to have shelter.  We have come across an awful lot of associations that say they will need 30 stables but there is no need for them.  The problem now is that the Clondalkin Equine Club is trying to maintain such an expensive building, which is sad, and it only has room for 20 horses.  Members of my organisation are in Clondalkin quite a lot so we know that there are dying horses in fields and some of their owners are children.  Another problem is that there is no traceability in respect of children because they get horses for free.  It is now almost summer and many foals have been born and many kids will get them for free, which is something that happens all over Ireland.</p></speech>

They should but only in a controlled manner.  The Clondalkin Equine Club has control of the situation in Clondalkin but, as Ms Kenny said, it only has room for 20 stables.  In Clondalkin, a lot more than 20 kids want to be involved in the care of horses.</p></speech>

We all know that there is a housing situation and, therefore, all land is taken up.  How do we deal with the situation?  The children end up tying up their horses in parks or in a stable in their back gardens.  There is an amount of stables in back gardens all over Dublin city.</p></speech>

At the outset it is important that I clearly set out the responsibilities concerning hemp.</p> <p>  Cannabis and industrial hemp both derive from the species cannabis sativa and contain the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.  Hemp has lower concentrations of THC which decreases or eliminates its psychoactive effects.  Cannabis, which includes hemp, is listed in Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, as amended, which means it is subject to the strictest level of control.  Legislation on cannabis, which includes hemp, is not a matter for this Department and it would not be appropriate for us to discuss any issues on the legal aspects that govern hemp.  It should be noted that it is an offence to cultivate, import, export, produce, supply and possess cannabis, including hemp, except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Health.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regularly receives correspondence from interested parties on various aspects of the subject, including the legislative position and the potential commercial development of the industry.  On foot of this interest, the current programme for Government includes a commitment to fully explore fibre crops such as hemp and consider whether these crops have a viable market.  It is from that perspective that the Department is interested in examining the viability of growing hemp for fibre.</p> <p>  In August 2021, the Department wrote to several stakeholders inviting them to submit their considered views.  In the letter of invitation the stakeholders were asked to include in their submission responses to the following questions: what markets exist for fibre from crops including hemp; the strengths and weaknesses of fibre crops so the classical strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats or SWOT analysis; and what is the scalability of the Irish fibre crop and hemp industry but taking into account market size and value, industry processing capacity and adequate economic returns for all along the supply chain.</p> <p>  The consultation process is ongoing and a report is near completion.  When the report is finalised it will be presented to the Minister for his consideration.  It would not be appropriate for me or my colleagues to discuss any aspect of the consultation process until such time he has considered the report and made a determination on the programme for Government commitment to fully explore the potential for growing fibre crops such as hemp and whether there is a viable market for these crops.</p> <p>  Hemp has a number of uses.  Hemp can be used in construction, marine construction, car manufacturing, paper, food, animal bedding, clothing, drinks and in the health, pharmaceutical, biofuel and cosmetics industries.  Hemp oil, which is derived from seeds, is used in health supplements, personal care, cooking and also in industrial usage such as linseed oil in paints.</p> <p>  In terms of the hemp industry in Ireland, while the area sown between 2016 and 2019 increased considerably, 2020 saw a more than 50% decrease in the area sown when compared with 2019.  My Department's basic payment scheme data, from which we derive our information, indicates that there was a further slight decline in area in 2021.</p><p>Hemp is included as an eligible crop under the basic payment scheme.  For comparative purposes, the areas sown to hemp and Ireland&rsquo;s main crop, spring barley, are included in the table in the Department submission.  From 2015 to 2019, the area grew from a very low 17 ha to 314 ha.  It subsequently dropped to 164 ha in 2020 and last year decreased slightly to 153 ha.  In that same period, if it is compared with spring barley, we had 132,000 ha in 2015.  That decreased to 94,636 ha in 2019, predominantly due to a swing towards higher yielding winter crops.  It increased significantly in 2020 to 140,000 ha and 116,000 ha last year.  Apart from some interest at national level, there is also increasing interest at international level, with the European Commission recently hosting a public meeting on the production of hemp and market opportunities.  While the meeting was to be focused on fibre crops, much of the discussion centred around food.  While many positives were put forward on the future potential of the sector, many similar problems exist in other European countries as are present in Ireland, including, for instance, access to processing facilities.  Currently, Ireland does not have fibre processing facilities.  These are required to be in close proximity to hemp growers.  Any development in relation to a processing facility must be industry led.</p><p> On the area sown internationally, in 2016 more than 100,000 ha was sown globally, with China, Canada, the USA and Europe being the top four.  The global area sown in 2019 mirrored Ireland.  It almost grew threefold to 275,000 ha, with China, Canada, the USA, Europe and Russia being the main growers.  Of note is a drop in area sown in the USA from 2019, where it was almost 60,000 ha, to 2020, where it was 20,000 ha.  These areas are also small in an international context and show hemp is currently very much a niche crop.</p><p> On the legislative position, I mentioned earlier hemp was governed under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017.  Current legislation in Ireland does not allow for the growing of hemp unless a specific license has been granted by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Health.  That licence contains strict conditions, including, for example, the location where the hemp crop can be grown.  It cannot be grown in a roadside field.  It must be a number of fields in from the road.  In addition, the cultivation of hemp is restricted to varieties having less than 0.2% content of THC.  It should be noted this limit will be increased from 0.2% to 0.3% for eligible crops under the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We have conveyed that information to the Department of Health.</p><p> By way of additional information, in 2018 this Department carried out a broad consultation with relevant stakeholders as part of an examination of growing hemp commercially in Ireland.  This consultation was conducted following a request from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Petitions.  The consultation included the Departments of Health and Justice, the HPRA, Teagasc and the two representative bodies for hemp in existence at that time.  A clear view arising from respondents involved in regulation during that consultation was that the domestic hemp industry should continue to be controlled and regulated by the Department of Health and that the stringent controls in place on growing hemp should continue.  This strict regulation is in line with the situation in many other countries.  Detailed analysis of the economics of hemp and its ability to provide a meaningful income all along the supply chain was lacking in that consultation.  The detail on how scalable an Irish hemp industry would be was also lacking in the responses received at that time.</p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to come before it to discuss the development of the hemp sector in Ireland, and I or my colleague will answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Farm diversification is a key strategic direction within the Teagasc statement of strategy for 2021 to 2024.  Our rural development department, which is part of our rural economy development programme, aims to support farmers with diversification opportunities through farm business options webinars and in-person courses held throughout the Teagasc regions.  Teagasc has developed numerous fact sheets on farm diversification, including one on industrial hemp.  We work with industry to develop these opportunities and have been part of the organisation of a national hemp conference in 2019 and have been again in association with Hemp Cooperative Ireland on 8 April.</p> <p>  Teagasc, and An Foras Tal&uacute;ntais before it, has a history of hemp fibre research in the crops programme dating back to 1960.  Over that time there have been three different areas of research of hemp.  The first was conducted by Michael Neenan, who was interested in using the hemp fibre for paper and textile production between 1960 and 1966.  The second era of research was carried out by a researcher called Jim Crowley between 1997 and 1999.  He was interested in hemp as medium density fibreboard, MDF, material.  More recently, between 2008 and 2012, Dr. John Finnan was interested in research on hemp as an energy crop.  All of this research was geared towards the agronomy of hemp, though there were different uses of hemp in mind.  This work has shown that hemp can be grown well in Ireland and has established the basics of crop production in terms of sowing dates, seed rates, varieties, harvesting techniques etc.  It has also shown that the crop can be grown with little or no requirement for plant protection products, although if grown more widely, pests and disease could become a problem.  It has also established the crop nutrient input requirements that are now included in the Teagasc green book, entitled Major &amp;amp; Micro Nutrient Advice For Productive Agricultural Crops, with the relevant table shown in the appendix.  It should be noted that in the three cases above, no significant cultivation of hemp resulted, due primarily to the lack of a local or domestic market for the fibre.</p> <p>  Hemp fibre is a low-density material and therefore not well suited to long-distance transport to processing facilities.  To deliver a significant increase in hemp production for fibre markets will require investment in processing facilities to extract the fibre as well as the development of local markets to turn the fibre into products.  In addition to fibre, hemp may offer opportunities to develop novel products, in particular from the flowers, leaves and seeds, which would not present such a transport challenge as the fibre.  Cannabidiol, CBD, oil is extracted from the leaves and flowers of the crops, the harvesting of which is currently not allowed under hemp cultivation licences.  Therefore the development of a significant CBD industry will require some legislative changes.  These alternative markets are an area of ongoing research, and our food programme recently received funding from the Department to carry out a project called Innovative food friendly processes of hemp CBD extraction and evaluation of hemp as a source of functional food ingredients.  The project is led by Teagasc and involves researchers from UCD.  The total funding allocated is &euro;591,000.</p> <p>  Additionally, we plan to investigate the functionality of hemp protein to identify if there are specific market niches to which it is suited.  We plan to do this as part of the Department funded Unlocking Protein Resource Opportunities To Evolve Ireland&rsquo;s Nutrition, U-Protein, project.  It is a large programme we have going on around plants as sources of protein.  As part of that project we will look at the functionality of hemp protein.  That is a multidisciplinary collaboration between Teagasc, University College Cork, Maynooth University, NUI Galway, the University of Limerick and Queen's University Belfast, as well as ten industry partners, that commenced in November 2020 and received funding of almost &euro;3 million.  Obviously, that is not all for hemp-related work.  There will be some additional work in an EU-funded project lead by Teagasc that is currently in contract negotiation.  We will be actively disseminating the research findings from these projects when they are available.</p> <p>  As with any crop or product, markets, together with the necessary infrastructure, are critical to encourage farmers and give them the confidence to grow the crop.  However, as outlined above, the crop grows well in Ireland, and given the right financial returns, growers would be interested in growing the crop.  There are many claims made for the carbon sequestration potential of the crop.  We have done some very limited work in this area which indicates it sequesters slightly less carbon than grassland, but these results require further validation.</p><p>The net carbon sequestration will also be dependent on the system in which the hemp is being grown, that is, grassland or tillage land, and the soil type on which it is being grown, namely, organic or mineral.  It should also be noted that as far as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, methodologies on which our national greenhouse gas inventories are based are concerned, the carbon contained in most crop products is assumed to be released back to the atmosphere once harvested.  That stands in contrast to harvested wood products, for example.  If such products are used in construction, the carbon is assumed to be sequestered.  That is a difference between hemp and forestry or harvested wood products.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present evidence to it this evening.  We welcome any questions members may have.  My colleagues, Mr. Caslin and Mr. Spink, who are more knowledgeable on this topic than I am, will come into their own at that stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#K00200"><p>I thank the representatives from Teagasc and the Department for coming in.  We have already had debate on this issue at the committee, particularly with hemp growers and advocates on its potential.  I have grown hemp here and in Greece, so I know a little bit about the matter.  It is very easy to grow.  Once the seed makes contact with soil and it is firmed in, it grows.  I do not particularly want to connect it with the word "weed", but that is what it is and it grows well.  We have to be responsible about advocating for it and how it is grown and managed.</p> <p>  I will deal with my questions for the Department first.  I got a sense from the Department that there was a certain reluctance in respect of this crop.  I do not know why that is the case but it is the sense I got from reading departmental circulars and the opening statement provided by Mr. Moloney.  He referred to the programme for Government, which states that this will be explored.  Mr. Moloney did not say that, but I am familiar with the programme for Government and it does mention of this.  Mr. Moloney stated that he is not in a position to share this and that with us.  I respect and understand that, but we, as a committee, have to take an overall view based on the information available to us at this time.  I am not sure whether people are convinced about hemp but there seem to be a lot of people who are excited about it.  When one drills down into it, however, there are difficulties.  We know it is easy to grow but there are issues in terms of processing it.  Close proximity to a processing plant is a requirement.  We know it has to be set in away from roads.  Mr. Moloney outlined that in detail.  He presented figures in respect of hemp and spring barley for the period from 2015 to 2021 and told us that it peaked in 2019 terms of hectares sown.  I will ask a few questions and our guests might answer them all at the one time if that works for them.  Is there any reason for the peak in 2019?  Does the Department have qualitative research and information that tells us it peaked and then slowly went down?</p> <p>  There is great excitement in respect of hemp.  It may be the case that there is not enough information but there is a view that it has potential in terms of fibre material, printing, horticultural and other matting, horticultural mulch and quality seed.  What knowledge does the Department have in respect of security and quality of seed?  There are many hemp seed variants.  What is Mr. Moloney's knowledge of the current supplies of hemp?  Where is hemp seed being sourced?  Is hemp seed being harvested here?  Where is it being harvested?  I ask Mr. Moloney to share details in that regard.</p> <p>  I thank our guests from Teagasc for appearing.  Teagasc prepares a number of fact sheets.  It did a very extensive one in respect of hemp.  I was very excited by it.  I do not know if or when it will revise that factsheet but it gave great hope and excitement in this regard.  In his opening remarks, Dr. O'Mara referred to diversification.  Farmers are always looking to diversify and consider new crops but those crops have to be profitable and sustainable and have a future and, ultimately, a market.  It is about getting that critical mass and buy-in.  I do not know where that can happen and what the opportunities are in that regard.  Ultimately, Teagasc is involved in research and development.  That is one of its key roles.  Dr. O'Mara referred to An Foras Tal&uacute;ntais and the earlier research that was done.  I ask him to circulate to the committee Teagasc's most up-to-date factsheet on hemp because I think it covers a lot of the area we have been discussing.</p> <p>  The U-Protein research project being undertaken by Teagasc in conjunction with UCD and other places is exciting in terms of the funding being committed by Teagasc and the potential for synergy.  There is significant growth in new protein in the sports sector.  Even aside from human consumption, there are significant opportunities in the context of animal feeds.  We know from the United States and Canada the opportunities that exist in that context.  It is clear that Teagasc does not have to reinvent the wheel.  A significant amount of research has already been done on this.  Much of the industry is already getting into the area of sports nutrition, as well as human dietary and nutritional requirements.  The most promising reports about which I have read relate to animal nutrition.  I know that work is ongoing with universities in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Belfast.  When will that information come?  Where is Teagasc at in that regard?  What is the timeline involved?  More important, what is the financial commitment in terms of innovation, research and resources that Teagasc has invested in this market?  How is that reflected in its ambition for the product?  It would be very helpful if our guests from Teagasc were to share that information.</p></speech>

There was an extraordinary increase from 67 ha in 2018 to 314 ha in 2019.  We do not normally see that margin of swing.  We have no definitive answers on this, but our opinion is that, as the Senator stated, there was great interest in crop diversification.  The level of beef prices may have been a factor.  There was a 3% increase in tillage area last year and we think much of that came from mixed tillage and beef enterprise.  Farmers were looking at margins and backing tillage as having a better margin than beef.  Farmers were seeking to diversify.  The level dropped off the following year, probably because of the returns.  The market was not returning enough on investment.  I have referred to spring barley because it is the staple main crop and any potential new crop has to be compared with it because it is the area that will probably be lost to gain hemp or any other crop.  That is the basis for giving that comparison.</p> <p>  As regards seed, the seed can be harvested but, unlike in the case of cereals, it cannot be used for propagation - it has to be used for processing.  I have responsibility for seed certification schemes.  Farmers can use home-saved seed, whether it be potatoes, cereals or whatever, for the following year's crop.  That is not possible in the case of hemp.  We have had several engagements with the representative organisations and I know one aspect they would like changed relates to the THC content of the seed.  That might allow them to use a greater range of varieties.  That may happen next year with the change in the basic payment rules, going from 0.2 to 0.3 THC.  All the seed is imported.  We do not cultivate the seed here.  The seed is imported to OECD standards.  I have not had direct contact from the representative bodies in respect of the quality of the seed.  They have not raised any issues with me in that regard.</p></speech>

We will certainly make that fact sheet available to the committee tomorrow.  As he probably saw in our written statement, most of our past research was in respect of hemp and its potential use as a fibre source for paper, energy or whatever.  Our main interest related to how one would grow the crop and the parameters in that regard.  The more recent relevant research we have relates to the food or feed characteristics of the crop.  I ask Mr. Spink to expand on the details of that.  Before he does so, I will point out what we are trying to do in this area.</p><p>We are trying to create facilities, the infrastructure and a support system for entrepreneurs and innovators who could use any food or crop.  We have good facilities in our research centre in Ashtown, dealing with the extraction and processing of foods.  We have invested approximately &euro;10 million over the past three to four years in what we call prepared consumer foods facilities.  We have good facilities that could be used by people at a testing or small manufacturing scale for processing grains, seeds or whatever it might be, purifying them or extracting components from them, and for packaging them.  There has been very little work with hemp at the facility but the resource is available.  We have good expertise relating to the characterisation of seeds, feed or whatever it might be, so that we can identify their properties.  That expertise is being brought to bear on some projects.  I mentioned U-Protein.  Mr. Spink knows more about than me.  He might outline investment in that research.</p></speech>

We have another large EU-funded project that will start soon.  The development of plant proteins has been a significant focus for us for more than a year and is ramping up.  We are interested in how we can effectively extract plant proteins.  It also uses some of the facilities in Moorepark.  The work on protein would have applied primarily to milk until now.  We are trying to identify what we can grow in Ireland.  Can we grow crops with particularly high-value proteins?  How are they extracted?  What are the markets?  This looks at high-value products, including sports nutrition and whatever other markets there might be for proteins that we can effectively grow and extract.</p> <p>  We are also looking at agronomy, which is how the crop is grown, how that affects the amount and quality of the protein, how it is processed, and what it can be used for, so that we can effectively identify raw materials to be used by large food manufacturing companies.  There has been a significant increase in plant-based foods, as I am sure the committee will be aware.  Many of those are based on imported crops.  We are focused on ensuring that the raw materials come from Ireland and the value goes back to the Irish growers rather than being imported.</p> <p>  I have not come equipped with information about the total value.  I was not expecting the question.</p></speech>

I am conscious of time and other members want to contribute.  I think that is exciting.  That is an enormous amount.  Is the committee to take it that the witnesses are ambitious and believe there is potential?  The hemp crop provides high-value protein.  It is a new market and provides diversification.  Are the witnesses reasonably confident that this is exciting, challenging and that there are real opportunities?</p></speech>

I will try to be as brief as possible.  The overwhelming sense I get when dealing with this issue is that there is a lack of enthusiasm and certainly a lack of drive, which is bewildering, considering many commentators suggest that this could be an important crop for diversification, farm incomes and climate action.  Everything that has been done seems minimal.  This is not directed at just the Department or agencies, but applies across the board.</p> <p>  Mr. Moloney mentioned some very low numbers earlier, with 300 ha in 2019.</p><p>He gave a rationale that perhaps this was due to the low price of beef that year, and the fact that there was not a market and that people moved out from it.  He further said that the assumption is based on any future growing of the crop replacing spring barley production.  Which is it?  Who diversifies and where does Mr. Moloney see the potential for hemp growth?  Is it in areas where spring barley is not being grown?  It was my understanding that the type of area that would be most suitable might be the likes of the Border region, the midlands, even into the west, which would not have a high prevalence of tillage farming at the moment, and that it would actually be a diversification from meat or even dairy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#N00200"><p>I am over the crop policy area.  From a tillage perspective, tillage farmers are always looking for diversification.  They look at what can improve their farm incomes and they are keen to look at alternatives.  On that basis, they would look at the crop to see if it is feasible for tillage farmers to grow it.  They have the techniques of growing crops, they have the equipment, and they are ready made to engage.  They will, however, compare the returns from hemp with spring barley, which is the crop they would most replace.</p> <p>  With regard to livestock farmers, it is not for any one sector as it can be grown by beef farmers and, as we heard Senator Boyhan say, it is a relatively easy crop to grow.  There is a low level of inputs.  Mr. Caslin might have more detail on that but it is a relatively easy crop to grow.  It does not take the expertise that would be needed if, for example, somebody who was a beef farmer wanted to grow malting barley in the morning.  It can be grown in marginal areas and I am aware that is grown in places in County Kerry and the west of Ireland.  There is tillage in Kerry as well, however, around the Listowel area.  We have not said that any one particular sector is more suited and my comparison with spring barley was predominantly just to show that if it is a tillage farmer, this is what he or she will be comparing it to.  At the end of the day, they are going to look at the margin of this crop versus what they are currently doing, be it finishing cattle or raising store cattle or whether they are growing barley or any other crop.</p></speech>

There have been claims made by the representative organisations with regard to carbon sequestration.  It is the buzz thing in relation to the climate debate but we have not seen hard facts or evidence to show that.  Dr. O'Mara showed the limited research and how it is comparable to grassland.  It is a low input crop as well, with low levels of pesticides and little or no fertiliser as such.  It is environmentally friendly in that regard.  Yes, it does tick that environmental box but by how much?  Is it comparable to grassland or will it sequester more carbon?  We have not seen the evidence to back up that claim in relation to carbon sequestration.</p></speech>

In respect of farm incomes, there are two parts to the hemp crop.  The Government has committed to an exploration of the fibre element of it.  We heard very strong evidence with the representative organisations that this is a fundamental mistake because asking anybody to grow a crop and to discard, potentially, half or more of the value of the crop would not be entertained.  Dr. O'Mara spoke about looking at the by-products.  Does the Department see scope to examine the entire crop in the context of looking at this from a farm income perspective?</p></speech>

There are regulatory issues around the other elements that are income streams, which are not in the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  Again, it would be for the Department of Health to consider issues in relation to the other income streams.  Some of those are constrained by way of regulatory issues.  At the moment, there is fibre and seed.  That is the licence provided for by the HPRA.  In this programme for Government, we are strictly limited to looking at the fibre element.</p></speech>

The issue has gone as far as the European Court of Justice, which made a ruling that suggests we are wrong in this regard.  The Department of Health may be appealing that.  Does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine not have an opinion on that?  Does it simply let the Department of Health deal with this and say that whatever happens happens, even though there is an acknowledgement that this could be an important income stream for farmers and could play a positive role in agricultural emissions?</p></speech>

We gave our view on whether products should be allowed at a certain THC content, which at the time I believe was 0.3%.  We gave our opinion at that stage.  Where we are consulted we certainly will give an opinion and we will work with our Government colleagues on the development of the sector.

If we took the same view on wind energy, for example, we would not have any in the State.  Going back to the premise that this could potentially be very beneficial to the environment and could be very beneficial to farmers and to local economies, does the Department not see any role at all for the State to intervene in order to kick-start and assist the development of a processing element of the industry?</p></speech>

It has been mentioned, and I believe he has accepted, that the research done by Teagasc in this area has been limited.  The obvious question is whether Teagasc plans to expand that level of research, and what will that look like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.126" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#N02200"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  While the research has been limited, in the area of growing the crop I believe it is reasonably comprehensive.  We know how to grow the crop.  Of course one can always keep looking at new varieties or new plant protection products but I do not believe there is a huge gap in knowledge there around growing the crop</p> <p>  On the uses of the crop, the area we have not researched in the past was the use of the crop in the food industry.</p><p>The research we have under way at the moment is in that space.  Perhaps Mr. Spink will wish to comment further on that.  I will go back to the environmental question the Deputy asked.  There is a bit of uncertainty around the level of carbon sequestration.  Some research we have done suggests that is about the same as for grassland but that is really only half the answer to the question the Deputy asked.  If we are to compare it with a livestock enterprise such as a beef or dairy farm, it must be remembered there is a lot of emissions from ruminant animals.  A hectare of a beef enterprise's land will result in about 4 tonnes in emissions while a hectare of a dairy enterprise's land will result in 8 tonnes.  A hectare of a tillage enterprise land will be responsible for very little emissions in comparison with animal enterprises.</p></speech>

That is probably the main thing but it would be much lower, perhaps 1 tonne or so.  There are far fewer emissions.  The sequestration side of the balance sheet is probably about the same as it would be for grassland but there is a bit of uncertainty around that.</p></speech>

It is probably similar for hemp but there are high levels of uncertainty around that.</p></speech>

That is a third factor to take into account.  If it goes into building material, it is probably going to be there for 20, 30 or maybe 40 years.  If it was a wood product being used for construction timber, it would then be counted as being sequestered or locked up for up to 100 years.  The same does not happen with hemp or many other such crops, even if they are to be locked up.  They are not treated like for like.  It is not getting the same advantage when the fibre is used for long-term construction uses like that.  In some ways, it is an anomaly but production of the crop is very small so the impact it would have on our national inventory is very small in the short term.</p></speech>

It is really about finding the use for it first.  The carbon sequestration benefit of using it for construction material is very much a spin-off or co-benefit.  The big challenge is getting it used in construction.  That is the thing.  We need to get the horse first.  The cart will follow.

I do not even know what a hemp plant looks like.  We had the representative bodies in and it seems to me that the kernel of the debate and the issues we will have if this is to have any kind of feasible future is the fact that the plant is covered by the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017.  I hope the witnesses will correct me if I am wrong because, as I have said, I do not even know the make-up of the plant but it has high levels of protein and the seed oil has many uses.  It strikes me that looking at this from the perspective of the fibre alone is like doing a consultation or feasibility study on growing barley for straw.  Am I right in saying that?  The value of the barley is in the head and, from what I have heard, the situation is likewise for hemp.  If it is to be a feasible crop, the farmer will not be growing it for the fibre but for the head.</p></speech>

With regard to barley for straw, there is a scheme where it is chopped for &euro;100 an acre.  That is the value of the straw but the grain is worth more than &euro;300 a tonne at the moment.  The difference here is that people are given a licence to grow the crop for the straw, in the main, and for the seeds, which are to be used for industrial uses.  The other parts of the plant are not provided for under that licence.  Farmers are prohibited from harvesting those elements under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.</p></speech>

I will again use that analogy and say that I cannot see any farmer buying in to grow barley for straw or to grow hemp for fibre.  If it is to be a feasible and viable crop that yields a return, he or she is going to have to be able to sell, process and utilise the entire crop to maximise his or her income.

However, if we grow that seed and produce hemp-derived products, such as hemp oil or a CBD product, that contain any trace of THC, they will be illegal.  The move at EU level will increase this allowed level from 0.2% to 0.3%.  The exciting thing is that more varieties will be available to us to research and to grow.  These may be high in CBD and low in THC.  That is an exciting opportunity which we will have fairly soon, under the next CAP.</p></speech>

The point I am trying to get is that, as long is this falls under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2017, the agricultural potential is limited.</p></speech>

There is an issue there with regard to investors and insurance in this industry and in getting people involved.  It creates a level of fear among potential investors that if there are trace amounts of THC in hemp-derived products, it will be illegal to sell them on the market.</p><p>We also have the situation whereby, if flower heads are being transported along the road, those farmers are transporting cannabinoids, which is illegal.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could potentially stop those farmers from transporting a trailer-load of flower heads if there were any trace amount of it at all.  That creates a bit of angst among growers and processors.</p></speech>

Is there an appetite within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to try to right that wrong?  I would call it a wrong.  There is no point doing feasibility studies and consultation processes as we know the outcome at this stage.  Is there an appetite within the Department to overcome this major problem and at least talk to the Department of Health?</p></speech>

Where the difference lies is in the THC content.  As Mr. Caslin outlined, some countries have a low threshold of 0.2%, 0.3% or 1%.  Currently, as I understand it, the threshold here is zero.  We will certainly help and give our feedback but the ball is not in our court.  We do not own the ball.  We are not responsible for the licensing of that product.  It is primarily a matter for the Department of Health to consider the restrictions and whether they are justified.  We had a consultation process on the regulations in 2018 and it was felt at that time that the current regulations should continue under the auspices of the Department of Health.  If there is a viable alternative crop, we are certainly there to offer help and support.  We are following the programme for Government, which referred to fibre crops.  Hemp is only one of those.  Flax and linseed are alternatives and that is what we have concentrated on to fulfil the commitment in the programme for Government.  It is not within our remit to change those regulations, but if the crop is viable and we can help, we will consult our Government colleagues.  It is not in our hands.</p></speech>

Its representatives have talked about the sequestration value.  One of the hemp organisations that came before the committee told us that, if it is used as a rotation crop, there is a big increase in the yield of the following year's crop and less nutrient input is needed.  Has Teagasc done any research into whether that would be the case?</p></speech>

We did not specifically include it in a rotational experiment but introducing any non-cereal crop into a cereal rotation will result in an improvement in the following year's crop, usually just over a tonne a hectare.  That is the result of a break in cereal diseases in the rotation.  We would not expect crops such as hemp, beans or oilseed rape to be particularly different from each other.  Invariably, using such crops will reduce fertiliser requirements and increase yield following a non-cereal crop.  It would have a value in a cereal rotation in the same way as other non-cereal crops.</p></speech>

Ideally, it would be sown from early to mid April after the last frost, because that can set the crop back as it is growing, and harvested in September or around the time of the National Ploughing Championships.

It also outcompeted any weeds.  One of the advantages of the crop is that it gets ahead of any weed seeds.  We need rotation crops within tillage systems, so it is ideal as a rotation crop.  The taproot of the hemp helps improve the soil structure and improves aeration within the soil, so it has many benefits that way.</p></speech>

It may just be me but I think the Department is a little dismissive of the development of the hemp industry.  It has called it a niche crop and it seems to me there is no real intention of moving away from that position.  It also said there was little evidence in the consultation showing how it could provide a meaningful income all along the supply chain.  That seems short on ambition to me because at the same time the Department has funded Teagasc to do research on it.  Is the Department giving adequate attention to the big potential for the growing of hemp in this country?</p></speech>

The Department seems very dismissive.  Everybody else seems to think there could be huge potential in the growing of hemp but the Department described it as niche.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022042700002#P02300"><p>At 150 ha, it is very niche.  It is not widely grown.  The maximum area grown was around 300 ha.  I would not agree we are dismissive.  There are difficulties with this crop that do not occur with any other crop.  If I wanted to grow a crop of oilseed rape tomorrow morning - it is a bit late for that now - or if I wanted to grow a crop of maize tomorrow morning, I could get seed and a contractor or, if I had my own gear, put it in the ground and harvest it.  Hemp is a completely different crop and it is not treated the same way.  Farmers have to apply for a licence, which is only a one-year licence and only allows them to grow the crop for certain purposes.  The representative organisations would contend that the most valuable parts of the crop are prohibited.  I have said from the outset, and I have to continue to repeat myself, that is not within the remit of this Department to tell farmers they can now grow it for whatever reason they want or that they do not need a licence.</p><p>We can give our opinions, if asked, about that and we will.  Mr. Mac Aodh&aacute;in may have engaged with them more than I have, but I have met representative bodies and given them whatever support they need.</p><p> The crop is eligible under the basic payment scheme, so people are able to draw payment on that.  With the tillage incentive scheme we announced earlier in the year, land that had hemp grown on it last year is eligible if an eligible crop is put on it this year.  It would be eligible for that &euro;400 payment in that case.  Dr. O'Mara has outlined the funding the Department has put in, and in total that is certainly a significant amount of money that is being put into research for the crop.</p><p> Again, when we have asked about scalability and feasibility, it ultimately gets down to getting growers to plant the crop.  It comes down to brass tacks and whether somebody will make a comparable or better income from this than what he or she may be doing.  Those figures must be substantiated.  To be fair to the representative bodies, they are enthusiastic about this and said there would be demand for 10,000 ha or this, that and the other.  A business proposal must be developed.</p></speech>

It is leaving it with the Department of Health and plodding along with what has happened over the past couple of years.  Unless there is a drive from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine itself to change this, there would be no confidence that a farmer would decide to double or treble his crop.  Until there is a change on the departmental end, we will be having the same conversations over and over.  It will not be classed as anything other than a niche crop grown on a small scale.  The potential is there to expand the industry big time if the Department gives confidence to others.</p></speech>

There is talk about potential but we have not yet seen that backed up with financial information indicating the great potential for the crop to be grown on a wider scale.  We are not the drivers of the change; we are not in control of the licensing or the regulations.  The product is being dealt with and the result of the previous consultation in 2019 was a view that it should continue to be controlled by the Department of Health and dealt with by the HPRA in the licensing aspect.  I cannot see how we can change that from within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is not within our gift to make those changes.</p></speech>

There are similar strict regulations governing hemp and not just in Ireland.  They are across other countries.  The uniformity probably relates to CAP regulations, where there has been acknowledgement of and increased THC content in the seed to give a greater diversity of varieties that can be grown.  That is only for the basic payment regulation, as such.</p></speech>

In 2018, as another example of the same crop, there were 124,000 ha sowed, so that dropped to 94,000 ha sowed in the following year.  There would have been a change in crop balance with respect to other crops.  Farmers may have switched to winter crops on the basis of yield, as such, and spreading their workload.</p> <p>  We might start seeing a significant drop in cropping area.  That happened in 2012, when there was a 50,000 ha drop, and last year, when there was a 9,000 resurgence in cropping area.  That has stabilised over the past couple of years.  We analyse why that is happening and in that case it probably came with the abolition of milk quotas and farmers looking at profitability within the farm gate, as I mentioned.  They may have made the decision that dairying was more profitable than tillage, which led to the switch in that case.  In this case I suspect the drop in hemp was down to the market in what to do with that product.</p></speech>

Why has there been a lack of demand for hemp following the three research projects Teagasc mentioned?

It is needed by farmers and in the right structures.  There is a price for a kilo of beef, for example, or a litre of milk at the dairy co-op.  If a farmer brings grain to the co-op, he or she gets a price per tonne and there are quality parameters in all those industries.  Those structures are not currently there with hemp so farmers growing it now do so in a vacuum.  They do not know what the market or the options will be.  There are limited artisan-type markets around hemp, with some producers producing small amounts of CBD and hemp oil.  The fibre is the key area and there is no use for that fibre.  In a way it is a pity.  If it is grown for botanicals, seed and CBD, all the fibre is being left on the ground.  It is a lot of carbon that is being allowed to biodegrade on the ground.</p> <p>  Ideally, we should have some kind of an industry to give confidence to the growers so they know they have a market outlet for it.  That would be a market for utilising the fibre and locking it up as hempcrete or insulation material in buildings, for example, and maybe building modular homes using the likes of hempcrete.</p><p>We have the lime in the country.  Lime is mixed with the shivs or hurds and water.  We have all the ingredients to produce the material in the country such that we do not necessarily need to use so much concrete in buildings.  What we really need is to give confidence to people so they will move into the houses built with hemp.  We need engineers and architects to be confident about all this as well.  We are agronomists within Teagasc, so I am not too sure about the level of understanding of using hemp and living in a hemp house within those fraternities or industries.  It has been done.  We are not starting from scratch here.  It has been done in other countries.  There are hemp houses around Europe, including Ireland.  The first in Ireland was in County Longford.  Many more have been built since.  A lack of confidence is the key to why the markets have not evolved to the level we would like to see.</p></speech>

It has been claimed that hemp has great potential for retrofitting, construction and installation.  Has Teagasc data to back that up?</p></speech>

It considered the use of hemp for MDF.  It was quite a success, but there are competing sources of fibre.  When we were considering hemp some years ago, we were doing so from an energy perspective.  We were looking into mixing hemp with the likes of miscanthus or wood sawdust to make pellets for energy.  In retrospect, it is a waste of very valuable material just to burn it as a pellet in a biomass boiler.  We have heard a lot about the crop over recent years.  There are so many options, from food and feed to fuel and fibre.  Confidence will be so important.  There are legislative issues.  There is a lack of confidence among potential growers because they do not see the market at present.</p></speech>

It is for the Department.  To go back to the 2018 consultation, it was said there is a lack of evidence to prove a meaningful income could be provided all along the supply chain.  Can Mr. Moloney expand on the evidence sought and the research the Department carried out to ascertain that?  How high did it set the bar?</p></speech>

We did not set a bar; we asked for the evidence to be provided to us to show the scalability.  In other words, we asked the representative bodies to show us what they felt the industry's prospects were and to back up their views.  It is fine to say the crop will make &euro;1,000 per acre or hectare but the statement has to be backed up by sound data.  It was a matter of determining the margin at the processing end and whether the crop is viable.  Everyone will have to make money out of it for it to be viable.  We did not set any bar.  The bar was basically for the representative bodies to give us the information and back it up with the facts and figures.</p></speech>

Are the French governed by the same regulations that apply to us regarding the way in which the crop can be harvested?  Could the representatives from Teagasc state whether there is an economic model coming out of France indicating the return per hectare?  By comparison with the overall tillage area in France, 18,000 ha is still small.</p></speech>

The regulatory arrangements cross over into drugs regulation.  As identified earlier, the bars can be set by member states at different levels; there is no uniformity, but there is uniformity on the varieties that can be grown for the basic payment scheme.  In France, the 18,000 ha have crops with a THC content of 0.2%, but each member state could and does have a different level for THC content for the products.</p></speech>

We have the Single Market.  The crop is governed under the CAP so I cannot understand how it is treated differently in different EU countries.  I am not questioning the decision.  Obviously, the Council of Ministers will make a decision on crops but I find it hard to understand how there cannot be uniformity.

In France, Germany, Lithuania and other countries around Europe, the hemp industry is combined with other industries.  In the Normandy area of France, for example, the hemp industry has been combined with the flax industry.  There is processing capacity there.  Where the industries can be combined, the same type of equipment can be used for decortication.  That is what is making it work in the countries in question.  About four companies in Ireland are importing the fibre from hemp.  There is one in Monaghan and another in Kerry.  The companies are using the product for insulation material.</p></speech>

In France, it is the straw component that is being separated through decortication, and the fibres are being used for insulation and building blocks.  We are importing hemp building blocks from a Belgian company, IsoHemp.  A good critique or study could be done on what we are importing.  The industry specialists who met the members some weeks ago will probably have figures on that.  We more or less come from the agronomic side and do not focus on what the different markets are returning.</p></speech>

At the moment, we are talking about retrofitting many houses to bring them up to a high building energy rating.  That is where I see the opportunities in construction.  This is probably where it all needs to be explored a little further.  The role in retrofitting, and perhaps modular homes and new builds, needs to be examined.</p></speech>

While responsibility is left under the Department of Health, we will never be able to build up the industry.  There is so much uncertainty.  Farmers will not have the confidence to invest to increase the crop yield enough to make blocks or insulation.  Therefore, we will have to continue importing the material.</p></speech>

A critical mass of the crop is needed to justify building a decortication plant.</p><p>Many things could be done under one umbrella at a site, as with a biorefinery.  A site could be producing the construction material and processing the fibres.  On the same site, one could be processing the food components into hemp oils, and potentially processing the flowers, if allowed, into CBD.  All the constituents of the plant then would be used, which would make the economics far more favourable and give confidence to the market.</p></speech>

The proceedings of our Oireachtas committees will be conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and environs should continue to wear masks, preferably of medical grade, and warn properly covering the mouth, etc.  They should continue to sanitise and wash hands and be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend the meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members will be aware we are required to participate in the meeting remotely from within the Leinster House complex only.  We have not received any apologies as yet.</p> <p>  The general scheme of the right to request remote work Bill 2022 was referred by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, for pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, by the committee.  The Bill aims to provide a legal framework around which requesting, approving or refusing a request for remote work can be based.  It also aims to provide legal clarity and procedures to employers on their obligations for dealing with such requests.  The committee has discussed the proposed legislation with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, representatives from IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  Today I am pleased that we have an opportunity to consider the matter further and that we will hear from Grow Remote, whose representative will join us in person, and Glofox, appropriately, will join us remotely.  I welcome from Grow Remove Ms Joanne Mangan, the employers' lead, and from Glofox, Mr. Finn Hegarty, the chief product officer.</p> <p>  I will run through the parliamentary privilege and a brief note for the witnesses.  Before we start I want to explain the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regard reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To begin our consideration of the matter, I invite Ms Mangan to make her opening remarks on behalf of Grow Remote.  Mr. Hegarty will be available to answer questions and contribute to the committee debate following Ms Mangan's opening statement.</p></speech>

Joining me remotely is Mr. Finn Hegarty, who is chief product officer, CPO, and co-founder of Glofox, an Irish remote company.</p> <p>  I would like to highlight the work done to date by the Government in relation to building a sustainable remote working ecosystem in Ireland, in particular, by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Social Protection and Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, in relation to the roll-out of both the national remote-working strategy and Our Rural Future - the national rural development policy.  I would also like to give particular thanks to Senator Emer Currie, who has been a tireless advocate for remote working in Ireland and who has played a key role in Grow Remote being here with the committee today.</p> <p>  Grow Remote is a social enterprise and we are on a mission to unlock the power of remote working to enable everyone to work, live and participate locally all over Ireland.  We do this by providing training for managers to employees and to jobseekers and practical supports to businesses to enable them to take the advantages of remote working.</p> <p>  We also enable communities of remote workers to power social connections locally.  In this space, we have begun an ambitious project to map every remote worker in Ireland and beyond to build a living census of the remote working population.</p><p>In broad terms, we welcome the draft legislation before us.  Before I address specific issues in the general scheme, however, it is important to highlight that, ultimately, the success or failure of remote working in Ireland does not lie within legislation alone.  What is needed is systemic change at all levels to support companies to make the transition to remote-first working.  Over-focus on specific legislation risks missing the point of what remote working can achieve for businesses, people, families and communities from Malin Head to Mizen Head.</p><p> We need to act now to build a robust remote working ecosystem or we risk losing the momentum we have gained over the past two years.  Legislation allowing individual workers to request to work remotely, while very welcome, simply will not equip Irish businesses to compete at the highest level nationally and globally.  The evidence shows that businesses benefit from remote working, and a vast proportion of the Irish workforce wants the opportunity to work remotely.  There are 80,000 remote jobs available in Ireland today, and that number is growing at a rate of 5% to 7% monthly.  Employees have options, and those options are only growing.  Companies are currently operating in a highly competitive hiring landscape, and employers in Ireland who do not adopt remote working models run the risk of losing out to those who do.</p><p> In asking companies to make the transition to remote working, however, we are expecting them to undertake a significant, costly and time-consuming transformation project.  We must take bold steps to de-risk that change for employers.  Therefore, the Government's focus must be on catalysing real action and ring-fencing the investment needed to support businesses and to drive major cultural change in the Irish workplace.  With that in mind, we have three asks.  First, we call for funding supports for Irish businesses that want to transition to remote working models.  This should be designed to empower companies to hire without location in Ireland.  It should include a local enterprise office fund to support small to medium-sized companies at a local level.  Second, ensuring that Irish businesses are remote-ready and equipped for the future will require an awareness and communications campaign at the level of the Brexit Ready campaign.  We urge the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to fund and to develop that.  Third, we believe it is imperative that the Government lead by example and prioritise embedding remote working across the public sector.</p><p> If we fail to put the right supports in place, we will face three significant risks.  Irish employers who are unable to offer remote working will run the risk of losing talented employees to those who do.  Without a thriving, robust ecosystem for remote employment in Ireland, we will struggle to compete internationally with other countries that are moving very quickly in this space.  More importantly, we risk losing the current window of opportunity to drive significant social and economic change on the island of Ireland by making decent employment available to everyone, regardless of where they live.</p><p> Moving to the draft legislation, it is important to call out that the conversation and the legal frameworks must move away from one-off deals for individual people.  There must be an active move towards a remote-first culture whereby the jobs, not the people, are remote.  That said, Grow Remote strongly welcomes the draft Bill on the right to request remote work as a step in the right direction.  The general scheme and the public debate on the topic of remote working are far too heavily stacked towards providing reasons employers should not enable their staff to work remotely.  We are here to argue that the debate needs to move away from the reasons to say no and towards identifying solutions.  We are taking bad practice and allowing it to hold us back.  For each of the reasons listed in the legislation to say no, innovative, global and fast-growing companies have figured out solutions and are coming for our talent.</p><p> That is why we are so grateful to have one of those leaders, Glofox, here with us today.  Bringing companies such as Glofox into the debate means we can all learn how they are addressing the challenges and building successful remote-first companies.  The committee will really benefit from hearing first-hand how organisations are finding solutions to the challenges that are often raised: challenges such as how to successfully onboard new staff, how to manage health and safety requirements and how to collaborate, communicate and foster a shared sense of culture and belonging.  Glofox and many other companies that Grow Remote works with have put measures in place to meet these challenges and have built successful businesses with a highly engaged and satisfied workforce in a remote setting.  There is a lot we can learn from Glofox and others, and they are willing to share what they have learned with us to support others on the journey.</p><p> Despite the progress made in the past two years, there are still many misconceptions about remote work and we need to address them if we are to truly realise its potential.  Many of these misconceptions are embedded within the draft legislation.  They are misconceptions that will restrict and limit the potential of remote work as a driver of social change.</p><p> Head 6 of the general scheme states that an employee shall be entitled to submit a request for remote work when he or she has completed at least 26 weeks of continuous service with an employer.  We question the need for this eligibility criterion and urge the committee to recommend the removal of this requirement from the draft Bill.  By imposing a six-month eligibility criterion, the legislation restricts one of the key benefits of remote work, the removal of location as a barrier to employment.  When new hires have to be in the office for the first six months of their tenure with a company, they will have no option but to live within commuting distance of the office.  This requirement serves to reinforce a common misconception about remote working, that is, that it is not possible to effectively onboard and ramp up a new hire remotely.  Remote-first companies such as Glofox have proven that it is entirely possible to onboard a new hire remotely and for new employees to feel engaged and connected from day one without any need to default to the office setting.</p><p> Head 12 covers the reasons an employer can decline a request for remote working, with 13 business grounds for refusal listed.  We recognise that there can be valid business reasons for an employer to say no to a request for remote working - for example, connectivity issues or an inadequate work-from-home space.  However, a number of the current reasons for refusal in the draft Bill are far too subjective and open to interpretation.  Some of these reasons serve only to feed into damaging misconceptions about remote work.  For example, one reason for refusal is where an employer "cannot reorganise work among existing staff", which implies that the person working remotely will not be working at full capacity and will need his or her work to be reorganised among other staff to allow for this.  There is strong evidence that remote working enables employees to be more productive, not less, yet this reason gives weight to the myth that people who work remotely are not working as hard as those in the office.  We urge the committee to recommend changes to this head in order that the spirit and letter of the eventual Bill will shift entirely towards supporting companies to say yes to remote working.</p><p> Head 13 states that the right to appeal is limited only to procedural grounds.  We encourage the committee to allow for appeals to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to be based on the substantive decision of the employer, not merely on procedural grounds.  We strongly urge the committee to strengthen the legislation in order that employers must have a firm rationale for refusal that is based on objective and measurable reasons.  We can then be in a position to provide employers with the right supports and guidance to help them overcome these challenges.</p><p> There has been a shift in remote work where we are missing out on tax income because employment is landing in other countries.  We need to support Irish companies to hire without location within Ireland to mitigate this severe and rapidly increasing risk.  This is the committee's opportunity to create a legacy whereby location is no longer a factor in the opportunities available to our people across the country.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  We are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I now invite members who wish to discuss this with representatives of Grow Remote and Glofox.  I remind members participating remotely to use the raised hand feature and, more importantly, when they are finished speaking to take it down.  I ask those in the room to indicate to me.  The first person who has indicated is Deputy O'Reilly.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  I share a lot of the concerns Ms Mangan has about legislation that is, effectively, in some respects, a charter for an employer just to say "No".  Some of the difficulty we have is that remote working is seen as a bit of a gift, something you have to earn, something you might get after a service qualification, a benefit that accrues with service rather than an actual way to run a company.  I hear what Ms Mangan says about the cultural shift that is required.  I also understand what she says about the limitations of proposed legislation, but if this is not driven by positive legislation, we will end up simply codifying the reasons workers will be just told no, and that is not good enough.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste has recognised that the Bill is flawed in many aspects and has indicated that he will accept amendments.</p><p>Hearings such as this are very valuable.  It means we can construct those amendments and make sure that we can make the legislation fit for purpose and make it work and drive the change Ms Mangan talked about.  Ms Mangan mentioned she was working on mapping remote workers.  I was not aware of that.  It is very welcome.  When will that work be completed?  What will the map look like in terms of where remote workers are?</p></speech>

There are no data readily available to say where remote workers are located or how many there are.  There are some data from the Central Statistics Office but we look to build a comprehensive map of where people are throughout the country and the companies for which they work.  We have launched a survey.  It is on the Grow Remote website.  Workers can go to the website, log themselves and put in the details of where they live and what company they work for.  Our ultimate aim is that one will be able to see at a glance where there are clusters of remote workers.  All these data are very valuable in terms of regional dispersion of remote workers, what parts of the country are more popular for remote workers and who the remote employers are in Ireland.  We are building those data.  That is an ongoing project about which we are very excited.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#C00300"><p>It will be very useful.  Added to that, the information from the census will give us a very good picture.  Ms Mangan did not talk much about the hybrid model of half and half, one quarter and three quarters or four and one.  Does Ms Mangan see a role for the hybrid model as well as the remote-only model?  Remote only might work for some but my understanding is that the vast majority of people want to feel that connection to the office and to be physically present sometimes.  It is not for every job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#C00400"><p>Absolutely.  Obviously we are advocates for remote working but we are not necessarily advocates for remote only.  We recognise that not every company is fit to be set up as a fully-remote organisation.  A practical example is where there are staff who have to be in the office or on the premises because of the nature of their role.  Fairly strong evidence has come out in the past year or two through the CSO survey and the Western Development Commission and NUIG Whitaker Institute survey around what employees want to show that probably the majority of workers are looking for a hybrid model.</p> <p>  We advocate for remote but there is not necessarily anything wrong with the hybrid model if it is done in a remote-first way.  What I mean by that is an employer saying that every employee needs to be in the office every Monday and Friday but can work remotely the other days of the week is not an ideal situation, because the employer is not giving flexibility to employees to live where they choose.  I cannot live in the west of Ireland if I have to be in Dublin two days per week or I have a bit of a nightmare commute ahead of me.  The flexibility needs to be there for the employee for him or her to make the choice of whatever suits him or her within the confines of the role.</p> <p>  Ideally, remote first means the employee can decide when to go to the office and when to work from home.  All processes and policies are designed around the fact that there are remote workers.  Where hybrid goes wrong is when it still ticks the office as the default and the remote workers are the forgotten employees.  They are not seen in the office anymore and are invisible.  They may miss out on promotional opportunities.  They may miss out on FaceTime with the boss or the water cooler moments.</p> <p>  Companies that adopt the hybrid model very much need to think about these things and be intentional and plan around the fact that they now have a remote workforce.  Otherwise, they run the risk of having a two-tiered workforce where the remote workers are at a disadvantage.  An important point to make around that is there is evidence to show that more often, but not always, people who look for remote work are women with caring responsibilities or other people who may, for whatever reason in their lives, not thrive as much in the office nine-to-five environment.  They could have hidden illnesses or doctors appointments to which they need to go.  There is a real risk of further marginalising people who may already be marginalised in the first place.  I encourage any company that adopts a hybrid model to take a remote-first approach and design all processes and policies around both office workers and home workers.</p> <p>  Having said that, doing so is very complicated.  Any company we work with that is doing hybrid at present is wrestling with many of these questions.  How does it manage fairness when some people are at home?  Some people are in the office and they can go to the canteen.  What about the home workers?  There is considerable complexity to that.  We need to support employers with these questions because it is what employees want.  However, it is not as simple as letting it happen organically.  Considerable work, thought, intentionality and planning needs to go into it.  </p></speech>

It is its own form of work.  It should have its own sets of procedures to ensure that one can stay connected.  I noted that Ms Mangan referred in the statement to workers as they start being engaged and connected from day one.  Perhaps people who are more used to the traditional model might struggle to understand how that will happen and how one manages that.  Will Mr. Hegarty outline how that works in his company?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.238" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finn Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#C00600"><p>Our company has 220 people all remote.  Some 50% of those folks are in Ireland.  We have been on our remote journey for approximately seven years now.  We were co-located, we were the hybrid model and now we are fully remote.  The challenge in terms of new joiners over the past seven years has certainly been how we onboard these new folks.  We need to get value from these people straight away as they join and try to get them ramped up in a short timeframe.  Doing this remotely poses its challenges especially for those folks in more junior roles.</p> <p>  We are very deliberate about how we onboard people.  We invest a significant amount of time on making sure we onboard people correctly.  That might be significantly more touch points with their manager, making sure they are embedded within the culture and meet other people outside their own department from day one in order that they can feel the overall culture of the company as opposed to feeling isolated.  They are going into a new role.  They are working remotely and not directly working with a manager.  We have certain policies and procedures that we refined over a number of years of being able to ramp up those people quicker.</p> <p>  We hire in clusters.  We have more than 100 people in Ireland.  We plan to hire another 150 or so this year.  Some 80% of those people are outside Dublin.  There is a cluster of folks in each province at this stage.  There are some challenges with the social interaction as well of being remote but the benefit is that we can bring people together once per month or once per quarter.  In terms of the Deputy's question on onboarding, we bring those people together once per month.  One needs that human interaction especially at the start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#C00700"><p>Mr. Hegarty makes a good point about how important human interaction is.  No one wants to get to a situation where we completely lose that but people are very anxious to have the flexibility.  Ms Mangan did not touch on the issue of the right to disconnect.  When a worker's home is his or her workplace, a worker is always and never in work.  Does she see a role for legislation on that?  Should it be built in?  I would absolutely introduce legislation on it.  A worker should have a legal right to disconnect.</p> <p>  In terms of the experience of workers so far, I have a concern that there could be a grey area.  However, it also exists in an office environment.  There is a view that the culture of presenteeism could be challenged by remote working or the hybrid model.  It does not always work like that unless one has the legal right to disconnect.  When Grow Remote works with companies, are they conscious of that?  Are they prepared to do it anyway?  With the best will in the world, a worker still needs that legal protection.  Without it, one will have an issue.</p><p>We all know we are in the middle of a housing crisis.  We could talk all day about how we got there.  We can all see how we got to where we are.  There are many people who live in inappropriate accommodation.  For those people, access to a hub is going to be essential.  Would Ms Mangan see it as the role of the employer to provide the hub or that of the worker to source it?  How would that work?  Could it work in a clustered situation similar to what the banks are doing?  They are bringing their workers together in branch buildings that may not be open; the bank workers are going to be working in there even if the branches are closed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#D00200"><p>On the right to disconnect, it is important that there is a legal framework in place to protect employees from overworking.  I guess before I get into that there are a couple of things to highlight.  Yesterday the Central Statistics Office came out with some figures around remote workers.  It found that remote workers had the highest level of job and life satisfaction of any worker group in Ireland.  That is important to highlight.  While there is a lot of talk about overworking and over-productivity in a remote setting, it is not really borne out in those statistics.</p> <p>  Having said that, there are risks of a greying of boundaries between work and life when we work from home.  Anecdotally we hear people saying they work later.  There is evidence to show people are more productive when they work from home.  I do not think there is evidence as to whether that is down to more hours being worked or because people can focus better and be more efficient and effective when they work remotely.  I would be leaning more towards the latter.  Nevertheless it is important that there are measures in place to protect employees from the risk of overworking.  The right to disconnect is an important piece of the legislation to protect against that.</p> <p>  I also think the onus is on employers and managers, particularly.  This is a very difficult time for people managers.  There are a lot of transitions and transformations they need to make.  Wellness needs to be top of mind for employers.  For most of the employers we work with, including Glofox, wellness is something they are very aware of with their employees, particularly because of the last two years and the situation we have all found ourselves in.  The companies we work with are very mindful of people's time and put measures in place.  For example, people would know from day one that they are not expected to answer a work email outside of working hours.  Email sign-offs include a wording to the effect that if the person receives the email outside their working hours they do not need to answer it.  That is repeated all the time, it is not just said at the beginning and then forgotten by everyone.  It is reinforced.  That is what companies need to do.  They need to be very specific when employees start, telling them they are not expected to answer emails if they are working remotely and it is evening time, that they need to turn off their phone in the evening.</p> <p>  One important benefit of remote working is flexibility.  We are also hearing a lot, particularly from parents who log on early in the morning and do an hour or two before the kids get up.  Then they take an hour or two off and get the kids off to school, then they go back in.  My daughter comes home from school at 2.30 p.m. and I take an hour to be with her.  Then I log back in and work until a little bit later in the evening.  We do not want to lose the benefit of the flexibility.  People like to schedule work around their life but we do not want work to take over their lives.  There is a balance to be found.</p></speech>

We have seen significant progress in remote working over the past two years, helped in part by the pandemic.  We have also seen the springing up of a large number of hubs across the country.  We recently saw the opening of the co:worx hub in Edgeworthstown in County Longford.  It is a wonderful initiative which is really going to help champion the cause of remote working.</p> <p>  It is important to point out that there are some people who still like to go into the workplace.  This was borne out throughout Covid also.  There are people who like the social aspect of going to work.  While remote working is good and has many positive outcomes, there are people who still want to go into the workplace.  We have to acknowledge them as well.  One of the previous speakers was correct that the blended work pattern is now the second most important item when it comes to negotiating terms and conditions with an employer, after salary.  There is no doubt that people in the main want the opportunity to work remotely.</p> <p>  The legislation is what it is.  It is never going to please everybody.  At the same time, we have to try to come to a point where we accommodate workers but also as many businesses as is humanly possible.  We have to acknowledge that 96% of employers in Ireland employ fewer than 19 people.  That is evident when I look out from my constituency office back home.  I can see those small businesses first hand and know how challenging it is going to be for them to move to a remote working situation.  It was suggested that there could be funding for businesses to help them move towards remote working.  Could Ms Mangan expand on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#D00400"><p>The Deputy's question ties in with the point he made about small businesses.  The shift to remote work has been quite a costly exercise for a lot of companies.  The larger multinationals have been able to pivot more easily because their infrastructure and technology was set up to work remotely before the pandemic.  They are international businesses and are used to working with distributed teams.  It is the small to medium-sized companies in the main that have really struggled with remote working.  I am talking about companies that would have been paper based with paper files.  Nobody would have ever used Zoom before.  They may have had desktops on desks and no laptops.  Imagine those companies suddenly being told they had to work remotely.  The challenges they faced in the last two years and particularly the costs are something we think they need some support with.  That is what we are asking for.</p> <p>  We would like to see a local enterprise office, LEO, fund or grant system set up similar to what has been provided in the past for digital readiness for companies.  The cost is an up-front cost so in the longer term we would see a cost saving for businesses if they make the move to remote in terms of being able to reduce their real estate footprint and other efficiencies that may be gained through remote working.  We are not talking about a long-term funding model or supports but something to kick-start and support companies that have had to invest quite a lot of money.  There is also a time and resources factor.  It is not just the cost of equipment, technology or infrastructure.  A lot of companies have had to appoint someone to do this full time.  In Grow Remote I work every day with people whose job is the remote transformation.  That applies to large and small companies.  The time and resource issue is also costly for businesses.</p></speech>

Has Ms Mangan seen any examples in Europe of governments that have done this and how it has worked?  She referred to the e-voucher, a &euro;2,000 payment on behalf of the business to an e-mentor or business to help them develop their website.  Is she thinking of something like that?</p></speech>

I do not have an amount in mind or anything like that but I am referring to a once-off grant or voucher that can be used to support a business's remote work transformation or remote-ready transformation similar to the digital transformation that companies have been through in the past.</p> <p>  I am not aware of any specific countries that have a similar model.  Portugal is very ahead of the game when it comes to supports and legislation and being very proactive around remote working.  There may be something like that in place there.  We could have a look at that after the meeting if the Deputy is interested in finding out more.</p></speech>

One of my sons told me recently I am not a digital native.  I looked it up and discovered that I might be a digital immigrant or even a digital refugee.</p><p>That goes to the heart of some of what Ms Mangan has been saying where it is not just legislation but a change of mindset, of how we view things, and so on, that is needed.  For many employers, businesses, companies and workers, this is very new and very challenging.  There are built-in prejudices that if someone is not there under someone's gaze, perhaps they are not working at all but are skiving off.  I know of one particular young man at the moment who is employed in Ireland but is based in Mauritius and he is extraordinarily productive, doing very well and making a great deal of money for his company.  Perhaps the issue of the change of mindset is where we need to get to.  Ms Mangan cited that early on in her presentation, if one reads between the lines.  </p><p> I have a number of questions.  Ms Mangan mentioned that there are more than 80,000 remote jobs available in Ireland today.  Could she expand on that please at some stage?  Can she tell us exactly where that figure comes from, what kind of jobs they are, if they are available and, if there are difficulties in filling them, why is that the case?  </p><p> Could she also talk a small bit about the hubs and the hot desk offices?  I have said in the D&aacute;il on a few occasions that I do not believe we are thinking big enough on this issue.  In many rural towns people leave them in the mornings and there are lines and lines of traffic heading into cities and into big companies where they sit at desks all day for much of their time.  They could do that in their own towns.  </p><p> Working in one&rsquo;s own house is difficult.  I have also read, and perhaps our guests might help me on this point, that it can be quite expensive if one is at home all day in respect of heating, lighting and so forth, where the carbon emissions can actually go up if one is working at home rather than working at a central employment point, and so forth.  I have been looking at the idea of the larger remote working hubs in towns and villages.  In some of the provincial towns, in particular, one can leave home, go to work but not actually have to travel into a city 20 km or 30 km away.  Ms Mangan might comment on that please.</p><p> I also know that she mentioned Portugal as having best practice.  Could Ms Mangan talk about third level; I believe the University of Edinburgh and perhaps MIT have also done a great deal of work in this area?  Perhaps those universities should be leading the way here by not having all of their students going to a central campus but in having more remote working areas.  </p><p> Should workers have a choice as to whether they might like to work remotely as opposed to employers insisting that workers would have to work remotely?  Should we look at this the other way in respect of workers having a choice as to whether they would like to go into the office for half or some of the time, or whatever, rather than having to stay home, especially if there is not a hot desk or hub in the workers' town or locality?</p><p> There are many businesses which cannot facilitate remote working and I believe Ms Mangan alluded to some of those in her earlier presentation.  Should we give those companies an opt-out at the very beginning so that they would not have to actually prepare a policy in this regard?  It seems to me to be time-wasting and expensive for a company or business to have to prepare a policy in this area if none of their workers can work remotely.  I am thinking here perhaps of services where people work in nursing homes, for instance, where people have to go in, or in restaurants where people have to attend, or plumbing companies where people have to be physically on site.</p><p> Those are all of my questions for the moment, Chairman.</p></speech>

I will address the Deputy&rsquo;s first point about mindset.  I agree with that.  It is all about a big mindset and culture shift for these companies, particularly if one is coming from a co-located office to a hybrid workforce.  It is not just a case of getting a policy and the technology.  It is very much about creating, as Ms Mangan mentioned, this remote-first culture and a fundamental change in the way we work.  That is, in the way that we communicate with each other, how we manage people, how we manage performance and how we on-board staff.  These are all fundamental changes in the way of working as a business.  That is not easy as we went through this for the past seven years and we did not have the support.  I see Grow Remote out there now and we need to support these small businesses with that content and in how they can make that shift.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s point in respect of the hubs, that is something where we give our employee the choice as to whether he or she wants to come in.  We have an office in Dublin, and a couple of smaller offices around Ireland as well, and we give them a choice.  If they do not have a suitable working arrangement in their house where it could be shared accommodation straight out of college, we would compensate them in going into a local hub.  I even worked last week from Achill Island and there are these very good hubs out there that have the connectivity and the infrastructure to support these roaming in and out workforces.  </p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s final point on the opt-out policy, it certainly makes sense for certain businesses that would not necessarily need this requirement to have this exemption, whether this is construction or services for businesses.  I will pass over to Ms Mangan now, please.</p></speech>

These are jobs that can be taken up by individuals living in Ireland and the jobs are across Europe.  These jobs cover every industry and every type of job.  One would be amazed at what jobs are being done remotely compared to two years ago.<br/><br/>On the topic of the hubs, I am very glad that Mr. Hegarty has highlighted the fact that his company uses hubs because we believe that hubs are a fantastic resource and are possibly an underutilised one right now.  It is a little hard to say because they only started opening up since the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted.  We see hubs as an answer to many of the puzzles of remote working.  One of the big ones of these is the social aspect and interaction as not everybody likes to work in their home and not every day, at any rate.  One may wish to get away from the house for a day or a week and the hubs are a very good solution to that as one can meet other people and can connect and network.  One can also pop to the local coffee shop on one&rsquo;s lunch and spend some money locally.  They are very good for the local economy and they also answer other issues around, for example, Internet availability.  If one does not have a good enough Internet service one can use a hub.  <br/><br/>There is also the fact that not everyone has the luxury of a home office.  We have heard some horror stories of people sharing flats where there are two people at a kitchen table trying to do calls at the same time.  The hubs answer many questions and provide answers to many of the challenges around remote working.  <br/><br/>Our view on the hubs is that, first, the Government has done great work on rolling out and committing to 400 hubs nationwide and we are seeing hubs being put in place all over the country in some really amazing places.  Mr. Hegarty mentioned Achill Island, and one can find these up in Donegal and down in Dingle.  Many of these hubs are of a very high quality, have a very good Internet connection and it is almost like being in an office in respect of the standard available.  <br/><br/>What needs to happen and what is not happening yet is that employers are not really taking up the hubs in any great numbers and it is still being driven by the individual employee.  I might decide that I would like to work in a hub so I will ask my employer and they will say &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;.  In the main it is that situation where I may end up paying for it myself.  It is a question then as to whether the employer will pay for it or I will pay for it.  Ideally, the employee should not necessarily have to cover the cost.  That is a question that is yet to be answered.  <br/><br/>We are seeing other cases where it is small business owners, entrepreneurs, people who are working for themselves or freelancers who are using the hubs right now.  There is definitely scope and potential there to drive the occupancy and uptake of the hubs among employees and it has to start with going to businesses and encouraging them to share the benefits, and perhaps addressing some of the challenges as they may have some issues or challenges around security or privacy.  These are things that the hub owners are more than happy to talk to businesses about.  It is really about bringing the hub owners and that organisation together with employers to find ways to better utilise those hubs, which are a fantastic resource.<br/><br/>On the question of third level, that is a difficult one to answer.  We talk about employment rather than education.  Education is moving more towards digital learning but I also know that the third level universities want to have people coming on to the campus.  It is a little difficult for me to give my viewpoint on that.  We are a training organisation not a university but we do a great deal of online and blended learning, which is becoming more common.  Some students like to be able to do this work in their own time from home but I would not want to give a comprehensive answer on that because it is not really an area that we are involved in.<br/><br/>On the question of workers' choice, yes, they should have such a choice if a worker wants to go to the office and if there is one in place.</p><p>At the end of the day, it comes down to choice.  If people are going for a job and in the job description there is no office, they can look for something else if they do not like that.  It is quite a misconception that remote companies do not have offices or a premises and people do not meet.  We often say that people are remote at first but they are not remote only.  As Mr. Hegarty said, we need to find ways to bring employees to get the social interaction and collaboration.</p><p> A lot of the organisations we work and partner with have premises or an office.  They may have a satellite office or couple of offices, use a hub or have headquarters in Dublin.  For example, Liberty Insurance made the move to fully remote from in office while maintaining a couple of offices around the country.  Its staff are allowed to go into the office for up to two days, but no more than that.  They have to use the office for something they would not necessarily do at home.  Nobody goes into the office to sit at a desk and work on emails by themselves all day.  People go in to the office for meetings, team events, collaborations, brainstorming sessions and those kinds of things.</p><p> I would not necessarily be militant about saying that workers should not have a choice.  There is a place for the office.  Most companies will retain that.  The number has grown and will continue to grow, but we are still talking about 20% to 25% of companies that might consider fully remote, whereas in the main there will be a hybrid model involving an office or premises.</p></speech>

Returning to the proposed legislation, successful countries have a different approach in a way that would promote the evolution of solutions.  Could the witnesses suggest some amendments?  For example, if we are to move to remote first, I understand the proposed legislation envisages that employers should have a statement on remote working.  Could that be strengthened?  Do the witnesses have suggestions as to how that would be done?</p> <p>  In the view of the witnesses, would removing the six-month eligibility criteria be an absolute in all cases or would they allow some employers to specify that certain jobs would be handled differently?  What is the experience of the witnesses on the practicalities of making legislative proposals that will apply to everyone, rather than just the pioneers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.256" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#F00400"><p>With the eligibility criteria, for the most part if a job can be done remotely, it can be done remotely from the outset.  As I mentioned in my statement, it is reinforcing a misconception about remote work that we need to be in the office to get ramped up.  That sets everybody off on the wrong foot and basically says that the office is better for certain things.  In this case, as Mr. Hegarty spoke about, the office is not necessarily a better place for onboarding.  Onboarding can be done from home, we just need to put the right processes and policies in place to make that work.</p> <p>  We would like to see the eligibility criteria removed on a practical level.  For example, people working for an organisation that will offer them remote work in six months' time have to wait six months before they know they can relocate.  I live in Athenry.  If I apply for a job, I cannot apply for one in Dublin.  I am missing out on those opportunities because I need to be in an office for six months which would not work for me.  That creates an issue.  Does the Deputy have another question?</p></speech>

The only other one I know of is the Portuguese model, which I understand is more heavily weighted towards the employee choice as opposed to the employer having a rationale for being able to refuse requests.  I do not have the details of that legislation in front of me.  I am not able to give any more definite information on that.</p></speech>

Ms Mangan gave a passionate contribution on the potential of remote work.  I hear what she is saying in terms of legislation alone not being sufficient.  It is, of course, vital to have a strong legislative framework.  We are here today because we had pre-legislative scrutiny of the right to request flexible work.</p> <p>  Last week, the Government announced a work-life balance Bill.  Both proposed Bills have a very rigid perspective on who should access remote and flexible work.  Should the Government see remote and flexible work as separate things?  From the perspective of the Labour Party, we see the right to flexible work with regard to the hours and place of work as being the same thing.  We produced a Bill on the right to request that.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on the separation of flexible and remote work, in particular in the context of everything they have said with regard to women and other groups of workers who may want to access the labour force.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#F00900"><p>There is, obviously, a distinction between remote and flexible work.  However, we would see them as being within the same sphere.  Ultimately, it starts with trust and flexibility for employees.  Out of that, businesses start looking at different models.  The different models that come out of that are things like remote and flexible work.  They are definitely in the same family, even though there are differences between them.</p> <p>  I keep talking about a remote culture because it is not just an employer telling me I can sit at home and work but I still have to continue my 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day and everything else stays the same.  There is a cultural shift that comes from remote working, and it is important to emphasise that.  Within that culture is flexibility.  Flexibility of choice, location and hours worked and also trust in terms of the work people are doing are important.  It is not just a different style of working; it is a completely different approach to work.</p> <p>  That is where the flexibility in terms of flexible hours, to which the Senator referred, also comes in.  For people who are working remotely, it does not work to be told they have to be at a desk at 9 a.m., a boss will check up on them to make sure they are there at 9 a.m., they have to be there at 5.30 p.m. and take a lunch break between 12 noon and 1 p.m.  Some people do that and like that structure but, as I said earlier, some people may want to work around their caring or other responsibilities.</p> <p>  A lot of companies that have remote working options in place also offer other flexible options, such as different start and finish times or reduced hours.  We have not seen a four-day week with any of the companies we have worked with, but it is something that is getting a little traction.  Some companies, including our company, offer unlimited paid time off.  That can sound completely crazy, but for some companies it is about the idea that people manage their work, do it when they need to do it and take their leisure time.  Life takes over at the times when it suits the people.  We would definitely see those things as interrelated.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the T&aacute;naiste has said he will come forward with amendments, but that was two months ago and we have yet to see any detail on that.</p> <p>  We are conscious that not every worker can work remotely.  In the Labour Party Bill, we referred to the grounds for refusal relating to data protection and confidentiality, because there is an issue with regards to security, a minimal level of Internet connectivity and the work space, because not every person's home is suitable to work in.  Reference was made to the fact that some people are house sharing or there are two people at a kitchen table.  Are there other grounds for refusal?  Should there be fewer grounds for refusal?  I am interested in hearing the perspective of the witnesses because we are discussing what the ideal Bill should look like.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#F01100"><p>The reasons for refusal should reflect the feasibility and reality of whether the job can be done.</p><p>The first reason, then, is that the job cannot be done remotely.  Even with that, companies need to interrogate their assumptions around certain jobs.  I say that because we are still seeing, even after the last two years, that it is the same types of jobs in the same types of industries that have more remote working than others.  Examples include the technology sector and other professional services.  Other jobs can be done remotely as well.  With a little bit of imagination and open-mindedness, companies could see that certain jobs could be done remotely, or be done remotely some of the time.  However, if the job that needs to be done involves practical aspects such as serving customers face-to-face or working a machine, for example, then it is not possible for people to work remotely in those situations.  Other similar practical aspects involved include Internet connectivity and a lack of suitable desk space or a place to work safely because of health and safety reasons.  Those are all valid reasons jobs cannot be done remotely.</p><p> For businesses, there are also other reasons.  I feel we must give businesses a little bit of a break in this regard as well.  Sometimes perhaps, and in the media especially, there is a misconception that there are some big bad companies that just do not like remote working and that they are dinosaurs making everyone go back to the office.  Perhaps there are a few of those companies, but as I said earlier many challenges are encountered in making the transformation.  It is not as easy as everyone just going home and working remotely.  It is very difficult.  I talk every day to representatives of companies that are struggling, including those that have significant resources and large budgets to spend on this undertaking.  Therefore, we must give a little bit of leeway to companies.</p><p> Having said that, however, some reasons given do not make sense.  I mentioned one of those already in the context of ensuring remote working can be embedded.  Another example is the distance from the office to the home being judged too far.  That really questions the whole logic of remote working, because where anyone lives should not be a factor.  Given everything I have said already, location should not be a factor when it comes to remote working.  Another reason given that is subjective is the quality of work being impacted.  Again, the question here is how it can be proved that the quality of work has been impacted.  This is about measurable, objective and fair grounds being used in the context of remote working requests and giving employees the option to be able to question decisions.  If they are not happy or satisfied, then what is required is to provide frameworks to enable them to take a request further, while also balancing the needs businesses have in respect of the time, space, resources and support they require to overcome some of the challenges faced.</p></speech>

I recall that the American with Disabilities Act 1990 famously had a system whereby it was necessary to have a statement about a policy in that regard.  It was then necessary to show each year that positions had been evolved to ensure it would not be a case of just saying that things were done a certain way and that was that.  It was necessary to show each year that reasonable steps were being taken to advance the policy.  If we could change this legislation to envisage that sort of approach, would that be a practical way to evolve it?</p> <p>  Turning to the public service, it seems to me that some of the bodies that are the most reluctant to undertake remote working are in the public service itself.  Has Ms Mangan any data that could shed light on resistance within the public service to remote working and the advantages for the public service of moving to a remote-first strategy?  The impression one gets is that the sort of command-and-control approach which still prevails leads to shutters being thrown up straightaway.  Can we evolve some legislative nudges, which I think is the word people use, to force the public service, as well as the private sector, to undertake this approach?</p> <p>  I have a question that Mr. Hegarty might address.  One possible way of resolving this issue in legislation is that we could see the establishment of codes of practice that companies would not be required to apply immediately.  Over time, however, those would become factors used in situations where employers had unreasonably turned down requests for remotely working.  Has Glofox evolved a set of protocols that could be pointed to for use in dealing with the onboarding aspect described, as well as to some of the other tricky issues employers throw up as being obstacles?  Perhaps we could learn from that approach and enshrine in legislation the expectation that codes would evolve and that companies would have to respond.  Drawing on his experience, does Mr. Hegarty think that a remote-first approach will be accompanied by significant vacating of office properties?  Has Glofox's advocacy of this approach been substantially driven by a desire to avoid property costs as well as running the company in a different way?</p></speech>

I will deal with the first two and then pass over to Mr. Hegarty for the third.  Deputy Bruton's suggestion is a reasonable one in respect of evolving the legislation or asking companies to state their position today and then returning to them and seeing where they are in a year&rsquo;s time.  That is exactly what we are talking about.  I have said this several times.  We keep talking about a balance between carrot and stick approaches for employers.  We want to push employers and we want them to adopt remote working, because this is not going to work without them.  We need them to be creating the jobs and making them available without being location-specific.  Having said that, however, we must also understand the challenges that companies are facing and that not all companies are not where we would like them to be, or where they could be, regarding transitioning to a remote-first culture.  Therefore, the idea of companies stating their position now, while also putting commitments and measures in place to evolve over time, is a practical and positive one for those companies far behind in this regard.</p> <p>  I keep talking about the difference between technology companies and small businesses.  They are worlds apart in respect of where they could be with remote working.  Including a requirement in the legislation to have a policy, even when remote working may not be available, is a good approach.  I refer to situations where that policy would evolve and need to be revisited over time, with certain steps being put in place to move the needle forward.  I say that because much of the rationale in the legislation for refusing remote working requests involves things that can be overcome.  They are things that Mr. Hegarty and companies like Glofox have been able to overcome.  However, companies might not know how to do that now, so we must bring them on that journey.</p> <p>  Turning to the question on the public service, we have no data in this regard.  Anecdotally, we have heard of public sector organisations bringing people back to the office.  The public service does appear to be much slower than the private sector in respect of a longer-term adoption of remote working.  We are happy to see that the Government has committed to making 20% of jobs remote.  We would like to see how that will play out.  If that 20% refers to the working time of public servants, then that means working remotely one day each week.  That is not necessarily going to have the transformative power we would like to see remote working having.  We are calling for the public sector to adopt remote working much more broadly and to make remote working available to employees in the public sector in the same way that it is available to employees in the private sector.  I ask Mr. Hegarty to address the third question from the Deputy.</p></speech>

Organisations like Grow Remote have not always existed.  People have learned from international companies, as well as from some peer companies in Ireland, about what they have done regarding onboarding.  We evolved that over time and now we have our own documentation and procedures.  Working with Grow Remote, we have come up with a playbook to share those best practices, whether those involve onboarding, how to manage people remotely and-or establishing a remote first culture.  That has all been documented and we have been working closely with other peers in Ireland as well to come up with a playbook.  The key thing is to share that with new businesses to ensure they can pick up these approaches.  Every culture and every company is different, so there is a need to adapt.  Having this framework, however, is a good start.</p> <p>  Turning to Deputy Bruton&rsquo;s question regarding the key driver in making this shift, we had seven offices globally before and cost is one of the benefits, but it was not the original driver of this change.  We made this shift because it enabled us to get access to talent.  We are a technology company and Dublin was a very competitive location in which to try to scale up our team.  We were competing against the Googles and Facebooks of the world.  For us, therefore, this shift was about getting the best talent and not necessarily having to hire those folks in Dublin.</p><p>For us, that was the driver, and it still is.  It has resulted in a competitive advantage for us because we provide the flexibility to hire people wherever they are based.  Covid has shifted everyone's mindset in the past few years towards at least thinking about making the shift to hybrid or remote working.  My concern is that we are not just competing against Irish companies for talent anymore.  There is a massive talent war right now in the tech space.  We are actually competing against global companies because they are remote as well.  Those who join a company in the EU, UK or US are still in Ireland, but we are losing their talent.  That is the risk.  This Bill is a great step towards addressing this, but the risk is that we will lose the talent to other companies if we do not make a fundamental shift.</p></speech>

I compliment them on the submission and opening statement.  From my experience, the submission was among the best we have had in the past few years.  Ms Mangan mentioned Senator Currie and her work in this field over the past couple of years.  Senator Currie has, within her own party, brought this forward.  Unfortunately, she cannot be here today but I know she is watching.  She has asked me to make a contribution on her behalf.  I will say essentially what she would say, and then ask questions.  She said she supports the witnesses' submission and concerns, which she believes can be fixed.  She entirely agrees that this is not just about legislation, which has been described as a floor of rights, but that it is also about breaking through the ceiling and creating better opportunities for people and communities.  A national campaign and supports are essential.  Senator Currie would add that we need to match the demand for remote working and investing in remote-ready communities that create a supply of remote workers in every part of the country.  Other countries have this legislation but it goes hand in hand with culture change where it is successful.  Can the witnesses directly address employers' concerns and how they might be overcome?  Concerns can be about insurance, health and safety, onboarding, cybersecurity, data protection, fostering a team dynamic, and how, and if, staff are monitored.  Some of these have been listed as grounds to refuse remote work.  Could the witnesses tell the committee how, in their experience, they can be overcome?  I will come back with some other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#H00600"><p>I reiterate our thanks to Senator Currie for her support.  She was advocating for remote work long before I joined Grow Remote.  I am very disappointed she was not able to be with us today.  There are many employer concerns, with good reason.  We have worked in offices for over a hundred years and never got that perfect.  Therefore, we cannot expect the new model of remote working to work perfectly after two years, particularly when we were implementing it in the middle of an emergency.  The remote working over the past two years is not how we envisage remote working in the future.  One of the most important aspects of making remote working work is careful, deliberate planning on the part of companies, with support and guidance to help them along the journey.</p> <p>  How can these challenges be addressed?  One of the most important aspects involves what we are doing today: bringing a company like Glofox into the public arena and hearing about how it is addressing some of the challenges.  Glofox and some of the other companies we talked to will hold their hands up and say they do not have all the answers yet, which means we are in a period of experimentation and transformation.  The more open companies are about this, the better.  Last September, Grow Remote founded an alliance called the Remote Alliance and brought together some of the companies that are in the process of transformation, including eBay, ESB, Vodafone and Liberty Insurance.  The purpose was to hear from them about how they are addressing the challenges and to share solutions publicly.  That is what we need to be doing over the next year or two, or even longer, as companies start testing.  Really, we are still testing this model, particularly the hybrid model.  It did not really exist before, or not in any systemic, procedural way.  Where it existed, it may have been a one-off.  We need to support companies with some of the supports I have talked about today.  We need to ensure companies are given platforms and opportunities to share through organisations such as Grow Remote so that we can build a library of case studies and references and so companies can follow guidelines, playbooks and how-to guides on how to make the changes.  The most important thing is to give companies an opportunity to share publicly how they are addressing these challenges.</p></speech>

Ms Mangan mentioned supports from local enterprise offices in her contribution and how these could assist businesses in making a financially beneficial transition.  Could she expand on that?  Is the biggest issue with the legislation that it does not reflect and unlock the full potential of locationless work?  Could she talk about the local enterprise offices' work?  Could she talk about her organisation's chapters in communities and the work done in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.276" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#H00800"><p>The legislation is not necessarily the lever that will unlock locationless work in Ireland.  As I said at the start, it is more than being just about legislation; it is about a systemic, cultural shift we are making in Ireland.  Some of the feedback we have given on the legislation relates in particular to removing some of the misconceptions about remote work, building in opportunities to identify solutions and coming up with ways to address some of the challenges so companies will not just say they will not allow remote work because of all the challenges we list.  It is a matter of having a bit of a driver and support for companies to help them in overcoming those challenges.</p> <p>  I can talk a little about Grow Remote's work.  At our heart, we are a local community development organisation that advocates remote work as a driver of community development.  We have a very broad community of members, who are local people all over the country and beyond who come together in person as well as online.  Much of this is about solving the social isolation that remote working can cause.  We have chapters in towns and villages all over Ireland whose members meet up, get to know each other and engage in local activities.  Our chapters, which are groups of remote workers around the country, are also very instrumental in promoting remote jobs available in their towns.  They are almost like mini jobs boards in the towns around Ireland.   They might ask people whether they know they can get a great job in Shopify or eBay and do it from their locality.  It is a matter of spreading the word and generating awareness.  The chapters also play a key role in attracting people back to towns.  They are trying to reinvigorate their local communities.  Those are the three things our chapters are driving.  Even though we are all about remote working, we are actually very focused on face-to-face, offline community activity because we regard remote work as the lever to enable it.  Owing to the additional time remote work gives and because it enables people to stay in their town, members of local communities will have the time and space to meet up, contribute to the local GAA club or join Tidy Towns.</p></speech>

I am a fan of remote working.  It offers a great opportunity, particularly around the regions.  Anything that reduces people's commuting time has to be welcomed in promoting a green environment.  May I ask a couple of questions?  Ms Mangan said her organisation is surveying people on remote working and remote-working hubs all around the country.  Has it surveyed the types of employment that lend themselves to remote working and specifically the types that do not?</p><p>Is there an opportunity to see if ways of working can be adapted?  I know some cannot and, for instance, a forklift driver is very unlikely to be remote working any time soon.  Where do the witnesses think that is going?  How will we produce graduates in the future who are going to be oriented to the idea of moving into jobs that have a high technology component that probably lend themselves to remote working?  That is the first point.</p><p> The second point is that I think blended working is where we are going to arrive at the finish.  Most businesses will find there are benefits to both remote working and having people in the workplace for all of the reasons that were mentioned, such as access to the boss, access to promotion, being visible and being seen doing what they are doing.  I believe blended working is the way to go and, therefore, it brings up the whole issue of trying to get broadband rolled out nationally to give people an offering.  I would like an answer to those points.</p><p> On a point that has come up at the committee previously, Mr. Hegarty&rsquo;s company is 100% remote, as he pointed out.  Does he have any issues around the idea of employee liability where an employee might suffer an accident in the workplace while working from home?  Has he had any issues in that regard and could he outline any of those?  Those are my two questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.279" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#J00200"><p>On the first question, in our survey, which is our map of remote employees and their employers around Ireland, we do ask the type of work the person is doing, so that data are something we will have available and that we are building on.  There has been other research in this area.  I cannot recall the organisation that did research on the types of jobs that can be done remotely - it was a consultancy, perhaps Deloitte or some company like that - but I can look it up after this meeting.  As to what types of employment are more suitable to remote working, it did identify that it is more the knowledge jobs.  We also see this at Grow Remote because we have a remote jobs board and we just recently launched a new one.  Through the data from last year, we were able to pull what types of jobs were being advertised there.  It was still quite heavily weighted towards tech jobs, that is, jobs in the technology sector, in software engineering and in data, and so on, but growing more and more are jobs in other sectors such as marketing, legal and sales.  One very fast-growing area is customer service and support, and Shopify, HubSpot and eBay are good examples of companies with quite large customer support teams.  A lot of that is moving to remote because these are jobs where the person is on the phone or email all day and does not have to be co-located with the customer, and as it is all done virtually, it can be done from anywhere.</p> <p>  Obviously, there are jobs that cannot be done remotely but, as I mentioned, we also need to keep an open mind about not boxing certain jobs into a non-remote box because what we are not seeing yet is the jobs such as administrative and secretarial jobs.  What we would love to see is more of what we might call the more entry-level jobs and the less well-paid jobs becoming remote.  What we definitely do not want to see is a type of two-tier inequality, where the really high-paying, high-quality, high-education and high-skills jobs are remote because there is a war for talent in that sector.  We want to see companies being open-minded about making remote jobs available across the board if the job can be done remotely and if it is feasible to do so.</p> <p>  It is very important that graduates are upskilled and ready to adapt to remote working from day one.  We have a training programme, Remote Work Ready, which we are developing right now to gear towards graduates.  There are certain skills people need to learn to be able to work remotely.  These are all very teachable and easy to pick up, but there are certain skills and a certain profile that people need to develop to be able to successfully work remotely.</p> <p>  I will pass on to Mr. Hegarty for the second question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Finn Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#J00300"><p>I want to make a point on the first question.  There was a statement around blended or hybrid work being the future but that having people come into the office is going to help them get promotion because they get that visibility.  That was definitely a challenge that we faced when we had that hybrid structure in that our remote workers felt they did not have that visibility, they were out of sight, out of mind, and they were being overlooked for promotion.  We had to shift our performance management and the way we made promotions in order to not have that bias for people who were not in the office or in person even some of the time.  That is a deliberate change we had to make to put everyone on that level playing field.  Even as we made that shift to hybrid, that was something we had to change because we did not want to create the stigma that people who are outside the office are not going to progress in their careers at the same time.</p> <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on liability, when new joiners come on board, on an annual basis we do health and safety assessments for their workspace and where they are working.  We have insurance which covers us for home workers and we have various controls around security to make sure we are protected when folks are out of the office.  Fortunately, we have not had any incidents where someone has had an accident in the home but that is definitely an area we need to do more research on regarding who is liable in that instance - for example, if someone is making a cup of coffee and slips, are we liable?  That is the sort of issue we are still doing a bit more research on.</p></speech>

It was said that the six-month period is potentially a barrier that is causing people to be hoovered up by companies which are offering remote working.  Is there a halfway house?  I wonder is it fair to ask employers who are taking on new hires to immediately offer them a remote working opportunity if they have not seen them operating within the business and if they have not got their feet under the table to some degree.  Is that something that is achievable within three months?  I can understand the reason the six months is there but I can also understand the point made by Grow Remote that it is potentially creating a recruitment challenge.  Would a halfway house of three months perhaps meet the needs of both parties?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#J00500"><p>It still opens the question of the practicality of that person having to be in the office for the first three months where he or she may not be living in that area, so I would still question the need.  I would go back to my original point about the misconception that it is too hard to onboard a new hire remotely.  I know a lot of people started new jobs in the last two years completely remotely and they are probably only now travelling into the office and seeing their colleagues for the first time face to face, which is not ideal either.  To go back to what we were talking about earlier, it is important in the onboarding stage or the ramp-up stage that a new hire actually gets to meet, where possible, face-to-face with his or her manager and team, but that does not necessarily mean the person needs to be in the office every day for that first three months.  As I said, people do not have to be 100% remote and not meet face-to-face.  That social interaction, collaboration and opportunity to meet are important.  People get more out of a half-hour face-to-face meeting than they might do over a week on virtual, and I know that myself from our team.  Giving opportunities to meet is one thing but I would still question the need to have it in the legislation as a specific time period.</p></speech>

A key enabler of that is the availability of artificial intelligence, AI.  I see that 23% of Irish enterprises rely on artificial intelligence or use artificial intelligence, which I think is the highest rate across all EU member states.  That says something in itself.  The conversation today is very much about promoting remote work but my particular interest is about protecting workers in the context of remote work.  I would be interested to hear the perspective of Ms Mangan and Mr. Hegarty on the need to introduce projections for how artificial intelligence is used with regard to how workers are managed, in particular because AI has transformed how work is managed in some instances, though not in all.  Do the witnesses believe there is a need to set down legislative protections for workers in that regard and, by extension, ensure that remote working can become an even greater and more accepted feature of the world of work in this country?</p></speech>

The use of technology to monitor employee activity goes against everything I said about trust.  We would not be supportive of companies that use this technology.  There are many questions around data privacy and security, particularly with regard to working from home.  People are in the background when people are being monitored through cameras.  There is the privacy of the people in the background to take into account.  I would be very hesitant to recommend any type of monitoring tool.</p> <p>  I can only speak from my experience, which is that in Ireland it is not used in any real widespread way by the companies we work with.  Luckily in Ireland we have GDPR regulations.  We have some legislation in place to protect in terms of the use of these technologies and privacy.  I would not be in favour of it.  At Grow Remote we support the idea that people trust their employees.  Give employees targets and outline and communicate well what is expected of them.  Give them the support and guidance they need.  Employers should make sure they take care of employees and give them plenty of opportunities to interact with the manager or teams and they will get their work done.  That is all employers need to do rather than breathing down people's necks virtually.  It is the same idea as breathing down their necks in the office.  That is also bad management practice.</p></speech>

It goes back to Ms Mangan's point on trust.  We create a culture of trust.  One of our values is that we trust our team.  We do not manage whether they are online from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  We measure people on outputs and achieving results.  It is not about the number of hours they clock up during the day.  It is about getting the tasks done and getting the results.  It is not easy.  We have had managers who came from an environment where they were co-located and then they had to go into a remote environment.  They may have been a micromanager or sat next to the team.  They have to make a shift to trust the team and measure on output and not necessarily monitor their every hour or wonder why they are not getting a response at 3 p.m.  People's days are much more flexible now.  This is a key element.  We are against any monitoring or using such tools.  We use tools to better collaborate and better communicate in the remote and hybrid world but not anything on the monitoring side.</p></speech>

We need to see an increase in the number of hubs throughout the country.  Of course there is concern among some that remote work is an attempt to fragment workplaces or that hubs would displace the office.  I want to be crystal clear.  Does Ms Mangan see hubs as a complement to the office as opposed to a substitute for the office?</p></speech>

The hybrid model would be not necessarily a replacement.  There is always a place for the office and many companies will retain their offices.  As I also said, many companies will let go their premises.  We have heard of many companies that have already done this and have decided to make the move to going remote.  The hub brings in another place to work.  People think working remotely means working from home but it does not.  Home is one place people can work.  Working remotely means working without a specific location.  A hub is a good option and it complements the home.  It also complements the office.  There is no ideal model I can share today.  Grow Remote is very much in favour of fully remote working.  If the job can be fully remote it means people can live in their community.  Many companies are trying different approaches.  Some companies use a hub plus home model.  Some companies use a home plus office model.  We even have some that use an office plus hub plus home model.  It adds another option.  It is a really good option for people where the office is too far away or where they do not want to travel to the office every day but where their home is not necessarily a suitable location or where they want to meet people in the local area.</p></speech>

In the Bill before us there is no recognition of this past experience.  In our Bill on the right to flexible work we speak about using the experience of flexible work as a ground to enable workers.  Would this be useful to ensure that greater numbers of workers can access remote working?</p></speech>

This would be more leaning towards the experience employees have had and how much they want to continue working remotely.  How this is embedded in the legislation I cannot say but it is something that needs to be taken into account when the legislation is being finalised.  It is something that employees want.  Many employees are afraid they will be brought back to their office and they will not have a right or recourse to be able to say they cannot do so.  Over the past year we have learned that remote working can work.  It has surprised everybody how much they have found it to be beneficial to their work-life balance and all of the other positive issues I spoke about.  We can also learn from the past two years how not to do it.  It was dropped on everybody in a last-minute emergency.  People just packed up their desks and went home.  Many companies tried to take the office and put it in the home.  We are not starting from the beginning because we know it can work and we have learned a lot from the past two years.  It has brought us to a place that could have taken 20 years for us to get to.  This momentum was happening but it was happening slowly.  Perhaps the lessons that can be learned from the past two years is to look at some of the challenges that companies have had and try to figure out why they have had those challenges.  Is it because of remote work itself or because of the situation they were put in?  This is a very important question when we are looking at the reasons for refusal in particular.</p></speech>

I have listened to Mr. Hegarty speak about trust between the workforce and employers.  Building up a relationship is hugely important.  It gets away from the old confrontational model that was there in the past and from the monitoring model.  I have detected this among younger workers in particular in the technology sector.  It is important and underpins what the witnesses are speaking about.</p> <p>  There are 13 grounds whereby an employer can refuse.  I agree that a lot of them are nonsense and we need to change them.  One of them is the burden of additional costs and the witnesses alluded to this in their introduction.  It is to take into account the financial and other costs entailed and the scale and financial resources of the employer's business.  Will the witnesses comment on this?  If somebody is to work from home or from a hub there are costs involved in both instances.  Is it is expected that the employer would supply chairs, desks, computers, printers and whatever else would be needed for the employees?  This would be not just for one employee but for many who are working remotely.  The witnesses have also alluded to the cost of renting space in a hub, which can be substantial over time.  Some of the hubs have to pay rates, which is causing a big problem for their own financial viability.  Will the witnesses comment on the cost implications of this?  We know that employees do not have to travel to work so they do not have this cost.  In some instances it may very well be that a family might end up with just one car rather than two.  There are savings there.  Has work being done on this side of it and how it might be balanced and whose responsibilities lie where?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#K01100"><p>This is a very good question.  Over the coming year we will see more cost-benefit analysis on remote working, which is needed,.  It is not quite clear.  Take the example of individuals working from home.  Are the additional costs they may have in terms of their electricity and heating offset by the fact they do not have to commute and they do not have to pay for their lunch?  We can get into a lot of granular detail on the potential savings.</p><p>For the company, the answer to the question is "Yes".  There is an upfront cost in setting up people to work remotely.  If they work in their home, it is common practice in most companies to provide employees with everything needed to do so, including a laptop, monitor, mouse, keyboard, and usually a desk and chair.  At the start of the pandemic, companies were not providing the desk and chair, for example, but as time evolved, they realised from a health and safety point of view they had to make sure their employees had a decent place to work and a good chair to sit on.  Mr. Hegarty may talk about this as well, but most companies offer a stipend for employees to purchase the equipment or provide the equipment.  It depends on the size of the company.  Larger companies provide it and send it out when the employee starts.  Smaller companies may give the employee some money.  The stipend can vary.  I have seen figures varying from &euro;300 to &euro;1,500 per employee, depending on the size of the organisation.</p><p> The Deputy is correct about the hub.  There is a cost for space in a hub and hubs face additional costs.  That is something to consider.  We need to work out the business case.  The business case for remote working has not been worked out in terms of the economics.  There is an upfront cost, but also potential cost saving for the business in terms of office space and rates paid on that space, which are significant, and in terms of better retention and less attrition, sick days and absenteeism, which we see with remote working.  There are many variables.  As we move forward and get into a more steady state with remote working, more work will be done on figuring out what the business case is.  We are happy to work with companies and some of our partner companies to try to figure it out.  We are keen to get started on that.</p></speech>

Mr. Hegarty alluded in response to a question from my colleague, Senator Ahearn, to the health and safety aspects of this.  He also mentioned that his company had an insurance policy to cover something that might happen in the home.  We have come across instances where the employer has the right to inspect the workplace, which is a person's home.  Has that come up in Ms Mangan's experience, and will she speak to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.297" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#L00300"><p>Most employers of which I am aware fulfil the criteria of making sure the employee is well set up from a health and safety perspective by doing virtual inspections as opposed to physically attending.  I do not think there is a need for the employer to attend the person's home.  It can be done virtually and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, has guidance on its website on how to do health and safety ergonomic assessments and checks.  Most companies we work with do it through the employee self-assessing, taking pictures and sending them in.  If any flags come up from that, the employer is required to take action and they give education and training around best practice for health and safety.</p> <p>  Having said that, and Mr. Hegarty will probably have a similar comment, there is a gap in the guidance for remote companies on health and safety.  We have been asked how to build a health and safety statement remotely, which is a challenge, as opposed to being in the office.  Further work could be done, maybe by the HSA, to provide more guidance for companies.  Many companies are worried about the health and safety aspect, particularly because over the past two years it was an emergency situation and may have been more lax.  Now that things are moving into a place where this is a more permanent sustainable option for working, it is important to make sure employees' health and safety is taken care of and that employers are confident they are ticking boxes and ensuring their employees are safe.</p></speech>

I am puzzled about the six-months business.  A new hire may negotiate that from the outset so I am not sure how important that is.</p> <p>  The twelfth one is: "Employee is the subject of ongoing or recently concluded formal disciplinary processes".  Will Ms Mangan give her views on that reason for an employer not to accede to a request to work remotely?</p></speech>

It goes back to the idea of the need to default to the office when something goes wrong or in order to do certain things.  In a remote-first setting, you should not need to default to the office.  Performance management issues will not necessarily be solved simply by bringing the employee in, sitting them in front of you and giving them a talking to or whatever is envisaged by this part of the legislation.  Ideally, in a remote-first setting there are management practices and culture, and the managers are able to handle performance management issues in that setting.  It is good to have the option of being able to meet, but I do not think it needs to be called out specifically in the legislation because it reinforces the idea that the office is the best and when things go wrong, we need to default to the office.</p></speech>

I refer to companies with thousands of employees, many of them travelling every day.  Would she encourage such companies, who have, as she said earlier, substantial resources, to invest in rural towns and build remote working spaces for their employees?</p></speech>

For example, Liberty Insurance has a couple of offices around the country, as does the ESB.  Some of the banks are using their regional premises and branches as hubs for their employees.  I am not aware of a large company planning to build a hub.  Shopify, since before the pandemic, uses local hubs and premises, such as hotels, to bring employees together.  As Mr. Hegarty talked about, it has clusters of employees around the country and it bring them in.  That could be a good approach and a great way of investing in the region, and any opportunity for the employees to meet is always a positive thing.</p></speech>

The EU Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Nicolas Schmit, was before the committee a couple of months ago.  I asked him about people who want to remote work, for example, somebody in the Algarve in Portugal working for a company in Ireland.  Is there a challenge going forward in respect of their employment rights being in a different jurisdiction?  Has Mr. Hegarty come across any challenges in that area?  He said approximately 50% of his staff were outside Ireland.  The Commissioner said in his contribution that the EU did not want to change employment rights in each country, which means they will be all different.  Is that a challenge for his company?</p></speech>

They would not get the benefits of holidays or anything else.  In certain markets we have entities, so we employ them as PAYE folks locally.  Where we do not have an entity, we rely on third parties.  For example, <i>Remote.com</i>or the Irish company Boundless enable that support.  We can hire locally through those entities or intermediaries and that gives us the benefit.  These folks are seen as employees so they have rights based on their local global employment organisation, GEO.  If they are individual contractors, their rights differ in those countries.  We have not seen any issues like that over the years.  We hire them as PAYE employees and pay local tax in each market, as opposed to hiring them as individual contractors.</p></speech>

In my household, my wife was working from home five days per week for almost two years.  She works for a wind energy company in Cork as an accountant.  As people have gone back to work, her company has been good in providing four days at home and one at work.  It gives the right to disconnect, as well as the opportunity to manage your own hours in some ways.</p><p>In my household, it is common for work to start before a child wakes up.  Remote working gives that opportunity.</p><p> We need legislation probably because we cannot rely on trust.  People who are currently in that hybrid model have told me they almost work over the hours because they do not want to lose the remote working balance they have.  They have seen the opportunity it brings and its positive changes in their whole life structure.  My area of Tipperary is approximately an hour away from four cities.  For the past 20 years, we have seen cars parked just off a motorway and people carpooling or otherwise travelling to Cork every day.  Many people used to have a round trip of two and a half or three hours each day.  They consider the extra work they might be doing in the morning or evening to be a counteraction to the travelling to work that they used to do.  They do not really see it as extra work.  They decide to do it themselves but the companies are benefiting on the back of that.  The employees feel as though they are benefiting on the back of that because they do not wish to lose the option of remote working.  Have our guests experienced that with employees?  We speak about the right to disconnect and it is really important but there is a hesitance for employees sometimes because they do not wish to lose what they believe has been an advantage in recent years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.308" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#M00200"><p>Absolutely.  It is a good point.  Anecdotally, it does seem to be the case that for some people the additional time they are getting back from their commute is being used to work.  It goes back to the point that we need to make a cultural shift and not look at remote working as a gift, benefit or favour an employer is giving to individual employees.  Remote work is not simply another benefit like health insurance or a gym membership; it is a culture and within that culture one has flexibility.  The onus is on employers to ensure they build that culture internally so their employees know this is not just a favour they are getting for good behaviour; it is the way the company works.  In that way, employees do not need to feel like they have to work the extra hours but, rather, those hours are for them.  We in Grow Remote feel strongly about the potential of that extra time and are in the process of working on a project to capture the additional time people have, how they are spending it and whether they are spending it in their local community.  Yesterday, the Western Development Commission and NUI Galway released a survey that I completed yesterday evening.  One of the questions asks how the respondent is spending the time saved on commuting.  It is important that we capture that because if people are spending that time working, it is work the employer is getting for free and the employee is not benefiting.  A cultural change is needed at the level of the employer.  It needs to be clearly articulated to the employee that this is not something that will be taken away again but, rather, it is systemic and normal that one works remotely and it is part of our culture, so there is no need for an employee to do any juggling or bells and whistles to make sure an employer does not take it away.  Employees should not have that worry.</p></speech>

Both the employee and the employer feel like they are winning here.  The employer sees the employee is working the hours they were formerly spending driving, while the employee feels that at least he or she is not driving and is saving money as a result.  People who used to drive from Clonmel are saving more than &euro;100 a week, especially given the current increased costs.</p></speech>

If they wish to spend that time working, that is completely up to them.  It may be that they are enjoying their job and want to put some extra time in.  However, as a cultural shift, we need to move away from the idea that the employee has been gifted this time by his or her employer and needs to give something back in response.  We are looking for a cultural shift.</p></speech>

If an employee is going to a hub rather than working from home, the normal 9 to 5 work time kind of falls back into place for him or her.  Employees may currently be working for an hour at home before the child gets up and doing an hour after 8 p.m. when the child goes to bed.  If one goes to a hub, however, it feels like one is going into a workplace even though it is just the local town.  The employee kind of goes back to some sort of normality.  Hubs can bring that sort of advantage in managing one's work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#M00600"><p>They can.  They can bring structure for parents in particular, who may wish to have a separation of work and life and may like to be in a hub away from home where they can focus on their job.  It all comes down to choice.  It is still important, however, that the time people are getting back from their commute, which for some can be two hours a day and really adds up, is time they should be spending doing something for themselves.  It is their own time.  We are discussing work-life balance and the benefits remote working brings.  It is not really helping employee's work-life balance if there is an expectation on the part of the employer that the employee will spend that time working or that the employee feels pressured to work that way.  It comes back to the idea of the right to disconnect.  It is tricky because one wants to give people who wish to work early in the morning the opportunity to do that while also ensuring they understand they can switch off when they need to do so.</p></speech>

As the Senator stated, they are working the time they got back from the commute.  The challenge we have seen through the years is that leads to burnout.  We are back to Ms Mangan's point on the right to disconnect.  We encourage employees to see the time they get back as being time for them rather than for us.  In the long run, employees who work for that time will end up burnt out.  Productivity has certainly improved for us through the time and it is not because we have gotten those hours back from people's commutes.  It is the flexibility we are giving people to work when they want and changing the culture in getting used to asynchronous communication.  Employees do not have to respond to an email after working hours but, rather, can reply when they wish to do so and when it works for them.</p></speech>

It is great to hear what Mr. Hegarty and Ms Mangan are saying in respect of all this.  Of course, we know that, effectively, for many people the experience has not so much been working from home but, rather, living in the office.  The main concern is that some workers need to take the onus themselves to be able to switch off but for others that the onus is not on them; they are pressurised into working late hours, very early mornings, weekends or whatever without compensation.  The Labour Party brought forward legislative proposals in November 2020 on a right to disconnect and we still believe we need to have that in legislation.</p> <p>  Obviously, leadership is important, particularly from Departments and the public service.  It is important to state that from the accounts I am getting in from various workers across the public sector, some Departments have been very good but others, including the sponsoring Department of this legislation, could do a lot better.  I am thinking of two other Departments in particular whose record has been very poor, frankly, in facilitating workers who wish to work remotely.  It is important to put on record that Departments need to show greater leadership.  There is an onus on them to show leadership because we cannot expect the private sector to step up to the mark if the public sector itself is not doing so.</p></speech>

A job in the public sector is considered a Holy Grail for many people.  It is a great job for life but, as the public sector lags behind and the private sector moves forward with remote working, one may find some people working in the public sector think they do not have the flexibility they need or the opportunity to work from home.  There is a risk that staff will begin to think about leaving the public sector.  It is important that remote working is embraced in the public sector as much as it has been in the private sector.</p></speech>

Ms Mangan referenced several times the work of the Western Development Commission in the context of applied research that is feeding into the research of Grow Remote.  It is a hobby horse of mine that I have been asking the Government to support the development of a south-eastern development commission but we have not got any traction on that.  It shows the importance of regionalised applied research.  That may be a message our guests will convey to their members.</p> <p>  Irish Small and Medium Employers, ISME, wrote to the committee this morning to make a couple of points.  It asked the committee to be mindful of the impact of the legislation on small businesses and noted that 96% of Irish businesses employ 19 people or fewer.</p><p>When we are talking about the public sector and large FDI employers it is important to remember that we are talking about large employer criteria there.  </p><p> One of the points that ISME raised was that of back-office functions that can be done remotely outside Ireland.  Does Mr. Hegarty see the possibility that companies switching to remote working would start to look at in terms of individual cost silos?  They might look at employing five people in Ireland or they might potentially look at employing five people in eastern Europe who have good English because of the cost benefits.  Does Mr. Hegarty want to comment on that?  Is that something he is seeing?  I presume that companies that are very profit driven are looking at siloing out back-office operations through remote working.</p></speech>

Even before the shift to remote working and before the pandemic, people were outsourcing, off-shoring or near-shoring work anyway.  What we do is really about creating a culture and whether we keep hiring in Ireland, that would be the main driver.  It is not something we are focusing on right now, to look for efficiencies through off-shoring.  It is not something we are investigating.</p></speech>

Remote working is very much part and parcel of modern-day life.  It was a growing trend anyway but obviously it was increased incredibly by the onset of Covid-19.  While there are so many different benefits to it from a work-life balance point of view, especially for young parents who may wish to spend a little bit more time at home, obviously there are challenges too.  I would like to hear the perspective of our guests on a number of issues.</p> <p>  My primary concern is around having the workplace in the home, through remote working or in remote working hubs, where people are not necessarily in an office setting in the traditional sense.  Has any research been undertaken, either by Grow Remote or Glofox, to indicate there is a concern around employees being able to switch off?  People are entitled to be able to leave their workspace and to have the time off to which they are entitled.  This is a concern when it comes to remote working in that people are, essentially, always switched on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.321" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#N00500"><p>In terms of working from home and the blurring of the lines between home life and work life, it is definitely a factor that we have discussed previously.  There is an onus on the employee and the employer to make sure this does not happen.  Remote working is a different way of working and it does require a different way of thinking on the part of the employee.  It requires people to be a little bit more self-motivated but also more disciplined in terms of structuring their own time.  I have talked a lot about trust but with trust comes the need to be able to manage one's time effectively, take breaks and make sure one is adhering the time for work and making sure there is a separation between home life and work life.  That can be a little bit more difficult in the home.</p> <p>  I have talked to friends about remote working and told them that I do not have someone to come and tell me that it is time to stop for lunch because I work from my home and I am on my own in my house during the day.  Employees need to be careful about that.  There are different steps people can take.  Some of Mr. Hegarty's employees might do this and we have heard of other companies where people do a fake commute by going for a walk in the morning before they start working, they take a walk on their lunch break and are very disciplined about leaving their work space.  Having a separate workspace is ideal, if one can do that, and then close the door on it at the end of the working day.</p> <p>  There are some things the employee can do but there is also a huge onus on the employer to make sure people are switching off.  It can be a little bit more challenging for managers of a remote team because they do not always know that their employees are looking a little bit stressed because they do not see them all of the time, every day.  Therefore, it is really important to have a lot of one-to-one time with them.  In a remote setting, managers need to over-communicate.  That does not necessarily mean back-to-back Zoom calls all day long but just checking in with employees on a regular basis.  People managers need to check in every day with members of their team, even if that is just a voice message or WhatsApp note asking how they are or how they are getting on.  Regular one-to-one communication is really important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1516" speakername="James O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#N00600"><p>That is interesting.  I am 24 years old and many of my friends and colleagues are going into the working world for the first time after completing higher education.  One thing that many have really missed out on, particularly at the very outset of their career, has been that introduction into the workspace.  They were not able to have induction sessions with their employers throughout Covid and obviously the birth of mass remote working, which we are now seeing internationally, is having an impact.  I would question the current standard practice by a lot of firms that are offering remote jobs.  Many are allowing their employees to leave Ireland and work in other locations.  This is becoming quite common and is having a detrimental impact on people who are going into a working environment for the first time.  I make that point to the witnesses, having spoken to people who are just starting out in work.  They are losing out on that face-to-face engagement with their managers.  Perhaps we need guidelines rather than legislation around this because the latter would be too prescriptive but it is important that the Government looks at this matter.</p> <p>  When it comes to the provision of broadband, has any research been undertaken on how many people engaged in remote working are having significant issues with broadband connections?  Is it more of a problem in rural areas?  Are there any statistics available on that?  Obviously, there is a big difference between areas that have access to high-speed broadband and those, mostly rural areas, that do not.  My own constituency has quite poor broadband infrastructure outside of the main towns.  Obviously that is having an impact on people who want to engage in remote working.  I invite our guest to answer that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.323" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#N00700"><p>I do not have statistics on broadband connectivity or on where there may be broadband issues.  I can only speak anecdotally to what some of our community members and the people we work with would say, which is that there are areas of the country where broadband is still an issue.  Some members of our chapters in Dublin would even say that they sometimes have trouble with their broadband.  Outside of the cities and in some of our more rural locations, there are definitely gaps in service which really hinders people's ability to work remotely.  People need to have adequate broadband to be able to work remotely.  It is really important.  We are doing a remote call here today but if we had issues with broadband, this meeting could not have gone ahead.  It is critically important to have good broadband.  Obviously the national broadband plan is being rolled out and we hope that it will be expedited so that everyone in the country has access to high-quality, fast broadband because it is really essential.  It was surprising for me to hear Mr. Hegarty talking about working on Achill Island.  We have a lot of chapters in Donegal, a couple in Dingle and in west Cork.  There are some areas where there is really great broadband, places where one would not expect that to be the case.  It is really about making sure that it is consistent and available equally to everyone, wherever they need it.</p></speech>

She referred to the eligibility criteria and the provision on requests for remote working being submitted after 26 weeks.  I ask her to elaborate on that.  I think it is quite a sensible provision although obviously it is not applicable in all walks of life.  It is just not an option for certain employers and certain industries.  In general, however, I think it is quite a clever idea but I understand that it is a concern for Ms Mangan so I invite her to elaborate on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.325" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Mangan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022042700002#N00900"><p>The main concern in that regard would be around the idea that remote working should remove location as a barrier to employment.  People should be able to access good quality, decent employment regardless of where they are living.  If they have to spend the first six months with a new company in its office and that office is not nearby, then in the first instance, they probably will not apply for that job if that condition was included in the job description.  It would really make life difficult for people if they had to relocate for the first six months.  If people are looking for a remote job and they want to work remotely, it would be very off-putting to have to be in the office for the first six months.</p> <p>  I understand there is an issue from the perspective of younger workers, those in their 20s who are just starting out in their careers.</p><p>We hear feedback on that from our partners and Mr. Hegarty from Glofox mentioned as well about hiring graduates, onboarding them and ramping them up when it is their first job.  It can be a little more challenging in a remote setting because one does not get the immersion in the office and the first day when a recruit is brought around to meet everybody.</p><p> Companies really need to be very deliberate and plan a really strong onboarding process.  It does not even start from the first day; it starts even before that.  We see good practice in companies where they engage with new hires from the day they are told they have the job.  They even try to facilitate some meet-ups with new team members and the recruits might meet their manager a couple of times before they start if they are willing to do that.  From day one they have a really strong onboarding, which includes ensuring they get time with everyone they need to meet and they have access to the information they need.  That is the level required and there should also be opportunities to meet face to face, as we have spoken about a few times.  If a few colleagues live in a person's area, the company might provide a budget to meet for a coffee or beer or something in the evening.  The people would still meet and interact in a remote scenario.  Having those kinds of opportunities is really important but I reiterate my point about it being possible to onboard and ramp up a new hire remotely if the process is done well.</p></speech>

In effect, this means policies and objectives of the Minister and the Government become legally enforceable without being enacted in the form of legislation.  It is proposed that compliance with guidelines, codes and policies should be assessed by reference to the principle of "comply or explain".  This approach would serve to restore the balance between autonomy and accountability and is an approach that is proportionate in circumstances.  Any policy or objective of the Minister can become the subject of a guideline, code or policy.  Non-compliance can lead to direct intervention by the HEA and the imposition of financial penalties under section 42 and determinations for action under section 65.  This has the potential to undermine the autonomy of the university governing authorities and it potentially increases risk of third level institutions being regarded as being under public control.</p> <p>  The "comply or explain" principle operates on the basis that the entities at which the legislation is directed should not favour strict compliance over effective governance and transparency.  Instead, the entities at which the legislation is directed are encouraged to consider their individual circumstances carefully and choose what is best for them while ensuring they provide full, clear and meaningful explanations for departures from what is expected of them under the guidelines, codes and policies.  This allows entities to develop governance, processes and practices most suitable for their particular circumstances and to report them in a meaningful way rather than declaring strict compliance with the guidelines, codes and policies that result in reporting that lack of substance and information about governance outcomes.  The "comply or explain" principle seems particularly appropriate in the current context where the circumstances affecting each designated institution of higher education tend to be quite different.</p></speech>

I also indicated that I will endeavour to come back with greater definitions around sustainability.  I will put on the record that I will work closely with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh and others between now and Report Stage on that matter.</p> <p>  On section 38 more broadly, I flag to the committee that my Department continues to engage with the Central Statistics Office on how borrowing for this sector is treated in terms of money being on and off balance sheet.  It is a broader point but it is important to say that while we are on section 38 of the Bill.</p> <p>  To be clear, the policy intent of the Bill is not to change in any way, shape or form the existing principle of "comply or explain".  That is for the reasons Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Conway-Walsh outlined in terms of the autonomy of institutions and diversity.  I genuinely get that.  Already, though, with the existing principle of "comply or explain", the HEA must agree the explanation with the designated institution of higher education for a derogation from a guideline, code or policy to apply.  If a guideline or code is not complied with, the CEO would view the explanation and a reasonable explanation would be accepted by the HEA.</p> <p>  I have engaged intensively with the sector on this and I would not like to change the current principle beyond "comply or explain" or accidentally dilute it.  I would not like to have a "comply or explain" process and if you do not like the explanation, goodnight and good luck.  This would accidentally diminish the process, and that is not what the sector wants to do either.  I have looked at this quite extensively but I am satisfied, in regard to the proposed amendments, that the current policy intent is in line with the existing policy of "comply or explain".  I have no doubt the Deputies will return to this on Report Stage because it is important for the sector.  That is my view.</p> <p>  This amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 157 and 169, which are in my name.  The purpose of these amendments is to clarify that the obligation of the governing body of a technological university is to have appropriate systems, procedures and practices in place in order to implement and report on compliance with the policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government to the extent that those policies may affect or relate to the function of the university or technological university.  The wording has been amended from "enable compliance" with the policies to "implement and report on compliance" to more accurately reflect the policy intent.  To be clear, there is no intended change with regard to policy intent in the subsection.  Amendments Nos. 158 and 170 are covered by amendments Nos. 157 and 169, if I might put it like that.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 204 and 208 propose to remove the provision that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the HEA to prepare guidelines, codes or policies, and the HEA shall comply with the direction with a new provision.  The proposed new provision provides that the Minister shall provide a draft of a direction to the HEA and the HEA may make submissions to the Minister on the draft direction, and the Minister shall consider any submission received.  The new provision also provides, as we previously discussed, that the direction shall be published.  I am satisfied with the provisions relating to directions as currently reflected in the Bill.  I do not propose to accept other amendments to this section.</p></speech>

What we are endeavouring to do in this section is ensure the chief executive officer of the HEA can deal with a number of matters as they arise.  There is standard provision in legislation relating to what are called "other conditions".  I accept "other conditions" could perhaps be viewed as a catch-all, although it is not a legal term.  It can be a standard provision.  I am trying to get the threshold right of what is appropriate for the CEO to be able to discharge as chief executive and what the CEO should have to receive board approval for.</p> <p>  I am not in a position to accept amendments Nos. 105 to 107, inclusive, but I am considering making an amendment on Report Stage based on Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's overall point to include a requirement for board approval for the addition of other conditions.  I am flagging that I am considering bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage that board approval would be required for the addition of other conditions.</p></speech>

I apologise to the committee for not being present to move the previous amendment.  I was monitoring online from another meeting and, unfortunately, it was not being broadcast.  I missed those amendments for that reason. </p><p>That series of amendments, which I discussed with the Minister, as he acknowledged, is about trying to set on a firmer footing the importance and primacy of climate action within this piece of legislation, and in particular that the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 and our obligations under the Paris Agreement are acknowledged explicitly within the text of this Bill.</p><p>I understand the argument that, of course, this Bill must have cognisance and reference to all of the other pieces of legislation.  I feel the case for climate action is such that it deserves a specific reference in and of itself, however.  I will not delay the committee any further than that given that I missed my initial opportunity.  I am glad to have had the opportunity to retrospectively put the case for those amendment.</p></speech>

As I indicated earlier in the meeting with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, my response is that we are looking to see how we can, and I think it is the wish of the committee, further strengthen definitions in this important area of climate action.  I am also looking to see what can be done in addition to the legislation.</p> <p>  A significance to this legislation that sometimes does not get discussed enough is the Higher Education Authority, HEA, being able to devise and develop codes and guidelines.  I think the healthy scepticism at this committee the last time was that this was an enabling provision and about whether there will there be guidelines or codes in these areas in two or three years' time and what assurances I can give the committee.  I am working with my officials and the HEA to see if I can perhaps, even in advance of the legislation being passed, indicate in writing that this is an area we wish to see prioritised.  I will work with the Deputies and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

What I did not want was any confusion with regard to the difference between &quot;review&quot; and &quot;assess&quot;.  Again, it is similar to the point Deputy Conway-Walsh made earlier.

I would like the thank the University College Dublin students' union for bringing this to my attention.  This is a straightforward amendment to assure that these positive initiatives around training are delivered in all institutes.</p></speech>

I will also be considering a very similar amendment in section 44 with regard to students who are Irish language speakers.  I thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for her amendment and, indeed, her engagement with the UCD students' union on this.</p><p>I did look at this and I will read my note to be clear on my advice.  Amendment No. 113 proposes to provide that a formalised engagement process between students of designated institutions of higher education and those institutions shall - with an emphasis on that word - include training for students participating as members of the governing bodies of those institutions and a mechanism for students to request such training.  The amendment is seeking to replace the word &quot;may&quot; with the word &quot;shall&quot;.  My own view from consulting is that it is not appropriate as some students may have sourced alternative training and may not require that training.  I am not being pedantic because I know what the Deputy is endeavouring to do here.  On the idea that the training must or shall happen, we believe the word &quot;may&quot; is an enabling provision to provide for good engagement processes.  It is also noted that the institution is required to report annually to the HEA on training and engagement processes.  If training has been requested and not provided, we will see this annually in the report to the HEA, which I think is important for transparency as well.</p><p>As the Deputy said, amendments Nos. 114 and 115 request two additional provisions to be included in the annual report to the HEA.  I went to check this because it is important.  I agree with what the Deputy is endeavouring to do here.  My advice is that there is no need for those amendments, however, because they are already included as part of the reporting process to the HEA under subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>).  There is a nervousness that changing the word &quot;may&quot; to &quot;shall&quot; has an unintended consequence.  We believe the reporting mechanism is captured in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>)(<i>c</i>).</p></speech>

I hear the committee on the importance of the word &quot;partnership&quot;.  I obviously outlined the legal concerns around &quot;partnership&quot; and flagged it in an earlier section.  I do believe, however, that &quot;co-operation&quot; accurately reflects the policy intent with regard to student surveys.

I will look at all of these in the round for Report Stage but our view is that the legislation under subsection (f) already enables this.</p></speech>

There is a provision in section 46 for consultation by the HEA with myself, as Minister, and other listed bodies.  This includes any Minister of the Government but we thought it was appropriate to specify specifically the Minister for Education, considering the obvious strong links there are between equity and access, participation and promotion of success at first and second level, and the implications for further and higher education.  I think it is sensible to clarify what was already intended.</p></speech>

I see Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh makes the same point.  If we have a comprehensive list of those who should be consulted, the trade unions need to be in there.</p></speech>

As well as being institutions of learning and huge economic drivers, institutions in the third level sector are major employers with tens of thousands of workers.  There are several unions that would be a regular part of engagement with higher education institutions, such as the Teachers&rsquo; Union of Ireland, TUI, the Irish Federation of University Teachers, SIPTU and F&oacute;rsa, and there are probably several more as well.  This is vital.  Typically, with some exceptions, these institutions are engaging in general terms with these unions but that needs to continue and it needs to be preserved.  I believe they should have an equal place with the other stakeholders in that regard.</p></speech>

It is a thing that used to annoy me when I was a Deputy bringing forward amendments.  I wish to bring forward my own amendment to do exactly this on Report Stage and while we need to run things through the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, there is no disagreement here.  To be clear, this should be in the Bill.  We did engage with the TUI and others and they identified a number of areas where trade unions and staff associations should be in the Bill.  The Deputies will remember from the last day that we brought forward quite of lot of amendments where we ensured that trade unions and staff associations were listed in the Bill explicitly rather than implicitly.  This was not a section where it was identified in our engagement but, nonetheless, it is an accepted oversight and I will rectify it on the basis of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendments.</p></speech>

In any case, there is amendment No. 122 in my name and No. 125 in the Deputy&rsquo;s name which intend to do the exact same thing.  It is just a question of legal wording on how best to do this.  This is basically about making sure that the provision for lifelong and flexible learning provides that the HEA should promote and support the institutions of higher education in the development and provision of lifelong and flexibile learning for learners which meets the requirements of the learners.  The amendment I am bringing forward, which captures the Deputy&rsquo;s view too, adds a specific provision to meet the needs of persons who are competent to speak the Irish language.  This amendment is another example of how we are working to strengthen the provisions in regard to the Irish language in the Bill.  I move amendment No. 122 and respectfully suggest it encapsulates what amendment No. 125 was seeking to do.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 are aimed towards transparency in the funding model.  As I have said previously, the State makes a significant investment in the third level sector and we should expect that the State's values are mirrored back to it in the investment in third level institutions by having oversight of the types of funding and the funding sources other than State funding that are feeding into the provision of third level education.  These two amendments go to the point about transparency and clarity in terms of the funding.</p><p>The HEA initiated a review of higher education and funding in 2017, the &ldquo;Review of the Allocation Model for Funding Higher Education Institutions&rdquo; final report for the independent expert panel of the HEA.  I would emphasise the inconsistent and incoherent nature of the administration of funding for data collection and lack of overall transparency in HEA funding.  This item references governance and public confidence in the system and I think transparency around private sources of funding will only strengthen people&rsquo;s confidence in the third level sector.  To quote from that report, funding streams from entities outside of the designated higher education institutions that operate substantially for the benefit of or under the auspices of the institutions, both inside and outside the State, are included in some instances.  This is the practice of having a separate legal entity that may operate parallel to the actual third level institution.  I do not think we have good oversight or good insight as to where the funding sources are coming from in that respect.  As a major stakeholder in third level funding, the State should expect to have that level of transparency.</p><p> Amendment No. 128 is slightly different in its focus.  It is related to something commonly known as the divestment movement.  That is the idea that, with regard to investments made by third level institutions commonly held as, for example, pension pots, we should limit the exposure of those investments, in terms of investment in fossil fuels in particular.  There is an issue around reflecting the values of the State, as well as the matter of stranded assets and the destabilising influence that could arise from investments being made in fossil fuels infrastructure or having that as part of a pension portfolio, and that subsequently devaluing.  That is what this amendment goes towards.</p></speech>

I have looked into this matter.  In the context of the horrific situation in Ukraine, there has been a need to seek information in relation to transparency around funding.  There have been some parliamentary questions tabled to me that required me to go to institutions to seek data I do not have on that situation and the need for Russia to experience significant sanctions and isolation.  I have recent experience of the importance of being able to seek data from institutions.</p> <p>  I have checked that in the existing provisions for data collection specified in the legislation there is a category relating to financial data.  I am advised that these amendments appear to be covered by the subsection on financial data.  If it is deemed necessary to collect the data, that can be done under the heading of financial data and prescribed by the Minister of the day in consultation with the HEA.</p> <p> This is another instance where I am not in a position to accept the amendments, but I can engage with the Deputy and seek to expand what I have said between now and Report Stage in order to see if that provides assurance.</p></speech>

Therefore, plans should be included in the strategic development plan of the designated institutions outlining how they will contribute towards the aim of progressively increasing Irish-language provision.  At present, most institutions, especially those covered under this section, seem to act as if they have no duty to provide education through Irish, but it should be the role of all institutions to play their part.  That is why we are proposing this amendment.</p></speech>

This amendment proposes to include the Irish-language requirement in their development plans but for what are mainly private and not-for-profit institutions.  We generally attach conditions through funding.  These institutions may not be receiving any funding from the Exchequer, and some may be receiving competitive funding only, as we discussed the last day.  I outlined this in my engagement with Conradh na Gaeilge.  While I am considering more amendments in the round on Irish, that is my position on these amendments.</p></speech>

What amendment No. 131 seeks to impose is not onerous.  It just proposes that in the strategic plan, an institution consider how it will progressively increase.  If it is starting from a low level, a progressive increase can be from a very minimal level.  One of the big challenges for society as a whole regarding Irish concerns how we expand its use outside the third level institutions where Irish is pigeonholed as one of the arts subjects or whatever.  In this instance, as the Minister correctly said, the institutions in question are private, not-for-profit institutions, but many of them are delivering courses on business, finance and whatnot.  It is important that those courses be available through Irish or, at the very least, that there be an understanding, by virtue of the promotion of the Irish language within the institutions, that graduates may end up in areas where Irish is the vernacular and that there is a need to protect and enhance the language.</p></speech>

I am sure we can reflect on it between now and Report Stage.  I will accept amendment No. 130 because I believe the Deputy is right.  The institutions are already committing to a cultural element in their strategic development plans.  The amendment proposes only to include "cultural and Irish language".  I believe the intention behind this is acceptable, so I propose to accept amendment No. 130 but not No. 131 at this stage.</p></speech>

I welcome that this has been done in some parts of the Bill.  Amendment No. 132 continues in that vein.  Often, one of the main forms of discrimination, socioeconomic discrimination, is overlooked.  It would be positive to include a specific reference to this in the section, as proposed in amendment No. 133.</p></speech>

This section, however, relates to the private colleges.  We had a debate on this earlier in terms of private versus public and the likes.  The way we pursue access to education is through the publicly funded higher education sector or where we provide specific funding to a private or not-for-profit college for a specific purpose, we attach conditions of funding.  That is how we try to highlight priorities, be they access, participation or course completion, considering we do not fund these institutions, I do not have a direct policy lever.   For example, I will bring forward a national access plan and the Deputy and I will debate its merits and demerits but it relates to trying to ensure people get through the public education system.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I will have to go back to previous sections, but I am satisfied that in the context of institutions we are funding, the Bill provides an ability for the HEA to attach conditions to funding.  That is one of the significant benefits of the Bill.  We can consider that and see whether the Deputy is satisfied it is strong enough but, where we do not fund the institutions, we do not have the policy lever.  That is my view.  I will reflect on what the Deputy has said in respect of publicly funded institutions.  It is a fair point.</p></speech>

I want to replace the word &quot;concerned&quot; with &quot;serious, significant or material concerns&quot;.  That is a slightly more robust definition of what a concern may be, a concern that the CEO may have about the governance of an institution, that it should be serious, significant or material.</p></speech>

As the Chairman indicated, amendment No. 134 tabled by Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and amendment No. 135 that I have brought forward are alternatives in the sense that they are both trying to achieve the same thing.  I would argue that my amendment achieves what Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is seeking to achieve, which is a legitimate point that I heard from the sector, that is, what is "concern".  I am proposing in my amendment to delete the phrase "concerned about", which could be construed to be vague and subjective, and substitute it with, "of opinion that there are significant concerns regarding".  The policy intent of this section is that the CEO of the HEA would only request a review and report from a designated institution where there are significant concerns regarding the institution.  It is not intended that this provision is used to address minor or trivial issues that can be addressed through normal working arrangements.  An amendment is proposed to provide that the word "significant" is now inserted in the section.  This amendment will provide that the CEO may request a designated institution to undertake a review if there is a significant concern about the institution's governance, performance or compliance.  I do not think anybody is suggesting it, but we need to be careful we do not inadvertently prevent the CEO requesting a report if there are significant concerns.  I do take the point in respect of the vagueness of the original language and I contend that amendment No. 135 in my name achieves that balance.</p></speech>

This is important where there is potential reputational risk to an institution.  It is the view of the sector and, I suspect, that of the committee that it would be appropriate for the CEO to require the approval of the board of the HEA before the publication of a report of a review.  That is the purpose of amendments Nos. 137 and 138.</p><p>Amendment No. 139a in my name removes the provision that the chief executive can make a determination to provide assistance in accordance with section 66 following a review under section 64.  The amendment has been tabled because it is proposed to remove section 66 of the Bill, relating to the provision of assistance by an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, and, therefore, this provision is no longer necessary.  This, too, is something that came from engagement with the sector.  It would like to be in a position to request assistance but does not wish to have that assistance forced upon it.  That language may be slightly inaccurate.  I apologise; some of my language should be tighter.  It is just a change of emphasis in terms of assistance.  In light of the fact that we will be removing section 66, amendment No. 139a removes a provision that is no longer required.</p><p>On amendment No. 139, I am not proposing to accept the amendment.  It proposes to insert a provision that HEA board approval will be needed by the chief executive in order to make a determination to take action following a review.  This whole legislation is a question of balance.  We are all trying to get the balance right.  My amendment proposes that, for reputational reasons and the like, the chief executive cannot go ahead and publish the report of the review without the approval of the board.  It is still appropriate for the CEO to be able to take action.  In fact, it is empowering and important for the CEO to be able to take the action without the requirement of a board meeting.  For that reason, I prefer the amendment I have tabled, so I do not propose to accept amendment No. 139.  It is important that when the HEA identifies an issue in a higher education institution, the HEA can react in a timely manner.  Of course, all present have great confidence in the sector, but we also have to legislate for times when things go wrong.  Being able to act in a timely manner is important.  The steps include a request for self-review and a report from the institution by the CEO.  I think we have the balance right in this area.</p><p>I do not propose to accept amendment No. 140.  It provides that an appeal can be taken in respect of any determination made by the CEO under section 65.  The Bill provides that an appeal can only be taken against the imposition of remedial measures.  That is important too.  If there are remedial measures, one can taken an appeal in respect of one's unhappiness with that, but if there is not a remedial measure, I do not think there is a need for an appeal.  As I stated, amendment No. 139 removes the provision that the chief executive officer can make a determination to provide assistance.  I have dealt with that.  I wish to flag that I am considering introducing an amendment on Report Stage to provide for an appeal in respect of the appointment of a reviewer.  I will consider amendment No. 140 again prior to Report Stage.  That is basically what I am saying.  I think we have the balance right without amendment No. 139, based on the amendment I have brought forward.  I will consider the issues relating to amendment No. 140 in advance of Report Stage. </p></speech>

Amendment No. 142 provides for an appeal of a decision by the CEO to provide assistance to a designated institution of higher education and provides that when an appeal is made, the appeal has the effect of placing a stay on the provision of such assistance until such time as the appeal has been determined.  I have proposed to remove section 66 from the Bill to remove that mandatory provision of assistance.  A later section of the Bill provides the ability to seek assistance, but we will remove the mandatory provision of assistance through the removal of section 66.  Therefore, amendment No. 142 is no longer necessary.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 146 provides for the right of appeal against a decision of the HEA CEO to appoint a reviewer.  This amendment also provides that if an appeal is made against the appointment of a reviewer, it has the effect of placing a stay on the appointment or shall require a cessation of the work of the reviewer pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.  The appointment of a reviewer is considered to be part of the process of assessing whether there is an issue which needs to be addressed.  The reviewer will undertake a review of the institution to establish the facts.  The institution will then receive a copy of the draft report and may make representations on the draft report to the reviewer, which the reviewer shall consider prior to finalising the report.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment, but I have indicated and now indicate again that I can consider an amendment on Report Stage to provide for an appeal process for the appointment of the reviewer.</p></speech>

As I outlined earlier, the requirement for board approval in these cases takes into account reputational aspects for designated institutions.  The measures are the admonishment and censure in writing of the institution, the requirement for members of the governing body or members of staff of the institution to undertake a course of training on matters related to governance, or the review of the strategic development plan of the institution.  This adds the requirement for the approval of the HEA board rather than unilateral action of the CEO.</p><p>Amendment No. 145 is in the name of Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Conway-Walsh.  It proposes to introduce a provision for the appeal of the imposition of a remedial measure and a stay on the imposition of a remedial measure if the appeal is made pending the determination or discontinuance of the appeal.  Section 65(4) of the Bill provides for an appeal of the imposition of the remedial measure.  Amendment No. 141 addresses the same issue, of proposing to put a stay on the coming into operation of a remedial measure if an appeal is made, pending the determination.  In English, I believe amendment No. 141, which we discussed, has addressed what the Deputies are trying to do in amendment No. 145.  Amendments Nos. 143 and 144 are about a greater role for the HEA board, in the interests of recognising the importance of the reputation of the institution.</p></speech>

It is to comprise two persons with special interest in higher education and one practising solicitor and barrister.  The purpose of the amendment is to recast section 70(a) to provide that one of the three nominees of the appeals board must be a suitably qualified international higher education expert, who may be an academic, depending on the matter under appeal.  The revised text also precludes a public servant or any person employed by the institution of higher education from being eligible to be appointed to the appeals board.  The use of an appeals board is envisaged by all within the Department and the sector to be an unusual occurrence.  In the event that it is required, we believe that an international perspective would be beneficial.  It is not an unusual use of international expertise, as there are existing panels of relevant experts to draw from.</p></speech>

I will move amendment No. 149 shortly.  That amendment will make a new provision to preclude serving members of staff of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science from being members of the appeals board.  It is an important amendment to clarify and to further embed what is absolutely the intention set out in section 71(12) of the Bill that the appeals board should be independent in the performance of its functions.  It is important it is independent and seen to be independent.  That is the purpose of that amendment.</p> <p>  As for amendment No. 148 in the names of Deputies &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Conway-Walsh, section 70 of the Bill provides for the three-person appeals boards to be appointed by the Minister.  It is to comprise two persons with a special interest in higher education, so that provision is already there, and one practising solicitor or barrister.  Members of the HEA board, members of staff of the HEA and solicitors or barristers in full-time service of the State are precluded from membership of the appeals board.  To clarify, we are already providing that nobody who works in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science can serve on the board, nobody who is a member of the HEA board can work on the appeals board, nobody who is a member of staff of the HEA can do so and nobody who is a solicitor or barrister in full-time service of the State can do so.  That is quite a number of people we are taking out of circulation, and appropriately so, in the context of independence.  It is my view that amendment No. 148, in precluding any public servant or employee of an institution of higher education from membership of the appeals board, would significantly risk narrowing the pool of people with expertise.  Members may remember that the legislation states that we will comprise the board of two persons with a special interest in higher education.  I think it is entirely possible to be a public servant not in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science or in the HEA or a staff member of an institution of higher education that is not in any way involved in this and to serve on the board.  The amendment I am bringing forward takes a further step.  For that reason I do not want to narrow the pool further.</p></speech>

That is beyond question.  The Government will always have our support for any policy that achieves that.  There are, however, many proposals in the Bill that reduce the autonomy of institutes without any clear relationship with transparency or accountability, and I have yet to see or hear a convincing justification for dictating such rigid governance structures such as the mandatory 17-member limit on the governing bodies.  The Technological Universities Act 2018 allowed for a governing authority of 22 to 26.  The Minister has changed the position since the general scheme was issued, and now the right number on the governing authority is 17.  I put it to the Minister, however, that the reason the number keeps changing is that there is no magic number and no one size that fits all.  The people best placed to come up with the right size of the governing authority are the institutions themselves.  These are unpaid positions, and every governing body has its own unique make-up and tradition.  The removal of the broad representation on the governing bodies will be a real loss, I believe.</p><p>It is unfair to say that this legislation will move the sector to a competency-based governance model.  Governing bodies are currently made up of members of academic and non-academic bodies, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, the alumni, the local authority nominees, trade union representatives, employers' organisations and others.  The expertise is vitally important, particularly in the more technical areas such as financial reporting.  However, we should not limit the value of the contribution and valuable input from a wide variety of people.  The Minister should look again at the rigid, overly prescriptive governance structures and a fair approach that can be applied to everyone without damaging the unique characteristics and differentiated missions of the different institutions.</p><p>The Bill curtails staff representation on the governing bodies and assumes without any actual evidence that having a majority of external members is superior.  It takes an upstairs-downstairs attitude to both academic and professional staff, who are not seen as worthy of significant influence in the governance of their own institutions.  There are clearly established dangers in shrinking governing bodies so dramatically.  The risks in terms of the loss of expertise are significant for organisations as complex as the higher education institutions, particularly the larger ones.  Five internal members of staff is a very small number to bring all the competencies required to the table of the governing body.  Also, there is no indication that more ministerial nominees will lead to greater diversity.  In the past, ministerial or external nominees have had a strong bias towards business and corporate appointments.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions made an excellent submission to the consultation on the Bill and pointed out that the academic institutions with the highest reputations and the most effective track records worldwide are those that enjoy the highest levels of autonomy.  It is hardly a coincidence that the two highest ranking universities in the UK, Oxford and Cambridge, are precisely those where governance by academics has not been diluted by external governance influence.  Closer to home, Trinity is the highest ranking of the universities in Ireland and in this Bill has been singled out to protect its autonomy.</p><p>During debates on the Universities Act 1997, the then Minister for Education attracted criticism for proposing a minimum of three ministerial nominees on governing bodies that varied between 20 to 30 members.  The current Minister is proposing boards of 17 with a majority of external nominees and a minority of staff from each institution, with the exception of Trinity, but here too the proposed changes to the governing body will reduce staff representation and curtail the number of elected staff members to the board of TCD.  The governing body's size should be adequate to accommodate all stakeholders, students, staff, alumni, funders, enterprise partners, local communities, government and society.  This can be provided for without compromising a feature of governance which has been proven worldwide to be appropriate for institutes of higher education.</p><p>The provision for boards of 17 members is too rigid and I would like the Minister to look at it again.</p><p>I am thinking as well about the Atlantic Technological University and the whole scope that covers in the counties that it has to represent.   I cannot see how a number of 17 would do that.  I will be a bit parochial.  We need Mayo and other places to be represented as well.  We need a bit more room there.  </p></speech>

A key tenet of this Bill is to make sure that we protect the autonomy of our institutions.  That is really important.  To ensure that happens, we need to make sure that we improve internal governance, and this Bill is trying to do that.</p> <p>  At the outset, and I want to be really clear on this, people who serve on governing authorities are doing so for the public good.  They do not get a cent.  These are non-remunerated positions.  This is the definition of public service.  They work hard and they do a good job.  None of what I am about to say is in any way a criticism of people who serve on governing authorities.  In my time as Minister, I have had the honour and pleasure of appointing many excellent people to governing authorities.</p> <p>  However, some governing authorities have 40 people on them.  I do not believe that is effective for oversight.  I definitely do not think that it is effective for the CEO of an organisation to also be chairperson of the board, so that they can ask themselves if they are doing a good job.  I do not think that works.  I cannot think of a comparable situation, although the HSE used to be like that for a brief period of time, where there is an idea that the chairperson is also the CEO.  We are therefore trying to make sure that there external chair.  The Deputy is right that there are differences for Trinity College Dublin.  We will get to the Trinity section in a minute, if I may call it that.  However, there are legal differences around Trinity.  We are trying to respond to those differences, while also bringing about the reform.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to say that there is not one magic number - although I am not sure if she used the word &ldquo;magic&rdquo; - and why the figure should be 17, rather than 18 or 15, etc.  I do take that point.  However, a consistency of approach across the sector is what we are trying to achieve.  There is not one magic number and it is an arbitrary decision as to how one lands at a number.  That is not incorrect.  However, the purpose here is to agree a composition that can work for the sector, that can make sure it has access to the expertise it requires, that makes sure that the staff voice and the student voice are still there and that there is an external majority.  I see this as a strength for the institutions.  If we take Atlantic Technological University as an example, and the Deputy rightly raised it, involving external voices will strengthen and embed the university more in a region.</p> <p>  This idea of reforming the governing authorities was not mine.  I cannot take credit for it.  It has been recommended in the National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030.  I am not sure that there is an issue that has been consulted on more than this issue.  I think even the sector itself would acknowledge it, although I cannot speak for it.  I know their representative bodies - such as the university representative bodies, technological universities or institutes of technology - would all accept that there needs to be change and reform in the composition of governing authorities.  In meetings I have had with them, that has not been the debating point.  They have wanted to get the composition right.  I think I am accurate in saying that they all accept there needs to be a change in the composition.  Certainly, that was the distinct impression that I got.</p> <p>  The provisional smaller competency-based governing authorities is a vital part of the overall reform of the Higher Education Authority Act.  I accept that the Deputy and I have differences of view on this, but that is why I cannot accept amendments Nos. 150 and 230. </p> <p>  Amendment No. 151 is in the name of Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  The Deputy has not yet spoken to it. </p></speech>

I presume that the Minister would agree with me that the student voice is often relegated.  It happens right throughout education.  Most of the discussions that take place are about learning, and about those who may learn, without those people having input at the top table.</p> <p>  Within all of that, I have to congratulate the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, today on elevating the issue to a higher area of responsibility than had been there before.</p> <p>  In the Bill, there is a provision for two student members.  We are simply proposing that it would be increased to three.  I think that would be a better balance.  By having three within themselves as a body, it is easier for them to have a coherent view on something, rather than having two opposing views.  The Minister might see where I am coming from there.  We would like the Minister to move from two members to three members to strengthen the student voice.  </p></speech>

We can come back to that, but I would just mention it in passing to the Deputy.</p> <p>  I get Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in&rsquo;s point.

If I alter one part of the composition, it will have knock-on effects for all the other components.  I would say here, to the USI and to the student voice in general, that at the moment they are under the provisions of the Universities Act.  There are three to four members of the student body on governing authorities of up to 40 people.  Proportionately, while there were three or four out of 40, there will now be two out of 17.  Therefore, the weight of influence that the student voice will have on the governing authority has truthfully and factorially increased as a proportion of the overall body.</p> <p>  However, I do not want to be in any way disingenuous.  I know that the USI and others would prefer three members.  They have conveyed that view to me.   However, the rationale behind two is contained within the overall composition of the Bill.  </p></speech>

I am trying to be able to tell the people of Ireland that I am satisfied that the governance structure works.  We have been collaborative on this Bill, so I do not wish to be argumentative.  However, if we passed Deputy Conway-Walsh&rsquo;s amendment No. 150, we would be removing all the reforms to the composition of the governing authority.  The challenge that I have faced as Minister, and people would argue as to whether I have gotten this right or wrong, is to come up with a composition.  If we passed amendment No. 150, we would just keep the <i>status quo</i>.  I do not think that even the sector believes in the <i>status quo</i>.  The challenge is to try to get it right.</p><p>I accept that it would be counter-factual to suggest that the figure of 17 is not an arbitrary number.  Of course, it is.  However, there is a rationale behind it that includes an external chairperson, eight other external members, two students, the chief officer and five internal members.  That is how we get there.  We are trying to be fair to the constituent parts. </p><p>We have made a policy decision that there should be an external majority.  Some would agree and some would disagree with that decision.  However, it is a policy decision and I think it is an important policy decision to protect autonomy.  I say this because they will be able to stand over strong internal governance by having an external majority.  I think that helps to protect the autonomy.  We see this across the Bill, which enables the institutions to have the right modern governance structures in place, as well as being able to get on with their own affairs.  It is an important policy intent.  It is entirely up to Deputy Conway-Walsh and to the stakeholders to bring forward further proposals on Report Stage.  However, my position on this is set.  That is my honest answer to her question. </p></speech>

It will be widely anticipated and welcomed by colleagues.  Deputy Conway-Walsh and I have had discussions about this is in the context of the north west.  It does two things.  First, it seeks to amend the Technological Universities Act to provide that the Minister may, following an application by order, provide that an education institution or part thereof can be incorporated into a technological university.  Second, it amends the aforementioned Act to recognise applications for incorporation made on an administrative basis, ahead of the commencement of the provisions I have just outlined.  It is expected this will be availed of to facilitate the incorporation of St. Angela's College into Atlantic Technological University.  </p><p>We are trying to support St. Angela's College, Sligo, joining Atlantic Technological University, ATU.  That is, in the first instance, a matter for the governing authority of ATU.  I believe it will consider it at its board meeting of 9 May and then follow the procedure set out.  There was no legal basis for this to happen in advance of the Bill.  I am pleased we are doing that.  We are also providing an administrative basis, which is important to ensuring there is no delay.  We can move ahead on an administrative basis and, while we are at it, we are future-proofing the legislation in case such a situation should arise in the future.</p></speech>

These amendments exclude a member of the academic council of the college from being classified as an external member for the purpose of appointment to the governing authority.  The amendments also remove members of the academic council from the definition of an internal member.  This means that an internal member is a member of staff of the technological university or is a person who is remunerated under contract with the technological university.  These definitions are now accurate.  They align with the definitions in the Technological Universities Act 2018.  Amendments Nos. 187 and 188 make similar amendments to the definitions of &quot;external member&quot; and &quot;internal member&quot; of the governing body of an institute of technology.  Amendments Nos. 180 and 182 provide for consultation by the president of a technological university with trade unions or staff associations of members of staff on the preparation of the strategic development plan and the equality statement of the technological university.  Sections 89 and 90 amend the Technological Universities Act to provide for consultation on the preparation of these plans with certain persons and bodies.  It is considered - and I know it is a view conveyed today - to include trade unions and staff associations of members of staff in these consultation processes. </p></speech>

I do not mean to be rude, but I think my Opposition colleagues' amendments are probably part of the same argument that we had earlier.  I think the same arguments on both sides stand.  I will not repeat my argument on that.  Amendment No. 183 seeks to provide specific details of the breakdown of the membership of the five internal members, other than the president of the governing body of an institute of technology.  These provisions are in accordance with the provisions for internal memberships of the governing body of a college under section 82 of the Technological Universities Act.  The reason for amendment No. 183 is to ensure it is in accordance with the election provisions for academic and non-academic staff to the governing body of institute of technology, as set out in section 82 of the Technological Universities Act.  I think this was something sought by staff representatives.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 189 is a technical amendment to allow for the additional amendment, amendment No. 192.  Amendment No. 189 inserts (a) and amendment No. 192 inserts (b).  Amendment No. 191 is a technical amendment to insert the word &quot;and&quot; to facilitate amendment No. 192.  Amendment No. 192 is a consequential amendment to section 7(6) of the 1992 Act, which is required as a result of the repeal of subsections 4 and 5 of section 7.  These subsections are being replaced by paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule, to be inserted by section 103 of the Bill.  For clarity, there is a need to reference a committee of the governing body of a college as there are also committees of the academic council of a college.  Amendment No. 190 is to clarify that the obligation of the governing authority of an institute of technology is to have appropriate systems, procedures and practices in place in order to implement and report on compliance with the policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government to the extent that these policies may affect or relate to the functions of the institute of technology.  As we discussed earlier, the wording has been amended from &quot;enable compliance with the policies&quot; to &quot;implement, and report on compliance with, the policies&quot; to more accurately reflect the policy intent of the subsection.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the members who participated in the recent visit to Moldova and Romania.  Senator Regina Doherty and Deputies Brendan Howlin and John Brady travelled along with me.  I also acknowledge Darren Kelly, the policy official to the committee, who travelled with us, our ambassador in Bucharest, H.E. Paul McGarry, who looked after logistics while we were there, and the clerk to the committee, Mr. Barry Kavanagh, who helped to pull the programme together.  In particular, I thank the people of Moldova and Romania who gave us a great welcome and a privileged insight into all the good things taking place in both countries in response to the humanitarian crisis.  The committee will have an opportunity today to hear the members who were part of that programme give their insights and observations.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, many of the predictions and observations we heard in Moldova and Romania are coming to pass.  Ireland also faces challenges regarding how we greet and welcome Ukrainian refugees and put together proper programmes for dealing with them.  If there are learnings from Romania or Moldova, this meeting will be an opportunity to discuss them.  We have produced a report on our visit, which will be published within the next week.  We met many representatives of NGOs and government officials and ministers.  Their key insights and observations will be helpful in the overall conversation.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I welcome H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet, ambassador of the Republic of Moldova to Ireland, and her colleagues.  I also welcome H.E. Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan, ambassador of Romania to Ireland, and his colleagues.</p> <p>  Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending the meeting remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Before I call on H.E. Mrs. Miculet to make her opening statement, I acknowledge the presence of H.E. Mr. George Zurabashvili, the ambassador of Georgia, who is very welcome.  It is good to see him again.  We will now open the meeting with the opening statement of H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet.</p></speech>

I am especially honoured to be in this legislative body today as my people and country celebrate national state flag day today.  Our flag is a major official symbol of our independence and sovereignty.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for taking the initiative to discuss, in the committee&rsquo;s sessions on March 15 and today, these extremely important issues for my country and also for organising the visit of a cross-party delegation of the committee to Moldova to show solidarity with us and find out how the situation has evolved in my country and what more can be done to support us.<br/><br/>I also express our most sincere appreciation to the leadership of Ireland for the involvement and the assistance announced for Moldova in managing the flow of Ukrainian refugees by relocating 500 refugees from the Republic of Moldova to Ireland and for targeting &euro;1 million for the Republic of Moldova out of the assistance allocated by the Irish Government for the humanitarian situation in Ukraine.  In addition, I thank the Irish people, including members of the Moldovan diaspora, for collecting and sending humanitarian aid to my country.  Our gratitude also goes to the RT&Eacute; television news crew and <i>The Irish Times</i>newspaper leadership for providing to Irish society comprehensive, on-the-spot information about Moldova&rsquo;s response to refugee flow.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as we meet today, further tragedy is taking place in Ukraine and this tragedy is difficult to put into words.  The world has recently witnessed even more shocking atrocities committed against civilians in Ukraine.</p><p>It is hard to believe that all of these crimes are happening in the 21st century, just at our border, in our neighbour and friend Ukraine.  Meanwhile, some dangerous incidents and attempts to destabilise the situation in the Transnistrian region were registered recently.  These pose high security risks for my country.</p><p> Let me reiterate that our country's position on the war in Ukraine is clear, firm and leaves no room for interpretation.  The Republic of Moldova strongly condemns the war of Russia against Ukraine and demanded from the first day of military aggression that this war has be stopped.  My country has voted in favour of diplomatic statements condemning the war waged by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and co-authored resolutions adopted at the UN.</p><p> The Government of the Republic of Moldova has provided to Ukraine humanitarian aid worth 24 million lei in two instalments.  These are in Odessa, which is near my country, and in Vinnytsia on the other side.  It is ready to help our neighbours more.  Millions of people have been forced to flee their homes in Ukraine because of the war.  At our meeting on 15 March, I briefed the esteemed members of the committee on our actions.  I stated the Republic of Moldova had firmly demonstrated its commitment and engagement in ensuring international protection for those seeking refuge in Moldova.  The government has taken co-ordinated action to manage transit and refugee flows from Ukraine.  State institutions, tens of thousands of people, volunteers, police officers, public servants, medical doctors, mayors, executives and ordinary citizens all mobilised to help.</p><p> Since the onset of the conflict, more than 425,000 refugees have crossed into Moldova.  Some have been assisted to travel onwards to other countries, including through pledges made by EU countries to receive refugees from Moldova in an effort to share responsibility and reduce pressure on neighbouring countries.  Ireland is included in this.  The Republic of Moldova continues to host more than 95,000 refugees.  Of these, 91,000 are Ukrainian and we also have other nationalities.  With the inter-agency support of international organisations present in Moldova, a response mechanism is being implemented to assist Ukrainian refugees.  The mechanism includes measures on protection, accommodation, transportation, education, health and cash-based interventions for refugees.  It is important to highlight that cash enrolment in Moldova has been growing rapidly since the programme was launched at the end of March.  The figures for cash enrolment vary from country to country.  They are not as big or as high in Moldova as elsewhere but the mechanism exists.  The goal is to provide cash for approximately 150,000 refugees as well as for Moldovan host families who have opened their homes to refugees fleeing Ukraine.</p><p> Many high-level dignitaries of international organisations and our partner countries who visited Moldova have praised the authorities for the robust emergency response at our borders and within the country.  They expressed their appreciation for the remarkable solidarity in this regard.  At the same time, I am obliged to highlight that this figure of 95,000 refugees is far too large for us and we do not know what to expect with developments near Odessa.  Members can probably easily understand this because they can compare it with the number of refugees in Ireland.  The number in Moldova is four times bigger.  The influx of refugees is placing enormous pressure on my country.  Given the scale of this crisis, we need additional support from the international community to be able to provide appropriate assistance and keep the country stable.  It is important for all of Europe to have a stable Moldova.</p><p> I will name a few urgent needs.  We need to strengthen existing national systems to enable them to respond efficiently.  For example, 50,000 children have been enrolled in schools so the education system needs support.  The health system, the police and many other parts of our national system are also involved in the process.  We need to continue relocation of the refugees   Up to 19 April, more than 1,000 had been relocated to countries, including Lithuania, Austria, Germany and Latvia.  I have requested a meeting with the leadership of the Department of Justice.  I have not yet received a reply but I hope it is coming.  I want to discuss with it Ireland&rsquo;s refugee relocation mechanism, which is the responsibility of that Department.  I know from being here that when Ireland does something it does so nicely and efficiently.  This is probably why it took a bit of time to put the mechanism in place.  I am quite sure it will be operational very soon.</p><p> We are asking our partners for direct financial assistance.  We thank Ireland for helping us in this regard.  Generally speaking, I want the committee to understand what we mean by this.  We were confronted with a situation whereby big sums of money were announced.  Some people were asking the authorities for this money.  Sometimes international special mechanisms are very slow.  This is why those who assisted us bilaterally were of great help.  Everything was very pressing and money did not arrive.  Every situation and system response to the conflict is different.  Some international organisations are more used to providing tents.  In our case, refugees were hosted in homes.  This is why another type of response, such as cash interventions for host families and refugees themselves, is necessary.  We are working on this and we are grateful the organisations are flexible and are adjusting their activities.</p><p>Fortunately, during this difficult time, Moldova has not been left alone and receives assistance in many ways.  I mention one such initiative, the support conference for Moldova held in Berlin on 5 April.  It was organised by the German Federal Foreign Office and co-hosted by the German, France and Romanian foreign ministers.  We thank you for that.  That conference was aimed at mobilising immediate international support for our country but it went beyond that.  It was aimed at helping us with those other challenges Moldova faces right now relating to the war in Ukraine, which is a conflict at our border.  In this context, we also express our appreciation to the Irish authorities for the assistance and support provided to Moldova within this initiative.  Ireland participated and we are grateful.</p><p> It is clear the war has not only devastated Ukraine but also deeply affected Moldova, with a serious impact on people's lives.  It has raised prices for food, fuel and energy.  We are also facing the disrupted imports and exports from the eastern markets.  That is why we are now looking for some quick solutions to open other markets for our products that we used to export through Ukraine to other parts of the world.  In our assessment, we will feel the consequences of the war for a long time.  Therefore, we need the support of our partners to strengthen our resilience.</p><p> Despite all difficulties and crises, we continue consistently to implement the government&rsquo;s reform programme with the aim to succeed in building a competitive and resilient country that values its people and invests in them.  Allow me to underline Moldova has applied to join the European Union during this difficult time, willing to confirm it wants to be part of the free world, values democracy and believes that in the family of the European Union it can ensure freedom, security and well-being for its citizens.  The decision of the Republic of Moldova to apply for European Union membership has been taken in exceptional circumstances, as I have highlighted, but this step fully corresponds with its long-standing European aspirations and strategic European choice that members know about.  Within Moldovan society there is a strong sense of expectation and renewed hope linked with the possibility of obtaining EU candidate status.  In this context, we are grateful to the EU member states, including Ireland, for their firm and vocal support of our European aspirations and perspective.</p><p> In the context of EU work on the assessment of Moldova&rsquo;s application for membership, as a first step at this important stage, on 22 April, Moldovan President Maia Sandu and Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilia handed over the completed EU questionnaire to the head of the EU delegation to the Republic of Moldova.  The questionnaire was completed in just 11 days.  This speed clearly shows the determination of the president, government and the whole Moldovan people to do the utmost to bring our country to the European family as quickly as possible.  The Republic of Moldova hopes that the European Commission will recommend and that the June European Council set to be held on 23 and 24 June will take a unanimous positive decision to grant Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia candidate status or potential candidate status.  In this context, we are counting primarily on Ireland's support to approve granting EU candidate status to Moldova.</p><p> We are fully aware, as I said previously, that the accession procedure is long and complex and we are willing to embark on this path.  What we need now is a political decision that will be guiding the country for years ahead.  We need a clear target and strong political message to mobilise everyone, including society, the business community and authorities around the European integration process.  As many members shared with us in the last session, it happened with Ireland as well, at a due time.  From this perspective, please allow me to convey to the committee that my government would greatly appreciate Ireland&rsquo;s further support in managing the refugee flow that is the main topic of today's discussion and also for Moldova&rsquo;s advancement of the co-operation process with European Union.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.874" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#E00300"><p>Chairman, distinguished members of the committee, Mrs. Miculet, I am delighted to have the opportunity to follow up on our discussions of 15 March.  I like to think the consistent exchange with me and my fellow ambassadors of Ukraine, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Poland added momentum to members' decision to travel to the countries affected by the humanitarian crisis.  I congratulate the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs and its leadership on its critical role in responding to the needs of the Irish people to stay tuned to the horrible realities of the war in Ukraine and to remain updated on European Union endeavours to support the people of Ukraine and sanction the aggressor.  Although separated by geography, Romania and Ireland are together in these endeavours and contributing to the strong and unprecedented unity of action of the European Union.  We may be far apart, at the two extremities of the European Continent, but the ugly realities of the war have shown how close we are and how close we should be in defending our common values, namely, the liberties of our citizens, the democratic backbone of our public lives and the independence and sovereignty of our countries for which our ancestors gave their lives.</p> <p>  With these and upcoming challenges ahead of us, Ireland and Romania should work even closer together.  This is already happening.  I praise the decision of the committee to send a delegation of its members to Romania and to the Republic of Moldova to witness first-hand how the authorities and peoples of these two countries handle the humanitarian challenges posed by huge numbers of Ukrainians who are fleeing the war to safety.  Together, we stand with Ukraine but I am sure that after the meetings in Chiinu, Palanca, Suceava, Siret and Bucharest, Romania and the Republic of Moldova will have an even larger place in your hearts and minds.</p> <p>  Allow me to mention in this context, as Mrs. Miculet did previously, the joint initiative of the Romanian, French and German Governments to raise awareness to the particularly sensitive and difficult situation in the Republic of Moldova in the context of the Russian aggression in neighbouring Ukraine.  Following the Moldova support conference organised on 5 of April in Berlin and co-hosted by the foreign ministers of Romania, France and Germany, many countries, including Ireland, pledged specific support to the Republic of Moldova via the Moldova support platform.  I take this opportunity to thank Ireland for providing substantial support to the Republic of Moldova in the context of the humanitarian crisis but also in the process of joining the European Union.</p> <p>  The joint support for the Republic of Moldova is only one of the many areas in which Romania and Ireland will work closer together in the future.  Later this afternoon, senior officials in the ministries of foreign affairs of our two countries will hold political consultations.  It may appear to be a coincidence, but this shows the intensity with which our two countries are prepared to work together.  In less than a month, the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Romania, Mrs. Daniela G&igrave;tman, will travel to Dublin to engage with her counterpart, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and also to meet this committee.</p><p>A delegation of the European affairs committee of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies is also scheduled to come to Dublin to consolidate the dialogue at the parliamentary level.</p><p> Our bilateral relationship grows stronger and the recent trip of the delegation of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to Romania was a consistent part of this process.  One obvious conclusion after this trip is that our two countries will continue to support the European aspirations of the people of Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova.</p><p> I thank the committee again for the invitation.  I am looking forward to taking members' questions and listening to their comments.</p></speech>

Of the many visits I have made over my parliamentary career, it was one of the most impactive.  The members who travelled talked privately before this meeting.  All of us took some time when we came home to reflect on the volume of issues with which we were presented.  On my behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of everyone else involved, I thank all those we met, both in Romania and Moldova, for their absolute openness.  There was an extremely open, frank and inclusive discussion on all of the realities and all of us came back with a sense of professionalism and generosity in meeting an unprecedented crisis.  That view is expressed in our report which will be published imminently.  I hope the ambassadors will convey to their Governments and, more especially, the peoples of both their nations our awe and admiration for the way in which they have gone about meeting this unprecedented crisis.  We came back determined to redouble our efforts in explaining the depth of the crisis, which is unprecedented in modern European history, but also to see how we can assist matters.</p> <p>  I will deal with a number of specific points.  I do not know if we have an update on the 500 refugees Ireland has undertaken to accept from Moldova and whether they have arrived here.  That was one of the issues we said we would follow up on as soon as we came back.  Perhaps the ambassador, H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet, has an update.  If not, I suggest we make direct contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs to find out what is happening in that respect.</p> <p>  The second issue, one we were all mindful of, is that while there is substantial international support mediated through international organisations, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, and United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, UNICEF, there is a dearth of direct support to the Governments of Moldova and Romania, particularly the former, to meet the pressures.  We had an extraordinary meeting with the Moldovan health minister, Dr. Nemerenco, who described in great detail the pressures on the health system as it was opened up to the 100,000 Ukrainian refugees who are now in Moldova.  In the context of the country's population and capacity, the pressure is enormous.  We need to give direct support to deal with that.  The ambassador referred to the education system and other state systems.  Direct government-to-government financial support is needed in addition to the support provided through international organisations.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the issues we were mindful of are that the conflict may migrate towards Odessa, that Odessa, a large modern city, may be attacked and that the consequences of mass migration from Odessa through Palanka into Moldova would overwhelm Moldova, bluntly, if it arrived at a scale of 100,000 people per day.  Romania is already planning to support Moldova to ease the pressure there but we all need to be part of that easing of pressure because should that happen - please God, it will not - it would be a human catastrophe.  As we have seen, rockets landed in Odessa last weekend.  When we were in Palanka, a 30-minute drive from Odessa, that possibility was made abundantly clear to us.  The stated ambition of creating a Russian corridor through to Transnistria in Moldova, which was at the edges of our fears, is now a potential reality to which we need to be alert.</p> <p>  All of us understood the scale of the support Romania was providing but we were taken aback by the professionalism and organisation we saw, particularly in Suceava.  At the Siret crossing point, we were concerned about a range of issues, including the security of migrants coming across and the potential for exploitation.  The organised and professional security cordon that ensured nobody could enter the Siret region without proper identification, etc., was hugely impressive.</p> <p>  On the issue of supports, I was struck by the useful initiative of the UNHCR in providing Ukrainians coming into Moldova or Romania, once registered, a card with $100 per person per month.  This approach has a variety of positives.  It gives the individuals concerned independence and protects their dignity, which is extremely important, but it also helps the local community by providing spending power within it.  That is vital.  Is that model working and is it extensive enough?  How can we support it?</p> <p>  My final question is on practical steps we need to take.  It struck us as odd that there are so many direct connections between Ireland and Romania and none to Moldova.  Is a direct air link to Chiinu in the pipeline or is there anything the committee could usefully do in relation to that?  Creating markets would also be practical.  We had the great pleasure of sampling a great variety of Moldovan produce - food, drink, etc. - when we were there, which would certainly have a market here.  Maybe we could seek to assist with that as well.  Those are my opening thoughts.</p></speech>

Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#F00500"><p>I thank the Deputy so much.  I was impressed by the fact that the committee decided to visit Romania and Moldova.  As I told the Deputy at our previous meeting, the focus in regard to the particular issue of humanitarian assistance should be on Moldova.  Romania is supporting and partnering with Moldova.  We are careful, which is the reason Romania, along with Germany and France, decided to initiate the Moldova support platform.  That is the urgent need and it is an issue I said a few words about in my introduction.</p> <p>  The second issue is the European perspective.  Everybody knows this is a long road but the European perspective should be clear.  Romania and other European countries, including, I am sure, Ireland, will support that and convince other European countries that are much more sceptical that we - Romania, Ireland and other European countries - should be together with the Republic of Moldova and Georgia.  Let us not forget about Georgia, one of the first countries to be affected by Russian aggression.  It is the role of the embassies of our countries to maintain momentum and keep attention on the region - Ukraine, of course, and the Republic of Moldova but also Georgia - as high as possible.  Let us not forget about Georgia.  It may not be affected by the humanitarian crisis to the same extent as Romania, Poland and the Republic of Moldova, but it is important.</p><p>I spoke with my colleagues in Bucharest and Suceava who praised the fact that members of the committee were there on the field.  It is not easy.  People are keen to stay in their offices to watch and comment but I am here to praise the fact that the committee decided to visit and witness the hardship of the people in Moldova and the complexity of the processes.  </p><p> As we discussed last time, Romania has put in place a complex mechanism to assist.  There are six groups in the chancellery of the Prime Minister dealing with children, elderly people, housing, schooling and students.  All the sensitive human issues are covered and the six working groups are co-ordinated by the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister travelled to Kyiv yesterday.  The Ukraine foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, was in Bucharest.  We are in close co-ordination with Ukrainian officials to see what is needed in terms of practical assistance to carry on the war and also refugees.  We have started to discuss the future.  We should talk more about the future and be optimistic while providing the necessary assistance, both for the people in Ukraine and those who travel to safety from Ukraine to other countries.</p><p> I do not have specifics on the UNHCR mechanism.  I know the Romanian Government is looking to the Romanian people who are hosting.  There was a recent decision to increase the allocation for food and rent to people who decide to host.  It is to encourage Romanians who host Ukrainians to carry on doing so because at some point they may become a burden.  We should carry on with the hospitality but resources are necessary.  My Government is looking into that.</p><p> I will stop there and I can come back later.  I thank members for the opportunity to praise the committee and its work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#G00200"><p>I agree with Dr. tefan's sentiments about this committee, which so quickly responded to the meeting we held here.  In just a few days, I heard that the Chairman and members decided quickly to visit Moldova, Palanca and many other places.  They now know what they talking about, having seen the reality.  I was personally touched but the visit was appreciated by the entire country.  We have just started our parliamentary connections.  The committee delegation was probably the first group of parliamentarians to visit Moldova so that was also very important and touching.</p> <p>  Deputy Howlin was correct about developments in Odessa.  Yesterday a bridge connecting the south of Ukraine, near Odessa, with Moldova was destroyed.  Therefore, Palanca, which the delegation visited, is now the only crossing point for people from Odessa if they need to flee to Moldova.  It is very narrow and has not been adjusted for thousands of people.  We are trying to manage the situation today but also to evaluate what might happen.  We pray it will not be needed.</p> <p>  Cash enrolment is probably the most useful and appreciated assistance in the country.  I will give some information to compare with the kind of help given by Ireland.  It is very different.  We give 2,000 leu monthly, which is &euro;100, to refugees.  To people who are hosting refugees, we provide 3,500 leu, more than &euro;150, which is not very much.  Previously, people helped out without any kind of cash support.</p> <p>  I am very grateful that Deputy Howlin raised the issue of markets.  We are working very closely to open new markets for our products.  Some Moldovan products are already available in Ireland.  We are looking to enhance that.  That is my job but because of the Covid pandemic, I was not able to do much in this area.  I am sure that with the support of this committee and other committees that are more focused on commerce, I will be able to do further work on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.882" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#G00300"><p>I thank the ambassadors.  I commend Romania and Moldova on the hospitality shown to me and my colleagues on our recent visit and the expertise, openness and honesty shown by all the organisations, individuals and politicians we met.  We had very frank conversations.  It is a visit that will stay in my heart forever.  It is one thing to watch the news and see the horror unfolding in Europe but it is a completely different experience to see a mother and her two or three children come across the border at Palanca or Siret carrying a plastic bag and crying her eyes out, not knowing where she was going or what the future holds, when she may go home or whether she will see her husband ever again.  That is something that will stay with me forever.</p> <p>  I had another very striking engagement in the refugee centre in Chiinu when I met a woman who, I think, had two children.  She had spoken to her husband the previous evening.  He is on the front line in Ukraine defending his country.  She had not heard from him since.  As she was speaking to him, missiles were falling around him.  It was very real and horrific.  I can only imagine the trauma those people are experiencing.  I commend the hospitality that both countries have shown to the refugees who are fleeing for their lives with only a few valued possessions.</p> <p>  We engaged with many organisations in Romania and Moldova.  As Deputy Howlin said, the openness from everyone we met was striking.  I will deal with the two countries separately.  Moldova is a country that has very little in the way of finance and is extremely poor but it was very apparent that the warmth and generosity shown to the refugees have been striking.  Over 425,000 people have crossed into Moldova, of whom about 100,000 have decided to stay there given its proximity to Odessa and the southern part of Ukraine, which, unfortunately, is coming under more and more pressure.  As the ambassador said, the bridge that was struck yesterday just below Palanca was struck again this morning to ensure it was completely destroyed.</p><p>In recent days we have also seen potential false flag operations in Transnistria.  I refer to the destruction of two telecommunication towers.  There were reports this morning that there was an attack or attempted attack on the largest weapons depot in Europe, which holds more than 20,000 tonnes of Soviet air ammunition.  There are reports that there may have been an attack on it this morning.  To my mind, these are all potentially false flag operations because Russia has stated that to try to stabilise the situation in Transnistria, it may not stand idly by.  To my mind, that means there is potential for Russia to open up that land connection from Mariupol right across through Odessa and into Transnistria.  The concerns that generates are significant.</p><p> I was struck by a genuine and simple request from all those we met in Moldova in respect of the need for hard cash.  It is striking that in her opening statement H.E. Mrs. Miculet welcomed the &euro;1 million that has come from Ireland in humanitarian assistance.  That is a drop in the ocean.  I think it was Senator Doherty who stated in our engagement in Moldova that the amount is actually an embarrassment.  I agree that it is an embarrassment.  In the context of dealing with the poorest country in Europe, for &euro;1 million to be given in humanitarian assistance is pitiful and an embarrassment.  I repeat my calls in that regard.  I think all representatives of the committee were speaking in unison on this issue while we were in Moldova, stating that this needs to be addressed immediately.  There needs to be a substantial amount of money from Ireland and the EU to Moldova to help with the humanitarian crisis and the fantastic response that has been made.  That monetary assistance needs to be forthcoming.</p><p> Some of the NGOs we met, including Plan International, expressed concerns in respect of vulnerable people, including unaccompanied minors, crossing the borders and the potential for trafficking.  That concern was expressed by some of the organisations there.  Unfortunately, it is a reality.  It is happening.  There have been reports of it taking place.  This issue needs to be addressed, given the volume of refugees coming over the border.  The organisations stated that proper vetting of people dropping off goods or collecting refugees at border points needs to be put in place in order to ensure the potential for trafficking is completely eliminated.   The organisations stated that there is massive goodwill coming from Ireland and right across Europe but their appeal to members of the public who wish or need to do something is for them not to go directly to border crossing points because that adds complications in terms of trying to avoid the potential for trafficking or the picking up of unaccompanied minors by people who should not be there.  Trafficking is a threat.  It is a matter that needs to be considered and stricter and more rigid procedures must be put in place.</p><p> As regards the 500 refugees Ireland has agreed to take in, I will follow up on the point made by Deputy Howlin.  It was a concern while we were in Moldova that although the announcement that Ireland will take in 500 refugees is welcome, it seemed to come from nowhere.  The figure was not based on anything in particular. Have those 500 refugees now landed in Ireland?  It was a concern when we were in Moldova that the announcement was made but there was no movement on it.  H.E. Mrs. Miculet may be able to update the committee in that regard.  I am also concerned that her request to meet the Minister for Justice has not been responded to.  This may be a matter on which the committee can follow up.  Given everything we have stated and seen in the context of the crisis that is unfolding and the additional pressures on Moldova, that request should be acted upon immediately.  The committee needs to follow up on that because it is concerning that the request has not been responded to, let alone the meeting granted.  </p><p> As regards Romania, its openness, honesty, expertise and commitment to deal with the situation are second to none.  Everyone we met was so open and excellent.  We visited a refugee centre in Bucharest.  There is a fantastic operation in place there.  The level of volunteers not just in Moldova but also in Romania was stark.  There were schoolchildren going straight to the refugee centres at the end of their school day in order to help out.  It was striking.  A matter that struck me in the context of our engagements in Romania was the significant costs.  We were told it had cost between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million up to that point.  I am sure that figure has been exceeded at this stage.  Like in the case of Moldova, very little assistance, if any, has been forthcoming from the EU.  Indeed, we were told there were no additional funds or money coming from the EU and that Romania had been told it had to use up its existing cohesion funding before a request for funding could be considered.  That is really concerning.  Billions of euro are being pumped into providing weapons for Ukraine, and those weapons are needed, obviously, but we do not see a parallel level of funding going to help deal with the humanitarian crisis that, unfortunately, is evolving as a result of the war.  That seriously needs to be looked at because more than 777,000 refugees have crossed over into Romania to date.  I refer to the additional infrastructure in terms of road services and everything that will be needed to cater for that massive increase in population.  Existing cohesion funding is now being sidetracked to deal with the crisis.  This is a serious issue that needs to be immediately addressed by the EU.  That will be borne out in our report.</p><p> This morning, we saw that Russia cut off the gas supply to Poland and Bulgaria.  In Moldova, it was striking how dependent the country is on that gas for the production of electricity.  We were told  the gas supply is being provided free to Transnistria but the bill had been passed on to Moldova.  Are there serious concerns now that the gas supply to Moldova may be cut?  It was striking that Moldova is very dependent on that supply.  Is Dr. tefan concerned that the supply to Romania may be cut off?  What contingencies have been put in place?  How dependent is Romania on that supply?</p><p> This has been a very useful engagement.  I have probably left a lot out in terms of my questions.  It will probably take me a while to analyse it.  I am still analysing some of our engagement but it was a very useful trip and there are many things that will stick with me.  I know I have related a couple of stories already.</p><p>There was another young man in Moldova as well, who was 17 and just missed the military age in Ukraine.  He and his mam managed to bring their dog with them.  He was sitting on a bus heading to Spain.  They barely had a word of English, let alone a word of Spanish.  They did not know where they were going or what the future held for them.  It is very striking when we hear figures, statistics and of horrors and we should remember we are dealing with real humans whose lives have been turned upside down.  We do not know what the future holds for them.  There is a massive humanitarian crisis in the region that this horrific war has generated.  The response from the international community, including the EU and Ireland, is lacking to say the least.  It must be addressed.</p></speech>

I saw a picture of the day as he watched the address of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the car he described.  I thank him for the words of solidarity he expressed to us and appreciation.  He described precisely the situation in Moldova, including the emotions people are feeling, as well as our needs.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>  We welcome any food or assistance from Ireland or other countries.  There are different mechanisms, as I said.  One is the platform for Moldova that was initiated recently.  The EU mechanism is still active for Moldova to receive assistance.  There was a question regarding the mechanism for relocation.  Unfortunately, I am not aware of the matter.  I assume nobody has been relocated or otherwise I would see it noted in the papers I constantly receive from the ministry.  I assume it is because of the holidays and a reply indicates the letter was received.  I will probably have a meeting.  I understand the ministry for justice is working very hard on the Irish mechanism for refugee flows.  I am optimistic and quite sure we will manage with the committee's help to discuss the topic.</p> <p>  On the question of Transnistria, it is a very tense and complex situation right now.  It is probably the most important development that is now followed by everyone and not just Moldova.  It is followed by all our partners, the EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, mission in Moldova.  Just after those incidents, the OSCE mission called for everybody in general not to take any actions to undermine the trust and work that has been achieved up to now in the management of this conflict.  Yesterday the Moldovan President called a supreme security council meeting.  After that, Moldovan President Maia Sandu held a briefing, stating that all appropriate state agencies are on alert.  They were also given additional tasks, including to be more vigilant, investigate and take all measures needed from our side.  At the same time the President called on our people to stay calm and not to use false sources of information.  That is very important in such situations.</p> <p>  Our President also stated we are looking to use existing mechanisms, including the 5+2 format etc., to settle the conflict.  This means we are still looking to diplomatic and political solutions for the region.  We do not control the Transnistrian region but they are our citizens and it is our territory.  We are concerned and working with partners to approach these incidents that are seeking to destabilise in the best possible way.</p> <p>  I reiterate my words of appreciation and gratitude to the Romanian authorities, as has been mentioned.  There is a connection and we are working together in providing support.  This support, by the way, is not just in the area of managing the flow of refugees.  Romania is working hand in hand with us in the European accession process, which is already at the level of parliaments.  There was a meeting and they expressed an intention and a readiness to help us in this process at the parliamentary level.  The Chairman asked in a separate letter what we will need in the process towards further European integration.  I replied by saying now it is a question of deep assessment and we are completing those questionnaires.  There will be an assessment and we will need help at the level of parliaments and other authorities in future steps.  I will bring that to the committee's attention in time.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the energy resilience of my country.  It is one of the major topics we are working on.  There was and still is an energy crisis in my country and the members may have discussed this with authorities.  Prices of gas have risen to a level but probably not every European country pays that price.  We have only one source of gas, which makes us very vulnerable.</p> <p>  There are steps being taken to diversify.  Romania is on one side stocking some gas for us and the European Union announced that if there is a purchase of gas for European countries, Moldova would be included in the mechanism.  On the electricity side, I am also pleased to say our electricity system was connected to the European system just recently.  That helps us a lot.</p> <p>  At this moment, the European Union perspective for us is the cornerstone of everything.  It is why we repeat our plea for support and for a European perspective.  We will do our homework and it will be for the benefit of the entire European region.  That is probably what Ireland expects from us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.886" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022042700002#J00300"><p>I was touched by Deputy Brady's stories of his trip to Romania and the Republic of Moldova, and how it affected his view of the region.  I hope we can work together in future and he will travel there in more normal and peaceful times to see what else we can do for our countries and the region.</p><p>I will be brief and try to address the two questions.</p><p> The Romanian Government is keeping track of the expenses, so I have the figures.  A sum of &euro;70 million has been spent on refugees.  Romania has provided &euro;100 million to the Republic of Moldova to assist our neighbours in handling this humanitarian crisis.  We know that the European Union is doing its best.  It may do more, of course.  There are all these pressures - the members know that better than I do - on spending, military support and refugees in Poland and other countries, so there are huge challenges.  I tend to see the positive side of the story in that the European Union acted in a united way.  Of course, it may not have taken some decisions with the speed needed, but it is on the right track.  With everybody here, and with our leaders pushing and co-ordinating at the European level, we can do more - that is for sure.  The fact that we are interacting here today is a clear sign of unity and of our joint concern for countries such as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia.  There is a lot of work ahead, but I think we are ready.</p><p> As for energy security, Romania has been a strong voice in the European Union in looking at this issue for at least ten years.  Nobody paid attention.  We know from some facts that Germany, which is a very important country, did not pay too much attention to those concerns and now Europe is paying the cost because a number of European leaders admit they cannot simply cut commercial ties with Russia.  That is highly problematic.  I will not get into that discussion, but we are reaching that red line now with Poland and Bulgaria being cut off from Russian gas.  We have been concerned about the issue for some time and looked into it years ago, not necessarily on the brink of the war, with the Republic of Moldova.  As H.E. Mrs. Miculet said, we now have the gas connection and there is a gas pipeline, so we will be able to help the Republic of Moldova as much as we can.  The good thing is that we are not as reliant on Russian gas as other European countries are.  Romania has natural resources, so we are looking at other alternative resources.  That has been a major policy concern for Romania.  I am not saying we have addressed it properly, but the attention was there and we moved closely to reduce the dependency as much as we could.  Of course, there is debate in Romania as to "What will happen if?".  I think Romania is better prepared than other countries and we can help our neighbours if necessary.  It is to be hoped, however, that the committee and the leaders of this country will push that onto the European agenda to warn other countries, or the big countries, that we should move ahead from oil and gas from Russia and look elsewhere.  I know the United States is providing assistance and gas.  Let us see how we can handle this critical issue together.</p></speech>

There is nothing surer than seeing something for real, for yourself, to raise the temperature of the emotions you feel.  Deputy Brady has expressed in a lovely way the impact that meeting the children and the refugees personally and listening to their stories has had on how we feel.  I will not speak for my colleagues, but not happy is how we feel, or definitely how I feel.</p><p>Both ambassadors are incredibly gracious and diplomatic and would not be in the jobs they are in if they were not, but that is tinged, from my perspective, with a lot of anger, not just at our own response in helping neighbouring European countries on the front line but also at the European Union and, to my mind, its complete lack of financial support for the countries neighbouring Ukraine.  It is an absolute insult for the European Union to tell member states to use their cohesion funding that is desperately needed for the reasons the Cohesion Fund is there in the first place in place of giving real financial support for refugees, particularly along the countries bordering Ukraine.</p><p>The reality for me and the takeaway from the visit is not only how beautiful the part of the world the ambassadors come from and live in is, and it definitely requires return visits in normal times, but also the generosity of the people in their part of the world, more so from Moldova than Romania, who have so little but who are giving so much.  It puts me to shame and causes me embarrassment that I find myself in a country that has taken in 25,000 refugees and we are already telling the country that we are creaking at the seams.  Moldova has 91,000 refugees and a smaller population that has the generosity to put refugees in their own homes.  They do not have to have special rooms, special buses or the nonsense we go on with in this country.  I applaud the ambassadors' respectfulness in the response they have given to the statement we made nearly a month ago that we would take an extra 500 refugees with special needs from Moldova.  From my latest inquiries with the Department of Justice yesterday, I understand we are still tinkering around the edges of trying to find somewhere to put them, while the people and citizens of Moldova and Romania have them staying in their sheds and have not grumbled about the fact that they will look after them.  We are still tinkering around the edges as to where we will find to put them.  The committee should praise the humanitarian responses of the peoples of both Romania and Moldova, and indeed probably Bulgaria and Poland, countries which we have not even got to speak to or see yet.</p><p>What we should do next is bring in the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Justice and Housing, Local Government and Heritage and meet with the European Commission to find out exactly what the hell is going on, and not only with streaming funds to look after the refugees.  I am emotionally engaged now at a level at which I certainly was not before my visit.  To my mind, this war could have been over if the EU had made decisions a lot sooner.  If it actually wanted this war to be over today, it would be over today.  The likes of Poland and Bulgaria and the absolutely brave and singular stances they have taken in response to Gazprom are something we should all applaud and ask to be repeated by every other European country.</p><p>What probably struck me most, apart from meeting the refugees, the volunteers and the other people who were giving, and probably the most impactful person to me was a lady I met in Romexpo.  I think she could have single-handedly organised the response herself she was so effective and such a lovely and honest person.</p><p>I do not think we have really decided from a European perspective that this war should be over.  The things that need to be done should have already been done.  With respect to the visit and the people we met, the next steps we should take are to resolve some of the issues that were presented to us during the tour.  Probably the most impactful was the need for cash.  As Deputy Brady said, we were accompanied by a gentleman from <i>The Irish Times</i>who reported at an emotional level I do not think I had seen in <i>The Irish Times</i>before that, which was really appreciated.  When he asked me one day about the &euro;1 million we were clapping ourselves on the back for having given the Moldovan Government, I thought it was buttons and an embarrassment.  We should be doing so much more, whether at a European level or an Irish level.  It is an embarrassment that our local Red Cross in Ireland has fundraised &euro;30 million in recent years and the Irish Government is clapping itself on the back for giving the Moldovan Government &euro;1 million.  I am sorry.  I know the witnesses are being diplomatic, but it is an absolute disgrace.  It is definitely something we should take on board.  Having now met the ambassadors on the return from our trip, when we release our report this week, the people who can give the answers to the questions we raised while touring Moldova and Romania a number of weeks ago should be around this table, and we should do that sooner rather than later.  I commend all the people of Moldova and Romania and all their efforts.</p><p>My final comment is to H.E. Dr. tefan.  The deputy foreign affairs minister we met the day we were leaving told us that Romania has been banging the table for ten years trying to get the French in particular and the Russians to feel and to hear the message it has given.  The deputy minister said that Romania finally felt vindicated that they have woken up and finally seen the threat Russia poses.  I contend that they still have not acted on the acknowledgement of that threat.  If anybody is dragging their heels on the European Union's response that is needed, it is probably the Germans and French.</p><p>The reality should be borne home by the other member states that we can no longer tolerate what is happening and that the decisions we know need to be made must be made now.</p></speech>

Ireland will be friends forever to Romania and Moldova.  We can rely on Ireland to work together for our countries and for Europe, which is what this is all about.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned some large countries in Europe.  Countries like Romania, Ireland and others that may not be as influential can work together, push the agenda and change the course of history.  My role is to engage with Ireland and build a partnership, which is why I mentioned in my opening remarks that there would be a dialogue between the directorates-general and that our Secretary of State would be coming to Ireland.  I hope that the committee will be available on 18 May to celebrate and see where we are and what we can do for our countries and Europe.  More is coming.  Ireland is realising that it has partners.  Europe is our home.  It was mentioned that refugees were coming to Ireland via Moldova and Romania.  Europe provided us all with a home.  We may be located in one room at one level and others may be located in another, but we cross one another more and more in the kitchen, in the hallways and in the garden.  We need to do more for our neighbours and inhabitants.</p> <p>  I appreciate members' visit to our countries.</p></speech>

I will continue in line with my ambassadorial colleague's comments on our deep willingness.  I have worked a great deal on enhancing parliamentary connections.  Ireland has such a strong democracy.  I have witnessed it and its parliamentary activities for three years.  That is why I would love our Members of Parliament to take some of the good experiences from Ireland.  I finally managed to have a friendship group from the Irish side.  We have always had one on the Moldovan side.  Some of this committee's members have already visited my country.  The group's list is open, so they can join and we will push together.  I am looking forward to our first meeting &ndash; it will probably be online &ndash; and Irish parliamentarians will continue the discussion that they started in Moldova.  In this way, we will come closer together as nations and parliaments.  As I have often said in interviews, despite the fact that Moldova is not a rich country, we have found a window of opportunity to have an embassy in Ireland because it is our intention to come closer to this nation.  Our diaspora was brave.  It came to Ireland first and we came after it.  Now, we have that bridge.  I am looking forward to working closely with the committee in advancing our bilateral agenda.</p></speech>

Like everyone else, I have been following the invasion and looking at it geographically.  Palanca, which my colleagues visited, is close to the sea and not far from the southern tip of Transnistria.  In the context of Transnistria, what are Mrs. Miculet's concerns if the invasion continues?  Transnistria goes three quarters of the way up the border between Moldova and Ukraine.  If a corridor connects southern Transnistria to Odessa, Russia can move both east and west.  Will Mrs. Miculet speak about defending in the case of such an eventuality?  It would be easy for Russia to move east or west from Transnistria if it becomes connected to Russia.</p></speech>

These incidents in Transnistria did not start just a few days ago.  Rather, they started a little earlier.  We have had false bomb announcements and alarms.  We are following the situation closely and with constant vigilance.  When more pronounced incidents like explosions happen, the first to step in was the OSCE, which called on us not to do anything that would undermine trust.  I am pleased to say that, probably in a few days' time, a mission formed by OSCE structures will visit Moldova and, within its competence, evaluate the situation.  The EU is following that and I have heard that the US Department of State is also following it.  Everyone is following it.  The Russian Federation made a statement speaking about respecting our independence and sovereignty.  We are doing what the state is supposed to do.</p> <p>  We are a neutral country and our defensive power is within those limits.  That is why we are trying to stabilise the current situation and call for calm among people in Moldova and Transnistria despite the incidents.  We are assessing the situation in general.  We are assessing all statements concerning the corridor the Deputy mentioned.  The state authorities, including the Supreme Security Council, are probably considering all scenarios, but those considerations are not public at this moment, so I will not elaborate on them.  I can only say that the situation as it stands is complex.  That is why we need support of any type, including this public meeting of a European committee, to support our independence and neutrality and call for a calm situation in Moldova, including in Transnistria, because Europe needs a stable country there.</p></speech>

There was a public message from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to calm down and not to react or start putting the blame on different people.  There was a debate and I think the Moldovan President was accused of putting the blame wrongfully.  If would be very difficult if something starts.  It was mentioned that people from Odessa may flow into Moldova and that would overwhelm the country.</p> <p>  I would not comment on Russian plans, of course.  It is very difficult to think Russia will stop or that it would be satisfied with what it has so far.  It looks like the Russian agenda is to build this corridor.  We have been seriously concerned about this and also in terms of the refugees that Moldova will be the first affected, so we have to be prepared for that as well.</p></speech>

No doubt, given his involvement in the conversations around the future of Europe with Deputy Richmond, he knows that while we have been discussing the fallout of this absolute nightmare, at the same time, we are talking about the future of Europe.  Therefore, there is no pressure on Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; in terms of presenting on the future.</p></speech>

I thank the two ambassadors for coming before us and for their previous contributions.  We can see from the report that a significant amount of due diligence was done by the group that travelled.  It was a very useful piece of work and this is a follow-up on it.  In regard to where the conversation started, it started during the pandemic with regard to the Conference on the Future of Europe and, obviously, we have had not only a humanitarian disaster but it has been an absolute game-changer.  The one good thing to come out of a terrible situation is the fact that the world, including Europe, seems a lot closer and we all see the necessity of being able to co-operate with each other from the point of view of getting to a better place.  We have to co-operate on the basis of the humanitarian nightmare that these two countries are dealing with.  Like other speakers, I commend them on the work they have done and for what is, in real terms, the heavy lifting.</p> <p>  On some level, there is no need for a huge number of questions because the ambassadors have stated what their countries need.  In fairness, Dr. tefan said the focus needs to be on Moldova and that there is a need for resources.  A number people have stated explicitly that the money that is being offered up, particularly here, does not cut the mustard in any way, shape or form and is not good enough.  Mrs. Miculet also went into some detail in regard to the forward planning that Moldova needs to consider.</p> <p>  We had a fair bit of conversation on the worries about what Russia will do, and I get that none of us can necessarily game-play that.  I have no doubt there is a huge amount of preparation being made in that regard.  One of the points I want to raise relates to an issue raised by Deputy Duffy.  Given the worries the two ambassadors are talking about, there have been not only the false flag operations and whatever that might mean with regard to Transnistria, but there is also the attack on the bridge close to Palanca and it was said that that route is cut through.  From where the two ambassadors see it, there is going to be an influx of refugees from Odessa which would be very difficult to deal with in regard to how they will travel and so on.  What needs to be done?  We are hoping we do not have to deal with the nightmare situation but this war has shown we are dealing with one nightmare after another and it makes absolute sense that preparations are made.</p> <p>  As regards the asks, we need to do our best.  The two ambassadors have been very straightforward in regard to the meetings that are required and specifically in regard to the money.  It would be absolutely wrong if we and the State did not follow up on that.  It would be an abject failure from Ireland and the rest of the European Union if we did not do all of those pieces that are necessary.</p> <p>  I get where Senator Doherty is going in regard to the fact there needs to be a ramping up of sanctions to ensure we put the maximum pressure on Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s regime at this point in time.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right.  All of our state authorities try to work not only on what happens today, but to look ahead and to consider all possible or impossible scenarios because we are realistic in approaching the situation.  With regard to our future needs, I was looking at that bridge yesterday on the map and saw that it was also a way to go from that part of Ukraine to Romania and to other parts.  If that is cut, they can come only through this narrow Palanca area because on the other side, as the Deputy said, is Transnistria.  It is very narrow.</p> <p>  I spoke yesterday with the leadership of my ministry, who have a big role in these activities, and they told me that further relocation is one of our priorities and concerns.  We have to take into consideration that more refugees may suddenly, at one moment, come to our country.  That is why we must consider relocation.</p> <p>  There are two tracks with regard to developing assistance in Moldova.  As I said, one is the immediate need in regard to refugee flow and another is the support platform for Moldova.  One is helping Moldova just to survive itself because we still have that impact of the Covid pandemic, followed by the energy crisis, when we were not cut off but our prices were raised to $1,000.  On energy resilience, we need help and support.  As I said, we are also looking for new markets.  All of this is just for the country itself to survive.</p><p>This country is taking care of citizens on one hand and dealing with refugees on the other.  Both these pillars are very important to us.</p><p> There is probably an appropriate place in this second pillar of energy resilience and helping to build stronger capacity for our state agencies.  The issue will probably be discussed in more depth in the Moldova support platform of which Ireland is a part.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and other agencies that are participating in the platform can probably provide the committee with more concrete information on what was requested through that mechanism.  It is not only dealt with bilaterally but via the platform, which we hope will work better in putting all needs together and seeing what our partners can do to work together and respond, strengthening our resilience as a state in general, keeping us stable and aiding us in dealing with the flow of refugees.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for keeping an interest even if they were not on the trip.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, the committee has a critical role in bringing these issues and stories to the public and officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments.  Especially after their trip, the members sense what is needed there and the lack of funds in countries that may be affected even more seriously.  Russia is unpredictable and we should expect the worst.  Let us prepare for the worst and let us see.</p> <p>  I know Ireland is militarily neutral but I appreciate that it is not neutral when it comes to values and our approach.  Romanians and Moldovans really appreciate the fact that from the very first moment, Ireland's position was clear and its engagement on the right side of history was clear-cut.  Now we have to find ways together in bilateral terms, which is our offering here today, and also at European level, to find out how to move the European Union project along together and how to advance it in countries like Moldova, Georgia and Ukraine, when the time is right, of course.  It is a thorny process.  We must also find out how to protect ourselves from dangers in the future.  It had me scared a little bit when Russia announced the exercises in the waters off this island three months ago.  Bad things may happen to all countries regardless of their position in Europe.  Let us work together to fend off these dangers in the future.</p></speech>

It is a matter of making sure that Moldova survives.  For the want of a better term we have had a perfect storm.  As regards Russia we talked about energy resilience but this is an energy crisis meeting a geopolitical crisis and climate change.  I am sorry to use the term South Ossetia in respect of Georgia.  My point is that we wonder why Russia cares about this little strip of land, but it is about the sphere of influence.  If we look at the history of hybrid attacks in Estonia or even certain other things that have happened throughout Europe, it is the realisation that it is not only a smaller world but also a more dangerous one.  We have all said previously that when we are looking at Mariupol we could be looking at pictures from the Second World War.  It could be Dresden.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p>  On accession, we could see at the Conference on the Future of Europe that some of the language was very protective.  Some of that might relate to the likes of Hungary and fear, with the European Union saying it needs protection, particularly in respect of the rule of law.  Some of the earlier language was almost to the effect that Europe needed to get its house in order and be unified before it would facilitate further accession.  People saw that this was dreadful language, and that whatever about the western Balkans, it was particularly dreadful in respect of Moldova and Ukraine, and even Georgia and other states that are looking for this at present.  I accept that the Copenhagen criteria are what they are and there probably needs to be a greater level of engagement.  However, not only the language but probably the politics of that is moving on.  We should obviously play a part in that regard.  It is going to be a long and difficult journey.  Moldova needs to be facilitated but first and foremost it needs to be able to survive.  It is absolutely necessary that we play whatever small part we can in furthering those arguments.  I commend Romania, Moldova and the other neighbour states that are doing a huge amount of heavy lifting.  We need to look at ourselves and where we are falling down.</p></speech>

I can follow up with my colleagues who are putting together a programme of action as is usual with aid works, and I may be able to give the Deputy more details.</p> <p>  On accession I agree that it is not an easy decision.  We are realistic.  However, there is a new environment in terms of security and in general in the world and especially in Europe.  Now we need new political approaches, definitely.  Decisions will probably be taken that will differ from what was the case before 24 February.  The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has such a crucial role in Ireland's voice as regards giving us candidate status.</p><p>I kindly ask the committee to consider it very carefully to help us to survive and to do our best in the future to become a fully fledged member of the EU.  We do not ask for shortcuts.  We just ask people to realise how critical the European perspective is for us.  It is a long process and we will go through it as required, without shortcuts.

There is some momentum building.  It is important that we all, the diplomatic corps and public representatives, push to try to make the most of this opportunity to tangibly push this issue further despite the strict criteria.</p> <p>  I thank both of our guests for their excellent presentations.  My experience of this committee is that its members are deeply committed.  The ambassadors appreciate that we understand.  There is some great knowledge and experience in this room and we have to do all we can to maximise and channel our energy and endeavours in the direction in which they want us to travel.</p></speech>

I thank him very much.  I reiterate that my country's approach is that Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia must be given the European perspective together.  If all those countries were to have the European perspective together, it would mobilise the entire region.</p></speech>

This was a very important meeting.  There will also be an important public element to it when we publish the report on our findings and what we have learned.  We are very grateful.  I thank both ambassadors for being with us today.  Our knowledge of Romania and Moldova has increased no end, including places such as Chiinu, Palanca, Iai and up as far as Siret.  This has given deeper meaning to the relationship between Moldova and Romania but also, within the European Union context, the importance of solidarity and the words that were used today.</p> <p>  I thank the members for their engagement this morning.  We will continue these discussions.  Follow-up is key.  One point that we picked up in various meetings with politicians in Moldova and Romania was that they were talking about the future.  Yes, there was an acknowledgement of the present difficulties and challenges but they were talking about the future.  There was a considerable degree of hope in those deliberations around rebuilding and working together more closely, irrespective of geographical distances.  One thing I learned at a personal level was that we have a lot more in common that we have differences.  We will continue to work with H.E. Mrs. Miculet on EU involvement and the different signals and suggestions from politicians around bridging the gaps, which are certainly not insurmountable.  We look forward to meeting the politicians when they come here, and with Mrs. Miculet and Mr. Zurabashvili.  We will keep a close eye on the Ukrainian application as well.  The suggestion to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the committee would be a good next step.</p></speech>

That is no problem.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile; there is no strength without unity.  We look forward to strengthening this partnership and we will work together more closely.  The men, women and children of Ukraine are very much in focus at the moment.  We are happy to do anything we can to learn.  We are grateful to the Romanian and Moldovan Governments for their suggestions about what we can do.  There is no magic formula here.  This is wartime.  We are dealing with a refugee crisis in developed countries which is not the norm.  Even NGOs are having to reposition in order to help.  We will remain vigilant and stay in touch.</p></speech>

The meeting will follow the usual format.  Mr. Fraser will give an opening statement and then members may ask questions on that opening statement and the subject matter of the meeting.  With regard to privilege, those attending from outside the Leinster House campus should note that their privilege is limited.  Those attending from within have full privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  I ask members to remember that when they are asking questions.  I now ask Mr. Fraser for his opening remarks.</p></speech>

My remarks will be along the lines of that letter.  We are talking about the secondment of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  I had a number of confidential conversations with the CMO about his future plans.  This was in the context of our working relationship during the pandemic.  I naturally have such confidential conversations with colleagues about their personal situations from time to time and, of course, I respect confidentiality in such circumstances.  Towards the end of February, the CMO indicated to me that he was thinking of stepping down from his current role and was considering a possible role in the university sector that could make a continuing contribution to improving public health capacity in Ireland.  He proposed a secondment from the Civil Service to an academic post in a university that would enable him to use his knowledge and experience to help strengthen public health leadership in Ireland and to deepen relationships between the university sector, State agencies and international organisations in the field of public health.  As is common practice in the university sector, he envisaged that some research funding would be made available to support this work.  I was supportive of this proposal as the Covid-19 pandemic clearly illustrated the need for strengthened public health capacity not just here in Ireland, but globally, and I believed that Dr. Holohan could make a significant contribution in that regard.  </p> <p>  I contacted the Secretary General of the Department of Health, who advised me that he was dealing with the matter.  I had no further involvement as the detailed arrangements were a matter for the Department of Health.  The Department of the Taoiseach had no other involvement nor did I discuss the proposal with anyone except the Chief Medical Officer and the Secretary General of the Department of Health until there were media reports about the matter towards the end of March.</p></speech>

As I am sure he is aware, it is very important for the functioning of this committee that senior civil servants such as himself make themselves available and accept our invitations to appear.  I thank him for appearing.  When did Mr. Fraser first become involved in discussions with the CMO about his future work plans?</p></speech>

It was a fairly general conversation and I do not really remember the content other than that he was thinking of moving on.  It was a fairly brief conversation.  In the event, matters did not progress because, of course, we were all focused on dealing with the pandemic, no one more so than the CMO himself.</p></speech>

In fairness, this accords with what Mr. Fraser has said but, in paragraph 20, Mr. Watt says that it was in February of 2022 that the CMO entered into detailed discussions with the third level sector.  He says this followed on from initial discussions he had with the CMO in August 2021 regarding his future work plans, these involving the Secretary General to the Government and himself as Secretary General of the Department of Health.

The following does not have to be interpreted as a criticism.  Looking at the details of this proposal, it seems this was a job or secondment being designed for one individual.  Does Mr. Fraser agree on that point?</p></speech>

Does Mr. Fraser think it might be better for the post of chair to be established and for other individuals to be able to apply for it as a result of a public advertisement?  If Dr. Holohan got it, nobody would question his credentials or suitability.</p></speech>

It would be an alternative approach and equally valid.  The starting point is that Dr. Holohan wanted to move from his present role but wanted to continue to contribute to public health in Ireland.  That was the background to this particular proposal.</p></speech>

When civil servants reach a position at the top of a Department, they traditionally stay there until retirement.  I know Mr. Fraser's circumstances and the question is not about him.  Is there a position in the country now where we must look to see what to do with very high-level and qualified civil servants if there are only seven-year terms, as there are now?  What posts would they fill afterwards or is there a public issue that must be considered?</p></speech>

We had a position where the default and almost exclusive outcome at the end of someone's term at a high level was to retire but people are now being appointed at a younger age or from outside the public service.  There are term limits and the position is now different.  It is a problem for the public service and the country because it is potentially a significant disincentive to people who want to join the public service.</p></speech>

What should we do as policymakers to ensure there is not such uncertainty about what happens to senior civil servants?  I know Mr. Fraser is going off and we wish him well in his role in London.  I know the case of Dr. Holohan, the CMO, is slightly different but it is an issue that will continue to arise.  Do we need some form of a public policy response to this?</p></speech>

There is a policy and everybody has terms of appointment that govern what happens when the term is up.  It is somewhat imprecise at the level of individuals and what they must do.  Dr. Holohan was doing this and people have to try to find something else to do.  We do not want people in a post forever and that is not good.  Neither do we want to put people in a position where they are disincentivised from serving in senior roles because they cannot plan their career.</p></speech>

As the Chairman and the previous speaker has said, it is really important that the work of these committees is not impeded or frustrated.  It is disappointing that for the first time in as long as I am member of this committee, at well over a decade, we have had to seek compellability because another Secretary General is refusing to attend this committee at this point.  Mr. Fraser is before us, however, and I welcome his comments.</p> <p>  I will go back to a question that has been asked.  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan, Mr. Fraser stated his recollection was that he, the CMO and the Secretary General at the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, did not have a meeting.</p><p>In what form was your conversation with Dr. Holohan at the end of the summer?

I can check my diary but I do not recall the three of us sitting down together.  It could have happened and I will check my diary if it becomes a major point.  I am pretty sure that I had a conversation just between myself and the CMO.  It does not feel like a meeting.  It just sounds like three people is one too many for a conversation like that but I could be wrong.  If you want, I will check my diary but my recollection is that I just met the CMO privately.

Would there potentially have been a second meeting, a three-way meeting or would there only have been the initial meeting you had with the CMO?</p></speech>

I am looking at the paragraph and by the way, I apologise in advance if it turns out that I did have a meeting and I just do not remember it.  I am pretty sure I met the CMO and I am quite sure I would have spoken to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, either on the phone or otherwise.  I see him quite a lot.  I just do not think there was a three-cornered meeting.  A three-cornered meeting sounds like a far more formal thing than what I recall.  I think I had a private conversation with the CMO but as I say, I apologise if it turns out that there was a meeting that slipped my mind; so be it.  I do not think that sentence says there was a meeting.  It uses "involved" as the verb and I think involved probably means telephone conversations.</p></speech>

If you are suggesting that what is referred to in Mr. Robert Watt's statement was not a three-way meeting but may have been a telephone conversation that you had with him afterwards, at that time, then that is not referred to in your opening statement and neither is it referred to in Mr. Watt's submission to the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

The understanding was that this would involve a public policy development role outside of the Department of Health.".

What Mr. Fraser says, to paraphrase his opening statement, is that he had confidential conversations with the Chief Medical Officer at an early stage last year.  Towards the end of February it was indicated he was thinking of moving on, and in March Mr. Fraser contacted the Secretary General.  Now we learn he contacted the Secretary General as far back as August of the year before work in relation to the Chief Medical Officer moving on.</p></speech>

I would point out the sentence the Deputy is quoting back to me states that he indicated he was stepping down from his current role and was considering a possible role in the university sector.  This is more specific and it happened in February.  This is what I was speaking about when I rang the Secretary General.</p></speech>

He told Mr. Fraser this will envisage research funding.</p></speech>

In March he asked the Secretary General to ensure he was facilitating such arrangements.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is, of course, the line manager of the Chief Medical Officer.  He is the head of the Department for administrative purposes.  Quite appropriately, I rang the person whose responsibility these matters were.  He told me he was dealing with it.  I did not ask him to do this or to look after it.  Other representatives, not the Deputy, have said this.  That is not what happened.  I rang the person who is responsible for these matters and he told me he was dealing with it.</p></speech>

To go back to the question, in August, February and March, and it became known at the end of March, Mr. Fraser did not mention a dicky bird to the Taoiseach that the Chief Medical Officer was thinking about moving on.  Is that right?  I do not know how many telephone conversations Mr. Fraser has with the Taoiseach, or how many WhatsApp and text messages, or meetings and informal meetings.  Not one word was mentioned to the Taoiseach during this period.</p></speech>

I cannot swear blind that I did not - but I do not think I did so - indicate at some point to the Taoiseach that he was thinking of moving on.  I could not swear blind about this from August onwards.  I am not saying I did.  In terms of conversations with the Taoiseach, I had very few conversations with him in March, far fewer than normal because the Taoiseach, for a variety of reasons, was away on official business for much of the period the Deputy is speaking about.  So no, I did not discuss it with the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

This is Circular 27/2021, which indicates the new secondment policy for services being implemented.  The first key principle is that all secondments will be temporary in nature and in general will be for a period of six months up to a maximum of five years.  As Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach, how can a secondment be open-ended given this circular that was issued and which is legally binding?</p></speech>

Those questions are as follows.  Who makes the decisions within the State?  For whom are the decisions made in the State?  There is a strong feeling among the general public that there is an inversion of the democratic authority in this State.  There is concern that the decisions are being made by unelected people without the necessary democratic oversight by the elected individuals in the State.  The second element of that question is that there is also a group of people close to Government, who may be insiders and who may have a different experience of how they are treated by comparison with the general public.  For most members of the general public who want to go for a job such as this, they need to take part in an open competition.  I do not know any member of the public who would be able to sit down and have a job designed for them personally, with a budget of this amount paid by the State.  That experience is not shared by the vast majority of people in the country.</p> <p>  There are two big questions here.  This is not the first time we have seen this in the context of the Government.  It is the latest in a long list of similar occurrences.  The Zappone affair was another example of it in recent times.  There is so much power vested in those who are unelected that many people feel what is happening makes "Yes, Prime Minister" looks like a documentary.  It is absolutely outrageous that any civil servant would refuse to appear before the committee to answer questions on their actions.  These are the elected representatives of the people who are tasked to hold the State to account.  There is no accountability when we cannot ask questions and have them responded to.</p> <p>  In Mr. Fraser's view, is this particular role unique?  Can he give another example of a similar role?</p></speech>

I actually discussed it with him to make sure Taoiseach knew before there was any public announcement.  In the event, the Taoiseach probably did know, but not the details, no more than I did.  There is no formal process and in the particular circumstances I did not see the Taoiseach for quite a while during March; that was nobody's fault.</p></speech>

I am trying to explore the whole area of the secondments and will rely on his experience as a Secretary General since 2011.  I will start off where Deputies Doherty and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n finished with regard to Circular 27/2021.  It would be great if that was made available to the full committee in order that we can have a deep understanding of exactly what is in Circular 27/2021.  When Deputy Doherty asked, Mr. Fraser said it was not a legal document or one did not have to legally comply with it.  Then he said one should comply with secondments.  It outlines what a secondment should be.  Is there any oversight?  Does anybody scrutinise whether a secondment post complies with the relative circular before that secondment takes place?</p></speech>

First, it is the responsibility of the senior management of the Department to abide by the rules around secondment.  As I said to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, secondments are not bad and trying to share experience and develop people and organisations is good.  Ultimately, sometimes one needs sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All organisations are audited as well.  These things are looked at in a number of ways.  The essence of a secondment is that a person moves organisation on the same terms.  While it is good for the person concerned, it also means there is a sense he or she can come back to where he or she came from.  It is an opportunity to learn and develop rather than to leave the organisation.  That is the general reason for secondments.</p></speech>

In their broadest sense, secondments are used if people want to develop themselves or they want to gain a new experience.  That is a HR issue.  It is also used to bring skills into the organisation which is also a HR issue.  If the Senator means with regard to settling rows or something, I open to correction, but I do not think they have been used in that way.  It is lovely in here.

If one is talking about the Department of Health, the Secretary General there is responsible for all &euro;22 billion every year.  In that sense, he has to sign off on it all.</p><p> As to whether he has discretion to allocate money or develop policy, that is a separate question.  I think it is probably different in each Department.  I assume that is what is really being asked of me rather than what one signs off on.  Obviously these things must be consistent with Government policy, there has to be authority for them and so on.  That is what guides what the Secretary General can do.</p></speech>

As Deputy Doherty pointed out to me, it was a public policy development role that he was talking about.  There is a number of things that it could have been but it was not as precise as it became.

I accept the questions Deputies and Senators have asked me about how this decision was made and what it meant.  From my point of view, I think that there is a good case for more research funding for research into pandemics, preparedness, etc.  The case for that is, in a way, separate and I know that they have been conflated.  If a particular person had left after two years, I do not believe that we would not still be providing research funding.  At least I hope that we would still be providing because funding should be provided on the merits of the topic and not due to the fact that a particular individual holds a particular post.  I do not think that is right and I do not think that is what happens either.  We do some research in the Department of the Taoiseach and it is certainly not attached to any particular official's tenure, nor should it be.</p></speech>

In terms of the possible impact on public finances, we heard that this would cost &euro;20 million over the lifetime of the secondment.  We can only deal with what could have actually happened.  Perhaps that could have changed but we must deal with this matter now.  Such a large sum would have a significant impact on public finances.  Is Mr. Fraser aware of other initiatives taken by Secretaries Generals that would have had such a potential impact on public finances where the Minister would not have been fully across the detail?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, if one is the Accounting Officer for &euro;22 billion then I am quite sure one is involved in much bigger decisions than I am.  I have a budget of between &euro;35 million and &euro;40 million with most of it being non-discretionary.  I have a small amount of funding for research, which we allocate to the shared island initiative mainly.  The Government will know about that and the Taoiseach knows about that as it is a very important issue from his point of view.</p> <p>  The overall research spending in the State is, I think, &euro;950 million by Government.  I cannot say that every single euro goes across the desk of a Minister.  There should be proper processes for allocating the money and I am sure there is but it is &euro;950 million so quite a substantial sum of money is spent every year on research.</p></speech>

The board has not met since 2016 but I understand that it was never properly wound down.  The minutes of the last meeting in 2016 indicate that its work was in some ways only beginning and there was a lot of talk about the introduction of key performance indicators for Secretaries General.  I ask Mr. Fraser to comment on the disappearance of the Civil Service Accountability Board with no real comment and to confirm whether it has concluded its work.</p></speech>

The board has not sat for quite a while.  I do not know why and cannot explain that.  It is obviously not entirely up to me.  It is no longer, I think, in the Government's policy called Civil Service Renewal.  We try to work hard on performance management for Secretaries General.  We try to have strategy statements, indicators and processes around that.</p></speech>

We are spending very valuable time at the moment investigating where the CMO was going to go, the conditions on which he was going to leave, whether he was entitled to leave, and his salary.  The question arises as to whether or not the HSE, the Department of Health or whatever else was going to make a provision for his salary in a positive way.  Is that correct?  Would that be normal?

It was referred to him, or run past him, as they say nowadays, in the course of the events, apparently.  Well, he is well aware of the matter and agreed - or did not agree, as the case may be.  I presume he agreed.  In those circumstances, again, we are talking about a time when the health services in this country are on their knees.  There are waiting lists as long as your arm.  One of the things we tried to do in the month of January was to avail of the opportunity to rebuild the health service, and that needed a plan.  That needs the Secretary General of the Department and key people around him or her to deliver the quality and standard of service that is required.  Does Mr. Fraser agree on that?</p></speech>

It now falls to us to make a determination as to what we are going to do in the future.</p><p>Are we going to spend the next six months discussing this issue and asking questions about the whys and wherefores of what happened or are we going to do what needs to be done as a matter of urgency, to wit the provision of a comprehensive health service in this country, along the lines we have been speaking about for the past year at least, in the post-pandemic situation?  Was Mr. Fraser made aware of the fact there was a serious difficulty and a serious health issue that had to be dealt with in terms of the provision of health services throughout the country in the post-pandemic era?  What he aware of it?  Was he made aware of it?</p></speech>

I am not criticising Mr. Fraser or anybody else but I am saying this.  It is an item of futility if we are going to spend our time talking around the subject but never getting anywhere.  We are going very close to that at present.  We are going very close to it in the Department of Health.  For example, nobody responsible, with the exception of your good self, wants to come before the committee to talk about the issue.  This is despite the fact that everybody knows there is an urgent need to deal with health service issues now and that whatever can be done needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  The question remains.  Are we all on the same hymn sheet on this one?  Are we moving towards dealing with the issue or are we going to spend our time talking about the appointment or the failure to appoint or whatever the case might be?</p></speech>

I am a member of the committee the same as everybody else.  I have the same rights as everybody else and I am raising the question.  I am doing so because everybody else in the country is talking about the issue of the health service at present.  We have found at every meeting of the committee for the past 12 months individuals prepared to take steps to address the issues, do something about it and prove they could do something about various issues under their remit.  We are here today after a certain length of time, heading for 1 May, and we do not seem to have a plan.  Six months of the year have gone.  Again, I am not criticising Mr. Fraser for it but there needs to be somebody who can come before the committee and give the committee some satisfactory answers on what is going on.  Does Mr. Fraser not agree?</p></speech>

I am listening to the questions the Deputy is asking and I am listening to the answers from Mr. Fraser, who seems to indicate he has nothing further to add or that it is not for his Department and it is for the Department of Health.

If there is a role for Mr. Fraser before the committee in respect of this I cannot see it and I have not seen it.  I believe somebody else should be before the committee.

I appreciate that he is busy.  All Deputies appreciate that civil servants are busy and cannot be attending numerous committees every week.  Nor can they pick and choose which committees they appear before and I thank Mr. Fraser for coming before the committee.</p><p>I asked a parliamentary question over the vacation as to whether the proposed professorship of public health strategy and leadership at Trinity College Dublin would be proceeded with and whether the Minister for Health would make a statement on the matter.  Fortuitously I received the reply last night.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The establishment of a professorship within Trinity College Dublin is a matter for the University itself as an autonomous Higher Education institution that controls its own staffing requirements and academic affairs.  The Minister for Health has no role in deciding on these matters. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Fraser might not be surprised by that reply.  Was he surprised at the fact this role was being created and at this synergy, to say the least, between the Department of Health, the Chief Medical Officer and Trinity College in developing this unique position?  Mr. Fraser clarified to Deputy Doherty what he learned and when he learned it.  Was he surprised this new role was being created in the way it was and that essentially Exchequer funding was going to be expended on the professorship, albeit indirectly, by seconding Dr. Holohan?</p></speech>

He will recall that in October 2020 there was what was perceived by some people, and some in the media, as something of a stand-off between the Government and NPHET as to whether there would or would not be another lockdown.  The T&aacute;naiste made a much-commented-on appearance on the Claire Byrne show.  Suddenly, notwithstanding this stand-off, some would say the Government caved while others would say it just accepted the public health advice, and there was a lockdown.  In December 2020 and at the start of 2021, the Government differed from the advice of NPHET and many blamed it for the fact that people socialised and so forth, as people usually do at Christmas.  Was there a feeling in the Department of the Taoiseach, or did Mr. Fraser as the most senior civil servant there discern any concern, that there was a type of erosion of the authority of democratic government or that it was somehow being challenged by NPHET, whose role ordinarily would be to advise the Government but which instead was essentially telling the Government in public what to do?  Was there any concern about that or did Mr. Fraser discern any concern in the Department of the Taoiseach about that unusual inversion of authority in a democratic state?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the Claire Byrne show.  That, in itself, illustrated a certain amount of concern.  Of course, those were tense times, but everybody was doing their best for the country.  It was an unprecedented situation and, of course, there was frustration.  I am sure there was frustration on all sides and, most particularly, for the citizens of the country who were asked to do so much in such a difficult time.  The Deputy and I both know there were emotional ups and downs, if we are in the emotion business, over the entire period.</p></speech>

I believe we would agree that he played a very prominent role.

Many people felt a greater allegiance to what he had to say, and felt that his word was that which ought to be followed rather than that of the Government.  There was huge confusion about what was law and what was guidelines.  Of course, the T&aacute;naiste fell victim to it when he attended Ms Katherine Zappone's party across the road from where Mr. Fraser works.  All of that created a lot of confusion about the authority of the State and the authority of a democratic government.  Essentially, who was in charge was not clear.  Was there any relief that this potential problem had been averted?</p></speech>

I refer to what Mr. Fraser discussed at the beginning of the meeting.  Previously, when people left or retired from the public service they usually went into retirement, but now everything has become more fluid.  People come and go in the public service and their tenure is shorter.  Politicians have a cooling-off period, and even some political advisers have a cooling-off period, whereby they cannot work for a private entity immediately after carrying out a political function because there might be a perception of a conflict of interest.  Does Mr. Fraser think it would be advisable to develop something similar for civil servants?  Some would say they, too, have a more detailed knowledge of how the State apparatus in the Administration works, something that could be very desirable in the private sector and something which could create a conflict of interest.  I am not saying that people should be prevented from continuing their careers, but that there should be a similar cooling-off period for public servants to what is there for politicians.</p></speech>

I would have to check the details for the Deputy, but his point is well made.  I believe there are such arrangements in place.  However, I am not an expert and I would have to double check.  I am a member of the Outside Appointments Board, by the way, but it does not meet very frequently.  That is one of the reasons I am not clear.</p></speech>

Is the VHI in the private or public sector?  Arguably, it is State-owned.  I am not suggesting either of them has done anything wrong or breached any rules - far from it.  However, it surprised me that there was no cooling-off period involved in their move.  That is just my personal reaction.  It strikes me that it would be beneficial if there was.  That is just one minor example that happened to coincide with Dr. Holohan's.  There are many people who were key figures in the Covid-19 response leaving the HSE, and there appears to be many people leaving together.</p> <p>  However, to revert to my question, Mr. Fraser would agree with me that procedures around this would be advisable and potentially beneficial in the public interest. </p></speech>

Senior civil servants can be reassigned or they tend to retire.

There is a significance in what Mr. Watt points out here, that the Secretary to the Government was told certain things.  He comments on it in his report.  I want to go back again to the circular which was spoken about here.  The circular was issued on 23 December, 2021.  It is not an old document but is a recent circular that was sent out.  Would that have been sent to every Secretary General?</p></speech>

All secondments will be temporary in nature, all secondment advertisements will be sent to the Civil Service HR division and, in general, an advertised position should be circulated to all staff.  It is very clear on the steps that one has to take.</p> <p>  Let us move then to the letter of 16 March to Professor Linda Doyle, which is a public document so I presume I can refer to it.  That proposal or letter of intent sets out the agreement to the secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan and in the second paragraph Mr. Watt writes: "I recognise that agreement is conditional on the approval of any necessary authority within the University."  I am not asking you to comment on this, Mr. Fraser.  I am setting a scene here as to where all this started.  The authority mentioned here is only the university.  The superannuation arrangements and alignment with contractual terms and conditions relating to the position of CMO is addressed by the Department of Health, is what it says here.  However, the letter of intent goes on to state clearly, under the proposed agreement, what the Department of Health commits to.  It actually commits to the secondment and to continuing to pay the salary at its existing level.  It refers to "salary terms and conditions equivalent to the position" on the date of signing of the agreement and also commits to "improvements, awards or regrading that may apply to the position of Chief Medical Officer over the course of the secondment".  It commits to making an "annual, ring-fenced allocation of &euro;2M for the duration of the secondment, to be administered through the Health Research Board, a body under the aegis of the Department of Health...".  It goes on to talk about funds to provide for Dr. Holohan's salary "until his retirement".  It asks that Trinity College would provide an office on the campus and that it would provide administrative support for the position.  That is what was stated on 16 March 2022.  All of that is what has brought us to this juncture and this examination.  Let us be clear about this.  It was advanced to a stage where the final document was to be signed at the end of March.  The letter refers to the appointment of an officer in the Department of Health to work on details "such that a final agreement is signed prior to 31 March 2022".  All of this was advanced, apparently, without any sanction from anyone except the Secretary General and it flies in the face of Circular 27/2021.</p><p>That is the backdrop to this.  Questions have been asked about the remit of committees.  It has been suggested Circular 27/2021 does not define the involvement and role of this committee clearly; it does.  I am saying that because I am moving now to the recent happenings.  In the public arena we have been fed a diet of smoke and mirrors, obfuscation, spin and a determined effort by Government to cloud the issues here.  The issues are clear.  They were set out on 16 March.  They are set out in the document dated 21 December.  It is quite clear that there is an issue here that should be dealt with by this committee.<br/><br/>On 12 April 2022, the Secretaries General were asked for information.  They were told about the invitation.  On 13 April 2022, Ministers were informed.  They were advised that they might need to appear depending on what might be said by the three Secretaries General, Mr. Fraser being one of them and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform being another.  There is an apology there; the Secretary General is not available which is fine.  Then there is Mr. Watt.  They were the three.  We then asked for information just to inform the committee to put us into a position where we clearly understood what was going on, our role within what was going on and our oversight role as a committee.  To say that some showed utter contempt for what was going on is an understatement.  Deadlines were not met.  Information was not given.  Requests for further information were not acknowledged.  Telephone calls from the secretariat here were not returned.  I think that shows an awful example to those at a junior level within the Civil Service where they should be seeing exemplary conduct from Secretaries General.<br/><br/>I now turn to the political situation and comments that were made before I get back to Mr. Watt's letter of last night at 8 o'clock.  It is regrettable that the Taoiseach used the words he did because this committee - I am sure it is the same for every other committee of the House - is about its business.  It is about accountability and transparency, and bringing before the committee various witnesses depending on the subject matter and doing it in a constructive, courteous fashion, getting to the truth of the matter.  It would seem that there is no appetite in Government to get to the truth of this matter.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach has suggested that we should wait until the independent report is completed following due process at which point we can get the report and discuss it.  That stands in stark contrast to the treatment of a Minister who asked for due process but was sacked.  If that does not show double standards, I do not know what does.  Therefore, the committee has a remit.  It must answer the questions from the public in the context of the belief that there is a senior cabal of politicians and civil servants who are ignoring the due process, ignoring the Oireachtas committees and just doing as they please.<br/><br/>Last night's letter from Mr. Watt to the committee as usual provides a lot of packing.  There is a lot of stuff in there, some of it irrelevant.  He states: &quot;I have answered questions on these matters at the Health Committee and I do not believe it is reasonable for me to be asked to attend a different sectoral Committee to answer questions on the same issue.&quot;  He is not being asked to answer questions on the same issues.  He is being asked to address the issues that are of public interest and of concern to the people of Ireland.  He is being asked by a parliamentary committee, taking its task responsibly.  He has been asked to appear before it to clarify matters.  The circular letter puts him right in the frame to be asked to attend this meeting.  <br/><br/>That answers that part of his letter.  This is not personal.  I just need to do my job as Chairman.  It has been made seriously difficult by the attitude of Ministers, the Taoiseach and senior civil servants.  He states:</p><blockquote>	I understand that it has been practice for some time now that one committee should look at each particular issue under its terms of reference rather than duplicate examinations of issues.  I'm sure you would agree this is neither in the public interest, nor is it efficient use of members' or public servants' time. </blockquote><p>I put it to Mr. Fraser that he has eaten up an enormous amount of this committee's time and indeed the time of the clerk and the people who serve this committee by not answering letters, by not giving information and by having everyone here chasing after the information not being responded to and the numerous telephone calls that are not returned.  There is no dispute between the health committee and the finance committee.  There is a clear line of responsibility for both committees.  I would suggest, as I said earlier, all of it is contained not only in that circular, but in the title of the committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  If ever we needed to look at public expenditure in this case, and reform, by God we need to do it now.<br/><br/>A politician cannot go anywhere publicly without someone pointing out the disgraceful behaviour of some politicians and some civil servants.  I wonder if this attitude gave rise to the decision by those in the HSE, whom the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, wanted to meet, not to meet her.<br/><br/>Mr. Watt's letter continued:</p><blockquote>	I hope that we can carry out our respective duties in a respectful and courteous manner&hellip; issues that arise in a professional, factual, and policy focused manner, without unnecessary and distracting personal commentary. </blockquote><p>None of this is distracting commentary.  None of this is personal.  None of this is outside the realms of being courteous to everyone.  I find it a shocking state of affairs that this committee has to sit like this and work its way through nonsense and through all the misinformation and spin in order to try to get to the truth.<br/><br/>I go back then to the report from Mr. Watt to the Taoiseach.  I hope the Taoiseach and his officials will ponder on what has been said at this committee.  Point No. 20 in his submission states:</p><blockquote>	This involved the Secretary to the Government and myself as Secretary General of the Department of Health.  [That implicates Mr. Fraser.] ...  the CMO has an outstanding record of public service on behalf of the Irish State.  Both the Secretary to the Government and I indicated our strong support to facilitate and help where possible. </blockquote><p>Again, he refers to Mr. Fraser as Secretary to the Government.  The report also states:</p><blockquote>	In early March, the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed open ended secondment arrangements... </blockquote><p>The circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which I refer to again, has other things to say about that.  He then commits the research board: &quot;...with details to be agreed between all three parties.  It was never envisaged that this salary would be paid directly on the Vote of the Department of Health.&quot;<br/><br/>Yet it would be seen to be paid from an agency under the remit of the Department of Health.<br/><br/>Point No. 43 refers to &quot;the Public Service Management Act 1997, which stipulates that the administration of Government Departments is a matter for Secretaries General&quot;, and I do not dispute that.  He is not a lone ranger, however.  He is a manager within a system that is accountable to the people through Oireachtas committees, and he should be accountable to the Government, if it is interested at all, particularly given the sums of money involved.<br/><br/>In point No. 44, Mr. Watt indicates:</p><blockquote>	It also has been suggested that the Taoiseach and other members of the Government were &quot;kept in the dark&quot;.  The Secretary to the Government was aware of the proposed secondment move (but not of course the precise details) and I understood that the fact of discussions regarding the CMO's future plans were known in the Department of An Taoiseach.  I assumed that key decision-makers were aware of the proposal but of course not the precise details. [...]  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and asked me to confirm that I was working on the details.  I confirmed &quot;yes&quot;.  I inferred from this that this had political support in Government Buildings. </blockquote><p>Everyone seems to be running a mile from that one.<br/><br/>In point No. 56, Mr. Watt states:</p><blockquote>	...it is disappointing that some commentary alleges erroneously that I failed to keep the Minister appropriately informed.  The Minister was informed of the proposal for Dr. Holohan to take up a professorship at TCD in advance of the announcement and was supportive. </blockquote><p>I wonder if the advance announcement the night before was his way of informing the Minister, as he did with us last night at 8 p.m., sending us the email that he sent.<br/><br/>This brings me to the final point.  After all that, the committee was available to Mr. Watt and others such as the Minister to come before it.  It is a two-way street here and people get the chance to clarify their positions.  They get a chance to put the facts before the general public because it is a public meeting.  We all get the chance to learn from mistakes because nobody gets it right all the time.<br/><br/>We are now faced with the investigation to bring what the terms of reference refer to as &quot;learnings&quot; from this.  It has been a debacle from start to finish and it has cast a shadow on Dr. Tony Holohan, for whom I have the greatest respect.  Even the commentary over the past few days in the D&aacute;il has been nothing short of an attempt to cloud the matter, as I said earlier.  I find it truly shocking that senior politicians and civil servants do not see beyond the position they are currently holding and cannot understand that the public is furious about what is going on.  It is not so much about Dr. Holohan but the carry-on of Ministers, comments of senior civil servants and particularly the misleading commentary put to the D&aacute;il by the Taoiseach when he speaks about a &quot;witch hunt&quot; in three committees taking this up and his referring to what should or should not happen.  I made the point that this committee certainly has a remit to be involved.  I ask for Mr. Watt to reconsider his position on attending before this committee.  I ask the Taoiseach and the two Ministers to consider their position on attending before this committee and giving clarity not to me but to this forum as a committee of Parliament with representatives of the public.  I ask that this be done sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>If Mr. Fraser wishes to clarify any point, he should please do so now.  I acknowledge that this is not the first time he has come before this committee when others would not, and I respect him for that.  It is a pity others do not take his example and attend committee meetings when they are asked to do so.</p></speech>

So Mr. Fraser is off on his ambassadorial role now to the United Kingdom.  I wish him well in that.  I hoped the Civil Service could have been left behind well reformed and with its members attuned to attending committee meetings but maybe we have a little more work to do on that.  As I mentioned, I recognise Mr. Fraser's input to this meeting.  I will leave it at that unless any other member wishes to come in.  If they do not, we will leave it.  It is unfinished work and as Bertie said, there is a lot done, more to do.  There is certainly much transparency and accountability required.

From the National Women's Council, I welcome Ms Orla O'Connor, director, and Ms Alana Ryan, women's health co-ordinator; and from the Irish Family Planning Association, Ms Maeve Taylor, director of advocacy and communications, Ms Alison Spillane, senior policy and research officer, and Dr. Caitriona Henchion, medical director.  They are all very welcome to our meeting this morning.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I call on Ms O'Connor to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity.  As the committee knows, the National Women's Council is the leading national women's membership organisation, with more than 190 members.  We also convene and chair the Abortion Working Group, a collective of more than 20 civil society organisations and healthcare providers, which was established in 2019.  We collectively submitted to the abortion review as we believe that significant legal changes and practice improvements are required if the health Act is to guarantee equitable, accessible and legal abortion for all women and pregnant people who need it.</p> <p>  We want to take this opportunity to recognise and acknowledge the significant positive change the introduction of abortion in Ireland has brought to women's reproductive rights and to women's lives.  We are at a critical moment now where we can fully realise the overwhelming vote of the Irish public to enable access for all women who need abortions.  As time is limited, I will focus on three key challenges that we believe must be addressed.  The first is the restrictive legal framework.  The second is the national coverage, and the third relates to data collection.</p> <p>  In terms of the restrictive legal framework, instead of creating an enabling legal framework, the law acts as a gatekeeper creating a series of obstacles that prevent access to abortion, disproportionately affecting the most marginalised.  The World Health Organization's 2022 guidance recommends against laws that prohibit abortion based on gestational age limits and is clear that gestational age limits are not evidence-based.  Legal limits are contrary to the ideal model of patient-centred care whereby medical needs are met in line with clinical best practice and patient preferences.  Our strict 12-week window, which is actually just ten weeks from conception, is particularly challenging if you have irregular periods or need to undergo an ultrasound scan, and then in addition there is the mandatory three-day wait.  As with all rigid frameworks, it is women who are the most vulnerable who are impacted the most.  For example, adolescents, disabled women and pregnant people and women in situations of domestic violence who may not have freedom to leave the house.</p> <p>  In addition, the 28-day mortality clause for fatal foetal anomalies is also very problematic.  This clause means doctors are unable to provide abortion care in cases where the life expectancy for the foetus after birth is short, but may not be as short as 28 days.  This has caused significant challenges for doctors in determining eligibility, as well as huge heartbreak for women and families.  We are particularly concerned that the proportion of Irish residents travelling to the UK on these grounds has significantly increased, accounting for a third of all those who had to travel in 2020.  Analysis of the data suggests that the 28-day clause has created a two-tier system whereby for every three women deemed eligible for care here, two are forced to travel to the UK.  We must be clear that rigid gestational limits, mandatory waiting periods and narrow foetal mortality clauses, all serve to impede the ability of doctors to provide urgent care when required, while also placing additional stress on women and pregnant people during a challenging and stressful time.</p> <p>  Furthermore, under the terms of the Act, a doctor who provides abortion outside the specific circumstances laid out in the law may face a prison sentence of up to 14 years.</p><p>This means health professionals, under the threat of prosecution and criminalisation, are essentially forced to police themselves, determining when and whether the statutory criteria for access to care have been met.  That is why we are recommending that abortion be available on request up to viability to ensure that no woman or pregnant person is forced to travel abroad for essential reproductive healthcare.  We recommend the removal of the three-day wait period and the full decriminalisation of abortion care in line with the WHO guidance.</p><p> I will now turn to the national coverage.  At present, just one in ten general practitioners, GPs, are providing abortion services in Ireland and, concerningly, the pool of GPs registered with My Options who provide care to the general public is even fewer than this at just 7% of the overall GP population.  Data shared with the National Women's Council by the HSE in March 2022 show that half of counties have fewer than ten GPs offering the service currently; in some counties it could be as low as one GP per county as the data were provided in a zero to ten range rather than the total number.  Indeed, only four out of 26 counties have a well-developed community network of providers - Dublin, Cork, Galway and Wicklow.  Although abortion providers are very committed, limited coverage is therefore a significant barrier to access.  The reality of poor nationwide coverage coupled with the two-appointment requirement is a heightened burden on women and pregnant people, particularly the disabled community.</p><p> GPs have highlighted the threat of anti-abortion activities as one of the biggest impediments to new providers coming on board.  As such, it is difficult to disentangle the urgent need for safe access zones legislation from the issue of poor geographical coverage.  We are recommending that to address regional barriers to access, there must be focused efforts to improve community and hospital coverage.  Adequate early abortion care should be understood as a core part of our primary care services.  If it needs additional resources from the HSE, they should be provided as required.  Maternity hospitals must also be mandated to provide the service in line with the law.  Where necessary, new medical appointments should be fast-tracked to address any gaps in service provision and the necessary resources should be made available to address the infrastructure challenges.  Safe access zones legislation must be introduced to give healthcare staff assurance that in stepping up to provide this vital service they will be protected from harassment and intimidation.</p><p> Turning to the issue of data collection, we are concerned that the very low number of providers in community and hospital settings is reflective of silent refusal to provide abortion care, which is not being monitored or recorded appropriately and which is impacting on the effective operation of the Act.  Ensuring that conscience-based refusal of care does not hinder access to essential reproductive health services requires a clear, legal and policy framework and this must be urgently developed.  Medical providers should be obliged to record refusals of care on the grounds of conscience and detail the service to which they referred the woman or pregnant person.  We believe enhanced data collection is key for mitigating risks and barriers to service users.  As the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in Ireland stated, abortion is "a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks, or in some cases days, may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible.  The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person&rsquo;s life, health, and well-being.&rdquo;  We recommend expanding the current publicly available abortion data set to include wait times, recording of refusal of care and referral onwards.  Conscience-based refusals to provide care should be monitored by the Irish Medical Council to ensure compliance, and failures to adhere to guidelines regarding swift referrals should lead to sanctions.</p><p> The repeal campaign that led to the landslide "Yes" victory for removal of the eighth amendment from the Constitution was one of the most important social movements in our history for Irish women.  The message was clear - all women should be able to access healthcare at home with their doctors and make decisions regarding their care needs.  That is why we believe the review of the legislation is such a critical moment to deliver on the referendum and to deliver to women the reproductive rights they need.</p></speech>

The Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, is a specialist provider of early abortion care, contraception, specialist pregnancy counselling and other healthcare services.  We have advocated for sexual and reproductive health and rights since our foundation in 1969.  The last time we addressed an Oireachtas committee on abortion, it was to call for the introduction of abortion services.  To be here today to discuss the review of those services feels genuinely historic.<br/><br/>The review clause in the 2018 Act is a wise and prescient measure.  We have insights now from the provision of abortion care that were simply not available in 2018.  There are two key insights.  First, the Act has been transformative for reproductive rights in Ireland and abortion provision is now an established social good.  Second, significant challenges arise for the operation of services from the interaction of the legal framework, health system challenges and pervasive abortion stigma.<br/><br/>To start with the positives, the availability of services to terminate pregnancies and the public funding of those services unambiguously signal that abortion is essential healthcare.  The law provides for access to abortion on request.  Nobody who seeks early abortion care is required to explain or justify the decision about the pregnancy.  We know from our clinics and our pregnancy counselling service how important this is to service users.  The protection in law of these principles is a real strength of the Act.  Moreover, the model of care is working well for those who can access it.  The availability of abortion care within mainstream, local healthcare and without cost helps reduce the stress of unintended pregnancy and the stigma associated with abortion.  In principle, women can choose their provider.  They can opt for a specialist reproductive healthcare centre, such as the IFPA, attend their regular GP or find a GP through My Options.  The introduction of telemedicine has broadened women&rsquo;s access to essential, time-sensitive healthcare in very important ways.  Critical additional supports, including specialist pregnancy counselling and a 24-7 medical helpline, are also available without cost and are funded by the HSE.<br/><br/>However, there are problems.  The Act is modelled on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  This was a restrictive, criminal statute.  That framing gets in the way of access and choice.  Outside sections 9 to 12, inclusive, abortion is subject to prosecution and to harsh punishment on conviction.  Criminalisation of abortion relegates it to the margins of healthcare.  The European Court of Human Rights recognised this in the A, B and C<i>v</i>. Ireland case.  Criminal laws, even when they are not aggressively enforced, create a chilling effect on healthcare providers.  Section 23, the criminal provision, fosters stigma towards the conscientiously committed providers of abortion care and can discourage others from providing abortion.  Furthermore, while the right of healthcare practitioners to deny care on grounds of individual beliefs is recognised as conscientious objection, this implies, very erroneously, that only those who refuse care, but not those who provide it or access it, act with conscience.<br/><br/>The Act is far too restrictive.  The IFPA knows from our services that the vast majority of people who present for abortion care have thought through their personal circumstances, assessed the supports available to them and made a clear decision.  However, section 12 requires that they must first see a doctor and then wait three days.  Therefore, in fact, the gestation limit is eleven and a half weeks.  The waiting period implies distrust of women's capacity to make rational decisions in pregnancy.  It forces doctors to impose delay for no reason related to women's health, even when that delay pushes a woman past her gestation limit.  Most women and girls availing of abortion in Ireland do so well before 12 weeks of pregnancy.  However, crisis in pregnancy cannot be neatly confined to the first trimester.  The IFPA&rsquo;s experience is that the burdens of the 12-week limit disproportionately affect the young, the vulnerable, the marginalised and the disadvantaged.  After 12 weeks, access is narrowly restricted to grounds of health and fatal foetal anomaly.  This is exclusionary.  We know from our counselling services how traumatising this is for those who are excluded.<br/><br/>We also recommend that Ireland follow the recommendations of the WHO in its abortion care guideline, which calls for decriminalisation of abortion in all circumstances.  It recommends that instead of the imposition of mandatory waiting periods, grounds and gestational age limits in laws, access to abortion should be on request.  This would mean aligning service availability with the best interests of women and girls, rather than organising this part of the healthcare system around restrictive provisions.<br/><br/>We also have some other concerns, and I will not repeat some that have been mentioned by our colleague from the National Women's Council.</p><p>One issue we are concerned about is choice of method.  Abortion can be provided through either medical or non-invasive surgical methods.  However in Ireland most women are only offered one method which is home self-management of medical abortion.  This suits most women but not everyone has a suitable home environment and those who do not have a home that is suitable for self-management of care are not eligible for referral to hospital on those specific socioeconomic grounds.  The IFPA provides care to undocumented service users.  Currently, there is a lack of clear arrangements for reimbursement.  This is problematic.  The IFPA is absorbing those costs but this is not sustainable.  We are in discussions with the HSE about this and we hope this will be resolved.</p><p> These inequities in the operation of abortion services must be addressed.  Following the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 we believe the Oireachtas must address the flaws in the legislation and align the law with international best practice and human rights standards.  Moving into the future, the Oireachtas must identify health systems measures to institutionalise the current strength of the service and ensure excellence, leadership, innovation and sustainability into the future.  We should have a model of an excellent abortion care service in Ireland.  We believe the Oireachtas should continue to monitor the operation of abortion care in Ireland to ensure it is equitable, is of high quality and is available, accessible and acceptable to all who need it.  </p></speech>

I wish to deal with the issue in regard to section 11 of the Act dealing with fatal foetal anomalies.  The witnesses referred to the 28-day rule.  I have spoken to medical practitioners who have also raised concerns about this.  The witnesses&rsquo; view is that this section of the Act should be removed or the Act should be amended to take out this 28-day time limit.  It is obviously putting many restrictions on medical practitioners.  The witnesses referred to the issue in regard to the Act where a medical practitioner can be prosecuted for making a decision which does not comply with the legislation.  Do they believe the 28-day rule is a huge restriction in regard to decisions being made?  Is it only a small number?  No matter what number it is, even if it is only one a year, it is one too many.  Do they believe this restriction resulted in people being forced to travel?  Is there any evidence of people being forced to travel in regard to that?</p></speech>

This was certainly one of the issues that people believed would be solved by the referendum, and that people in that dreadful situation of fatal foetal anomaly would not be in a situation of having to travel and all the trauma that goes with that.  This really is a critical one, irrespective of the numbers.  I might ask Ms Ryan to go through the numbers given that this is affecting an important number of people.  I cannot stress enough how important this is for those families and couples in that situation and just how difficult that 28-day rule has made things for them.</p></speech>

Where the person has been refused a termination, there is a review panel.  I was contacted by one medical practitioner who advised me that they are not aware of the existence of the review panel even though it is provided for under section 11.  What is the witnesses' understanding about the review panel?  Is it in existence?  Who is it made up of?</p></speech>

While the right to appeal is there, and that avenue exists, it is not accessible and it means that when you are up against a very tight time limit, particularly if you know that you most likely have to seek care in England where there are also limits, you are most likely going to travel because you would be worried that if you delayed and continued down the route of trying to appeal a decision in Ireland, you might end up being ineligible here.  Then you would be in a terrible situation where you might have lost your ability to travel to access the care elsewhere and you would have been denied it at home.</p></speech>

As to whether the review panel is functional and meeting the needs of families, I cannot speak to that.  I have heard that the operation of section 11 is very restrictive because ultimately it is hard in these cases to say with certainty whether the foetus will survive for less than 28 days.</p></speech>

It appears that this review process is really not working in practice.  There is a requirement under section 18 for the HSE to report annually on the number of reviews sought and carried out under this mechanism.  In year one of the provision, 2019, no reviews were sought.  In year two, only two reviews were sought, one of which was successful and one of which was not.  It appears that this review process is not functioning.  I think that speaks to what the Deputy is hearing on the ground that practitioners are actually not aware of these structures and mechanisms.</p> <p>  If I could add one more point in terms of the operation of section 11, there is important research coming out of University College Cork by Professor Keelin O&rsquo;Donoghue and Dr. Stacey Power Walsh.  It would be useful for the committee to hear from foetal medicine specialists who are providing care under this section.  What they have done is they conducted qualitative research with foetal medicine specialists throughout the country about the operation of the Act.  These practitioners describe the Act as difficult and restrictive and the combination of the language and that definition in section 11 with the criminal provision means that practitioners fear getting a diagnosis wrong due to criminal liability and media scrutiny.  There is a great deal of fear around the operation of this section.</p></speech>

The Act provides for an annual report under section 18.  My understanding is that the report is being made available to the Minister by 30 June but I understand that report is not published.

It appears under documents laid in the Houses of the Oireachtas but it does not appear to be published anywhere on the HSE or the Department of Health websites.  If you spend a good deal of time looking for it, you can find it.  It is a very short report.  It reports that there was zero reviews in year one of the provision and two reviews in year two.</p></speech>

The waiting period is not related to women's health, yet doctors are forced to require women to wait for three days regardless of their circumstances.  Most women have made their decision, present to their doctors clearly about the decision they have made and have assessed their circumstances.  The WHO's guideline is clear that mandatory waiting periods demean women and are unrelated to health.</p><p> A wider point that we would make about the law is that, since it is based on a criminal statute, it has a tendency towards disapproval of abortion care.  There is an exception under sections 9 to 12, inclusive.  This weighs heavily on providers and is not something that is present in consultations with patients in other cases.  We believe that a significant improvement to the Act could be a set of overarching guiding principles that establish that access is based on human rights principles of reproductive health, centring the Act around access rather than it being built out from a criminal provision.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#D00400"><p>As Ms Taylor said, the three-day period does not provide any medical help.  There is a proper informed consent process in any procedure, and medical abortion would be considered such a procedure.  A doctor has to go through clearly with the person all of the adverse effects, risks, benefits and everything else involved.  The doctor also has to establish that the person is certain about going through with it.  In a proper consent process, anyone who is not certain or ready to proceed is immediately identified.  Obviously, the person will not go ahead at that time and may say that he or she needs a little more time.  This often happens with many procedures, yet we are not relying on the law to make them take that time.  Rather, we are relying on good clinical skills to identify these situations and communicate well enough to ensure that people understand that they have extra time.  In no consultation do we speak as much about the law as we do in abortion consultations.  We never bring it into any other consent process.  The only other time that the law might come into a consultation would be when dealing with minors, where a doctor might have to apprise them of his or her responsibilities in terms of reporting.</p> <p>  The thing about speaking about the law in abortion consultations is that one becomes used to doing it and almost forgets that it is not a medical part of the consultation.  A doctor has to advise people because they have to understand that there is a 12-week limit, which means that, if the procedure has not worked, they have to figure out what they are going to do quickly because, if they do not, they may find themselves beyond 12 weeks, still pregnant and having taken medication that could cause harmful effects to that pregnancy.  The law is an ever-present part of these consultations in a way that is not related to the medical practice side.</p></speech>

Has the IFPA come across evidence of this?  What needs to be changed?  The whole idea was that people would have the necessary level of care in Ireland as opposed to needing to travel abroad, but people are travelling abroad and there is no follow-up care or structure available here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#D00600"><p>The IFPA has a specialist pregnancy counselling service.  When we identify someone attending us who is going to fall outside the legislative conditions and will have to travel, we ensure that there is a catch-all so that we follow up with her from a mental health perspective as well as to offer a physical check-up afterwards.  In the HSE model of care, that follow-up medical care is reimbursable.  Many people might not be aware of this, so it needs to be more widely known.  We are careful to try to bring those people back and ensure that they get whatever follow-up care is required, but it might not happen widely.</p> <p>  As Ms Taylor mentioned, if people are in the small minority who find themselves having to travel, particularly if it is just because they narrowly missed a gestational limit or their foetal anomalies were not considered severe enough, they are more stigmatised than people who had to travel ever were, as they are in this group that is considered not worthy of care here.  They may be less likely to seek aftercare because they feel like they are in that very marginalised position.</p></speech>

I thank them for their work in this area.</p> <p>  It is clear from the import of both presentations that women are still travelling for abortion services.  Perhaps I will start with the IFPA, whose representatives said that this was a minority of women, but there are still women travelling.  Are there data on the number of women travelling abroad?</p></speech>

Every year, the Department of Health and Social Care in England and Wales publish an annual statistical report.  In 2019, it recorded 375 women who gave Irish addresses.  In 2020, 194 women and girls gave Irish addresses.  Almost 200 women travelled during a pandemic to access essential healthcare, enduring all of the financial, physical and emotional burdens of travelling for a health procedure.  We do not have the 2021 statistics yet, as they are published in June of each year.</p> <p>  In addition to what Dr. Henchion said about what these women endure in terms of stigma and ostracisation in the health system, a key issue is that this safety valve that Ireland has used for abortion care for decades is insecure because abortion services in England and Wales are under pressure.  Some of our clients, particularly those in specialist pregnancy counselling services who are travelling, are waiting weeks before they can get appointments at clinics in England and Wales.  We cannot rely on other countries to provide this healthcare.  It must be provided within the Irish health system.  We need to stop ostracising and stigmatising these women and families.</p></speech>

I will probably not get to ask all of my questions, given that there are many that I wish to ask, so I will focus on the opening statement of the National Women's Council and some of the data presented on poor national coverage, which were shocking in and of themselves.  Am I correct in saying that the data that Ms O'Connor presented were data that the National Women's Council received directly from the HSE?</p></speech>

That is shocking.  I thought it would have been much more than that.  Only 7% of GPs who provide care to the general public are registered with the My Options service.  That is even less than 10%.  Half of counties have fewer than ten GPs offering the service, but that is not the worst of it, given that there is a range.  As Ms O'Connor pointed out, the figure could be as low as one GP in some counties.  Before I ask about the reason for this, perhaps she could speak about its impact, particularly in rural areas but also in some urban areas.  If women have difficulty in accessing abortion services through GPs, what impact does that have on the women and their ability to go on to access full services?</p></speech>

For example, there are difficulties in rural areas in just being able to get to services physically because of public transport, the small number of providers, finding out who is providing abortion care and having to make those journeys at a stressful and challenging time.  There are also compounded issues for particular groups of women.</p><p>That is why the abortion working group has highlighted that all the things we and the IFPA are talking about today concerning barriers are made much more difficult, for example, for a disabled woman trying to access a service.  It is made much harder for different groups of women, such as women experiencing domestic violence.  These barriers to access make it much harder for those groups of people and we wish to highlight this aspect to the committee today.  As was pointed out, even the data we have, because they are in ranges of zero to ten - we do not have actual figures - means we are talking about people who must travel long distances to be able to access services and, as I said, find out where those services are.  That is not acceptable for what is not only a key and essential healthcare service, but also one that must be provided in a timely fashion because of its nature.</p></speech>

I support the recommendation that medical providers should be obliged to record refusals of care on the grounds of conscience and to detail the services they refer women and pregnant people to.  That is important.  As much data as it is possible to record  should be recorded, because that will inform us about this aspect.  It should not only inform this review itself, but ongoing reviews of service provision.</p> <p>  The NWCI's opening statement goes on to outline the importance of supports from local maternity hospitals for GPs.  This is an important point.  We also know that not all maternity hospitals are providing abortion services.  My understanding is that the Act itself allows for individual clinicians to conscientiously object but not for institutions to do so.  Would it be the NWCI's view that there is the possibility that some maternity hospitals are institutionally not providing the service, or is this coming down to individuals?  I ask that because I wonder how some maternity hospitals could not be providing any services.  I would like a comment on that aspect first.</p></speech>

In certain hospitals, the lead gynaecologist may be a conscience-based refuser.  There are also issues, however, regarding theatre space and practical measures which the hospitals are not equipped for now.  That has been uncovered by the WHO research report.  Therefore, a combination of factors is involved.  There are probably members of staff who are within their rights to object to providing the service, but then there are also practical and structural issues involving the scheduling of abortions, and particularly surgical abortions.  Hospital-based care is received after ten weeks, usually in the context of medical abortions, but further along, however, it will become a surgical abortion.  Equally, our stance is that service users should always have the preference regarding whether they would like a surgical abortion or a medical abortion.  In practice, however, the theatre space does not always exist.  That would-----</p></speech>

It may well be that capacity issues are at work here.  Where those exist, they must be addressed, and it is for the Minister for Health and the Department to do that.  What I am hearing from the NWCI's opening statement, though, is that only one in ten GPs is providing services, and not all maternity services.  We also do not have sufficient linkages between GPs and maternity services, if some maternity hospitals are not providing the service.  Therefore, that means there will be delayed access for some women.  This is the problem.  We must deal with the capacity issues, but if other factors are at work, whether institutional or otherwise, preventing any maternity hospital from providing these services, then that is not on.  The provision of these services is provided for under law.</p> <p>  Returning to the opening statement from the IFPA, much of what was dealt with in that, and I do not disagree with it, concerned the restrictive nature of the Act itself, its limitations and the consequent limitations it puts on women accessing services.  A review is under way and we had a lengthy discussion with the Minister for Health regarding its nature and extent.  There is a concern regarding how extensive the review will be and whether it will lead to recommendations for legislative changes.  We must wait and see.  Given the IFPA's opening statement, and what we heard in the opening statement of the NWCI, will it be a failure of the review process itself if it does not recommend legislative changes?</p></speech>

For example, and as was mentioned, the legislative framework is creating barriers regarding conscientious objection.  It privileges refusal as the only exercise of conscience and this can play into the wider &ldquo;abortion ecosystem&rdquo;, to use that phrase.  I refer to a situation where there is a separation between providers and non-providers and where the exercise of refusal is privileged.  Those-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#E00700"><p>Yes, and in our view, the two are inseparable.  We cannot simply separate out operational issues as if the legislative framework did not impact them.  The review was included in the Act to draw on the knowledge gained over three years and to look carefully at whether the Act is delivering for the women who need care.  One thing we have learned from the operation of the Act over three years is that those now excluded from care are excluded and stigmatised in particular ways.  Prior to legal abortion, all women who needed abortion care and who had to organise their own care were stigmatised and excluded.  Many were not aware of the supports available under law, such as specialised pregnancy counselling.</p> <p>  Now we have a situation where a small number of people are excluded from what is mainstream healthcare.  I refer to the harm being done to those people from being denied something available from GPs.  This is happening in the context where the law is specifying certain people cannot avail of the service because of the existence of a waiting period, even though the pregnancy concerned is less than 12 weeks.  It means people will just miss the cut-off limit because of the waiting period included in the legislation for no reason related to women&rsquo;s health.  Therefore, it would make absolutely no sense to consider the operational issues without looking at the impact of the law on them.  Dr. Henchion has been clear regarding a situation where, unlike any other healthcare procedure, the law is in the room and in the consultation.  We never talk about the law as much in other contexts.  Therefore, returning to the question of the review not addressing this aspect, it can certainly address things on the fringes but we must also look at the overall picture and the impact of the law in this regard.</p></speech>

I also thank them all for their work over the years.  It is a historic moment for them to be here with the committee not discussing whether women should be able to access healthcare, but how we can improve that healthcare for women in Ireland.  The review was much discussed during the campaign.  Those of us involved in the campaign always stressed the need to have our services based on Irish data and best practice for the Irish experience.  Therefore, it is right and proper that we are here discussing this aspect today and that we are having the review.  I have several questions, and the representatives of the IFPA would be best placed to answer the first.  What kinds of challenges do they see in practice with the 12-week limit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#E01100"><p>There are a few different challenges.  Without harping on this point too much, but to return to this issue again, the first concerns the three-day waiting period.  We have had women in this situation.  It tends to occur in the context of bank holidays and similar periods, when women present within the 12-week limit, but in situations where they are close to the end of those 12 weeks.  The need to refer them to hospital means that we cannot get them an appointment before their 12-weeks are up.  Even though they have presented to us within the terms of the legal framework, it is still difficult even within that time, plus the three days.  The three days themselves might just put these women over the limit.  This gives rise to situations where it is necessary to have a discussion with somebody to say that if I had been able to do what was required yesterday, it would have been fine, but it is not today.</p><p>That is a really difficult conversation to have with somebody for whom the consequences are going to be financial, social and very difficult.</p><p> The other thing where the 12 weeks really come into play, and I referred to this earlier, is with regard to the people who might have a failed termination.  The risk of failure with medical abortion is between 1% and 2%, depending on gestation.  That is a significant number of women, and we see it.  In the community, we would see people up to nine weeks plus six days, and from then onwards they need to go to hospital.  If we have seen somebody at nine weeks plus, and it is two or two and a half weeks before she can do a pregnancy test to check that it has been successful, she is pretty much at 12 weeks at that stage and if it has failed, she has to travel.  We have given her medication that is potentially teratogenic, which means it could cause harmful foetal anomalies.  We are now telling women they have to travel to continue this treatment.  We are not giving any flexibility to continue that treatment for that person where it has failed.</p><p> Those would be two biggest areas, the people who have narrowly missed it and the people who have had a failed termination.  Again, with regard to the people who narrowly miss it, we would have dealt with people who have had contraceptive failure, the failure of a contraceptive that would stop them having periods.  It is not that surprising that they did not realise they were pregnant on time, because the contraception they were using was causing them to have no periods.  It will take longer for those women to recognise they are pregnant.  There are also women who, due to physiological reasons or medical conditions such as polycystic ovaries, only have two, three or four periods per year.  It will take them longer to discover that they are pregnant than somebody who has a very regular cycle.  The 12 weeks can be very difficult for some people to recognise on time.  It is very difficult if people are just beyond it and it really comes into play, big time, when it comes to the risk of failed termination.</p></speech>

Across Europe, access-on-request provisions tend to be around the 12-week to 14-week mark.  The important thing there is that many of these laws are quite old.  Ireland was significantly behind the times in reforming its Constitution to allow for abortion access.  Many countries across Europe introduced abortion laws in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s when less was known about abortion care.  Certainly, at that point early medical abortion did not exist.  Laws generally tend to allow for a period of on-request or on broad socioeconomic grounds and then more restrictive grounds thereafter.  However, it is important to look at what is emerging from the World Health Organization.  Just last month, the WHO published its abortion care guideline.  It has assessed global evidence and clinical best practice with respect to abortion and it has come up with important recommendations about the way the law relating to abortion should function.  One is that abortion should always be decriminalised in all circumstances.  Another is that mandatory waiting periods and gestation limits function as barriers to access and they should not be included in law.</p> <p>  From our perspective, this review is an opportunity to think about the role of law in this area of healthcare.  As Dr. Henchion outlined, the fact the 2018 Act is a criminal statute means it sits in the consultation room between a patient and a doctor in a very negative way.  It hangs over consultations as a ticking clock.  Further along, when one looks at cases of foetal anomaly or risk to health, the potential criminalisation hangs over medical practitioners.  The law should function as an enabling tool, a tool that provides the framework that articulates the rights of people who are entitled to access care and the duties on the State to provide and organise services in a manner whereby they are accessible to all.</p></speech>

First, it depends on the environment in which one is working.  The IFPA has a number of doctors and nurses, we have our specialist counselling team and we are providing this care, so we have a network of supportive people set up.  We have colleagues to whom we can turn to discuss cases, we have colleagues with whom we can discuss anything that is difficult and we have our counselling team for women who are in a lot of distress or have additional needs.  That could be women suffering in domestic violence situations, women with disabilities or women with difficulties with travel.  For all those things we have a support network in place.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, it is almost unconscious that it is sitting there all the time and it is putting a great deal of pressure, particularly in cases where one feels that ticking clock.  There will be women who will say they cannot go into hospital, but one knows they will be past the time when we should see them by the time the three days go by, whereas if one could have seen them straight away that would not have been the issue.  It is there all the time.  In the community we are dealing with the 12-week situation.  That is very black and white.  We are not afraid so much of our judgment being questioned in the longer term because we have to operate within that 12 weeks.  It is much more something one needs to think about in terms of whether that is the reason there are only one in ten GPs opting in.  Is that why so many people do not want to provide services?  Why get oneself involved with something where one has to know the ins and outs of a very complex Act when one can just opt out?</p> <p>  Then one must look at the enabling environment that will allow GPs to do that, which is the proper geographical spread.  If one knows that the local hospital is not providing services, then every time one sees somebody who is over nine and a half weeks one will have to refer her to a distant location and one will have to go through that complex pathway with that person.  That is a deterrent to a GP.  The GP also knows that if the patient has a complication, she will be going into a hospital where this is not a provided service for her after-care if she has bleeding.  One does not know what type of treatment she is going to get, what type of bias she will come up against and what the level of knowledge to look after her is.  It is much more than just asking, "Am I afraid of being prosecuted?".  I am not, particularly.  It is the entire deterrent and the way it forces one to deal with people, for example, the amount of additional blood testing we will do for women who might be coming to 12 weeks after a possible failed termination.</p></speech>

In England and Wales, the limit is 24 weeks but when we look at the data on the time at which women access the service, the vast majority still access it at under 12 weeks.  It is 88% under ten weeks, 6% between ten and 12 weeks and only 2% in the later stage of over 20 weeks.  The idea that a longer gestational limit or removal of gestational limits will mean that service users will wait until the last minute to access care is not borne out by the evidence.</p></speech>

There are particular issues that are faced by GPs in smaller communities, GPs who live closer to their practices and small practices.  There is a range of issues where the criminal law might be more burdensome and where the reasons for non-provision would be different for them rather than for an organisation such as the IFPA.</p> <p>  There is a final point regarding the gestational limit.  Internationally, as Ms Spillane mentioned, in many countries there are specific socioeconomic grounds.  We do not think it is right that women should have to present socioeconomic grounds.  It is a very good thing that in current Irish law women do not have to justify their decisions.  However, there are issues that arise during the first trimester.  Women's lives and circumstances can change.  People lose jobs, relationships fail, family circumstances change, there are different caring responsibilities or opportunities arise.  There are many reasons a pregnancy can become a crisis during 12 weeks.  A woman is then over 12 weeks with a crisis pregnancy, and that crisis has been growing.</p><p>We know, for example, from evidence during Covid of situations of people living in violent relationships.  There are pressures on families, including the current pressures involving inflation and other economic issues.  There are lots of pressures that can come to bear during a pregnancy and then for women to find themselves excluded by a rigid gestation period is simply unfair.</p></speech>

We must try to incentivise GPs and take away barriers that might be stopping them from opting in.  There are other things we can do, including for example, creating a faculty of sexual health that would provide a peer support network for doctors who are providing services who may be geographically more isolated and who could be linked into a bigger group for support.  Another thing we could consider would require legislative change.  In the legislation at the moment, a medical practitioner is defined very distinctly as a doctor but there are lots of other parts of the health service in which specialist nurses or midwives are included in that category.  That would be an enabling part of the legislation, if that was to be done, which would help to broaden the base and protect services into the future.</p></speech>

The research that is being done by Dr. Catherine Conlon in TCD, commissioned by the HSE, which is about gathering those experiences, should form a key part of this review in terms of the changes that are necessary.  We know from talking to our members and to women that the changes we are bringing forward are rooted in their experience and going forward, that is exactly what needs to happen, as it does in other areas of women's health care.  Women's experiences need to lead the reform.</p></speech>

I thank them for their submissions and for their ongoing work over so many years.  In their submissions and comments here this morning, both groups make a really compelling case for the review to include recommendations on the legislation itself, as opposed to the operation of the Act.  We had this debate with the Minister some months ago but his tendency was to restrict it to just the issue of the operation of the Act.  As Ms O'Connor said, this is a really important moment.  We have the experience of the last couple of years and we have to go forward on the basis of identifying the issues that have been highlighted and the shortcomings in the legislation.  The review will not count for anything unless it includes very clear recommendations in relation to the Act itself and the legislative provisions therein.  The committee would be very much at one with the witnesses on that issue.  We have a job to do in making the case for legislative change and amendment.</p> <p>  I wish to take up the points Ms O'Connor made in her opening statement about geographical coverage nationally.  It seems that the figures have remained the same since the legislation became operational.  Is it the case that there is a view that just a number of GPs and maternity hospitals will provide the service and nothing can be done to change that situation?  Have the witnesses had any engagement with any of the GP organisations and the HSE on improving the situation?  Is work being done on identifying why so few doctors are participating and, from the HSE's point of view, why only just over half of the maternity hospitals are providing services?  It is completely unacceptable that there is such institutional resistance.  Has work been done or have the witnesses had engagement with any of those organisations?</p></speech>

That has been an absolutely vital component of bringing more GPs on board.  The WHO research also highlights that the HSE has been very good at being a direct contact for GPs for queries they may have and in providing assistance in a timely way.</p> <p>  The issue of coverage really comes down to some key points around the continued lack of safe access zones which we know is vital for giving GPs and hospital-based practitioners the assurance that if they stand up and deliver this care, they will be protected from harassment and abuse.  GPs have also flagged to us that the issue around the maternity hospitals not providing the service in line with the law has a knock-on impact on primary care provision.  We need to be thinking about fast-tracking appointments if there is a case of conscientious objection at the top, by the clinical lead, in a hospital so that a team can be in place to provide care and in doing so, give the signal to GPs in the local area that there is a referral pathway into a local maternity hospital.  Without having that joined up network between primary and hospital-based care, the picture will not improve dramatically.</p></speech>

Dr. Henchion spoke in very compelling detail about the impact of the time limits, both the 12-week gestational period and the three-day waiting time.  Does she have data showing the number of people who have had to travel as a result of both of those time limits?</p></speech>

The majority of women are presenting well before ten weeks so it would only be a small number of women for whom that would arise.  Out of proportion to that number, however, is the concern about it.  We go to a considerable amount of effort in following up women afterwards to make sure, if their test is positive.  In most cases if they did the test again in a week, it would be negative by then but we are afraid of losing that week.  We are bringing those women in and doing two blood tests on them to check that their pregnancy hormone levels are dropping.  We are actually putting them through anxiety and difficulty, as well as ourselves.  We are doing all of that without any extra fees.  We are doing all of those extra consultations and that is part of the effect of it.  There is extra anxiety for women and for providers.  In our experience, only a very small number of women have come to us thinking they would be eligible but have turned out to be just over the limit or for whom the three days has put them over the limit although it definitely has happened.  I have had those conversations with women but in a very, very small number of cases.</p></speech>

I think most of us would argue that the type of services to be provided should be explicitly set out in any agreement.  We know however that in recent weeks the HSE has come up with a form of words to describe the services that will be provided in the new national maternity hospital and that is they will be services that are clinically appropriate and legally permissible.  I would like to ask the witnesses what their understanding of what "clinically appropriate" would be.  It strikes me that if we are talking about providing services that are clinically appropriate in the new national maternity hospital, then it is a clinician who decides what is appropriate as opposed to the woman herself.  My reading of that is that it is contrary to the legislation.  I do not mean to put them on the spot, but I would like to ask their views on that, because there is a real concern that this thing is going to be wrapped up finally in the coming weeks.  I ask that they might pursue this issue with the Minister for Health because I think it is potentially very dangerous.  Have the witnesses any comment on providing services on the basis of what is decided is clinically appropriate as opposed to what should be available on request with the woman being the active agent?</p></speech>

The NWCI is on record as saying, and all our members are very clear on this, we believe the new national maternity hospital should be a public hospital and that is the only way we can absolutely guarantee that there will be full reproductive healthcare within hospitals.  We have also had the experience of Covid-19 where the Minister and the CMO say certain things should be happening in hospitals and yet that was not the case in regard to maternity restrictions.  We have many concerns about the new national maternity hospital but in particular in regard to the provision of reproductive healthcare.  Similar to the Deputy, we see what could be within the legal definitions about the clinical appropriateness.  That absolutely raises concern.  We already have the experience where we do not have full coverage of abortion services throughout our maternity hospitals.  Now it seems as though we are going to have this new hospital which will be there for the future and which it is likely will face similar issues that we now face in other maternity hospitals.  It is absolutely an issue that the Minister needs to address.  In our view, it needs to go further in that it needs to be a public hospital.</p></speech>

Currently, the National Maternity Hospital is one of the key institutions in regard to the development of excellence in abortion care.  It is a key support to primary healthcare providers and the doctors in the National Maternity Hospital have shown a great deal of leadership in establishing and institutionalising abortion care as part of healthcare in Ireland.  That has to carry forward, regardless of the location and the ownership of the National Maternity Hospital.  That ethos, professionalism and expertise has to transfer with it.</p> <p>  I return to one of Dr. Henchion&rsquo;s points about the need for a faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare and a professorship with specific responsibility for the development of excellence in abortion care.  Going back to Ms Spillane&rsquo;s point about how we cannot always rely on the UK, there are many strains and pressures on services in the UK, in particular in regard to advanced training for later abortion care, which is something that we need to develop here.  We cannot think only about the new national maternity hospital in terms of the legal documents that will establish it and that are part of the move, although those are extremely important.  We have to think about the institutional transfer of all of those skills.  Locating a professorship and faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare within the National Maternity Hospital now would be a really strong way of ensuring the transfer of those skills and excellence, so that clinical appropriateness would be considered within an institution that considered abortion healthcare to be critical to women&rsquo;s care generally.</p></speech>

Before I do, however, on the issue of safe access zones, I noticed that this week or last week the UN Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights published its list of issues ahead of Ireland&rsquo;s review and specifically asked about progress to safe access zones.  That is indicative of how important it thinks safe access zones are in terms of addressing our challenge of national coverage and access to GP care in particular.</p> <p>  I am very interested in this idea of having to declare and having a declaration of a refusal of care or conscientious objection.  I cannot remember who said it - it may have been Ms Taylor - but it is worth reiterating that "conscientious" is probably the wrong word because everybody who voted in the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment did so because they conscientiously engaged with the needs of women.  Maybe if we are talking about changes to the legislation, we have to rephrase that.  Just to be clear, would that include GPs?  Would we require GPs to record their objections?  At the moment how easy is it to access data about who is providing care and what the level of that care is?  Hospitals and GPs are obviously giving different levels of care.  If I am trying to access an abortion today, before I walk into the surgery or the hospital, how do I know who will deliver that service to me?</p></speech>

You would contact My Options and you would be told who you could go to.

Going back to what it means for the service user, with any healthcare concern, your automatic assumption is to go to your local GP and assume that he or she will be able to help you but because of the My Options route, it means that you have this additional step to go through.  The knowledge of My Options is quite slim and much of the research shows that there needs to be much greater awareness and a publicity drive around My Options being the first step.  Many service users face additional delays because they do not realise that they have to go through this.  When it is a time-sensitive procedure, not automatically knowing the quick first step that you have to take is actually quite significant.</p></speech>

Ms Ryan touched on a really important point.  Most people who would access any type of care would assume that the first step is to go to their GP and say they have an issue they need help with.  Is the creation of a database that outlines who offers care the wrong way around?  If we are going to look at people who object to providing basic care - I include hospitals in this and I would suggest before putting forward my next proposal that every hospital in receipt of public funds should be offering basic services - should the database not be on who is not providing the service?</p></speech>

It has been a barrier to access to abortion in Italy, where there is a register of objectors.  What has happened there is it has become the default.  When someone qualifies as a doctor, he or she goes on the register because abortion is stigmatised.  It involves additional work and perhaps some additional training, and if a doctor wants to progress his or her career within medicine, he or she will go on the register because people do not want to be associated with that type of healthcare.</p></speech>

We do not know that all those who are not engaged in the provision of care are objectors.  Thankfully, a strand of research is just getting off the ground with providers that will, we hope, identify some of those reasons.</p> <p>  Work and efforts would be better focused on engaging with non-providers through education and values work.  When the services were being established, at the end of 2018 and in early 2019, some significant work was done with the World Health Organization regarding what is called values clarification, that is, understanding the ethics of abortion care and the values that inform that kind of service delivery.  That work generally focused on people who were going to be involved directly in the provision of care.</p> <p>  From our perspective, that work should be resourced and should engage all staff in maternity hospitals, even those who are not involved in provision.  We certainly have experience of clients who have presented to emergency services or hospitals outside of the abortion service in the hospital and encountered inappropriate treatment in the form of stigma and judgment.  Dr. Henchion might wish to come in on that.</p></speech>

That is important.</p> <p>  It is also important for someone to be able to expect to go to his or her GP for any basic healthcare.  Not all GPs fit intrauterine devices, for example, but they should be able immediately to direct the patient where to go and offer any assistance the patient may need, whether it is a prescription or whatever.  That is where the difference is.  Patients should not have to call reception and be told they cannot see the doctor because a given service is not provided there, without being given anything else.  In fact, that would not even be recorded as a refusal of care because the person would never even get to see a doctor.  If a patient rings a GP practice, which takes a lot of courage, and is just told "No", that will never be recorded anywhere.</p> <p>  The way to resolve this, as Ms Spillane said, relates to proper education, making it core curriculum throughout all medical healthcare curriculums and engaging with non-providers continually to at least say that while they may choose not to provide the service, whether because they are too busy or whatever, these women will nonetheless come in with problems after accessing the service.  They need to know what happened, what their needs are and how to care for them.  The evidence shows the more that people are exposed in some way to this care, the more acceptance will develop and the more likely people will be to have a much broader base in the future.  It always comes down to education in these matters and that is important not to forget.</p></speech>

Part of that responsibility involves reflecting on the impact on the person presenting to them of the decisions they take.  The provisions on conscientious objection are contained in the same section as the provisions on equality and social inclusion.  One of the risks of focusing on the way conscientious objection is presented in the law is, as Ms Spillane highlighted, that there could be a situation like that in Italy whereby people categorise themselves and their medical students as objectors.  It is not good enough that they would never think about that again as a doctor.  There needs to be education and, as Ms Spillane noted, values clarification and further training for those who are not providing the service.  Moreover, there need to be opportunities and a responsibility to reflect on the impact on women of non-provision.  If a doctor is categorised at an early stage, he or she will have to decategorise himself or herself and there is a risk people will be locked into their decision.</p></speech>

That is one problem with trying to gather those data.  We certainly have encountered people who have attended agencies they thought were abortion-providing agencies.  They have been brought in for medical appointments, had scans and been told various information about their scans but have been provided with no reports.  It is only over time that they have realised that actually, nothing was going to happen and no progress was being made.  When they tried to get any of that medical information in order to transfer their care elsewhere, they have not had any assistance with that.  Depending on when we end up seeing them, we might say that gestationally they require a scan, and those details could quite easily be at odds with the report they were given earlier.  It is definitely an issue we come across, although not very often.  Luckily, women are quite clued in to the issue and recognise the signs that something is not right earlier than they might have in the past, when there was so much secrecy.  We tend to see them on time, therefore, although it is difficult to know because if they are not on time, we may not see them at all.</p></speech>

What jumps out at me is the sense we are almost back to where we were when we started with the eighth amendment.  Dr. Henchion stated that 90% of doctors do not provide care.  Rather than saying that 10% do, the fact that 90% do not demonstrates the lack of services for women in this country.  Moreover, there is a lack of mandatory provision in maternity hospitals.  When we remind ourselves of why we had a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment and why we needed to ask people whether they should have the right to have a say over their own health, lives, material futures and so on, a question on which we got a huge majority in favour, we need to look at the legislation in this review and address the issues that are holding us back.  Half the population - women and girls - are being held back by this legislation.</p> <p>  Ms Taylor said she thought it was good that socioeconomic reasons were not included in the reasons for which women or girls could seek an abortion, yet when we were dealing with this in committee in the lead-up to the referendum, this was one of the stickiest issues.  It was put to a very close vote and it was some other members and I who really pushed it.  I would have thought socioeconomic reasons would be very important.  When we think about teenagers, migrants, women living with domestic abuse, disabled pregnant people and so on, it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable.</p><p>Maybe Ms Taylor could address that.  </p><p> I will ask a few questions in a row.  The reason for this is that once I hear the answers, I will have to leave to go the D&aacute;il to speak.  My next question is on the impact of the protests outside abortion providers.  Does the panel of presenters here not think the Government is now presiding over a situation in this country where women are still being denied access to essential the healthcare for which people overwhelmingly voted because of anti-choice zealots and religious zealots in the main?  How urgently must that be addressed?  I would have thought that was one of the most urgent and important issues we have to deal with, along with the question of conscientious objection being allowed to block women from accessing abortion care.  We just had some discussion on conscientious objection.  However, do we know from the research carried out by the National Women&rsquo;s Council or by the family planning services how much the criminalisation of abortion acts as a chill factor, rather than the conscientious objection?  If a doctor or a practitioner thought, &ldquo;Well, if I am challenged on that I could potentially face 14 years in prison&rdquo;, how does that chill factor impact on the non-delivery of services?</p><p> I have another question about the scans and the delays women are experiencing because they are not able to get a scan on time.  Is there any evidence that is connected to the fact the scanning services have been outsourced by the HSE to a private company?  Is there any evidence, or am I just barking up the wrong tree, to suggest there is a discrimination against women in maternity services on those grounds?</p><p> My last question relates to the two ancillary recommendations of the citizens' assembly.  They arose from the joint Oireachtas committee before repeal was voted on.  One of them has been partially acted on while the other has not been acted on at all.  One is the provision of free contraception to all those of sexual activity age.  That has been partially acted on, but not fully.  The other relates to the introduction of a non-ethos-based sex education programme at school.  These were looked at and recommended to be implemented because, as is evidenced all over Europe, including in Britain and Holland, where the facilities of free contraception and a non-ethos-based sex education programme exist, the level of crisis pregnancies is reduced.  Could the panel please comment on those questions?</p></speech>

My point was that we would not want to see in law specific socioeconomic grounds, so that one would have a 12-week gestation limit, and then women would have to make a case for abortion on the basis of socioeconomic need.  The gestation limit excludes those in particular who have pressing socioeconomic need for abortion care over 12 weeks.  We need to remove the 12-week limit, so that rather than having a situation where somebody would have to plead for an abortion on the basis of their particular case, they would be able to request abortion without having to justify their decision, the same as in the current situation before 12 weeks.  We know from the international data that most women present well before 12 weeks.  However, in those cases where a pregnancy becomes a crisis after 12 weeks, it is important women have access to care.  They should not need to justify that on socioeconomic grounds.  There simply should not be a gestation limit that makes it an issue.</p> <p>  On the issue of safety zones, I agree completely with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.  The protests outside healthcare providers are instances of targeted harassment of women who need healthcare, as well as of providers.  Those who carry out those protests know the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA, will not change its policy on delivering abortion care.  They tend to target the hospitals and smaller providers.  This is particularly difficult for providers who are living close to their practices and living within the communities, such as those outside Dublin and in smaller towns and areas.  There is a need for action on that.</p> <p>  I will pass to Dr. Henchion to talk more about the chilling factor and access to scanning.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of the ancillary recommendations, which brings us back to the issue of unintended pregnancy as the critical factor here.  At the end of March, we supported the launch of a report by the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA.  This report was called, Seeing the unseen: the case for action in the neglected crisis of unintended pregnancy.  Empowering people to have the means to prevent pregnancy through education and information and through access to contraception care are critical.  I will now pass to Dr. Henchion for more on the contraception, the scanning issue and the chilling factor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1449" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#K00300"><p>I will comment first on the scanning issue.  Overall, it is one of those issues that depends on geography.  Where you are in the country depends on what way your scans are going to be provided, as well as who is going to provide them.  In some parts of the country, the maternity unit will provide scans and the doctor will contact them.  In Dublin and some other parts of the country, it is outsourced to a private company.  The contract that company has is supposed to be that it will provide those scans within that three-day waiting time.  It is not supposed to impose an additional delay.  Whereas that might work a lot of the time, there will be delays some of the time.  Everywhere has had staffing issues because of the pandemic, so that may be part of it.  It is not something I could say was either clearly discriminatory or against accessibility or allowing access to abortion.  It is set up specifically to allow access to abortion.  We have a dedicated referral pathway into this company, which is separate from the general pathway in order to get timely appointments.  However, it happens sometimes that there are delays.  That can be delay of maybe up to a week.  That can negatively impact on women in this time-sensitive service.  There are occasionally delays and that is definitely true.  It is difficult but we are not given any information as to what the cause the delay is.  It can be a difficult experience for women when that happens.  In some cases, if we were to go along with that and wait for the scan, it could potentially put women over the legal limit.  In the cases where you would be concerned, you might then contact your local hospital.</p> <p>  Like many issues in relation to the operation of this service, it puts an undue amount of pressure on providers to go way above and beyond what they would normally be expected to do in order to try to make sure the service works for women.  There could be several calls in a day about one person, which might not based on medical need.  They might not be because that person is really sick but, rather, they are based on the law and on the fact that if you do not get on to somebody today, that person is going to miss a deadline.  That is taking up time that should not be needed to be taken up.</p> <p>  Similarly, the administrative burden falls completely on the providers, who have to do additional certification documents and notification documents.  Nobody would mind doing those things, if they were going to provide good data.  However, the only data they seem to be interested in finding is the Irish Medical Council number of the doctor who is doing the providing.  There is no useful information about the demographic of women who are attending for abortion on the notification forms.  I hope that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s questions on scanning.</p> <p>  I have talked about the chilling effect of the criminal sanctions enough at this stage, so I might pass over.</p></speech>

This legislation has been promised and there is cross-party support for it.  We think it needs to be moved without delay.  We are concerned by the delay in bringing it forward.  In part answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, it is hard to know the combination of factors leading to the poor coverage we have.</p><p>We certainly believe, and we know from some evidence from the Southern Taskgroup On Abortion and Reproductive Topics, START, for example, that GPs, particularly in rural areas, are concerned about opening and about protests.  This would remove that, and we believe it would assist in broadening the coverage.</p><p> To turn to the issue raised on the ancillary recommendations, which are important, I will say something about sex education.  This has been the subject of many discussions and debates in the Oireachtas.  It is also part of what will be included in the third strategy on gender-based violence.  At this point, it is without doubt that we need a comprehensive sex education programme in primary and secondary schools that is obligatory for schools and is part of the core curriculum.  It is unfortunate that it is one of the areas getting left behind.  In the view of the National Women's Council, it is key for women's health and for wider issue concerning women's equality.  Ms Ryan will discuss contraception.</p></speech>

We also need to focus attention on thinking about how the roll-out to those aged 17 to 25 can be delivered in such a way that everyone can benefit from it.  Part of this is thinking about the network provider.  GPs and women's health clinics should be used.  We should also think about the potential role of pharmacies.  In other jurisdictions oral contraceptives are available without prescription via pharmacies.  They are trusted local community-based health care facilities.  It would be incumbent on us to consider whether there is a role for pharmacists to play if we are to reach all who could benefit from this, especially when they safely deliver the emergency contraceptive as it is.  It would be a good care pathway for them to be able to provide regular contraception consultation as they provide emergency contraception as it stands.</p></speech>

I speak as a former member of the committee, as other speakers have, that dealt with this matter in the context of identifying what that committee tried to do four years ago.  It was based on the absolute need to ensure that the full range of medical supports and services were available to women throughout pregnancy for whatever duration and whether it was a crisis pregnancy, an unwanted pregnancy or whatever.  It was felt that by doing what was done in the manner in which it was done at the time, the service was going to be provided in the way in which the legislation intended.</p> <p>  I listened with interest to what was said on the need to extend the 12-week period.  The previous committee looked at this and an attempt was made to provide services on average and on par with what was available in the rest of Europe.  Some countries differ.  Some are more advanced than Ireland and some are not.  We have to look at the efficacy of the legislation that was passed.  Who is not providing the service as required and dictated by the legislation at the time and as approved by the people?  We must remember that we had to have at the back of our minds at all times the fact the people had the right to approve or reject it.  The best we could do at the time was try to ensure the level of the legislation was sufficient to meet the requirements of women.</p> <p>  I strongly support the point on the absence of robust data.  We need this as a matter of urgency.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to some of the recommendations that were made for which we do not seem to have evidence.  For example, I do not know whether a comprehensive level of sex education is being made available in schools.  I am not sure changing legislation will improve it but we need to put it in place and it needs to be done as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  I am more than a little concerned about national coverage.  The findings at the time, after exhaustive exchanges of views between the various stakeholders, was that national coverage in respect of women's health during pregnancy is essential if we are to address the issues concerned.  If the availability of support services for women's health has changed since then we need to know urgently about the reasons.  We need to have cold hard factual evidence to back up the situation.  For example, we need to know how many women are forced to go abroad for terminations of pregnancies and we need to know the reasons for this.  By "we", I mean legislators need to know this.  The legislators have to stand over this afterwards.  Whatever is done has to stand up to scrutiny and stand up to Opposition appraisal.  It has the right to appraise it but it has to happen this way.</p> <p>  There is also need to try to ensure the level of data being made available addresses the concerns of the committee from four years ago.  Points were raised at the time, all in good faith, by various people and practitioners.  It was planned that some practitioners, for personal reasons, would refuse to get involved in the provision of services.  I recognise that, but it does not in any way absolve us from the need and obligation to provide health services for women who are pregnant and have a right to them.  I was one of the first people in the country to support the introduction of the legislation on the protection of life during pregnancy, which was groundbreaking at the time.  The waiting period was kept as it was for reasons that have been referred to already.  It has been acknowledged that some women seeking a discontinuation of pregnancy may change their minds.  People do change their minds.  It was from a health point of view that it was thought that people wanting to terminate pregnancies immediately should have a waiting period because they may think differently.  This arose from some of the evidence submitted to the committee during the course of the interviews whereby some people were full of remorse afterwards.  It was not the majority of people but it was some people.  In order to address this issue, it was put into the legislation to ensure the highest level of care was made available to women, for or against as the case maybe.</p> <p>  We need to identify precisely the amount of travel abroad and the reasons for it.  We need to look at the chill factor.  This also applies in other countries, including the UK.  Its inclusion is being criticised.  The Irish legislation is pitched somewhere in the middle ground, but we need more information as to how it has progressed over the past three to four years.  We need hard evidence.  That evidence must involve a careful assessment of all that has happened in the past couple of years in order to ensure that in the context of whatever decisions are made, we improve matters.</p><p>We are going to change the legislation, which was not anticipated in the review.  The review was supposed to identify the cause or causes of what might impede the provision of first-class healthcare and support for pregnant women throughout the country, in all circumstances, not by virtue of the fact they are far from where services are available but to try to ensure, insofar as we could, that such services be made available full stop.  We have the obligation as legislators to do that for now and in the future.  I do not want to delay the meeting but the issue of national coverage is one that needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</p><p> The other issue is I do not think it was ever intended that women would have to justify their need for healthcare.  There were reasons other than those for needing to ensure that the legislation was not as progressive as that in some countries but not as restrictive as that in others.  It is essential that the highest possible level of medical care be made available, whether it involves medical abortion or surgical abortion.  A lot depended on the degree to which these issues were teased out by the previous committee when the people came to vote.  Legislators have to rely on public support for whatever we legislate for at any particular time and that will still continue.</p></speech>

The availability of surgical abortions was also mentioned.  Perhaps Dr. Henchion would like to come in on that.  The point about data speaks to the need to reform not only operational issues relating to abortion access but also the law itself in the form of the 2018 Act.  Data collection requirements are set out under section 20 of the Act.  This provision does not give us any useful public health data on the delivery of abortion care.  It exceptionalises abortion and stigmatises the people who provide that care.  The requirement under that section - I am sure members are familiar with this - is that every abortion that takes place in this country must be notified directly to the Minister for Health within 28 days of its occurrence.  That is absolutely absurd and it is not an appropriate way to collect data on essential healthcare.  It does not happen with any other health procedure, such as heart and lung transplants.  Should we notify the Minister every time we carry out a cervical screen or insert a coil?  It is not an appropriate way to collect data in healthcare.</p> <p>  Such data does not, of course, provide any identifying information about the women who access care but, on every single notification, the doctor who provided care must supply his or her medical council registration number.  What message does that send to providers?  We have talked a lot about conscience, non-provision and the lack of geographical coverage.  What message does that send to healthcare providers other than, "We are watching you"?  It is absolutely not appropriate.  Instead, we need a provision that requires the HSE to publish an annual statistical report relating to trends in service delivery.  We do not need to set out in legislation what types of data we collect, but the type of information that might be useful includes the age profile of women accessing care, the gestation stage they are presenting at and the uptake of contraception.  This information is critical to informing service delivery and safeguarding abortion care into the future.  The current provision is not fit for purpose.  It is not appropriate to collect data about abortion in this way.</p></speech>

Many people assume that when somebody is in that nine-to-12 week bracket and gets referred to hospital that she automatically gets the option of a surgical abortion.  That is not the case.  It depends on what location she is referred to.  Some maternity units that are providing services do not actually have access to provide surgical abortion.  It can be particularly problematic for women, let us say, who have had a very difficult experience, either with a previous medical abortion or maybe a miscarriage, and are very anxious about the procedure or, again, are very worried about the prospect of failure, which would be higher with medical rather than surgical abortion.</p> <p>  The other issue I want to address relates to that of the youthfulness of the three days in respect of women potentially changing their minds.  A significant amount of evidence shows there is no medical basis for the three days' wait.  It is not just the fact of having a waiting period.  It is the fact the waiting period is mandated in law to a specific length of time that is totally inflexible and does not take anything into account regarding a woman's circumstances.  As I said, these things relate to the availability of referral services and the fact that in certain cases three days means at least a week because, for example, there might not be another hospital clinic until the end of that week.  It may also be the fact that a woman, for example, only has support from a partner at weekends so, again, three days becomes seven days since she cannot come back for the appointment on a Monday or Tuesday because there is nobody to mind her children.  It is all of those things.  It is the inflexibility of it, apart from the principle of it, that is problematic.</p> <p>  This issue should also come under the general principles of good, informed consent.  If we get such consent, somebody who is uncertain should then feel comfortable in saying "I don't know".  My experience is that those people do say "I don't know", and when they are given the information, they very clearly say, "I am still not quite sure what I'm going to do".  I say to them that it is absolutely fine if they need more time, that if they are six or seven weeks pregnant, for example, they have more time, they do not have to come after three days, they can come next week or the end of next week and, if it runs a bit longer, we can refer them to hospital.  We go through all of that with people.  They do not need to be told they must wait.  It is up to good practitioners to make sure that if people need to wait, they get that opportunity.  It is not for the law to decide how long it should be for a woman to decide she is still sure about the decision she was already sure about three days ago.</p></speech>

It was an extraordinary process.  The attention and detailed listening that happened during that process where Members listened to medical experts, civil society organisations and women who had experiences of being denied abortion care, and assessed and scrutinised international evidence, was impressive and phenomenal.  Those of us who followed the citizens' assembly saw the Oireachtas go through a detailed process after that.  Anyone who was on that committee should be very proud of the work it did, the report it produced and the result it had, but we cannot ignore what we know now.  We have had three years of understanding how the law is operating in practice.  The purpose of the review is to look at the operation of the law.  The evidence is showing that the law is getting in the way of the good operation of abortion care services that the committee aimed to produce.</p> <p>  There is a responsibility on the Oireachtas to deeply consider the evidence we now have, namely, Irish data, the experience of Irish healthcare providers and international guidance - there is new guidance from the WHO - and to have an ongoing and monitoring review so we are gradually supporting the mainstreaming of abortion care into healthcare and the destigmatisation of reproductive healthcare generally.  It is a very important role into the future.  The job is not done yet.</p></speech>

I have to agree that we have had three years of understanding how it can operate.  Many of the flaws the representatives highlighted were potentially picked up on three years ago.  We kind of knew this was going to happen.  I hope, therefore, we do not waste this opportunity to fix these issues because that means we will have gone through two rounds where we will not have put in place best practice in the first instance or, in this case, tried to amend the situation.</p><p> I am astonished that so many maternity hospitals are not providing care.  For an entire institution not to be providing care seems to go far beyond what was envisaged regarding conscientious objection, with individuals not being forced into doing something they do not want to do.  To have full-blown maternity hospitals not offering care is not in keeping with what was envisaged.  I ask for some comments on that.</p><p> One of the witnesses referred to the provision of care.  The people not providing it are not just conscientious objectors.  This has come up in recent months with some GPs I have spoken to, both in public debates and privately, whereby they have said they do not have the capacity to do it.  I ask the witnesses to tease that out.  Dr. Henchion mentioned that not every GP offers every service.  From some of the people I have spoken to, my understanding is that they were not providing it because they did not have the capacity to do it.  This does not apply to all.  Some GP practices are pointing patients to other GPs offering the service, which puts enormous pressure on a small number of GPs, in particular those in remote areas who have to deal with it all.  I know that not all GPs offer all services, but it would be incredible if it was 90% of GPs.  If it was mix of conscientious objection and just not being able to do it, I cannot think of any other service that would have 90% saying they could not do it for whatever reason.</p><p> We know that the three-day wait forces a medically unnecessary delay.  I already know the answer to this.  As far as I am aware, for no other procedure is a person required to wait three days.  People may get a major diagnosis and need to take time to consider their care options.  Am I correct in stating that there is nowhere in medicine where there is a required mandatory, legally bound three-day wait for any care?  We all know the answer to that.  I just want to confirm it.</p><p> I do not work in this area, but the 28-day mortality clause seems highly complex and difficult to work out.  We would all agree that it is not right or fair to force families to face that.  It puts the doctor in the situation of saying that it could be 29 days and therefore the pregnancy must proceed.  As an outsider looking in, it seems impossible for a doctor to make a call on the matter.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that.</p><p> Many people have found that telemedicine works very well.  It has been a very positive development.  From the witnesses' perspective, how has telemedicine been working?  I do not want to pose a leading question, but we all know where I stand on the value and necessity of telemedicine.  We were at the launch of the UNFPA.  There is a local conversation on telemedicine, but particularly here in Ireland regarding this.</p><p> The WHO recommends an abortion-on-request model as best medical practice.  I ask the witnesses to explain for the sake of the people listening in why that is the best model.  If this is the best practice, why are we not doing it?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for her questions.  She asked about the definition of foetal anomaly and the 28-day limit.  Professor Keelin O'Donoghue and her colleagues would be the best people to talk about this.  They have done some really important research on it.  Regarding the review of provisions within the legislation, Deputy Colm Burke pointed out earlier that it is extremely odd that only one review of a decision about foetal anomaly had taken place and asked whether that was functioning.  That is not unrelated to the definition and the ticking clock that we have repeatedly talked about.</p> <p>  Our director of counselling, R&oacute;is&iacute;n Venables, who is in the Gallery, has spoken about the decision-making process of people who have received the diagnosis of foetal anomaly.  The clock starts ticking.  Doctors need to do scans to determine the diagnosis and to make a determination of whether a foetus is likely to survive more than 28 days.  That is not at clear-cut diagnosis, and very often there are multiple serious anomalies.  In some cases, women or couples have travelled to the UK and a doctor there has said that it fell within the definition of foetal anomaly.  That is extremely difficult for people.</p> <p>  This point was made to the Oireachtas joint committee and the citizens' assembly many times.  It is putting a bright line into law where clinicians are looking at a statute rather than following the normal professional guidance on how to treat a case.  That determination must be made in line with the law rather than in consultation with a pregnant woman about her views because her views do not come into that determination.  That is critical to the determination of risk in any other circumstances.  The reason more people may not be looking for reviews under the law of decisions on the nature of a foetal anomaly is because the clock is ticking and they need to make a decision to travel to the UK for an earlier intervention rather than wait and potentially be told it will not happen here.</p> <p>  The WHO advocates for abortion on request for all the reasons we have heard.  The law gets in the way of timely access.  It gets in the way of good exercise of medical ethics, informed consent and clinical discretion.  It stigmatises women.  As Dr. Henchion said, there is no other procedure in respect of which the law gets discussed so much.  It keeps abortion at the margins of healthcare in ways that are not good for health.  It makes things more difficult for women and forces providers to police and be gatekeepers of the three-day waiting limit, to police and be gatekeepers of the gestation limit, to police and be gatekeepers of the definition of foetal anomaly and risk to health which is also very limiting and we see very few cases reported under that ground.</p> <p>  Having a criminal provision in the background simply makes it difficult and cumbersome.  It creates added time burdens and added administrative burdens.  It uses up healthcare resources on the part of the provider.  It causes stress, anxiety, delay and stigma to women for no health benefit.  It does nothing to change the picture of abortion access.  We know this from all the previous discussions.  When the law is in the picture it forces difficult decisions on women on where and how they will access abortion, not whether.  It forces women into later abortions by waiting.</p> <p>  The WHO guidelines set out that the approach to law should not start with criminal sanctions and then work in enabling provisions, which is essentially what the Act does because it was based on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, which was the enabling provision of the eighth amendment.  We are using that model, which was published in March 2018, before the extent of the public support for repeal of the eighth amendment was made clear through the referendum.  The WHO is advocating that laws should be based on principles of rights and access and they should place responsibilities on the State, which already exist.  They should be reflecting the responsibilities that already exist on the State.</p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan mentioned that the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had raised the issue of abortion in Ireland in its list of issues.  There are obligations on the public sector in Irish law.  There are obligations on healthcare providers according to their duty and their ethics.  The WHO believes that the law should be enabling access and should be protecting access to the service.  We need to protect the good elements which we mentioned in the opening statement of funding by the State for abortion and abortions on request without requirement to justify a decision, which are really important principles.  The law should be like the laws in places like the state of Victoria in Australia, which has one of the model laws and which starts with rights-based provisions.</p><p>The law in Spain similarly starts with the rights-based provisions and then goes into the fact that the law is designed to enable access rather than to restrict and criminalise.  That only causes harm, delay, stress and stigma.</p></speech>

One of the things I said earlier in terms of that whole 28-day piece is that termination for medical reasons is a critical issue for women and for our members.  They have raised this matter consistently.  It is the impact it has in the moment but also the message that it sends to people and couples who are in that situation.  It really is a critical area for change in this review.</p></speech>

Dr. Henchion might want to speak to our day-to-day experience of delivering it, but I want to mention that early on in the introduction of telemedicine, we sought feedback from our clients because it was a new mode of service delivery.  The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive that women like accessing care in this manner.  They identified several general advantages and very few or no disadvantages to accessing care.  For many women, it means that it minimises the burden of having to take time off work or education.  Certainly, at the time this research was conducted in summer 2020, many people also reported that it minimised the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, as one would expect.  Women felt it enabled them to access care sooner.  Others cited that they felt it gave them more privacy and reduced burdens in terms of arranging childcare.  The provision of abortion by telemedicine is supported by really strong international evidence.  Really importantly, that evidence base has increased during the pandemic thanks to a major study coming out of England and Wales.  It is working well from our experience.  It is a positive enhancement of abortion care and should certainly be retained into the long term.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1467" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#O00400"><p>I will mention two things on telemedicine, the first of which is to point out that it is not restricted to abortion care.  Telemedicine has been widely used since the pandemic particularly.  I would like to say it was really good to see that the HSE very proactively came out at the beginning of the pandemic to make sure that even though there is a restriction in the law saying the woman must be examined, it felt that in the emergency, we could actually still use telemedicine in these situations and still make an estimation of gestation in good faith or refer for a scan without physically having to see every person since it was not going to be safe to do so.  The really clear message was that abortion is the same as all other healthcare and that the abortion providers could act in the same way when providing this service as every other service.  That was really good.</p> <p>  The other thing, to be clear for people, is that I would not like anybody to get the impression that telemedicine is somehow a reducing of a service to women.  It is actually a huge extra amount of work for the provider to make sure that all of the information is being transmitted during the consultation because we so often rely on body language when looking at someone to see whether they look confused and get everything we say.  Much more effort goes into those consultations.  We put a lot of extra resources into making sure we had little links put into text messages, which we could send in order that people could click and read extra information.  We had little video clips showing them what to expect in their packs.  We would have already had information sheets and one pagers for people on how to take their medication at home, advice on what to expect and emergency contact numbers.  We made sure all of those went either by email or text.</p> <p>  A proper package has to be put together in order to have good telemedicine.  That is when we will get really good results.  We have to also be open for business.  We have to actually realise that it is not going to suit everybody.  Some people have no privacy at home and need to get out of it to actually be able to have a confidential conversation.  Some will just physically feel uncomfortable.  People could be deaf.  People will not always be able to do telemedicine.  We need to be very flexible about and also say, yes, we had this conversation over the phone but our door is open.  If a person has this or that issue, we want that person to come in and feel that they are welcome to do so.  We do not actually provide it in a vacuum where people feel they do not know where the service is and where they can go.</p></speech>

My first question is to Ms O'Connor and Ms Ryan of the NWC.  In her submission, Ms O'Connor looked at the interpretation of health and the consequences of it in abortion care.  She cited that of the 6,577 abortions provided in 2020, just 20 procedures were carried out due to risk to life or health.  This would signal an issue we have with how we interpret this definition.  Could the witnesses say a little bit about that?  How do they suggest we rectify this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1469" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alana Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#O00600"><p>It goes back to the points made earlier around gestational limits and the need to bring the model in line with the WHO guidance.  In practice, what we have is that after 12 weeks, there is a requirement to demonstrate why a person needs care based on very narrow grounds whether they are the definition of health and risk to health or fatal foetal anomalies.  It is why us, the IFPA and many others in this field are advocating for a move away from those kinds of rigid criteria and instead towards a model that is based on the doctor-patient relationship that allows abortion on request without the gestational limit, which does not have an evidence base and which the WHO recommends against.  To be clear, we disagree with having a model of care that requires the service user to demonstrate meeting very narrow criteria and which really inhibits that person's agency in this whole process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#O00700"><p>The submission looked at the issues that the criteria relating to PPS numbers impose for undocumented people looking for abortion care.  Apart from removing these criteria, how does the NWC think we can support undocumented people in achieving abortion care?  Can we implement safeguards that would protect them from any fear of engaging with State services?  I want to get the witnesses' thoughts on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alana Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#O00800"><p>I can speak a little about that.  It comes back to My Options and really ensuring that from the very first point of access with the service, it is inclusive and designed with diversity of needs in mind.  We have a great range of interpretation services being provided through My Options at the moment but there is still additional work which could be done to make sure that it is inclusive of everyone.  At the moment, if a person has English as an additional language, that person sometimes requires a friend or family member to call on their behalf.  That is one way in which the privacy of the service user is impacted.  It might be a particular issue for undocumented people who have English as an additional language.  We should be thinking from the very beginning about the additional challenges people on the margins are facing from the very first point of access.</p> <p>  Going back to the points around coverage, if a person is in a rural area that does not have a GP service robustly in place or lives in a direct provision centre and does not have a PPS number yet or, indeed, a medical card, that person will face challenges trying to use public transport to get to a provider.  It really speaks to the need to think about the coverage issue very seriously if we are to meet the needs of everyone, particularly those who may have additional barriers to transport as well as language challenges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#O00900"><p>I thank Ms Ryan.</p> <p>  Turning to the IFPA, in the context of the experiences of women in rural areas versus urban areas, the geographic disparities and disparities in care are very worrying.  The representatives from the IFPA mentioned that in most cases, and in the absence of locally accessible care, the only option women might have is home self-management of medical abortion.</p><p>Will our guests say a little more about that and what it means?  How has that affected, for example, victims of domestic abuse or women who do not have safe home environments?  Will our guests expand on that?  They touched on that issue a little; perhaps they would expand further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve Taylor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#P00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  Home self-management is the general model of care.  Women attend a doctor and receive the abortion medication.  The first medication is usually taken in the presence of the doctor and the second is taken at home.  If women are receiving care fully remotely, they receive a self-care pack and take both medications at home.  That is the general access model.  Of course, the point we are making is that for many women home is not a suitable environment to self-manage an abortion.  Home can be a place that a woman is sharing.  Perhaps she is sharing with a number of people.  She may even be sharing a bedroom.  Home may also mean a place with a coercive or violent partner.  It can be a place where one simply has no privacy.  These packs are also not suitable for homeless people who may be living in various kinds of unsuitable accommodation.  Many people in such situations would prefer a surgical abortion to a medical abortion.  Medical abortions are currently the predominant treatment available.  For most women, surgical abortion is only offered when there is a clinical indication of it being necessary rather than when there is a preference or a reason linked to their socioeconomic situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1475" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#P00300"><p>The Senator asked for clarification on the meaning of home self-management.  The situation is the same as it was prior to the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment.  In certain circumstances, there are people who still have to travel.  That can be very difficult for them.  Even if it means travelling to Dublin rather than to the UK, the women concerned are still having to travel, which means, for example, that they are not going to be there to collect their kids from school and that they must tell somebody else because they have to make arrangements in that regard.</p> <p>  Telemedicine is an advantage because only one attendance is required and women only need to make contingency arrangements once rather than twice.  It is, however, difficult for women who are coming from a distant location for many reasons.  Such women do not feel that the option is open to drop back into that provider if there is a problem.  They may be faced with a choice to attend a local maternity unit where they know there are no services being provided and where they might potentially face stigma.  That is another part of the issue.</p> <p>  On the non-documented issue, Ms Ryan is right that there is a barrier there in terms of language difficulty.  The simple black-and-white fact is that there is no way for a doctor to be reimbursed for providing that service if the patient has no personal public service, PPS, number.  Many doctors will simply not be able to provide the service because it is not sustainable to provide lengthy consultations for free.  Those women are being excluded unless they have money which in almost all cases, they do not.  It is not all about women who are in direct provision or that sort of setting.  There are students who have been in this country for a year but who do not have PPS numbers.  When this kind of situation arises, they have no way to access services.  It is not only one demographic that is affected.  People should be clear that there are several areas in which this happens.  There needs to be a pathway for the provision of this care if we want women who are resident here to be entitled to it, regardless of their circumstances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alison Spillane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#P00400"><p>I will make two additional points.  The first relates to the supports for women in those circumstances.  Since before the introduction of legal abortion and currently, the HSE does fund organisations such as the IFPA to provide specialist pregnancy counselling.  It is through that specialist counselling that we hear about many of the barriers women face.  Counselling can be useful for women to work through the particular stresses and anxieties of the unintended pregnancy but also of the delays involved and having to go through the waiting period.  It can help women to deal with the stress of being excluded by the law or of finding the gestation limit has excluded them from care completely.  Many women are not aware of the availability of pregnancy counselling.  Among the clients of our pregnancy counselling service are minors who need to access abortion care, women in direct provision and students.  Our clients include people who lack PPS numbers.  To clarify, the IFPA provides care to people without PPS numbers.  That is currently a cost we absorb.  That is not sustainable into the long term and there needs to be a system whereby there is a clear mechanism and transparency about reimbursement in order that providers are in a position to offer care and are not put in the position of denying it because of the reimbursement issue and a lack of clarity.</p></speech>

The reality is that the Irish people voted for abortion to be a healthcare issue and not a criminal act.  Unfortunately, the Act still criminalises anyone who assists a pregnant person to obtain an abortion outside of the provisions of the Act with a penalty of up to 14 years' imprisonment.  Are there many, or any, other countries in which abortion is decriminalised?  Do our guests think that decriminalisation would help to reduce the stigma relating to abortion?</p></speech>

As we said in our opening statement, we feel that the framing of the Act is wrong and that abortion is permissible in only a limited set of circumstances.  That is entirely the wrong frame within which to legislate for access to healthcare.</p> <p>  The Senator asked specifically about the situation in other countries.  I know it is decriminalised in Canada.  There were also recent reforms in South Korea and New Zealand.  I will prepare a note on that topic and send it to the committee after the meeting, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Criminalisation could impact a partner or a parent who might order abortion pills.  As we all know, that happened to the mother of a young teenager.  She was charged in that respect and the case is ongoing in Northern Ireland.  The likely result will be that medical professionals will interpret the law conservatively and patients will be denied care.  I highlight that issue.  I thank our guests for their comprehensive statements.</p></speech>

This ties into what the Senator just said about Northern Ireland.  Women who are travelling from Northern Ireland in the absence of services must bear the cost not only of the travel into the Republic and the cost of childcare but also the cost of the procedure because such women do not have a PPS number.  Given the absolute lack of provision in Northern Ireland and the fact that a postcode lottery defines whether a woman is in a healthcare area that is providing the limited service available, we have an obligation to provide care for that group of women.  Dealing with the issue around PPS numbers would also have an impact by providing support for women in Northern Ireland who need care and cannot access it in that jurisdiction.</p></speech>

As we approach the ten-year anniversary of the Protection of Life in Pregnancy Act, it is clear how far we have come in terms of the provision of services and how far things have moved in the past decade.</p><p>It is clear that the debate in 2013 was an important precursor to the successful repeal of the eighth amendment because, having been a Deputy, then I recall the level of debate and engagement I had with constituents regarding the legislation.</p><p> I welcome all our guests.  I wish to play devil's advocate a little, and I hope they understand that.  As somebody who voted "Yes" in the referendum, I still think it is important to reflect on some of the issues those of an alternative view might have.  Are there data on the three-day wait period and on how many women might have changed their minds prior to abortions or, indeed, how many may have harmed themselves as a result of not receiving timely access?</p></speech>

On the data question, what is important is the research I mentioned that was commissioned by the HSE and carried out by Dr. Catherine Conlon.  Within that, will be details on the experiences of women.  Within that, it will be our understanding part of that experience is that three-day wait period puts an undue stress on people.

Similarly, Dr. Henchion answered a question on telemedicine.  We received an amount of correspondence expressing the view that telemedicine, as opposed to direct, face-to-face contact, is a lesser service.  Dr. Henchion has answered on that comprehensively, but she may wish to comment further.  Playing devil's advocate again, a referendum was put to the people and reassurances were provided and a comprehensive set of regulations were legislated for based on the legislation for a 12-week limit and the three-day wait period I have mentioned.  What do our guests say to people who say a referendum was put, these were reassurances that were provided and to look again at those would go against the spirit of that referendum.</p></speech>

At that time there was only knowledge of abortion provision in cases or risk to life.  The only legal framework available was the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  I agree with the Senator that the Act and the debates around it and its enactment were really important in the process of reform.  Prior to the Act, no legislative effect had ever been given to the X case.  We had the eighth amendment and a Supreme Court case.  There was no legislation, regulations or anything in guidance that clarified for healthcare practitioners what they should do in those cases.  For that reason, the IFPA supported three women to take a case to the European Court of Human Rights, namely, the A, B and C case.  The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was enacted as part of the process to give effect to the ruling in the A, B and C case to give legislative clarity to the X case.  That was a requirement, as members know, of the A, B and C case.  However, once that Act was passed and in operation, a completely different conversation about abortion in Ireland happened because it liberated healthcare providers to talk about what that provision was like and really name the barriers.</p> <p>  It was in the process of discussion of the A, B and C case and of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act that healthcare providers came before the Oireachtas and later the citizens' assembly and talked about the difficulties of working in an environment where the law was in the consultation between a woman and her doctor and the bright line between life and health, the policing of that by healthcare professionals, the ethical and clinical difficulties that brought about and then the impact on women of denial of care.  That was thrashed out after the enactment of the legislation, and, in the context of the enactment, in a way we had not seen before.  This was because there was clinical knowledge and it was much more in the open.  We had doctors coming before the joint committee in 2017 giving evidence about what it was like and what the Act's impact on the operation of services was.  That is the position we are in again, whereas in 2018, during the referendum campaign, a general scheme was produced that March that was very much modelled on the structure of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act but allowing for abortion in much wider circumstances.  That was published before the extent of public support for repeal of the eighth amendment was known.</p> <p>  Following on from that, as lawmakers, Members of the Oireachtas have a responsibility to learn from the evidence of the impact of the law on the operation of services.  From the evidence, it is very clear it does.  Once Dr. Conlon's report and the other piece of research into the experience of providers are published, as well as the evidence presented to the committee today through various submissions and when the committee hears more from hospital doctors and GPs, especially in rural areas, the evidence will shows that the operation of services is negatively impacted by over-restriction in the law.  There is too much law in the law.  The gestation limit acts to exclude women who need abortion care from a necessary health service and forces them into exile.  That is something people very explicitly voted against in 2018.  That is very much what was in most people's minds when they were voting.  There is a responsibility on legislators to learn from the evidence and be confident in the evidence that will be presented in the review but to take responsibility for changing the law if the law is frustrating access and frustrating what people voted for.</p></speech>

On geographical cover, the referendum result was obviously hugely in favour of the proposition and that was across geographic areas as well.  Clearly, as has been mentioned, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Wicklow have adequate and good cover of provision of services.  In other areas and counties it is less so.  It was part of the debate that many people would not wish to access services that are very local to them, especially if they are from a small community or small rural area.  Notwithstanding the population advantage the large cities have, is there evidence people are accessing those services from rural areas partly because they must but also partly because they wish to have that level of anonymity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Alana Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#Q00600"><p>The evidence collected by Dr. Lorraine Grimes and the Abortion Rights Campaign as a survey of service users' experience suggests about 30% of those who responded were travelling four to six hours to access abortion care.  I understand the point the Senator is making that maybe going to a city might give people more assurance their need is confidential, is not a matter for discussion and that their privacy is respected.  Ultimately, however, when we think about the profile of women who require abortions, many will have children, caring responsibilities, some will not have access to a car and others may be disabled.  Nobody wants to be travelling that type of distance to access a key service.  That speaks to why we really need to retain telemedicine so that burden of a two-appointment procedure is mitigated and why we need to remove the three-day wait as well, so it is a single appointment.</p><p>Ultimately, we should be working to a national network of coverage where a woman or pregnant person can attend a local GP practice within her community which is accessible and which offers discreet and confidential care, as one would for any other health reason.  No one wants to travel that distance for what is a routine healthcare procedure.</p></speech>

If people chose to travel to a city for anonymity or whatever their personal reason is, that is absolutely fine but it should be a choice.  It should not be a necessity.  If there was less stigma around the provision of abortion, people would not be anxious about attending their local service for it and they would be able to do that.  As Ms Ryan said, many people lose much of their anonymity because they have to disclose to others if they are to travel that distance because they need help with childcare and they need time off work as it involves more than a couple of hours.  For the vast majority of people, if they were assured of the service being available locally, that would guarantee them far more anonymity.</p></speech>

At one stage, one could not travel down the road and international travel was out.  The representatives from the IFPA stated that there are three years of data.  How will that skew the data?</p></speech>

That decreased almost by half the following year to 294.  We do not know.  When the figures for 2021 are published in June, they might give us more of an indication of the extent to which unmet need is continuing.  We do not know whether that reduction between 2019 and 2020 was entirely due to the pandemic or whether there were improvements in access locally and nationally.</p> <p>  I might flag as well, in terms of the figures we have around unmet need, data provided by an organisation called Women on Web, which provides online access to telemedicine abortion predominantly in jurisdictions where abortion is illegal or heavily restricted.  Between 2019 and 2021, they received more than 700 consultations from women in Ireland.  That speaks to remaining barriers around access as well.</p></speech>

One in ten, as one of the members pointed out, means that 90% remain.  There are four counties - Dublin, Cork, Galway and Wicklow - where there are some limited services but where there are challenges.  There are challenges for GPs, particularly in rural areas and socioeconomically deprived areas.  There are fewer opportunities for people in those areas as well.  Has Dr. Henchion any suggestions in that regard?  How can we open up services so that people do not have to travel to services such as in Dublin, Galway or Wicklow?  I note IFPA's submission, but are there any practical suggestions?  Dr. Henchion was talking in terms of the barriers there in respect of those GPs.  We could nearly do a session on that alone.  Maybe Dr. Henchion might want to comment further on some of those matters</p> <p>  On the other issue, I was not aware of the criteria relating to PPS numbers.  That is new to me.  What is Dr. Henchion suggesting in respect of that matter?  Is she suggesting the use of medical numbers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1494" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Caitriona Henchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022042700002#R00700"><p>Students who spend some time in another country, if they do not get what would be the equivalent of a PPS number, they usually get a visitor number or a visitor card.  They can use the card to access medical services in that country while they are there.  That is one cohort that could be resolved.  If, for example, somebody is recently arrived into a country undocumented, that person will still have needs.  There has to be a way of providing something, whether it is an area where they are living or something like that, in order to use.  It can be a separate channel.  It can be a little more difficult to make sure that there are not problems with too many claims, but there has to be a way.  There should be a mechanism for those people to be able to still access care.</p> <p>  In terms of GPs, an individual GP might not have an objection but if he or she is in a practice with two others and those two others do not want to provide the service, it is difficult for that one GP who does not have the objection to provide the service because he or she will have concerns about his or her patient coming back on a day he or she is not there with a problem and being met by someone who says that he or she does not provide the service.  Sometimes it is a little harder to see.  When people talk about entire hospitals or institutions not providing, if one has a relatively small number of obstetricians in a hospital and half of them say "No", that makes it logistically quite difficult to do.  In terms of what needs to be done there, it is about resourcing new roles so that one will meet that critical number of staff required to make the service work.  It is also about task sharing with midwives and nursing staff to make sure that there are sufficient staff to provide it and about training for all so that everybody is clear that even if they do not want to be involved in providing the procedure, they must treat people with respect and be capable of providing all of the aftercare for complication.  As a result, if women go in and are faced with someone who does not provide the service, will not be worried about what that person is going to say and can be confident that everybody in the facility will be able to deal with anybody who has a complication.</p></speech>

Looking the hospital set-up, it is a hierarchical situation involving consultants, etc.  The difficulty is that if the senior clinician is in that position, I would imagine there would be an impact.  The senior clinician has priority in the context of theatre time.  It is also difficult for junior staff to be filling that gap or going against the conscientious objection of that individual.  One can imagine the tension and the difficulty that creates within the system.</p></speech>

That is why it is so important to have somebody appointed who can mentor those junior staff in order that the next generation coming through will not face the same issues.  That is what one wants to try and do to safeguard the service into the future.</p> <p>  On a question asked earlier, the HSE is continuously making efforts to expand the service.  It is involved in conversations with those hospitals.  As far as I am aware, the service started being provided in Sligo hospital recently.  Previously, it was not available there.  It is slow, but they are trying to engage.  Somebody asked if there anything is being done.  They are trying to engage in those areas.</p></speech>

The PPS number issue is something that the IFPA is engaging with the HSE on.  We have raised it with the executive and we can keep the committee informed if there is progress.  We are hoping that there will be progress in that area.</p> <p>  On the idea of sustainability and supports into the future, what is clear from everything that has been said today is that the law makes services available and creates a legal framework for availability, but availability is the minimal requirement in order that services can be provided.  We need to look at the broader requirements of the right to health, which is that healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare services, should not only be available, they should also be accessible and acceptable to women and of high quality.  We need to see removal of the barriers to access but also concerted efforts to build in that accessibility and acceptability, as well as availability and women's right to access care with dignity.  These requirements need to be built in institutionally by means of training and structures and, as Dr. Henchion stated, support and mentoring.  In addition, the Act does not contain an overarching preamble that deals with values.</p><p>Something is needed, whether that is a preamble inserted into the Act or a code of practice on reproductive autonomy and access to healthcare according to human rights guidelines.  The HSE has been making heroic efforts to ensure availability of services, but there is, however, an overarching responsibility to lift our vision and to think about excellence, quality and sustainability in future.  Many structures could be put in place in the health system to do that.</p></speech>

Also touched on was the issue of safe access.  Would the witnesses like to outline some experiences they are aware of?  I refer to challenges women are facing in some areas.  There is no need to necessarily mention those areas, but I think we would all accept it is wrong and that people should be able to access medical care if they need it.  They should not have to go through a gauntlet in doing so, as we have seen in other countries.  It is only starting here, and we would all be horrified if it escalated.  The people in favour of doing that would pick on what they would term, mar dhea, "a success" in one area and then move to another, and so on.  Legislation is being brought forward.  It is important, however, for any overview of the legislation to consider this aspect, which is one of the areas that must be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

We have certainly heard some of the public reporting on protests outside the National Maternity Hospital.  We also know of doctors who have decided not to go ahead with surgeries, on a weekend, for example, because of protests happening outside.  We are not that far away from when we had the referendum and we have also spoken a great deal about the stigmatisation of abortion, so of course these protests cause real concern for women.  We have said this several times today, but this legislation was promised at the time of the original Act and yet we have had this enormous delay.  This legislation must be introduced as speedily as possible because it is part of the frame around the stigmatisation of what is a healthcare service for women.</p></speech>

Nationally representative data collected in February 2022 show that 85% of the public agree that those providing and accessing abortion services should be protected from threats, harassment and abuse.  That is a strong mandate from the public for the introduction of safe access zones.  The cross-party Bill, which has been developed and strengthened on every Stage so far, represents our best opportunity for introducing the legislation in a timely way.  As the Bill enters the D&aacute;il, it is incumbent on all our representatives to support it.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses outline how often failed early medical abortions occur and what the process is for after-care?  What harm can this do to people?</p></speech>

Therefore, it goes up slightly during that gestational period.  In some cases, it is obvious it has occurred because no bleeding has happened and somebody is going to report that quickly.  If it were to happen in the community, then we would quickly refer the people concerned to one of the clinics in the maternity units providing care.  Those units would be extremely responsive in seeing those people quickly.  It is upsetting for people because they thought it was going to be sorted out.  This aspect is part of the consent process, though, so people know about it and we are clear with them about it.  It is stressful, however, because people might then have to wait for a few days for a hospital appointment.</p> <p>  The real problem comes in cases where people may have this experience slightly earlier than they thought.  I refer to situations where people might have had less bleeding than they thought, so then they may be anxious the procedure has failed, when in fact it has been okay.  Even more anxiety may be felt in the opposite situation, where people thought they had enough bleeding, but they did not actually lose a pregnancy and it was still there.  Therefore, there is this whole aspect of first trying to ascertain whether someone is still pregnant.  In a situation where there has been a positive test, the question is whether that is just because of some remaining residual hormone and there is nothing to worry about.  Rather than just adopting an approach of telling people it often takes a bit longer for the pregnancy hormones level to fall and that it sounds like everything is fine and we will just do the test again in a week, we are always in the position of saying we cannot really just afford to wait for a week in case we run out of time.  </p> <p>  Therefore, we must over-investigate people, whether that involves sending them to the hospital for scans or doing blood tests to check whether their hormone levels are dropping.  It means that women are being overstressed and over-investigated.  We are constantly going around with these numbers in our heads.  For example, if a person had a blood test on Monday, I must ensure I get the result, communicate again and ensure that person comes back in on Thursday.  There is nothing wrong with these people.  They are perfectly well and healthy, and we should not be having this major concern about what their blood test results are.</p></speech>

I have written down the questions to make sure I do not miss anything.  We can break down the funding and I can follow up with the Chairman on that afterwards.  The reason we presented it this way is that it would be done crudely.  Some of these organisations, like Feasta, Futa Fata or Comhar, are exclusively for the Irish language or for Imram, the Irish-language literature festival.  Then there are organisations we fund, like Poetry Ireland, that are national and all-island organisations that are working through English and Irish.  We have been working in recent years to try to encourage those organisations to make Irish-language literature more central to what they are doing and to raise the visibility of Irish within them.  The Chairman is right that some of these organisations are not involved in Irish-language literature at all, but the purpose of the draft policy, which should be adopted later this year by the Arts Council, and of the strategy are about bringing up the visibility of Irish and trying to encourage all those players within literature in Ireland to present, promote and commission Irish language literature as a core part of their work.  We can give that information on funding but it would be a crude exercise and it would take out some of the nuance.  The purpose of this is to try to give the full picture.</p> <p>  There are some bullet points below that financial appendix that talk about our supports to individual writers.  It is true we receive an awful lot more applications from individual writers working through English that from those working through the Irish language, and that is something we want to address.  We might receive around 20 applications per round from Irish language writers when we might receive 200 in the English language.  Part of the policy and strategy is about articulating the Arts Council's role in making it clear to those writers who are working on high-quality literary work that the Arts Council is there to support them.</p> <p>  We work with Foras na Gaeilge and we make sure our funding is not duplicated as a matter of course.  One of the actions within the draft strategy is to develop a memorandum of understanding between ourselves and Foras na Gaeilge that distinguishes what our role is.  Foras na Gaeilge's interest in the Irish language is broader than that of the Arts Council; we are just looking at Irish language literature.  However, not all Irish language writing falls within that category.  The Chairman is right that this is part of it but we work with Foras na Gaeilge frequently.  An example of a project we are working on with it now is &Aacute;ine Ni Ghlinn's wonderful An Bosca Leabharlainne, which sees Irish-language books going to schools throughout the country.  That is all about encouraging reading for pleasure through the Irish language.</p> <p>  The Chairman is right about the next generation of readers and writers and about the current generation.  We are looking at two things within that.  Within the literature team we are doing some research this year on reading and on what drives people to read for pleasure.  We are looking at what people read in English and at what drives them to read for pleasure in Irish as well.  We are doing some work on that this year to see if there are meaningful interventions the Arts Council could be making in that regard.  A lot of our focus to date has been more on the production end of things such as supporting new writers and supporting the publishers to bring things to print.  All of those books need to be read, enjoyed and shared, so we are looking at that.  Childrens Books Ireland is a key organisation we support, and the work it does is critical in the support it gives to children's writers and illustrators.  It is very good in the supports it offers to schools, libraries and others that are getting books into kids' hands.  The news about the funding for school libraries was welcome and Childrens Books Ireland was quick out of the traps with recommended reading guides, which included work within the Irish language.</p> <p>  I will go back to the Chairman's first question and we have been encouraged in recent years and in the past 18 months that some of our organisations that might have been a little bit slower to see Irish language literature as a core part of what they are doing have been making great strides in that area and have been developing their policies in that regard.  For example, Childrens Books Ireland has just engaged an Irish language officer who will work with it.  The Irish Writers Centre is developing an Irish language strategy, and Poetry Ireland has an introduction series that has been running for years and now it has an Irish language element to it as well.  The Poetry Aloud competition was another successful initiative it had done through English for many years and now it is partnering with Imram to do it in Irish as well.  A lot of good work is happening there, which we are trying to encourage as much as possible.  A lot of policy is about encouraging and making things more visible.</p> <p>  On the writing question, there is work to do there and the Chairman was talking about the next generation of Irish writers.  Just like with reading, we are supporting a number of organisations that are working with young people on writing.  The most prominent of those is Fighting Words, which is the organisation Roddy Doyle helped to found.  It is working through the Irish language as well and we have been supporting it to do so.</p></speech>

If I do not, please come back to me.  To answer the second to last question first, the plan is that my colleague, Mr. Val Ballance, will present a paper to the Arts Council this afternoon about our broader approach to the Irish language.  We will wait for that to be published before I go back out for a final round of consultation on the Irish language literature strategy.  I hope it will be published in quarter 3.  I would rather it would be tomorrow.  We have been working on the bones of it for some time, so I do not think it will surprise anyone.</p> <p>  In terms of the organisations and encouraging them to do more to maintain Irish language literature, there are two actions within the policy.  Again we have been progressing them for some time.  One of those is with regard to those organisations that are national or resource organisations.  The plan is to set some kinds of minimum standards we expect to be undertaken, some best-practice standards, calling out where we think we see very good practice and encouraging organisations to do more there.  That is for those organisations that have that resource-organisation remit.  They are meant to be national and they are.  That is what they are set up to do.  It is not an optional extra that they do only if they get funding.  It is part of their remit and seen as core.</p> <p>  There is an action within the strategy to set up, for festivals in particular, a curatorial fund or support or a curator-in-residence programme.  My experience with literary and multidisciplinary festivals is that many of them have an interest in programming some Irish, or maybe they do not, but they might put in one token event at the furthest reaches of the festival at the worst possible time.  They could be give given some advice and support around how to programme this imaginatively, maybe alongside people speaking English or other languages.  A number of festivals are doing that work very well but they cannot be relied upon to programme throughout the country.</p> <p>  With regard to the journals and publishers, it will be more around encouraging where the good practice is happening.  There has been some talk that maybe once funding reaches a certain level with a journal or a publisher, there would be an expectation that they will have Irish-language expertise on staff.  A number of the journals we have supported for a long time have Irish-language editors on staff and regularly feature that as part of their work.  We want to look at ways to increase that and make it the norm rather than the exception.</p> <p>  The new and translated classics is an area where we are distinct from Foras na Gaeilge in that, in general, it tends not to fund translations of English-language works into Irish whereas the Arts Council does.  We support an organisation called Literature Ireland which is focused on the translation of Irish work abroad but it also looks at inward translation.  It offers grants to publishers to translate an English-language work by an Irish writer into French, Ukrainian or another language or a work in English or French that could be translated into Irish.  It looks at ways to do that.  It does it on a smaller scale than it does the English-language work.  Literature Ireland is an organisation we look at in terms of the first category we talked about where we see some kind of minimum standards for what is happening.  The Cathaoirleach is right.  There are difficulties around that in terms of copyright but that is absolutely something the Arts Council wants to encourage.  We have been funding a number of publishers that have been doing that kind of translation work for quite a while.  Did I cover everything?</p></speech>

Regarding voluntary groups, the Arts Council is running a number of schemes at the moment that are open to voluntary groups where organisations do not necessarily need to be limited by guarantee.  That is mostly through our festival investment scheme, which often involves community-led groups.  I hope I am getting the question right.  For groups or individuals that are thinking about writing local histories, without knowing the particulars, it might be an area slightly outside the Arts Council&rsquo;s remit and more in the remit of a local heritage office.  In some cases it might be for the arts office or the library service.  The Arts Council&rsquo;s focus is on professional artists in literature, that is, professional writers.  Professional writers can come from anywhere and always start out as non-professionals, which is why we support so many journals up and down the country to enable them to work on creative work as well.  The line between what is creative and what is historical gets a little blurred but our focus is on those works of the creative imagination.  We have a long working relationship with the local authority arts offices going back a long time.  Depending on the nature of what a group is looking at, the arts office should usually be their first port of call.</p></speech>

The plan is to talk to our university partners about having an Irish language writer-in-residence.  Sadhbh Devlin is in DCU and works with prospective teachers in trying to instil a love of reading and writing in the Irish language.  The English-language writers-in-residence are mostly working with creative writing students.  We have had initial conversations with a couple of universities that have an interest in having an Irish-language writer-in-residence who would work with creative writing students who are working through Irish.  The purpose of these writer residencies for the Arts Council, which we have been doing for 30 years, is to provide a writer with a relative period of financial stability.</p></speech>

We can break our funding down in a variety of different ways and there is another report I can run that just looks at what is exclusively Irish language literature, and there are organisations that work exclusively that way.  However, there are also a number of organisations, such as Poetry Ireland, which I mentioned earlier, and Children's Books Ireland would be another.  Poetry Ireland runs a journal and it has an Irish-language editor, and there is no way of breaking that funding apart to say this part is the English-language part and that part is the Irish-language part.  This work is core to what it does.  In the strategy we are trying to set out a number of different ways in which we will try to do this.  In respect of those organisations which are national - stop me if I am repeating what the Deputy has heard already - and have a resource remit, we are looking for minimum and best practice standards from them.</p> <p>  For organisations within our strategic funding programme, we have higher expectations as to what they are doing around a variety of areas.  If this relates to a literature organisation, we would expect that it would be working through the Irish language also unless there is some sort of compelling reason as to why-----</p></speech>

We have always had a literature strategy, a literature officer and have had responsibility for Irish-language literature.  We have been working in this way according to a broader strategy for as long as the Arts Council has been around.  This policy is giving specific attention to it and is trying to name some of the things we have been doing for some time to give us more direction and greater clarity around that.  These are conversations, particularly with the strategically funded organisations, that we have with them all the time and are organisations that have made great strides in the work they are doing in the Irish language.</p></speech>

I want to say 2006 but it may in fact predate that.  I am in this role since 2007.  We have an Irish-language literature adviser who changes every three to five years and we get specific advice in this area.  I hear what the Deputy is saying about conversations but we probably have robust discussions with organisations on foot of their funding decisions.  We have funding agreements with organisations.  The Irish-language literature adviser and I attend these meetings together and discuss how organisations are doing.  On many occasions encouragement is what it is all about.</p></speech>

The Bosca Leabharlainne is part of the Arts Council initiative of Laureate na n&Oacute;g which is run on our behalf by Children's Books Ireland and is generously supported by Foras na Gaeilge as well as by ourselves in the Arts Council.  We support the Laureate na n-&Oacute;g initiative along with the reading resources which go along with it.  The foras paid for the books.  It worked very hard with Children's Books Ireland to come up with the funding package around it but it meant that it was not possible to cover the full complement of primary schools.  They comprise Gaelscoileanna, schools in Gaeltacht areas and, as I recall, schools from designated disadvantaged areas.  There were also those who made expressions of interest and there was an application process for it as well.  If the committee would like - I am unsure as to how these things work - to answer the second question, I can provide the committee with very comprehensive material on that.  Yes, this project is being evaluated as it goes forward and the ambition is that it would live beyond that time.  We can follow up with more detailed information on it as I would not have all of those details to hand.</p></speech>

I welcome from the Department of Transport, Ms Ethna Brogan, assistant secretary, Mr. Andrew Ebrill, principal officer, and Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal adviser on roads.  They are all very welcome.  I thank them for accommodating us on this matter.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating via MS Teams to confirm prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Members and all those in attendance in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Brogan, on behalf of the Department of Transport, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Dominic Mullaney, our principal adviser on roads who deals with regional and local roads matters, and Mr. Andrew Ebrill, principal officer with responsibility for national roads and active travel in the Department.</p> <p>  As members will be aware, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, which operates as an office of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is responsible for implementing national policy on public procurement, particularly with respect to construction procurement.  Policy on public works contracts, which are the form of contract used in transport projects and more broadly across the public capital programme, is a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  For this reason, I do not propose to address the specific issue of reform of those contracts as it is not within our Department&rsquo;s remit.  However, we are acutely aware of the difficulties facing the construction industry at present and the potential impact these difficulties may have on delivery of transport projects under the national development plan.</p> <p>  We are liaising closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and have brought any emerging issues in the transport sector to its attention.  I understand that Department is currently examining the position regarding the impact of construction inflation on public works contracts and is considering a number of options to address the difficulties that are emerging.  Ultimately, any decision in this regard will be a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  </p> <p>  The transport projects to be developed over the next ten years are set down in the national development plan, NDP, which was approved by Government last October.  The NDP provides funding of &euro;35 billion for transport infrastructure over the next ten years.  Delivery of the transport elements of the NDP will support many of the national strategic outcomes, NSOs, in the national planning framework, particularly NSO 1, compact growth; NSO 2, enhanced regional accessibility; NSO 3, strengthened rural economies and communities; NSO 4, sustainable mobility; NSO 6, high-quality international connectivity; and NSO 8, transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society.  We will be investing in active travel, bus, rail and road projects across the country to deliver these outcomes.</p> <p>  Turning to national roads, funding under the NDP will facilitate continued protection and renewal of our existing national roads infrastructure, including motorways, in line with Government policy.  The NDP foresees an Exchequer allocation of approximately &euro;2.9 billion for the protection and renewal of existing national roads over the ten-year period to 2030, in addition to approximately &euro;1 billion on public private partnerships, or PPPs, allocated fairly evenly across the decade.  Approximately &euro;5.1 billion of Exchequer funds are earmarked for new national road projects across the lifetime of the NDP to 2030.</p> <p>  In terms of new national roads projects, in keeping with the programme for Government, a ratio of 2:1 is to be maintained between new public transport investment and new road investment.  This means that while there will be expansion in public transport options to facilitate a broader range of choice for citizens, investment in key road projects will also be progressed.</p> <p>  Focusing on 2022, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, was allocated approximately &euro;733 million from the Exchequer for national roads capital funding for 2022, broken down as follows: &euro;254 million for the protection and renewal of the existing national road network; &euro;118 million for committed PPP contracts; &euro;331 million for new road projects; and &euro;30 million from within the Department&rsquo;s capital envelope allocated to TII for protection and renewal in December 2021, helping to augment TII&rsquo;s spending in 2022.</p> <p>  In line with the NDP and Government policy, TII allocated this national roads funding for 2022 in a manner which seeks to achieve the following outcomes, in addition to safety: protection and renewal of the existing national road network; progressing major projects at or near construction; progressing major projects which are pre-construction but well advanced in the development pipeline; and prioritising the remaining funding for major projects which provide for local bypasses and compact growth in Ireland&rsquo;s towns and villages.</p> <p>  Turning to regional and local roads, as members will know, the regional and local road network provides vital connectivity in rural Ireland.  It is essential in supporting economic and community links throughout the country and is relied on by buses, cyclists, commercial vehicles and private cars.  The NDP will enable a spend of &euro;5.35 billion on the protection and renewal of this network over the period to 2030.</p><p>Targeted improvement schemes will also be funded, including projects to take traffic out of town centres and to facilitate improvements to the public realm and the adoption of more sustainable transport modes.  A sum of &euro;677 million has been earmarked for that.  Approximately &euro;600 million has been allocated to regional and local roads in 2022, the vast majority of which, approximately 90%, relates to protection and renewal.  A robust and safe regional and local road network will be vital to support expanded and improved bus services and to connect dispersed communities with their local villages and services.</p><p> The NDP commits unprecedented funding to local authorities throughout the country to deliver high-quality active travel infrastructure to enable more people to make the switch to active travel.  Approximately &euro;290 million is being invested this year in walking and cycling infrastructure throughout Ireland along with another &euro;60 million on greenways.  We see delivery start to happen across the country and can expect to see it ramped up in the years ahead.</p><p> As for bus and rail, we will also see major public transport projects progressed and delivered over the period of the NDP, including BusConnects, the DART+ programme, MetroLink and substantial investment in suburban and intercity rail projects.</p><p> The funding provided for transport in the NDP aims to support the delivery of numerous projects across all modes.  The Department is committed to ensuring delivery of this ambitious programme to the maximum extent possible to contribute to the national strategic outcomes in the national planning framework.  We recognise the very real difficulties emerging on the construction front, which may have an impact on delivery.  Many of those difficulties, as the committee will know, are driven by global events.  We will continue to work cross-departmentally to address those in the period ahead.  I am happy to take any questions Members may have.</p></speech>

The bypass issue was a bit of hot topic for me.  To start out on a positive note, it is good to see the progress that has been made on Dunkettle and on the Macroom-Ballyvourney bypass.  It is transformative for connectivity in the south west.  It is also important we are having this discussion.  As we know, there is significant pressure on construction-related inflation, which has been very problematic for the Government.  Today is a good opportunity for us to ask the Department a number of questions.</p> <p>  Funding certainty for capital infrastructure projects became a hot topic throughout last year and into 2022.  My first question is about the ongoing work being done on the NDP.  When it comes to key road infrastructure projects in particular, how are we looking for the year ahead?  We will see the completion of major schemes, particularly in Cork, where the majority of the major construction of road infrastructure in the State is going on.  However, is the N25 upgrade to Castlemartyr and Killeagh, for example, and funding certainty for that and for other major roads schemes, a concern to the Department?</p></speech>

We were not able to progress all the roads we had hoped to progress this year with funding.  There are six schemes for which we were not in a position to allocate funding.  We have said previously that-----</p></speech>

What is the figure the Department will need to carry out those works?  For all of us here, they are all of concern.  I will be parochial and refer to my constituency.  Ms Brogan has referred to one project from Carrigtwohill to Midleton.  What can the committee do to assist the Department in getting a full understanding of the finance it will need to carry out these works?  I am sure the Chair and the committee would be amenable to talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to achieve the budget required to carry out these works.</p></speech>

In deciding on the projects to proceed, we had prioritised on the basis I have set out in my opening statement, starting with those that were under construction, followed by those that were near construction and then, further down the pipeline, bypasses etc.  The funding is settled for this year.  Unless more funding becomes available, we will not be able to progress those projects.</p></speech>

Mr. Peter Walsh and I have had our issues, a lot of them in the public domain, in these Houses in particular.  TII has had very few issues with cost overruns.  The projects undertaken have come in on budget.  From the committee's point of view, today is really a listening exercise to hear from the Department what we can do to help to attract the additional capital the Department will need.  The expenditure for 2022 is confirmed, and that is fine, but looking ahead to 2023, we will shortly enter another budgetary cycle, and it is important for us to get a good read of what we are able to do to assist when it comes to the provision of road infrastructure in particular.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding that, when it comes to rail infrastructure and the various metropolitan area transport strategies that have been put in place, the expenditure on those projects is very significant, especially when it comes to what is required in Cork and in Limerick.  I will let Deputy O'Donnell address the latter, but I understand about &euro;1.4 billion is needed in Cork, which is a very significant sum of money.  What we have seen is an allocation of &euro;184.7 million from the European Commission through the Covid relief funds, but where is the rest of the funding?  When will it be allocated to allow the progression of the Cork metropolitan train strategy as part of the Cork metropolitan area transport, CMAT, plan?  We are looking at the electrification of the lines, the tripling of capacity on them, the doubling of the frequency of the trains and the construction of, I think, four separate new platforms throughout east and north Cork and in Kent Station in Cork city.  When it comes to funding certainty for those projects, does the Department yet have a vision or plan or anything to which it could refer to give us a steer as to what the expected completion timeline is for those works?  The international economy is in a very shaky position.  Borrowing is at an all-time low at the moment but I do not think that will be sustained into the next two or three years, so that situation will change, but I put that question about rail infrastructure in Cork to the witnesses.</p></speech>

I am just posing that question.</p></speech>

Ms Brogan has listed the six schemes that are not problematic, but what new projects will it be in a position to undertake?  I am not referring to Dunkettle or the Macroom-Ballyvourney section, but other new capital projects that the sod has not been turned on yet.  Where is the Department going to next?</p></speech>

That is the pipeline for the next few years.  As initial design is progressed on others further back in the pipeline, they will move along the project pipeline process and into more advanced planning and construction at a later stage.  We hope to continue in 2023 with the list of the schemes that were progressed in 2022, and if additional funding becomes available we hope to be able to fund those that were not funded this year as well.</p></speech>

I compliment the capital works in aviation that have been done in 2022 and last year.  It was astonishing what the Department, working with the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, was able to achieve with the new runway being built in Cork Airport in record time and on budget.  It is fantastic to see that.  I compliment the staff at Cork Airport.  Senator Buttimer and I have worked in tandem with them.  I also compliment Mr. Dalton Philips, the DAA and the team in Dublin Airport.  We were out there recently.  It shows that we can build capital infrastructure in the State without problems, because I believe we do ourselves down too much in Irish politics when it comes to capital investment in transport infrastructure.  We need to broaden our horizons a little and look at things such as high-speed rail and other opportunities that could make a real and serious impact on the economy and on society.  The forecast is good when it comes to how projects are being managed, particularly with the Department of Transport.  I am usually critical but I want to compliment that today.  I also acknowledge Mr. Ebrill's attendance today.  He has been very helpful as well, and I thank him for that.</p></speech>

Some of my questions relate to the jobs that are being put out to tender.  We heard from the TII already, but the Department's spend is much greater than the TII spend.  It has rail spend, aviation spend, spend on active travel and so forth that do not go through TII but go through the National Transport Authority, NTA, and various other mechanisms.  Is the Department finding an absence of tenderers being willing to present and is it finding price inflation coming in?  Clearly, an allocation has been given to the Department, but prices are rising and there is even a challenge with labour shortages and getting people to say they are available.  I see somebody nodding, so that is a positive.</p> <p>  The challenge is that we have labour shortages and that is fuelling a certain element of price inflation in the labour market.  There is also the energy crisis, materials and so forth that are all affected by the cost of energy in many cases and for other reasons such as supply and demand.  We are talking about a &euro;9 billion road allocation in the next ten years, with &euro;5.1 billion for roads, &euro;2.9 billion for road protection and &euro;1 billion for PPP.  That is just the road section.  Obviously, then, there is the 2:1 ratio.  Does the 2:1 ratio exclude the &euro;2.9 billion?  The &euro;5.1 billion in roads new spend and the &euro;1 billion in PPP new spend would suggest approximately &euro;6.1 billion on roads.  Would roughly &euro;12.2 billion be a reasonable metric in public transport?</p></speech>

I am wondering what bang for our buck the State will get, relative to what we thought we were going to get, based on all this price inflation.  I know there are commercial sensitivities, but I am talking about the global picture.  If prices have gone up by 20% or 30%, are we saying with regard to a certain amount of projects we thought we were going to get that we just will not have the money to do all the things we thought we could do previously because of the price increases?  Has there been any analysis of that?</p></speech>

The supply chain difficulties have been present for some time, but the inflationary pressures have presented and have ramped up in the last couple of months, particularly since the events in Ukraine started to unfold.  If costs continue to rise, there is a risk that we are not going to be able to deliver to the extent that we thought we might.  I will not make a reference to any particular projects.  As the Senator knows, TII and the local authorities are the contracting bodies.  The Department does not contract for any of these projects.</p></speech>

It is looking at measures but what measures is it looking at?  Obviously, people are looking at infrastructural and roads projects but they are also looking at rail and active travel projects and greenways and are saying that if the pot of money was &euro;30 billion or &euro;20 billion and inflation has gone up 50%, a lot of these projects will not delivered on time or will not be delivered at all.

There is no point in promising people things that are completely undeliverable.  If everybody knows you cannot get the materials or staff and the stuff is costing far more than it was originally going to cost, something has to give and we need to be able to understand what is going to give first and so on.

The two major questions are how far the commitment in the national development plan - the funding envelope - will go in light of the emerging trend of inflation.

It is difficult to say at the moment because the goal posts keep moving.  Every week, there is a new development.

There is also a rumour mill that exists.  We will hear from the industry later on.

Ms Brogan said it involves a small number of projects but it has the potential to have significant implications.  Have certain projects been stalled?

We have a sense and are hearing - not necessarily from the Department explicitly - but from a range of stakeholders that there are serious concerns.  If there were serious concerns and if there was a serious problem here, what would be an appropriate response from the Departments involved - the Departments of Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform?  The Department of Transport has heard from TII, which suggests there needs to be a move in terms of the alignment of stakeholders, planning, regulation and public contracts.  Let us project forward a couple of years and talk about a worst case scenario where multiple businesses are going to the wall and multiple projects on which the Department and the Government wish to deliver and that communities wish to see delivered are being delayed or are not happening.  How do we avoid that in the context of what we are hearing from stakeholders and the crunch in terms of inflation?  What sort of response do we need from Departments and Government?</p></speech>

I suggest that it involve a real engagement with the relevant stakeholders and a responsive reaction in terms of the Government moving the levers it has as quickly as possible because we do not want to see businesses go to the wall because of the nature of the constraints we have applied to them or, more important, projects not being delivered or being delayed to an inordinate degree.</p></speech>

This is an important meeting and I echo the remarks of Senator Horkan that we should have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before the committee as a matter of urgency as part of an ongoing discussion on the reform of public works contracts.</p> <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke spoke about difficulties that are beginning to manifest and I am aware that Ms Brogan is constrained as regards what she can and cannot tell us about projects.  Speaking in a specific as opposed to a general manner, the national development plan is the shop window of infrastructure projects and is akin to the all-Ireland hurling final in respect of public works.  Project visualisation and delivery are critical.  Can we take it that the national development plan projects will be delivered on time for the many communities that are dependent on and waiting in anticipation of the projects committed to in their areas?</p></speech>

I can only speak for the transport elements of the national development plan but we are continuing in the delivery vein and we will try to address all of the challenges that are emerging in the weeks and months ahead.  We are very committed to delivery and our delivery agencies are as equally committed.  All the planning and development work is continuing while we try to deal with these difficulties that are emerging.</p></speech>

Deputy O&rsquo;Connor spoke about CMATS, for example.  I commend the allocation and resourcing of a specific office in Cork and Mr. AJ Cronin on his proactivity in that regard.  Where lies that project?  Ms Brogan told Deputy O&rsquo;Connor that she did not have the plans.  I am not saying this about Ms Brogan, nor do I wish to be personal, but we can have all of the glossy brochures we like but this is about project visualisation and delivery.  We have difficulties and Mr. Parlon in his remarks to us later - members have read his opening statement - will highlight different issues.  What does Ms Brogan's statement just now actually mean?</p></speech>

For the first time in a long time, we have comprehensive transport planning strategies.  The strategy for the Dublin area is being reviewed at the moment.  We also have strategies for the regional cities.  For the first time, we have that funding commitment in the NDP to underpin delivery of those plans.  While the Senator may refer to these as glossy, I believe we are in a good position and a much better position than we were in previous years when we had plans but no funding certainty.  The alignment of the NDP with the transport plans for the greater Dublin area and regional cities should enable us to deliver more efficiently a more comprehensive network that suits the needs of citizens across all modes, particularly the sustainable mobility modes.</p></speech>

A worrying issue for me and other members of the committee is that since 2009 the number of members of the Civil Engineering Contractors Association has fallen from 138 to 77.  Another recent development, to cite the foreword to the report by Mr. John G. Murphy, the association president, refers to many of these contractors "disproportionately increasing their turnover in foreign markets.&rdquo;  Does Ms Brogan believe this will have an impact on the national development plan?</p></speech>

For the sake of &euro;10 million, we have stopped six projects.  What percentage is that of the Department&rsquo;s budget?

I am not picking a row now, but &euro;10 million is not a huge amount of money in the overarching budget of the Department.</p></speech>

Is anyone good at maths?  Is that 0.3%?  It is a tiny percentage of the overall budget, and yet this has caused a great deal of anxiety.  Even without the calculator, my maths are still intact.  The percentage works out at about 0.3% of the overall budget.  It is less than 1%.  It is not a material amount in an overall context, but it is highly material funding to individual projects.  I hand back again to Senator Buttimer.</p></speech>

Therefore, we allocated that budget in line with the prioritisation exercise, which included not stopping projects under construction, such as the Macroom bypass or the Dunkettle interchange.  It involved prioritising other projects, such as bypass projects, for example, in line with ministerial priorities.  We were able to proceed with and to progress about 30 NDP projects this year on that basis.  Six projects could not be progressed this year, but as Ms Brogan said, they are not stopped and they will be examined later this year for next year&rsquo;s part of the normal annual assessment process.</p></speech>

I understand the response from Mr. Ebrill in respect of the six projects.  This comes back to my fundamental comment, however, and it is one I know many members will be sick of me saying, that the national development plan is the flagship policy.  This meeting is about the reform of public works contracts.  In that context, I would like to hear what the Department has done in respect of initiating reform of public works contracts.  I ask that given the issues we are encountering.  We will also hear about them later from the representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.</p> <p>  I have a major concern in this regard.  From a political perspective, we will be in the shop window if we do not have project visualisation and delivery.  We will go before the people in a situation where project X has not been delivered and we will pay the political price.  This comes down to that too in many ways.  Regarding reform of public works contracts, where are we with that process and what are the implications for ongoing projects, including those six projects we mentioned and others?  Is there an import in respect of the whole issue of the modal shift we have heard about regarding active travel?  What are the implications on the active travel segment of the Department&rsquo;s endeavours in respect of the issue of public works contracts?</p></speech>

That is not within the policy remit of our Department.</p></speech>

I know I am presenting her with an academic type of question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022042700002#G02900"><p>In that context, we had representatives from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, with us before Easter.  We find that to be a measured type of body.  Its representatives came in here and basically told us that the NDP was on fire and under serious threat.  They did not do that lightly.  We have invited representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to appear before the committee, and we expect them to attend because this matter is of such magnitude.  I happen to be a Deputy for Limerick city.  When Roadbridge went to the wall a short time ago, 630 people lost their jobs.  We speak to people throughout the country.  The national development plan in respect of road projects is under serious threat.  I would like to hear a sense of this urgency reflected in the Department of Transport.</p> <p>  We are arguing here about six projects that did not go ahead for the sake of &euro;10 million, and we had to delve in and forage out this information.  This issue has taken up pages of space in the media.  It has caused untold anxiety for people.  Side by side with that aspect, &euro;260 million is allocated to active travel.  Those are great projects and no one is questioning their value for money.  For me, this is about asking questions about value for money.  I want to see active travel and such projects.  Equally, though, I need to see road projects getting under way as well.  I am not ideologically driven.  I want to see both those endeavours happening in tandem.</p> <p>  The problem we have here is that there is a current public works contract.  In the case of all contracts put in place prior to 1 January 2022, inflation must be above 50% to enable contractors to make additional claims, and that can only happen after 30 months of a contract.  Since 1 January 2022, the rate for inflation has decreased and it must now be above 15%, but contractors still cannot claim for 24 months.  The witnesses are from the line Department with responsibility for the funding of road and transport projects.</p><p>With inflation rampant and with the cost of fuels, are the contracts causing the Department concern?  While TII did not do this lightly, it came to this committee with a very strong message that there is a serious problem with the way contracts have been awarded historically and it worries that more firms will not be able to function.  My understanding is there are four main civil building contractors in the Irish market at the moment, and many of them, like Roadbridge, have gone.</p><p> The question is how important the national development plan is for the Department of Transport on the roads side.  Is what is happening at the moment causing the Department serious concern?  Is the Department having active discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure public service contracts can be amended and are flexible to deal with external factors like the Ukraine war and other issues, given there was rampant inflation prior to that?  Is that causing the Department concern?  That is why we are here today.</p></speech>

It is a rapidly evolving situation and we are actively engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter.</p></speech>

The 15% sounds great but they cannot put in a claim for 24 months.  If someone has a contract and was up and running before 1 January, they cannot put in a claim until they are above 50% inflation and they cannot do that for 30 months.  As a layman and as an accountant, that appears to me to be unworkable in the current climate.  I do not want to see the national development plan going down because we have a contract that is a straitjacket for contractors in the current environment.  It might have worked in a low inflation environment but, in the current environment, I have serious concerns that we are about to get into a situation where there will be a car crash with the national development plan.  As a committee Chair and as a Deputy for Limerick city and Munster, I cannot allow that to go unnoticed.  We want to see urgency in this regard.  Is the Department looking for the current public works contract to be amended?</p></speech>

We have relayed those concerns and we are engaging actively with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on it.  As I said, ultimately, national procurement policy is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

As a committee, we will not allow that to happen.  This public works contract is too serious.  I am not certain of the full details on Roadbridge but, from what we hear, the sector is under serious strain with regard to the contracts.</p> <p>  A March 2022 statistic from the Civil Engineering Contractors Association has caused me serious alarm.  Respondents were asked if they had ever submitted a bid price for a public tender at or below cost.  The results showed that 56% of the respondents - the contractors - have submitted at or below cost.  The main reason they have submitted under these conditions are business continuity, lack of a future pipeline and chasing cash flow - chasing the dragon - and I think many of them have been doing that.  When Covid came, they were not able to maintain cash flow because contracts stopped and they could not physically get the money in and, eventually, that was going to catch up with them.  In addition, due to deficiencies in the contract documentation, there was a lack of opportunity during tendering to engage with clients for clarification.</p> <p>  If they started prior to 1 January, they have to wait for 30 months to be able to engage with TII and they must have above 50% inflation.  Since 1 January, it is 15% but they cannot engage with the Department for 24 months, or two years into the contract.  That means the contracts themselves may not be sustainable, and I have to question whether they are or whether they can ensure success on the framework tender.  We are getting that all of the time from the contractors.  There are four main Irish contractors left.  I do not want a situation where, in a short time, we may have no Irish contractors able to bid for roads projects.  That is the critical thing for me.  They are providing huge employment.  There has to be realism between the Department of Transport and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If the current framework is going to have a consequence of making these firms insolvent, we have a problem.</p> <p>  With regard to the Coonagh to Knockalisheen road in Limerick city, we spent months arguing with the Minister for Transport.  If it had been allowed to go ahead the way it should have, it would probably be built by now.  It is 30% complete and is idle for the people of Moyross and the north side of the city.  It will have to go out to re-tender, and the company that was building it was Roadbridge.  This is very serious.</p> <p>  I call Senator Buttimer to conclude.</p></speech>

I am passionate on this.  I am an accountant by training.  The figures do not add up at the moment on the public works contract, particularly for major roads projects.  It does not add up.  Deputy Cathal Crowe will be aware that, with the situation of Roadbridge locally, we have had to re-tender.</p></speech>

I apologise as I had a number of other engagements that meant I was late.  I think I have got a significant understanding of how the interaction has gone and I could probably guess some of that on the basis of Ms Brogan&rsquo;s opening statement.  In fairness, the Chairman has stated the difficulties that were put clearly in front of us, especially by TII, in regard to public works contracts, and I am not going to rehash that as it is obviously a system that will not work.  It is a fact we have not got to the point of having a system that is fit for purpose to deliver the national development plan at this time.</p> <p>  One of the questions I want to put concerns the fact this is not the first time the State will have entered into contracts during inflationary periods and, therefore, I am not sure any of us understand the inability to get a fit-for-purpose system in play.  I am guessing from what Ms Brogan said previously the Department is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to the contracting system and, at the same time, it is interacting with other stakeholders, be they contractors, the industry or whoever else.  I would like Ms Brogan to go into some detail in that regard, but if she is not going to, she is not going to, and there is no point rehashing that and going over old ground.</p> <p>  On another issue, we had the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and others before the committee and they spoke about planning.  We know the Attorney General is doing a piece of work in that regard because there are obvious difficulties with our planning system.  On some of that, there is tinkering, for want of a better term, and maybe major tinkering needs to be done.  However, beyond that, it is a fact we need to resource certain areas, whether the judicial system, An Bord Plean&aacute;la or otherwise.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has used the term that it is almost the survival of the fittest in regard to planning applications.  While we need due diligence done, for the companies that are contracting, one of the issues is that it can be two years down the line.</p><p>There is always a danger with a fixed contract but in an inflationary period such as this people just could not enter one unless there was a huge allowance.  We have had contracts such as this before.  What is the hold-up?  I would like as much detail as possible on the Department's interaction.  I would also like wider information on planning, particularly the Department's interaction with the Attorney General and whoever else is looking at the anomalies and difficulties that exist.</p></speech>

We have also had feedback from the local authority system.  We are acutely aware of the difficulties.  Different types of difficulties are emerging.  We are engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this.  I cannot really go much further than this at the moment.</p></speech>

I understand it is being actively considered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the level of engagement we have had.  We are engaged with TII.  We have also had some engagement with the industry.  I will ask Mr. Mullaney to detail some of these engagements and what we are hearing about pressures in contracts.</p></speech>

It represents the smaller contractors that do paving works throughout the country.  It has put forward suggestions.  Bitumen is a petroleum-based product.  It is greatly affected by the cost of a barrel of oil.  It has put forward suggestions which we have forwarded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is due to get back to us.</p> <p>  The contract system has been in place since 2006.  It probably has not been tested by inflation.</p></speech>

This was very much the motivation.  The Government has options.  It could look at support for the industry through an <i>ex gratia </i>payment.  It could look at changing the contract itself.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution for the contracts themselves.  There are the smaller contractors I have spoken about.  At present there are six different forms of contract.  Four of them are for projects greater than &euro;5 million.  A fifth is for projects between &euro;500,000 and &euro;5 million.  The other is for projects of less than &euro;500,000.  They all have slightly different arrangements.</p></speech>

We have certainly spoken to them.  As Ms Brogan said, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will have to come to a conclusion.  It may look at alternative forms of contract or it may look at adjusting this form of contract with regard to the inflation clause.  This is an option.  To introduce a completely new form of contract takes time.  There would be a lead-in period . It might not be fast enough to deal with the current crisis.  It is very much-----</p></speech>

Inflation was provided for and it allowed contractors to get increases.  What the Chair quoted is correct.  The old contracts covered inflation greater than 50% and contractors had to wait 30 months.  In the new contracts it has changed to inflation greater than 15% with a 24-month wait.  In fairness to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it introduced another measure at the same time.  There is an applicability factor that allows the consumer price index to be applied from the time the tender is sent in to the time the contract is awarded.  This is a saving grace.  If it increases people do get the benefit of it.</p></speech>

Many of the contractors are chasing cash flow to survive.  That is what people do.  In many cases even if they are not making a profit they can survive for a period.  It is called "liquidity".  In essence, they are probably insolvent.  At the same time, they cannot make claims for inflationary rents.  The bulk are existing contracts and this means the companies cannot make claims until inflation is above 50%, which it is at present, but they still have to meet the 30-month time limit.  It is impractical.  The new contracts cover 15% inflation but the companies have to wait two years.  For a claim made on 1 January 2022 a company will be waiting until at least 1 January 2024.  The bottom line is that many of them will have gone under before then.  People are working, paying people wages, paying suppliers and paying for diesel and materials.  Creditors will not wait 24 or 30 months to be paid.  They want to be paid tomorrow.  If they are not paid tomorrow, they will not supply the materials.  If they do not supply the materials, the roads cannot be built.  It is the basic commerce of how to build a road.  I am worried that if the changes are not made quickly we are in danger.  I do not want another Roadbridge.  The quality of its work was second to none.  Apart from the roads it constructed, it was a huge employer.  There has to be a sense of realism about what is happening.  There needs to be a sense of urgency in reacting to it now.  We are in a wartime situation.  Roads and the national development plan are fundamental to how the Government reacts.</p></speech>

I apologise as today is exceptionally busy and there have been many overlapping meetings.  I read the opening statement and I have followed most of the debate from my office.  I want to pick up from where Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; left off.  The planning process for roads is very frustrating.  In Dublin city there is a professional planning objection company, namely, The Swans and the Snails Limited.</p><p>It has held up some really key projects in County Clare.  It is amoral that an objector can be so far removed from the good and the bad of a project that the objector would see fit to object to something.  I would never in a month of Sundays think it would be appropriate for me to object to a proposal on the opposite side of the country.  The Department is participating in interdepartmental negotiations.  Has the issue of vexatious and distant objections arisen?  Does the Department propose to place a cap or restriction on who can object, where they should live and how approximate they should be to a project so that projects are not vexatiously and unnecessarily held up? </p></speech>

We heard at the presentation, and it was news to all of us and many of us were floored by the revelation, that the Minister for Transport has used a ministerial order to pull the entire phase 2 of the Limerick northern distributor road because he does not believe it should happen, which he said in this room a few weeks ago.  I do not expect Mr. Mullaney to have all of the answers.</p> <p>  Phase 1 is happening from Coonagh, County Limerick to Knockalisheen and Meelick, which is where I am from.  I will speak about Roadbridge in a minute.  There is a roundabout in Meelick where a distributor road begins and ends but there is no sign of anything more happening.  The Minister wants the distributor road to stop at a roundabout and then go on to minor rural roads so the road is going nowhere.</p> <p>  Yesterday, I made this point during the presentation.  I am sure that some people present have watched an old cartoon character called Wile E. Coyote and there was always a road on the edge of town that he would run on but then drop off because the road was unfinished.  That is how the Minister wants to leave the Limerick northern distributor road.  I will be honest and say that many people in my community continue to have major grievances with how the road is being routed and with such details but all of that should be dealt with in the planning and design domains.  It should not be possible for the Minister to take a samurai sword to a project and declare that it will not happen in his lifetime, in this Government's lifetime and will not happen between now and 2040.  I will not ask Mr. Mullaney my curveball question and do not expect a response from him.  Like everyone in public life, I believe that if a project is done on a phased basis that delivers phase 1 and moves on to the next phase but slow as the process might be people would at least go through the statutory phases and not use a guillotine.</p> <p>  I will mention the Roadbridge issue and acknowledge that the officials cannot comment specifically on the matter.  I will talk in specifics and hope they can talk in general.  There are 600 employees in counties Clare and Limerick, which I am sure that the Chairman mentioned a few moments ago.  I have met some of the employees and know that &euro;40 million is owed to subcontractors.  At least employees have a structure and can approach the Department of Social Welfare to avail of safety nets, although that is not an ideal situation by any stretch of the imagination.  There is nothing for subcontractors and some of them have removed their machinery from the site so they can retain assets of some value and do not see their financial livelihood crumble.</p></speech>

It is very important that this committee speaks on behalf the workers today.  It is also very important that we should speak about how these contracts are constructed.  I was told by an employee of one of these large contractors that if they remained on a contract that the fuel burn of heavy machinery on the road would cost &euro;5 million more than the tender price, which is unsustainable.  Today, we will talk about materials, steel and aggregates but the fuel alone to fulfil a major project could cost an additional &euro;5 million.</p> <p>  One stretch of this project is located in the vicinity the Country Club Bar in Caherdavin, which is located on the border of counties Clare and Limerick, and it has traffic cones and a little battery operated traffic lights system.  For the life of me and the people who live there we cannot imagine that another contractor will commence work in the next few months and we do not know what is happening. </p></speech>

The project followed on from the Limerick regeneration plan and it was very much in that context that the scheme was funded.  It is only in recent times that we have received documentation where the scheme was then being referred to as the northern distributor road phase 1.  It was never presented to us originally in that format.</p> <p>  In terms of the contract and what is happening, they are in fact going to do some emergency works, in particular on the bridge over the railway and certain other emergency works, which they hope to do very quickly.  At the moment it will probably be a negotiated tender.  I mean that they will go to a small number of tenders to do this and it is not the rest of the job by any means.  As they prepare plans they must measure what is there and create a new contract for the rest.</p></speech>

Over the years we attended similar briefings, as Oireachtas representatives and councillors, and I never ever heard the Limerick northern distributor road be treated as just being a discrete infrastructure project from Coonagh to Knockalisheen.  It was always a bandit corridor that brought one north to the city through south-east Clare and was to be done in phases.  I do not what parlance that the Minister has introduced but certainly in the region and locality the project was always to be done in phases.  It may not have been to everyone's taste or liking but there were processes to deal with route design and all the other issues that people had and now it appears that the project has been guillotined by the Minister, which is wrong.  I do not know whether he will be in public life in 2040 but the people around the area will need certainty regarding infrastructure and by his action this scheme has been pulled from them overnight.</p></speech>

Even though he is not a member of this committee I will allow him to ask a question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1835" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022042700002#K02100"><p>I appreciate that as I know other committee members wish to contribute.  I have watched the discussion of the public works contract on screen.  From a roads, transportation and civil engineering point of view, and as I was a quantity surveyor who worked in the industry and lectured on procurement, I have received a lot of feedback that the civil engineering contractors in this country are turning their backs on us because they can go to England and get a fair new engineering contract, NEC, as the risks are shared and there is a greater opportunity to have a viable proposition.  I do not know how the Department is getting on with tenders at the moment.</p><p>Does the Department have any works out for tender at the moment?  My understanding is that building contractors and civil engineering contractors are refusing to price contracts because they cannot price the risk.</p><p> I have a very simple question for the officials.  Earlier the Chairman and others asked how we fix the problem with public works contracts.  I suggest this problem can be fixed by one simple amendment to the existing public works contracts.  The amendment can be put in because it can be agreed between both parties.  Therefore, if the contracting authorities and the contractors agree to insert a price variation clause in the contract, it will solve this problem not forever but until we get to more stable ground again.</p><p> There are two aspects to the public works contracts.  We have the existing contracts, which are assigned and people are in a quandary.  Some contractors are recklessly trading at the moment because they are trading at a loss and they know it.  I understood that the Office of Government Procurement and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had issued a direction on how to deal with variations for other contracts that have been tendered.  As late as three days ago, a contracting authority's quantity surveyors looked for clarification from the builder as to where this direction has come from because they do not have sight of it.  Did the Department of Transport get any direction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding contracts that are tendered for but not yet signed?  What model is being used to deal with variations?  Did the officials get any direction on that?</p><p> The Chairman spoke about the road between Limerick and Cork.  The outer city bypass for Galway is in a quandary because of planning and other issues, and it has now been referred to Europe.  As far as I am concerned, we have spent millions of euro doing nothing on that.</p><p> There was talk earlier about phases.  This issue will be close to Deputy Crowe's heart.  Phase 1 of the western rail corridor was done; phases 2 and 3 were never done.  Appraisals are now being done on them again.  More money has been spent on appraisals than on doing work.</p></speech>

TII and all other relevant parties would have also got it.  Obviously, if we had had any contracts in that situation, we would have checked them for it.  The point was it was to apply to contracts that were being put in place from 18 January.  It does not apply retrospectively.  In the Deputy's second part, he suggested that if there was an agreed clause, then something similar or a variation of it could apply.</p></speech>

I accept that 15% is fine, but we need to wait 24 months before it can be used.  Within that 24 months, the contractors probably will not tender because they think the risk is too high.  The ones who already have it are caught in an inflationary spiral affecting their cash flow.  If they are prior to 1 January, they have to have a 50% increase in inflation and they have to wait 30 months.  The problem is that the system is not keeping pace with the changes in the external business environment for these contractors.  Mr. Mullaney is confirming to Deputy Canney that it has been in place since 18 January.  The Deputy has obviously had contact with contractors and contracting authorities who have not been informed of this change.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We need to see some form of flexibility in the existing public works contracts that takes account of the external inflationary pressures through no fault of the contractors.  We will come back to the officials on it.  Representatives of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, will be appearing before the committee.  We will be contacting the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform directly to ask representatives of the Office of Government Procurement to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Brogan, Mr. Ebrill and Mr. Mullaney from the Department of Transport for assisting the committee today.

I am accompanied by my colleague Mr. Paul Sheridan, who is the director of main contracting.</p> <p>  This is what we are really talking about.  The issues we are highlighting represent the difference between an industry functioning efficiently and one becoming logjammed.  It is the difference between public projects being delivered in line with Government expectations or one where many contractors are unable to tender due to price volatility.  The CIF has been warning about the issues around the public works contracts for quite some time, and the problems we are talking about today are not new.  What is new is how those problems are now manifesting.</p> <p>  The level of hyperinflation that has seen construction material costs skyrocket in recent weeks has made clear to everyone the scale of the flaws that have been built into the public works contracts.  The situation in Ukraine may be what has brought these matters into focus but there is no doubt the current system has long been unable to manage the impact of inflation, supply chain disruption and other industry-recognised risks.  This was obvious to anyone following the industry on the back of Brexit and the pandemic.  It should not have taken the impact of a war for badly needed reforms to take place.</p> <p>  Pricing inflation is one of the most challenging risks impacting contractors.  There is an unwarranted assumption that contractors are better placed to manage this form of uncapped risk - and it is effectively uncapped - for the duration of the project due to their relationships with suppliers.  Unfortunately, that is just not credible.  No contractor in the world is able to avoid price rises when we are witnessing hyperinflation of this scale.  For example, in recent weeks we have seen the price of rolled steel rising by 66%; a 50% jump in rebar prices, going from &euro;900 per tonne to &euro;1,350; cables comprising mainly copper up by 31% to &euro;8,642 per tonne; and delivery times being doubled for air conditioning units, electronic controls and lighting equipment.</p> <p>  These examples are just the tip of the iceberg.  The reality is most construction materials are now seeing significant jumps in price, and that is why is it so concerning that public clients often approach risk management by transferring as much of that risk as possible to contractors and the supply chain.  Driven by a lack of technical understanding, this leads to plans that fail to forecast the full nature of risks, and that will have a material impact on a project's time and cost.  It is not just the industry that can see these problems.  The Government and the Office for Government Procurement recognise the issues and have committed to reform.</p> <p>  Interestingly, in 2019 the Office for Government Procurement stated that, under the public works contract, risk transfer is not operating satisfactorily because the market is not pricing risk and formal dispute mechanisms were being triggered early arising from the notification requirements built into the contract.  It also indicated there is a poor definition of works requirements due to the poorly resourced design teams.  These flaws have been affecting the industry and the delivery of public projects for quite some time.  Not only is the flaw built into the process but public clients are taking full advantage of these weaknesses.  The transactional operating model they have adopted drives price assumptions and the allocation of risk before contractors and the supply chain even get involved.  That means public works contracts present open-ended risk to the contractor, which they have no ability to measure and cost thanks to a competitive lowest tender process.</p> <p>  It is well documented that margins in the construction industry are tight.  As the committee has seen in our supplementary materials, the CIF recently commissioned a report on public tendering practices and their impact on delivering value.  That report, conducted by Idiro Analytics, found that the average margin for public contracts was 3.8%.  When materials costs are soaring at the rates we have already outlined, that margin does not stand a chance.  The CIF believes allocating and managing risk is one of the biggest contributing factors that prevents firms from making the sustainable margins needed to invest in their businesses and the wider sector.  Poor risk allocation between clients and contractors prevents construction projects from being procured and delivered successfully.</p> <p>  When challenges arise in public projects, this means the commercial agreements leave little room or budget for putting things right.  These challenges are further exacerbated by the focus public procurers in Ireland place on the lowest price tenders.  That outlook means risk does not get adequately priced.  The simple solution here is for more emphasis to be placed on quality in the award of tenders, backed by the use of quality and price ratios.</p> <p>  If Ireland adopted international standard forms of contract, such as the new engineering contract, NEC, or the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, FIDIC, contract, all these issues could be addressed.  These contracts are built to encourage collaboration and the equitable allocation of price variation risk.  Contracts of this nature make more sense for the Government, the industry and the taxpayer.  By capping the level of risk applied to contractors, it enhances project outcomes, avoids delays or disputes and delivers better value for the taxpayer.  Implementing such a system will also help kick the habit of squeezing costs to save money in the short term.  More intelligent procurement, putting contractors on a stable footing and unlocking investment throughout the supply chain will speed up the transformation of the industry that business, government and the public wants to see.  These outcomes are diametrically contrasted to the scenarios delivered through the current public works contracts in Ireland.  As an illustration of how out of step we are with international standards, it is worth noting that international contractors will not price work in Ireland based on the public works contracts.</p> <p>  Better risk management will lead to many more projects being delivered on time and to budget, creating fewer disagreements ending in legal action and greater trust between businesses.  It is the industry&rsquo;s view that this reform process represents a badly needed opportunity.  For that opportunity to be grasped, significant changes will need to be made to the public works contracts.  Specifically, we believe the contracts and process should be changed to adopt the more modern, flexible approach contained in the NEC or FIDIC contracts, promote early and continuing engagement and a collaborative environment between clients and contractors, and provide a clear and complete project description where risks are identified and explained.  The process should also minimise the use of price-only criteria and encourage accurate, fair and clear use of multi-criteria awards.  We should promote multistage procurement processes and identify and penalise below-cost bidding or abnormally low tenders.</p> <p>  Until these changes are implemented, the current public works contracts will continue to create an adversarial environment that is prejudicial to good project management and wasteful of taxpayers' money.  Nobody is happy with the current system and this is the Government's chance to create one that really works.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I do not know if they watched the earlier proceedings, when we spoke with departmental officials.  What we as a committee tried to impress upon them was a degree of urgency with the matter, and we have some work to do with other Departments.</p> <p>  Representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland met the committee before Easter and they pointed to a number of issues as they saw it.  It was helpful for us to hear them.  They spoke about the need to align stakeholders and address planning and regulation.  They spoke from the perspective of delivering projects.  The main question they raised was the need to address fundamental problems with public contracts.</p> <p>  I will ask a couple of questions and I am sure others will pick up along the same theme.  How are these problems manifesting with projects that are ongoing and what impact will be seen for projects in the pipeline?  What does the Government, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and senior Ministers, need to do to straighten this out?</p><p>Within that ask, what are the most urgent things they can do?</p></speech>

Mr. Sheridan has a path worn to the Office of Government Procurement.  There is good engagement.  The Minister acknowledged that there is a serious problem and asked the Office of Government Procurement to bring forward some options.  I spoke with the Secretary General with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform this week.  He said there would be a further meeting with the Minister this week and the Department hoped to bring forward some proposals.  He spoke about how complicated and politically sensitive an issue this is.  I appreciate that is the situation.</p> <p>  However, contractors who signed up to a project based on prices 18 months ago have much bigger problems.  A couple of large well-known firms have gone out of business.  A number of large UK firms that were operating here, such as Balfour Beatty, have left the country mainly because of public works contracts.</p></speech>

One of the companies that went out of business had signed a contract for a substantial road project, but had not begun it.  I understand that the increase in the price of diesel was a factor.  Large excavators that are used to haul a lot of stuff out and in use a lot of diesel  The increase in the price of diesel over the past three or four months has caused a 10% increase in the overall cost of a contract.  That situation is untenable.</p> <p>  The report we commissioned shows that contractors are only putting about 2.2% aside for risk.  Clearly, if people are taking on an inflation rate of 15% or 20%, they are losing a lot of money.  Businesses could very well go broke if their cash flow runs out.  Other business may decide that a project is no longer tenable.  People have a responsibility to not trade recklessly and may decide to cease working on a contract.  We know from past experience-----</p></speech>

I understand the number of companies has reduced from 138 to 77.  The type of contractors that would be in a position to deliver on some of the major infrastructural projects associated with transport in the NDP is decreasing.  They are also in an internationalised market.  Other clients in the UK and Europe are more competitive in the terms and conditions of their contracts, like the NEC.  Therefore, they are looking at an open-ended risk on the Irish public works contracts and deciding that they will not tender.  What is exacerbating the situation is, as Mr. Parlon said, the inflation risk.  It is too difficult to go into a fixed-price contract.  We are seeing a thinning out of the industry, unfortunately.</p></speech>

It was difficult to read between the lines.  They have a line they need to hold.  I got no sense that a duck was paddling under the water and there was a level of urgency regarding this.  They spoke about ongoing assessments and engagement.  I ask the witnesses to give us a sense of the type of risk that is at stake here, in terms of a timeline within which something needs to move.  Does this involve months or years?</p></speech>

All of the work has been done.  Recommendations have been made.  There will, of course, be implications in terms of making a change.  The Minister is on the record as saying that about &euro;12 billion is available for the expenditure on the NDP this year.  We did not spend the full amount last year or the previous year for different reasons.  He has said we cannot go beyond that and the industry is not expecting him to.</p> <p>  Given the current level of inflation, we will get less bang for our buck.  Projects will cost more.  At the moment, the Government has said that contractors, which are largely individual family firms, signed contracts and it is tough luck as they have to deliver.</p></speech>

A price variation clause is normal.  In every other jurisdiction there is a price variation clause.  For some reason, which I think was political at the time, it was decided that all future contracts would be a fixed-price lump sum and prices would no longer go through the roof.  We then of course had periods of very low inflation, a recession and all of that.  This is an extraordinary time.  The fact that we have extraordinary inflation and no capacity does not make sense.</p></speech>

We all know that events can happen.  We want a contract that can react to that in a collaborative way.  The idea of risk mechanisms is to protect the contractor's business and the project, as well as to deliver value for the client.  The NEC-type contracts handle risk in a much better and fairer way.  In such a system we collaborate more, manage it better and the client only pays for what is actually delivered.  It takes competitive tendering on risk out of the process.</p></speech>

We thought some amendments to existing forms of GDLA would have done the job and allowed the industry to continue.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.</p> <p>  Looking at the last four years, we have to acknowledge that Brexit, Covid and everything have impacted on the ability of the OGP to deliver on what it has set out to do. Why would the Government want to reinvent a unique contract when there are standard international forms that will allow it to attract international companies?  If we want to deliver a metro or anything like that, we have to bring in this expensive equipment that international contractors use and our local contractors generally do not.  They go into joint venture, then they come in and help deliver that.  Unfortunately, Article 4 of the current public works contract, which any layperson can read, states you are responsible for everything, whether foreseen or unforeseen, excluding your price.  Your are supposed to get a price for that in six weeks.</p></speech>

Well, I am not happy.  I go back to my earlier conversation piece about the documentation we got today and Mr. Sheridan's remarks about the CIF members.  The decline in the Civil Engineering Contractors Association membership, the tendering process and the number who are not tendering, and the development of contractors disproportionately increasing their turnover in foreign markets is all worrying.  As I said, it is a perfect storm.  The construction sector, to be fair to it, has been hit with multiple belts, and that is something we must examine.  I hope there will be proactive engagement on the part of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which should be Minister-led because the line Minister is the person in charge, as opposed to passing the matter from A to B to C.  I hope that, as a result of today's meeting, we will have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in before the committee.  I thank Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Parlon for being here.</p></speech>

I come from a construction background.  The history of the public works contracts we have, for the benefit of the committee, is that they were introduced in 2007.  Negotiations had been ongoing at the time, but the then Minister for Finance guillotined the whole process and brought in these contracts and forced them onto the industry.  For the first seven or eight years the risk was masked by a recession.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.1960" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022042700002#Q03000"><p>And no inflation.  Basically, contractors were not pricing the risk.  Then, however, as inflation began to take off a little, they were able to gauge and to price the risk.  What has happened in the past six months, however, is such that nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, never mind next week or in 30 months' time.  That is where we are.  As I said earlier, the contracts were brought in at a time when the Dublin Port tunnel was being built and there were rumours that it was going over budget, it was going to collapse, water was coming into it and it would never be finished.  There was a knee-jerk reaction to change the contracts.  I think Mr. Sheridan said the GDLA form of contract was fine, although it needed to be tweaked a bit at that time.</p> <p>  Another thing that is missing from this whole process is that there is an onus on the building contractor whose balance sheet has been affected to provide a contract guarantee bond for every contract it goes onto.  That is based on the strength of its balance sheet, so an insurance company will not take it on unless it does that.  We are cutting ourselves off at the pass before we get there.  That is a very important aspect to this as well.</p> <p>  When I talk about the construction industry, I am talking about the guy who is building a house or a house extension, not the big guys.  I am talking about the guys who have to go home in the evening and worry whether they will have money at the end of the week to pay the wages or whether that money will pay for the bit of plant they have at the end of the month.  They might have a load-all or whatever else.  These guys are getting caught the same as the big guys in proportion.</p> <p>  I know of a guy who is building a house at the moment and who has the Polycor stone on it.  It is a two-storey house.  He has blockwork going from there.  He is already &euro;20,000 over budget on the project and has not got to the finishing stages of it at all yet.  Because it is a private house, he will have to talk to the client and they will negotiate how they will deal with that.  The private sector is functional in that there is an open book when it comes to this.  The client will sit down and look at specifications, savings and whatever else to make the project work, and that will help everybody.</p> <p>  What is wrong here is that we have been caught out by what has happened between Covid, Ukraine and the hyperinflation we have seen.  I have been talking to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, about this and I know he is consulting with all the various Departments, but my biggest worry about this is that, as far as I understand, the Office of Public Works cannot now compete in respect of the tender for works.  It cannot get contractors to tender for works because they will not tender in this market as they would be tendering blind.  The words "reckless trading" were used, and that is exactly what this is.  People will be recklessly trading if they continue the way they are.</p> <p>  I have a very simple solution in respect of both the existing contracts - and Mr. Sheridan can correct me if I am wrong here - and the contracts that have been tendered for but not signed.  It is very simple to amend these contracts to include a clause for price variation with a mechanism within that as to how that is dealt with.  It could be written out in half a day.  If the price comes down, the client benefits; if the price goes up, the client will pay in proportion.  That is how the NEC and FIDIC operate.  That would be for the emergency situation we have now.  Any clause can be inserted into a contract when there is an agreement between the contracting authority and the contractor.  A clause can be put into the contract to do that.  I think I am right on that.  Basically, the immediate emergency and the crisis we have now can be resolved very quickly.  There will be a cost to it, but what will the cost be if we do not do something about it?  This is where we will find that civil engineering contractors will turn their backs on Ireland and bring their plant over to England, where they can get work and have peace of mind knowing they will get a fair deal.  Right now we have stagnation because I think contractors are holding back on progressing works, even on site, because they cannot get the materials, because of the cost of it or whatever else.  Looking at the presentation the CIF made, in particular on the margins at which contractors are working, they are working at very thin margins, and to achieve those margins they have to work hard.  Since the public works contracts came in, I would describe them as having developed a war zone within the construction industry, where the clients' representatives are in a battle with the contractors from start to finish.</p><p>What is not known is how much money has been spent by contractors and contracting authorities on buying in expertise in arbitration, conciliation, claims and all those types of things.  That has to be paid for by somebody.  We have to come back from this and try to get a more collaborative approach.  That is what these contracts do.</p><p> I am making a statement rather than asking questions because I have been speaking to our guests.   My last point is that the small contractor building a one-off council house is as important to me as the big-----</p></speech>

It is what I did when I got married.  I refer to the national development plan in the context of not having contractors who are eager to price the work.  It always comes back to price.  There is another mechanism for dealing with tenders in the context of the lowest price, namely, the most economically advantageous tender.  That should be developed better to allow for account to be taken of previous work, performance, experience and all that.  As Mr. Parlon stated, you play the game and win it but you might not be selected on the team for the next game because your price is not right.  That is a frustration for contractors who are trying to do things right and well.  I fear that when there are tight margins and people are trying to save money, safety could be forfeited to try to save a business.  That is the last thing we want to happen in the construction industry.</p></speech>

On some level, this issue has already been addressed.  It was stated that there are two things we are dealing with, that is, the present running of contracts and the need for amendments.  From what our guests are saying, it does not seem that there is a major difficulty there.  Where two people are obviously in agreement and it is legally put together, then so be it.  What they are talking about, however, is what seems to be best practice internationally, namely, FIDIC and NEC contracts.</p><p>In fairness, TII had made a major play in regard to it.  I am going to ask about one specific point.  Price aside, what it had spoken about was the necessity or usefulness.  I believe it was outlined that, with FIDIC, one would sit down with a contractor very early to get into the ins and outs of the contracts and identify whether obstacles might appear.  It gave a couple of examples of being able to deal with issues and getting them off the table.  That would be necessary and deal with the issue in part.  We all accept there needs to be a genuinely significant provision, not just regarding the lowest cost.  Whether to deal with the issue of variable costs must be considered, but the ability to deliver is important because what is happening is absolutely ridiculous.  Some of the disaster situations have arisen because of contracts based on the lowest tender price.  What has happened afterwards has happened, and prices have definitely not stayed at the levels at the time of tender.</p><p> Reference has been made to coming up with a solution in around a month.  The CIF has said it has discussed this many times with those concerned and all the rest of it.  Is the hold-up fair enough, or is it something that could be moved on faster?</p></speech>

We outlined solutions and what we believed would work.  We repeated them in February in another letter, and we met the Minister.  We believe there are mechanisms and do not believe it could take so long to introduce them.  Unfortunately, policy development and cash flow do not mix.  What is happening is that it is taking time to decide on the policy we want to implement.  We can understand the need to protect the taxpayer and industry and create a sense of fairness, but it is now critical to have a sense of urgency.</p></speech>

The industry is not looking for a 100% recovery.  Those concerned would normally have considered risk around this in their contracts.  What they are looking for is a mechanism to recover some of the costs and share the burden.  Everybody has to be realistic here; nobody saw the risks.  The State, as an employer, never saw the risks coming.  That is the reason for mechanisms and contracts allowing people to sit down, collaborate and reduce the cost of any fixes, but that cannot be done at the moment because the contract does not allow it.  It tends to drive the recovery of costs into a dispute mechanism, which is what Deputy Canney was referring to, and suddenly one is into conciliators, arbitrators and lawyers.  Unfortunately, the public works contract has a clause that denies the right of the contractor to take any specific issue directly to the courts or draw on court jurisprudence.  We do not actually have a legal opinion on any of the contracts, which is not the case with NEC and FIDIC contracts, regarding which international law underpins what is said.</p></speech>

The longer this goes on, the worse the situation will be.  The reason we are having this conversation is that we want projects to be delivered.  We all accept we are in a different space owing to inflation, and we all know the reasons for it.  I accept that some of the issues were masked previously because we basically had zero inflation for a considerable period.  Sometimes the State can regard obstacles as greater than they are.  What sorts of contracts did we have previously?  This State, like every other, has had a history of high inflation.  That was taken into account.  I assume it was on the basis of separating materials from the actual works done and the percentage built in, but-----</p></speech>

The two of them were got rid of.  They contained mechanisms to allow a contractor and employer to sit down and figure out or negotiate a solution first.  Unfortunately, notification and follow-up are now required within a certain period.  The contractor is told it must state when it thinks there is going to be a problem.  It has to.  The problem may not materialise but the mechanism creates an attritional model of working rather than one whereby the relevant parties can sit down and state what has actually happened.  Many of the impacts of events on a contract take time to manifest and understand.  There is a timing issue.  The GDLA and other old contracts would have allowed the contracting party to ask for the bills on seeing the full effects.  It could point to its own bills and to what is not right-----</p></speech>

Can the witnesses give a breakdown and elaborate on the best-case scenario in what they are looking at?  There is the NEC and FIDIC.  Which is their preference?  Can they give any specifics regarding what they think would work, percentage-wise and so forth, and some detail on that pre-planning piece, for want of a better term, that seems to happen and that made a considerable amount of sense to me?</p></speech>

Again, it would be very good for attracting new talent into the industry because it would be internationalised.  It would be good for growing out business in the export sector.  That is important.  The formula itself has to be stress tested and we have to see what way it pulls out the numbers.  Right now, the 15% is way too high.  Normally, one would see approximately 2% to 5%, perhaps.</p></speech>

One tenders normally, one prices it and shows the value at which one can deliver that project.  Once that is delivered, one has a budget one works to.  The delivery becomes a target cost, so one tries to deliver it below that.  If it comes in below that, the employer gets the benefit and so does the contractor.  It is split.  It depends on what is put in the contract, but usually it is 50:50.  Then if there is a situation where the contract starts to go above, the client goes through a very strict auditing process.  It is not a case of sitting down and doing a deal.  One has to prove through an auditing process what the final cost is.  What happens then is that there is a split as well, so the State is only paying for the actual cost, it is well managed and it does not have to absorb everything, nor does the contractor.</p></speech>

That will set out the materials and the various things that are needed.  There will also be design specifications, work and drawings.

It is getting more complex with technology.</p></speech>

With regard to fixed-cost tendering, the fact is it can be two years down the line to go through.  I understand that due diligence needs to be done, but the system must be resourced.  We know the Attorney General is carrying out a review.

Planning is a disaster, which is about as good a term one can use in terms of the delays and the different issues.  I came across a couple in the last few days who made a planning application for a house extension.  It is in the country.  They are two professionals and very intensely focused.  They went to the nth degree to have everything right and it was sent back as incomplete.  It was such a pernickety issue, but for them it was their big project.  They have spent their time getting it right and this could add substantial cost.  To my mind, it was a ridiculous reason to call it incomplete.</p> <p>  Regardless of whether a project is big or small, it is the time, the delays and the judicial reviews on top of all that and the uncertainty that goes with it.  When we were walking here we walked past a particular area where there is a big new development.  There are a number of houses being gathered together for development and we were just wondering how long it had taken so far to gather it together and eventually then have to go through the planning process.  There is very little sympathy for developers, but when one tries to put one's feet in their shoes and sees-----</p></speech>

Sometimes the best thing to do is to carry out pre-consultation with communities for bigger projects.  However, the fact is that there is a problem in the system.  There are a large number of people who may be looking at big projects and think they are covering everything from a planning point of view, but they cannot be sure that they can deliver or certainly cannot be sure about the timeline.

The cause of it was an issue that the objector had with a customer of the particular manufacturing project.  He had sufficient power, without having to put any money down, to hold this up and extend it.

I welcome Mr. Parlon and Mr. Sheridan to the meeting.  There were overlapping meetings for me today.  I have been following most of this meeting and have read the CIF's opening statement but I apologise for arriving a little late.</p> <p>  I do not know if our guests watched "The Great House Revival" on television on Sunday night with the architect, Mr. Hugh Wallace.  It is about the renovation of beautiful, old but clapped-out houses.  </p></speech>

The entire series was filmed during Covid.  Basically, a house renovation begins and halfway through the programme, after the ad break, Mr. Wallace says that they ran into trouble because costs spiralled out of all control.  Every week they seem to resolve it because the contractor and the family split the costs.  It resolves itself and then in the second part, the project gets built and completed.  As we were preparing for today's meeting, it struck me that the private individual has a mechanism there, either through a quantity surveyor or directly with the contractor, to resolve issues.  They can agree to split the difference, or whatever, and then on they go.  While some builders have been burned on certain projects, by and large there has been a baseline of decency that has got a lot of people through difficulties.  That mechanism, unfortunately, does not exist in large capital projects where the State is involved.</p> <p>  In its opening statement, the CIF suggested the State consider two different hybrid contract mechanisms, known as FIDIC and NEC, which are accepted internationally.  I have a number of questions on that but I apologise in advance if other members have already put them to our witnesses.  I am interested in the idea of building an inflationary aspect into contracts.  Forgive my ignorance on this but we have all seen what has happened with the national children's hospital.  Does that not become the upper ceiling for a project?  Is there not a risk here for the State and the taxpayer that an inflation mechanism actually becomes the completion cost?  If people believe there is a certain amount of leeway in project costs, does that not become the upper cost in terms of the liability and exposure of the taxpayer?</p></speech>

The idea of an inflationary mechanism is to protect both the client and the contractor because it makes sure that the client is only paying for actual costs through a transparent, simple formula.  That is what it does and it is very different from other events that might happen on a site.  There might, for example, be something wrong with the design or the ground when the contractor finally gets on site and that generates different issues.  On inflation, a simple clause is used to protect the client and deliver the project.  If there is deflation, the client can benefit from that too.  That is what inflationary mechanisms are designed to do.  They provide a way of sitting down, discussing and agreeing something.</p></speech>

I am glad the CIF is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it concerns me that it is has been months since both parties met.  We are talking about big projects at this committee but my main concern is how this is impacting across housing and smaller scale projects throughout the country.  We are not supposed to get into that too much today, however.  When was the CIF's last engagement with the Department and when is its next engagement scheduled?  It seems to be a bit haphazard at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.2076" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Parlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022042700002#U00700"><p>On housing, about 50% of the entire output we are trying to achieve this year is going to be State funded through local authorities, approved housing bodies and so on.  With every one of those contracts, the same issues are arising.  They were fixed-price contracts and they have been exposed to all of the inflationary challenges that are there.  That has to be putting those particular projects in jeopardy.  There is no question about it; they cannot be immune from what is happening.</p> <p>  In terms of the private sector, thankfully for the industry there is a lot of private sector work out there.  There are a lot of big FDI projects and other types of projects.  In those cases the same difficulties arise but, as with the programme to which the Deputy referred, people can sit down and discuss issues.  Contractors can tell the clients they have come up against a problem, that the steel component of the project is costing an extra &euro;1 million, for example, and that they cannot cover it, it was not expected and so on.  The clients might decide they cannot afford to have the project delayed or deferred or to have the contractor walk away.  They will engage two professional quantity surveyors.  Quantity surveying is quite an exact science.  They will agree that the steel price is X amount and that is what they will have to do.  There is scope and flexibility to do that whereas, as Mr. Sheridan said, that flexibility does not exist under public works contracts at the moment.</p></speech>

I am being company-specific here and I know there may be liquidity information to which none of us is privy.  Could one of these more flexible contracts, had it been in place for the northern distributor road in the Limerick-Clare area, have saved Roadbridge from going wallop last month?</p></speech>

Roadbridge employees, who are able to speak freely now having been unshackled from the company, told me that if they had remained on contract, they heard that the fuel burn for the machinery on that project alone could have amounted to &euro;5 million on top of everything else that was priced in.  That is something that has not been mentioned much today but it is very current and the situation in that regard is fluctuating as well.</p></speech>

We all know that to pull in and fill up a car at the pump costs an extra &euro;20 or &euro;30 but filling trucks and diggers that are only doing five miles to the gallon is just frightening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.2084" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022042700002#U01500"><p>It would be no harm for the committee to communicate that to the Department.  It is very important.  This is the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, after all.  We have spoken about fuel costs previously but to hear Mr. Parlon quantify it at up to 10% in the context of projects costing tens of millions of euro is extremely worrying.</p> <p>  A few weeks ago, during questions on promised legislation in the Chamber, I said to the Taoiseach that inflation is a Europe-wide problem, particularly as it relates to building costs.  All of the figures the CIF has produced today on fluctuating prices in steel and aggregates and so on, are similar to those in the UK, France, Spain and across Europe as a whole.  It is not until one gets to Asia that one sees some degree of price stability because the supply chain of materials largely begins over there.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the European bloc of nations was able to sort out the supply chains for vaccines and PPE very successfully.  Does the CIF believe that supply chains could be improved if there was the wherewithal within states, and with multiple states, to get these materials back into the west of Europe and back over to Ireland?  Should there be state interventions?</p></speech>

That tide is pretty powerful and I do not think that either state intervention or EU intervention can hold it back.  The steel plant in Mariupol, where the last of the Ukrainians are holed up, is one of the biggest in the world.  It is a plant of a colossal scale but it will be a long time before it is supplying steel again.  Finding other supply chains now is going to take a lot of time.  I am sure there are other steel manufacturers around the world that are ramping up output and so on but it takes a lot of energy to produce steel as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.2086" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022042700002#U01700"><p>It is worth exploring though.  We did not really understand supply chains until Covid came along.  We have seen how it worked in terms of PPE and vaccines.  Bulgaria will see 60% of its gas shut off today but the European bloc has rallied overnight and secured alternative supplies.  It is not within the gift of this committee, the Irish Government or the Houses of the Oireachtas but the European bloc, when it has wanted to over the past 18 months, has been able to sort out pretty rich supply chains and co-ordinate transport across Europe.</p> <p>  I will conclude by speaking about subcontractors.  A subcontractor in my home county has told me that when the current job he is on is finished he will mothball his machine for a few months because every time he goes on site he is exposed to the financial unknown, which could be crippling.  He reckons he has enough money made and banked to ease off a little bit, have an enjoyable summer, tip around his own farm and get back into contracts in the autumn.  He said it with a smile and he is looking forward to that but I was thinking, if this is going to be the collective attitude, we are in big trouble.  My question on that relates to Roadbridge and the other contractor collapses that probably will happen if nothing else changes.  In those situations, the person who is most exposed is the subcontractor.</p><p>The employee who has been on the payroll has the State and has many safety nets.  They are not ideal, but safety nets come around and if we wrap them up, we support them.  There is nothing for the contractors.  One of our colleagues earlier spoke about a subcontractor who was exposed to the tune of &euro;2 million, which nearly decimated him.  Is there anything in the contracts Mr. Parlon mentioned in his opening statement that caters high up or low down for subcontractors or will they always be scavenging around the contract just trying to take their cut from it?  </p></speech>

A contractor operating as a going concern, has a legal obligation to pay for the work being done within 30 days.  It is set out in legislation.  There is a mechanism to challenge any disruption to that cash flow.  The CIF was very much involved in it and supports it.  That is there to protect the supply side.  Mr. Parlon can comment on this.  If a major contractor has gone out of business, obviously that creates a significant problem for the supply chain which is very difficult to control unless the client steps in and says, "Right that person is gone as a contractual entity.  How can I create some kind of relationship to try to support these subcontractors that are still going concerns but have a major black hole in their balance sheet?"  That is very much down to the client and how they want to resolve it.</p></speech>

We are Deputies.  I constantly go on social media pointing out that this is great.  However, I hear people back home asking whether, although all these projects are being announced, the country has the capacity to build them.  It is one thing for politicians to announce them, but they need to get built.  Given the material and labour costs and with the number of projects coming down the track, which shows great ambition in this country, is the CIF concerned we may not have the workforce to complete it all?  I ask that question in a positive sense.  I hope the answer will not be too negative.  It is important to hear from the horse's mouth today.</p></speech>

The biggest issue for contractors is always having work.  If a contractor has work, how profitable it may be is secondary.  However, if they do not have work, they are in disarray.  There is considerable work available on housing in particular.  The Ukrainian refugee crisis will exacerbate that further.</p></speech>

There is an old saying that you should never let a good crisis go to waste.  Some issues with planning and other chicanery holding up development can be looked at now with a view to speeding it up.</p> <p>  Along with some of our members I have been involved with modular housing.  Construction is evolving all the time.  It has been slow to move along and we are probably behind other sectors in adopting technology.  Offsite production and modern methods of construction are the way to go.  Individuals have made significant investment in modular systems in providing homes, factories, hospitals or even the very sophisticated networks for the IT and pharmaceutical industries.  Instead of 15 electricians working inside the room putting the stuff together, it is being put together in external plants and then brought in.  There is great scope there.</p> <p>  The national development plan is worth &euro;165 billion over ten years.  We have been talking to all the stakeholders.  It is fairly backloaded.  The amount of stuff that is coming out in the next few years is modest enough.  Of course, politicians like to be cutting ribbons and announcing great news.</p></speech>

Their parents are likely to suggest that is well and good but they should try college first.  When he or she comes out of college, they are no longer the hands-on tradesman with the callouses and welts with a lump hammer and a shovel doing the work; they are the foreman or the quantity surveyor.  While it is very important that we have them, we are focusing on the high end of the construction trade without the labouring beneath.</p> <p>  I ask the Chairman to give me latitude for one minute to ask a supplementary question.  I hope the CIF has a position on planning and I would like to hear it.  Some very strategic projects in the mid-west have been held up by objectors in Dublin.  As someone living in Clare, I would never in a month of Sundays see fit to object to something in Dublin or far removed from where I live because it does not impact me.  What is the CIF position on that?  Have its representatives articulated that to the Department?  </p></speech>

Our house builders are sitting on a special working group feeding into that committee.  As I mentioned earlier, while certainly we should not take away the rights of people to object, I hope people who have a vexatious objection without any skin in the game will be curtailed very substantially.  Likewise, people can access the courts through judicial reviews without any expense or any skin in the game and can hold up mega projects.  Unfortunately delays cost builders and developers substantially.</p></speech>

I think he meant it in the best sense when he said we should never waste a crisis.  Obviously, we have a housing crisis and have had it for some time.  We have the particular humanitarian Ukrainian crisis which is also a housing crisis here.  Regarding never wasting a crisis, hopefully this is where we can make up for some of the State's failings.  Mr. Parlon talked about modular housing.  Obviously, the CIF has done considerable due diligence on supply chains and all the rest of it.  What can be done and what can be done faster?  How can we deal with it?  The pandemic showed us the State can do some heavy lifting when it needs to and when the pressure is on.  We are in a crisis situation.  While we are not in the same situation that people in Mariupol are, this needs more time, planning, wartime financing etc.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Parlon might be able to deal with that crisis in the next two minutes.</p></speech>

I know of a particular builder who is familiar with it and who offered to prepare it for occupation <i>pro bono</i>.  It is just one example that we know of.<br/><br/>The Government has put the OPW in charge of modular housing.  The industry can produce over 100 units per week without interfering with other things.  In order to build an extra 10,000 houses for Ukrainian refugees, people would need to be pulled off sites for our national housing.  It is a combination of everything.</p></speech>

Apart from, obviously, the Ukrainian refugees coming in and so forth, what about generally ramping up house building, including affordable housing, for the Irish population?  Where does that stand?

I think I heard our housing director say yesterday that we are on target to build approximately 25,000 houses this year.  If there is no compensation for the extra 10%, 15% or 20% inflation and we are wondering how we are going to get through it, that will certainly-----</p></speech>

Luckily, there is a lot of growth in that capacity and it is off-site construction as well.  The kits can be turned out readily, but then we need brickies because generally the frames are surrounded by a brick wall.  That is probably one of the biggest difficulties.  I was talking last night socially to somebody, who said that he has two guys building a wall for him.  One guy is 69 and the other is 72.  They were the only two guys-----</p></speech>

On that basis, we have great capacity.  We have been given various figures about extra commencements and so on.  Personally, I do not consider 35,000 to be a big challenge.  I think the industry is well fit to do that.</p></speech>

On the other hand, I am told that private projects are being stalled.  Individuals are saying they are not going to do an extension at the moment because they do not know what it is going to cost or because it is going to cost &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 more than expected.  That is allowing the workforce that might have been concentrating on that type of work to get involved in the larger scale housebuilding.  It is a fluid situation but we are well fit to hit the 30,000 target without any big problems.</p></speech>

When the industry sees a pipeline of work coming, no matter what type of work is involved, it will find a way to deliver it but it has to have that visibility.  That is why we need the tracker.  That is why we need to see when projects are going to hit site and to know that money is being put into the design and feasibility studies so that there is a continuous pipeline.  Then there will be investment in attracting people, attracting more talent and so on.</p> <p>  The biggest issue we emphasise with all of our meetings with Government agencies on public works contracts, capacity and the NDP is around the export capacity of our own domestic construction industry and the importance of attracting people to build Irish infrastructure rather than UK infrastructure.  Construction companies will not do that because they are balancing their books and it is too risky here.  A number of our biggest members will not do public works here at all because it destroys their culture.  They do not operate like that and they do business elsewhere.  If the State could get some of those really good guys who are building for the biggest investors and companies across the world back into Ireland, that would solve the capacity issues.</p></speech>

We will be following up with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  This meeting came about because TII was before us just before Easter and rang alarm bells.  TII did not do that lightly because it is not that type of organisation.  This committee had to take on board what TII said and examine it further.  We will now follow up with the Department and the Minister.  I thank Mr. Parlon and Mr. Sheridan for coming before us.  We have broadened our remit somewhat but road projects are vital.  If the witnesses wish to raise any other issues with this committee, they can write to us.  We look forward to further engagement with them.</p></speech>

Mr. Parlon referenced the taxpayer and it is taxpayers' money we are talking about in the context of public works.  We must have a sustainable construction sector.
