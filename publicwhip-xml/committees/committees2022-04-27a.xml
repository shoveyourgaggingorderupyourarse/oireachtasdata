The meeting will follow the usual format.  Mr. Fraser will give an opening statement and then members may ask questions on that opening statement and the subject matter of the meeting.  With regard to privilege, those attending from outside the Leinster House campus should note that their privilege is limited.  Those attending from within have full privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  I ask members to remember that when they are asking questions.  I now ask Mr. Fraser for his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I sent the Chairman a letter last week.  If he would like, I could use that as my opening statement or it can be taken as read.  I leave that up to the Chairman.  I will do whatever he would like.</p></speech>

We normally open with remarks from the witness.  That is common and accepted practice.  If Mr. Fraser would not mind, I ask him to pass some remark on this matter because it has been in the public domain and he will be aware of the issues involved.</p></speech>

My remarks will be along the lines of that letter.  We are talking about the secondment of the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  I had a number of confidential conversations with the CMO about his future plans.  This was in the context of our working relationship during the pandemic.  I naturally have such confidential conversations with colleagues about their personal situations from time to time and, of course, I respect confidentiality in such circumstances.  Towards the end of February, the CMO indicated to me that he was thinking of stepping down from his current role and was considering a possible role in the university sector that could make a continuing contribution to improving public health capacity in Ireland.  He proposed a secondment from the Civil Service to an academic post in a university that would enable him to use his knowledge and experience to help strengthen public health leadership in Ireland and to deepen relationships between the university sector, State agencies and international organisations in the field of public health.  As is common practice in the university sector, he envisaged that some research funding would be made available to support this work.  I was supportive of this proposal as the Covid-19 pandemic clearly illustrated the need for strengthened public health capacity not just here in Ireland, but globally, and I believed that Dr. Holohan could make a significant contribution in that regard.  </p> <p>  I contacted the Secretary General of the Department of Health, who advised me that he was dealing with the matter.  I had no further involvement as the detailed arrangements were a matter for the Department of Health.  The Department of the Taoiseach had no other involvement nor did I discuss the proposal with anyone except the Chief Medical Officer and the Secretary General of the Department of Health until there were media reports about the matter towards the end of March.</p></speech>

As I am sure he is aware, it is very important for the functioning of this committee that senior civil servants such as himself make themselves available and accept our invitations to appear.  I thank him for appearing.  When did Mr. Fraser first become involved in discussions with the CMO about his future work plans?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022042700002#A01300"><p>I had a conversation with him towards the end of the summer of last year.  It was a fairly general conversation and I do not really remember the content other than that he was thinking of moving on.  It was a fairly brief conversation.  In the event, matters did not progress because, of course, we were all focused on dealing with the pandemic, no one more so than the CMO himself.</p></speech>

In fairness, this accords with what Mr. Fraser has said but, in paragraph 20, Mr. Watt says that it was in February of 2022 that the CMO entered into detailed discussions with the third level sector.  He says this followed on from initial discussions he had with the CMO in August 2021 regarding his future work plans, these involving the Secretary General to the Government and himself as Secretary General of the Department of Health.  Is that a fair assessment according to Mr. Fraser's recollection?</p></speech>

If I recall correctly, I had a confidential conversation with the CMO towards the end of the summer last year, but that is a fair enough assessment.</p></speech>

I do not know and that is the truth.  The discussions in February were initiated by the CMO.  I suspect it was him but I could not be sure, to be honest.</p></speech>

It would be unusual for Mr. Fraser to initiate a discussion with the CMO about his future work plans.  Is it fair to say that?</p></speech>

I really do not want to have to get into it.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question other than to say that I think he is aware of the CMO's personal circumstances.</p></speech>

That is why I cannot rule out that I did not, maybe, ask him how he was getting on.  Hence the slight ambiguity in my answer.  I just cannot remember.//</p></speech>

I will now bring you to February 2021.

Does Mr. Fraser agree on that point?</p></speech>

Does Mr. Fraser think it might be better for the post of chair to be established and for other individuals to be able to apply for it as a result of a public advertisement?  If Dr. Holohan got it, nobody would question his credentials or suitability.</p></speech>

It would be an alternative approach and equally valid.  The starting point is that Dr. Holohan wanted to move from his present role but wanted to continue to contribute to public health in Ireland.  That was the background to this particular proposal.</p></speech>

When civil servants reach a position at the top of a Department, they traditionally stay there until retirement.  I know Mr. Fraser's circumstances and the question is not about him.  Is there a position in the country now where we must look to see what to do with very high-level and qualified civil servants if there are only seven-year terms, as there are now?  What posts would they fill afterwards or is there a public issue that must be considered?</p></speech>

We had a position where the default and almost exclusive outcome at the end of someone's term at a high level was to retire but people are now being appointed at a younger age or from outside the public service.  There are term limits and the position is now different.  It is a problem for the public service and the country because it is potentially a significant disincentive to people who want to join the public service.</p></speech>

What should we do as policymakers to ensure there is not such uncertainty about what happens to senior civil servants?  I know Mr. Fraser is going off and we wish him well in his role in London.  I know the case of Dr. Holohan, the CMO, is slightly different but it is an issue that will continue to arise.  Do we need some form of a public policy response to this?</p></speech>

There is a policy and everybody has terms of appointment that govern what happens when the term is up.  It is somewhat imprecise at the level of individuals and what they must do.  Dr. Holohan was doing this and people have to try to find something else to do.  We do not want people in a post forever and that is not good.  Neither do we want to put people in a position where they are disincentivised from serving in senior roles because they cannot plan their career.</p></speech>

It is disappointing that for the first time in as long as I am member of this committee, at well over a decade, we have had to seek compellability because another Secretary General is refusing to attend this committee at this point.  Mr. Fraser is before us, however, and I welcome his comments.</p> <p>  I will go back to a question that has been asked.  In response to Deputy O'Callaghan, Mr. Fraser stated his recollection was that he, the CMO and the Secretary General at the Department of Health, Mr. Robert Watt, did not have a meeting.</p><p>In what form was your conversation with Dr. Holohan at the end of the summer?

I can check my diary but I do not recall the three of us sitting down together.  It could have happened and I will check my diary if it becomes a major point.  I am pretty sure that I had a conversation just between myself and the CMO.  It does not feel like a meeting.  It just sounds like three people is one too many for a conversation like that but I could be wrong.  If you want, I will check my diary but my recollection is that I just met the CMO privately.  I was trying to be supportive to a colleague, to be perfectly frank with you and I think-----</p></speech>

I can understand that at that time and I understand the motivation behind that, in terms of seeing where people are at, but we are just trying to get to the facts.  One of the parties will not come before this committee to answer these questions so we are trying to work on the basis of your recollection.  Would there potentially have been a second meeting, a three-way meeting or would there only have been the initial meeting you had with the CMO?</p></speech>

The pandemic obviously got worse and we all had our focus elsewhere, particularly the CMO.  I do not recall any engagement until February between any of us on this topic.</p></speech>

I am looking at the paragraph and by the way, I apologise in advance if it turns out that I did have a meeting and I just do not remember it.  I am pretty sure I met the CMO and I am quite sure I would have spoken to the Secretary General of the Department of Health, either on the phone or otherwise.  I see him quite a lot.  I just do not think there was a three-cornered meeting.  A three-cornered meeting sounds like a far more formal thing than what I recall.  I think I had a private conversation with the CMO but as I say, I apologise if it turns out that there was a meeting that slipped my mind; so be it.  I do not think that sentence says there was a meeting.  It uses "involved" as the verb and I think involved probably means telephone conversations.</p></speech>

If you are suggesting that what is referred to in Mr. Robert Watt's statement was not a three-way meeting but may have been a telephone conversation that you had with him afterwards, at that time, then that is not referred to in your opening statement and neither is it referred to in Mr. Watt's submission to the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

In the first line of my letter I say that I had a number of confidential conversations with the CMO.  One of those was obviously the one in August that we are discussing.  Mr. Watt does say that I was involved and he was involved.  We are now arguing over whether we had a three-cornered meeting or several conversations but it was the same people talking about the same thing.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt goes on to say that both "the Secretary to the Government and I indicated our strong support to facilitate and help where possible.  The understanding was that this would involve a public policy development role outside of the Department of Health.".  How was Mr. Robert Watt aware at that stage, in August 2021, that you, the Secretary General of the Government, had indicated your strong support to facilitate, where possible, this role?</p></speech>

It would have been my view at the time.  He is the person in charge of the Department of Health, so I am quite sure I would have said it to him.  Maybe I said it to him at a meeting I have forgotten, maybe I said it to him on the phone or maybe I said it to him when I met him in the course of other business but that is how he would have been aware.</p></speech>

That is a far more generic sort of proposal than the proposal which I understand has given rise to the controversy, which is the secondment proposal.

That language, to me, is quite familiar.  Deputy O'Callaghan spoke about civil and public servants moving on.  It is quite familiar language and it is quite generic language.  It could mean, for example, a role in the WHO or in the EU.  It could mean any number of things.</p></speech>

What Mr. Fraser says, to paraphrase his opening statement, is that he had confidential conversations with the Chief Medical Officer at an early stage last year.  Towards the end of February it was indicated he was thinking of moving on, and in March Mr. Fraser contacted the Secretary General.  Now we learn he contacted the Secretary General as far back as August of the year before work in relation to the Chief Medical Officer moving on.</p></speech>

I would point out the sentence the Deputy is quoting back to me states that he indicated he was stepping down from his current role and was considering a possible role in the university sector.  This is more specific and it happened in February.  This is what I was speaking about when I rang the Secretary General.</p></speech>

The Secretary General, who refuses to come before the committee, makes it very clear that Mr. Fraser was aware perhaps not of the complete details but much of the information at an earlier stage.  Therefore, both statements are, in a way, conflicting.  We are trying to get as much information here as we possibly can.</p></speech>

As far back as August Mr. Fraser was aware Tony Holohan was looking at his options of moving on from being Chief Medical Officer.  In February Mr. Fraser was informed he was looking at academia.  In March he asked the Secretary General to ensure he was facilitating such arrangements.</p></speech>

The Secretary General is, of course, the line manager of the Chief Medical Officer.  He is the head of the Department for administrative purposes.  Quite appropriately, I rang the person whose responsibility these matters were.  He told me he was dealing with it.  I did not ask him to do this or to look after it.  Other representatives, not the Deputy, have said this.  That is not what happened.  I rang the person who is responsible for these matters and he told me he was dealing with it.</p></speech>

To go back to the question, in August, February and March, and it became known at the end of March, Mr. Fraser did not mention a dicky bird to the Taoiseach that the Chief Medical Officer was thinking about moving on.  Is that right?  I do not know how many telephone conversations Mr. Fraser has with the Taoiseach, or how many WhatsApp and text messages, or meetings and informal meetings.  Not one word was mentioned to the Taoiseach during this period.</p></speech>

I cannot swear blind that I did not - but I do not think I did so - indicate at some point to the Taoiseach that he was thinking of moving on.  I could not swear blind about this from August onwards.  I am not saying I did.  In terms of conversations with the Taoiseach, I had very few conversations with him in March, far fewer than normal because the Taoiseach, for a variety of reasons, was away on official business for much of the period the Deputy is speaking about.  So no, I did not discuss it with the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

This is Circular 27/2021, which indicates the new secondment policy for services being implemented.  The first key principle is that all secondments will be temporary in nature and in general will be for a period of six months up to a maximum of five years.  As Secretary General of the Department of An Taoiseach, how can a secondment be open-ended given this circular that was issued and which is legally binding?</p></speech>

Those questions are as follows.  Who makes the decisions within the State?  For whom are the decisions made in the State?  There is a strong feeling among the general public that there is an inversion of the democratic authority in this State.  There is concern that the decisions are being made by unelected people without the necessary democratic oversight by the elected individuals in the State.  The second element of that question is that there is also a group of people close to Government, who may be insiders and who may have a different experience of how they are treated by comparison with the general public.  For most members of the general public who want to go for a job such as this, they need to take part in an open competition.  I do not know any member of the public who would be able to sit down and have a job designed for them personally, with a budget of this amount paid by the State.  That experience is not shared by the vast majority of people in the country.</p> <p>  There are two big questions here.  This is not the first time we have seen this in the context of the Government.  It is the latest in a long list of similar occurrences.  The Zappone affair was another example of it in recent times.  There is so much power vested in those who are unelected that many people feel what is happening makes "Yes, Prime Minister" looks like a documentary.  It is absolutely outrageous that any civil servant would refuse to appear before the committee to answer questions on their actions.  These are the elected representatives of the people who are tasked to hold the State to account.  There is no accountability when we cannot ask questions and have them responded to.</p> <p>  In Mr. Fraser's view, is this particular role unique?  Can he give another example of a similar role?</p></speech>

I did understand that the CMO did not intend to return to his post.  I understand completely why that was, because he obviously did not want his successor to feel that somehow he was only a temporary person.  He wanted to make that clear.

I actually discussed it with him to make sure Taoiseach knew before there was any public announcement.  In the event, the Taoiseach probably did know, but not the details, no more than I did.  There is no formal process and in the particular circumstances I did not see the Taoiseach for quite a while during March; that was nobody's fault.</p></speech>

I am trying to explore the whole area of the secondments and will rely on his experience as a Secretary General since 2011.  I will start off where Deputies Doherty and T&oacute;ib&iacute;n finished with regard to Circular 27/2021.  It would be great if that was made available to the full committee in order that we can have a deep understanding of exactly what is in Circular 27/2021.  When Deputy Doherty asked, Mr. Fraser said it was not a legal document or one did not have to legally comply with it.  Then he said one should comply with secondments.  It outlines what a secondment should be.  Is there any oversight?  Does anybody scrutinise whether a secondment post complies with the relative circular before that secondment takes place?</p></speech>

First, it is the responsibility of the senior management of the Department to abide by the rules around secondment.  As I said to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, secondments are not bad and trying to share experience and develop people and organisations is good.  Ultimately, sometimes one needs sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  All organisations are audited as well.  These things are looked at in a number of ways.  The essence of a secondment is that a person moves organisation on the same terms.  While it is good for the person concerned, it also means there is a sense he or she can come back to where he or she came from.  It is an opportunity to learn and develop rather than to leave the organisation.  That is the general reason for secondments.</p></speech>

In their broadest sense, secondments are used if people want to develop themselves or they want to gain a new experience.  That is a HR issue.  It is also used to bring skills into the organisation which is also a HR issue.  If the Senator means with regard to settling rows or something, I open to correction, but I do not think they have been used in that way.  It is lovely in here.  No one has any fights in here at all.</p></speech>

I do not think so but I would have to check.  Some 10% of the staff here are seconded in.  We are talking about hundreds of people for as long as I have been Secretary General.  Most of our secondments are within the Civil Service.

If one is talking about the Department of Health, the Secretary General there is responsible for all &euro;22 billion every year.  In that sense, he has to sign off on it all.</p><p> As to whether he has discretion to allocate money or develop policy, that is a separate question.  I think it is probably different in each Department.  I assume that is what is really being asked of me rather than what one signs off on.  Obviously these things must be consistent with Government policy, there has to be authority for them and so on.  That is what guides what the Secretary General can do.</p></speech>

At that point would Mr. Fraser have been aware of the time limit?  Was a secondment mentioned?  If so, what was the time limit or how long it could, potentially, have been?  Mr. Fraser said he was aware that the CMO said that he did not want to come back but what was the duration of a possible secondment? </p></speech>

On secondment, academia or international organisations, the conversation in August was of a more general nature.  It was not specific.  The issue of secondment came up in February.</p></speech>

As Deputy Doherty pointed out to me, it was a public policy development role that he was talking about.  There is a number of things that it could have been but it was not as precise as it became.  I understood that he felt that it was time to move on from being Chief Medical Officer and I think that we can all understand that is not an unreasonable thought for him to have had at the point.</p></speech>

I accept the questions Deputies and Senators have asked me about how this decision was made and what it meant.  From my point of view, I think that there is a good case for more research funding for research into pandemics, preparedness, etc.  The case for that is, in a way, separate and I know that they have been conflated.  If a particular person had left after two years, I do not believe that we would not still be providing research funding.  At least I hope that we would still be providing because funding should be provided on the merits of the topic and not due to the fact that a particular individual holds a particular post.  I do not think that is right and I do not think that is what happens either.  We do some research in the Department of the Taoiseach and it is certainly not attached to any particular official's tenure, nor should it be.</p></speech>

In terms of the possible impact on public finances, we heard that this would cost &euro;20 million over the lifetime of the secondment.  We can only deal with what could have actually happened.  Perhaps that could have changed but we must deal with this matter now.  Such a large sum would have a significant impact on public finances.  Is Mr. Fraser aware of other initiatives taken by Secretaries Generals that would have had such a potential impact on public finances where the Minister would not have been fully across the detail?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, if one is the Accounting Officer for &euro;22 billion then I am quite sure one is involved in much bigger decisions than I am.  I have a budget of between &euro;35 million and &euro;40 million with most of it being non-discretionary.  I have a small amount of funding for research, which we allocate to the shared island initiative mainly.  The Government will know about that and the Taoiseach knows about that as it is a very important issue from his point of view.</p> <p>  The overall research spending in the State is, I think, &euro;950 million by Government.  I cannot say that every single euro goes across the desk of a Minister.  There should be proper processes for allocating the money and I am sure there is but it is &euro;950 million so quite a substantial sum of money is spent every year on research.</p></speech>

The board has not met since 2016 but I understand that it was never properly wound down.  The minutes of the last meeting in 2016 indicate that its work was in some ways only beginning and there was a lot of talk about the introduction of key performance indicators for Secretaries General.  I ask Mr. Fraser to comment on the disappearance of the Civil Service Accountability Board with no real comment and to confirm whether it has concluded its work.</p></speech>

The board has not sat for quite a while.  I do not know why and cannot explain that.  It is obviously not entirely up to me.  It is no longer, I think, in the Government's policy called Civil Service Renewal.  We try to work hard on performance management for Secretaries General.  We try to have strategy statements, indicators and processes around that.</p></speech>

It was referred to him, or run past him, as they say nowadays, in the course of the events, apparently.  Well, he is well aware of the matter and agreed - or did not agree, as the case may be.  I presume he agreed.  In those circumstances, again, we are talking about a time when the health services in this country are on their knees.  There are waiting lists as long as your arm.  One of the things we tried to do in the month of January was to avail of the opportunity to rebuild the health service, and that needed a plan.  That needs the Secretary General of the Department and key people around him or her to deliver the quality and standard of service that is required.  Does Mr. Fraser agree on that?</p></speech>

It now falls to us to make a determination as to what we are going to do in the future.</p><p>Are we going to spend the next six months discussing this issue and asking questions about the whys and wherefores of what happened or are we going to do what needs to be done as a matter of urgency, to wit the provision of a comprehensive health service in this country, along the lines we have been speaking about for the past year at least, in the post-pandemic situation?  Was Mr. Fraser made aware of the fact there was a serious difficulty and a serious health issue that had to be dealt with in terms of the provision of health services throughout the country in the post-pandemic era?  What he aware of it?  Was he made aware of it?</p></speech>

I am not criticising Mr. Fraser or anybody else but I am saying this.  It is an item of futility if we are going to spend our time talking around the subject but never getting anywhere.  We are going very close to that at present.  We are going very close to it in the Department of Health.  For example, nobody responsible, with the exception of your good self, wants to come before the committee to talk about the issue.  This is despite the fact that everybody knows there is an urgent need to deal with health service issues now and that whatever can be done needs to be done as a matter of urgency.  The question remains.  Are we all on the same hymn sheet on this one?  Are we moving towards dealing with the issue or are we going to spend our time talking about the appointment or the failure to appoint or whatever the case might be?</p></speech>

I am a member of the committee the same as everybody else.  I have the same rights as everybody else and I am raising the question.  I am doing so because everybody else in the country is talking about the issue of the health service at present.  We have found at every meeting of the committee for the past 12 months individuals prepared to take steps to address the issues, do something about it and prove they could do something about various issues under their remit.  We are here today after a certain length of time, heading for 1 May, and we do not seem to have a plan.  Six months of the year have gone.  Again, I am not criticising Mr. Fraser for it but there needs to be somebody who can come before the committee and give the committee some satisfactory answers on what is going on.  Does Mr. Fraser not agree?</p></speech>

I am listening to the questions the Deputy is asking and I am listening to the answers from Mr. Fraser, who seems to indicate he has nothing further to add or that it is not for his Department and it is for the Department of Health.

I appreciate that he is busy.  All Deputies appreciate that civil servants are busy and cannot be attending numerous committees every week.  Nor can they pick and choose which committees they appear before and I thank Mr. Fraser for coming before the committee.</p><p>I asked a parliamentary question over the vacation as to whether the proposed professorship of public health strategy and leadership at Trinity College Dublin would be proceeded with and whether the Minister for Health would make a statement on the matter.  Fortuitously I received the reply last night.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	The establishment of a professorship within Trinity College Dublin is a matter for the University itself as an autonomous Higher Education institution that controls its own staffing requirements and academic affairs.  The Minister for Health has no role in deciding on these matters. </blockquote> <p>Mr. Fraser might not be surprised by that reply.  Was he surprised at the fact this role was being created and at this synergy, to say the least, between the Department of Health, the Chief Medical Officer and Trinity College in developing this unique position?  Mr. Fraser clarified to Deputy Doherty what he learned and when he learned it.  Was he surprised this new role was being created in the way it was and that essentially Exchequer funding was going to be expended on the professorship, albeit indirectly, by seconding Dr. Holohan?</p></speech>

He will recall that in October 2020 there was what was perceived by some people, and some in the media, as something of a stand-off between the Government and NPHET as to whether there would or would not be another lockdown.  The T&aacute;naiste made a much-commented-on appearance on the Claire Byrne show.  Suddenly, notwithstanding this stand-off, some would say the Government caved while others would say it just accepted the public health advice, and there was a lockdown.  In December 2020 and at the start of 2021, the Government differed from the advice of NPHET and many blamed it for the fact that people socialised and so forth, as people usually do at Christmas.  Was there a feeling in the Department of the Taoiseach, or did Mr. Fraser as the most senior civil servant there discern any concern, that there was a type of erosion of the authority of democratic government or that it was somehow being challenged by NPHET, whose role ordinarily would be to advise the Government but which instead was essentially telling the Government in public what to do?  Was there any concern about that or did Mr. Fraser discern any concern in the Department of the Taoiseach about that unusual inversion of authority in a democratic state?</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned the Claire Byrne show.  That, in itself, illustrated a certain amount of concern.  Of course, those were tense times, but everybody was doing their best for the country.  It was an unprecedented situation and, of course, there was frustration.  I am sure there was frustration on all sides and, most particularly, for the citizens of the country who were asked to do so much in such a difficult time.  The Deputy and I both know there were emotional ups and downs, if we are in the emotion business, over the entire period.</p></speech>

I believe we would agree that he played a very prominent role.

Many people felt a greater allegiance to what he had to say, and felt that his word was that which ought to be followed rather than that of the Government.  There was huge confusion about what was law and what was guidelines.  Of course, the T&aacute;naiste fell victim to it when he attended Ms Katherine Zappone's party across the road from where Mr. Fraser works.  All of that created a lot of confusion about the authority of the State and the authority of a democratic government.  Essentially, who was in charge was not clear.  Was there any relief that this potential problem had been averted?</p></speech>

I refer to what Mr. Fraser discussed at the beginning of the meeting.  Previously, when people left or retired from the public service they usually went into retirement, but now everything has become more fluid.  People come and go in the public service and their tenure is shorter.  Politicians have a cooling-off period, and even some political advisers have a cooling-off period, whereby they cannot work for a private entity immediately after carrying out a political function because there might be a perception of a conflict of interest.  Does Mr. Fraser think it would be advisable to develop something similar for civil servants?  Some would say they, too, have a more detailed knowledge of how the State apparatus in the Administration works, something that could be very desirable in the private sector and something which could create a conflict of interest.  I am not saying that people should be prevented from continuing their careers, but that there should be a similar cooling-off period for public servants to what is there for politicians.</p></speech>

I would have to check the details for the Deputy, but his point is well made.  I believe there are such arrangements in place.  However, I am not an expert and I would have to double check.  I am a member of the Outside Appointments Board, by the way, but it does not meet very frequently.  That is one of the reasons I am not clear.</p></speech>

Is the VHI in the private or public sector?  Arguably, it is State-owned.  I am not suggesting either of them has done anything wrong or breached any rules - far from it.  However, it surprised me that there was no cooling-off period involved in their move.  That is just my personal reaction.  It strikes me that it would be beneficial if there was.  That is just one minor example that happened to coincide with Dr. Holohan's.  There are many people who were key figures in the Covid-19 response leaving the HSE, and there appears to be many people leaving together.</p> <p>  However, to revert to my question, Mr. Fraser would agree with me that procedures around this would be advisable and potentially beneficial in the public interest. </p></speech>

Senior civil servants can be reassigned or they tend to retire.  I am not aware of too many requests for exemptions or of cases being submitted to the Outside Appointments Board, but I would have to check, to be honest.

There is a significance in what Mr. Watt points out here, that the Secretary to the Government was told certain things.  He comments on it in his report.  I want to go back again to the circular which was spoken about here.  The circular was issued on 23 December, 2021.  It is not an old document but is a recent circular that was sent out.  Would that have been sent to every Secretary General?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-04-27a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022042700002#L04000"><p>In that, just for the information of members, there are three things.  All secondments will be temporary in nature, all secondment advertisements will be sent to the Civil Service HR division and, in general, an advertised position should be circulated to all staff.  It is very clear on the steps that one has to take.</p> <p>  Let us move then to the letter of 16 March to Professor Linda Doyle, which is a public document so I presume I can refer to it.  That proposal or letter of intent sets out the agreement to the secondment of Dr. Tony Holohan and in the second paragraph Mr. Watt writes: "I recognise that agreement is conditional on the approval of any necessary authority within the University."  I am not asking you to comment on this, Mr. Fraser.  I am setting a scene here as to where all this started.  The authority mentioned here is only the university.  The superannuation arrangements and alignment with contractual terms and conditions relating to the position of CMO is addressed by the Department of Health, is what it says here.  However, the letter of intent goes on to state clearly, under the proposed agreement, what the Department of Health commits to.  It actually commits to the secondment and to continuing to pay the salary at its existing level.  It refers to "salary terms and conditions equivalent to the position" on the date of signing of the agreement and also commits to "improvements, awards or regrading that may apply to the position of Chief Medical Officer over the course of the secondment".  It commits to making an "annual, ring-fenced allocation of &euro;2M for the duration of the secondment, to be administered through the Health Research Board, a body under the aegis of the Department of Health...".  It goes on to talk about funds to provide for Dr. Holohan's salary "until his retirement".  It asks that Trinity College would provide an office on the campus and that it would provide administrative support for the position.  That is what was stated on 16 March 2022.  All of that is what has brought us to this juncture and this examination.  Let us be clear about this.  It was advanced to a stage where the final document was to be signed at the end of March.  The letter refers to the appointment of an officer in the Department of Health to work on details "such that a final agreement is signed prior to 31 March 2022".  All of this was advanced, apparently, without any sanction from anyone except the Secretary General and it flies in the face of Circular 27/2021.</p><p>That is the backdrop to this.  Questions have been asked about the remit of committees.  It has been suggested Circular 27/2021 does not define the involvement and role of this committee clearly; it does.  I am saying that because I am moving now to the recent happenings.  In the public arena we have been fed a diet of smoke and mirrors, obfuscation, spin and a determined effort by Government to cloud the issues here.  The issues are clear.  They were set out on 16 March.  They are set out in the document dated 21 December.  It is quite clear that there is an issue here that should be dealt with by this committee.<br/><br/>On 12 April 2022, the Secretaries General were asked for information.  They were told about the invitation.  On 13 April 2022, Ministers were informed.  They were advised that they might need to appear depending on what might be said by the three Secretaries General, Mr. Fraser being one of them and the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform being another.  There is an apology there; the Secretary General is not available which is fine.  Then there is Mr. Watt.  They were the three.  We then asked for information just to inform the committee to put us into a position where we clearly understood what was going on, our role within what was going on and our oversight role as a committee.  To say that some showed utter contempt for what was going on is an understatement.  Deadlines were not met.  Information was not given.  Requests for further information were not acknowledged.  Telephone calls from the secretariat here were not returned.  I think that shows an awful example to those at a junior level within the Civil Service where they should be seeing exemplary conduct from Secretaries General.<br/><br/>I now turn to the political situation and comments that were made before I get back to Mr. Watt's letter of last night at 8 o'clock.  It is regrettable that the Taoiseach used the words he did because this committee - I am sure it is the same for every other committee of the House - is about its business.  It is about accountability and transparency, and bringing before the committee various witnesses depending on the subject matter and doing it in a constructive, courteous fashion, getting to the truth of the matter.  It would seem that there is no appetite in Government to get to the truth of this matter.<br/><br/>The Taoiseach has suggested that we should wait until the independent report is completed following due process at which point we can get the report and discuss it.  That stands in stark contrast to the treatment of a Minister who asked for due process but was sacked.  If that does not show double standards, I do not know what does.  Therefore, the committee has a remit.  It must answer the questions from the public in the context of the belief that there is a senior cabal of politicians and civil servants who are ignoring the due process, ignoring the Oireachtas committees and just doing as they please.<br/><br/>Last night's letter from Mr. Watt to the committee as usual provides a lot of packing.  There is a lot of stuff in there, some of it irrelevant.  He states: &quot;I have answered questions on these matters at the Health Committee and I do not believe it is reasonable for me to be asked to attend a different sectoral Committee to answer questions on the same issue.&quot;  He is not being asked to answer questions on the same issues.  He is being asked to address the issues that are of public interest and of concern to the people of Ireland.  He is being asked by a parliamentary committee, taking its task responsibly.  He has been asked to appear before it to clarify matters.  The circular letter puts him right in the frame to be asked to attend this meeting.  <br/><br/>That answers that part of his letter.  This is not personal.  I just need to do my job as Chairman.  It has been made seriously difficult by the attitude of Ministers, the Taoiseach and senior civil servants.  He states:</p><blockquote>	I understand that it has been practice for some time now that one committee should look at each particular issue under its terms of reference rather than duplicate examinations of issues.  I'm sure you would agree this is neither in the public interest, nor is it efficient use of members' or public servants' time. </blockquote><p>I put it to Mr. Fraser that he has eaten up an enormous amount of this committee's time and indeed the time of the clerk and the people who serve this committee by not answering letters, by not giving information and by having everyone here chasing after the information not being responded to and the numerous telephone calls that are not returned.  There is no dispute between the health committee and the finance committee.  There is a clear line of responsibility for both committees.  I would suggest, as I said earlier, all of it is contained not only in that circular, but in the title of the committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  If ever we needed to look at public expenditure in this case, and reform, by God we need to do it now.<br/><br/>A politician cannot go anywhere publicly without someone pointing out the disgraceful behaviour of some politicians and some civil servants.  I wonder if this attitude gave rise to the decision by those in the HSE, whom the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, wanted to meet, not to meet her.<br/><br/>Mr. Watt's letter continued:</p><blockquote>	I hope that we can carry out our respective duties in a respectful and courteous manner&hellip; issues that arise in a professional, factual, and policy focused manner, without unnecessary and distracting personal commentary. </blockquote><p>None of this is distracting commentary.  None of this is personal.  None of this is outside the realms of being courteous to everyone.  I find it a shocking state of affairs that this committee has to sit like this and work its way through nonsense and through all the misinformation and spin in order to try to get to the truth.<br/><br/>I go back then to the report from Mr. Watt to the Taoiseach.  I hope the Taoiseach and his officials will ponder on what has been said at this committee.  Point No. 20 in his submission states:</p><blockquote>	This involved the Secretary to the Government and myself as Secretary General of the Department of Health.  [That implicates Mr. Fraser.] ...  the CMO has an outstanding record of public service on behalf of the Irish State.  Both the Secretary to the Government and I indicated our strong support to facilitate and help where possible. </blockquote><p>Again, he refers to Mr. Fraser as Secretary to the Government.  The report also states:</p><blockquote>	In early March, the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and I confirmed that I was working on the details of this arrangement, including the proposed research funding element.  I was aware that the Government had recently endorsed open ended secondment arrangements... </blockquote><p>The circular from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which I refer to again, has other things to say about that.  He then commits the research board: &quot;...with details to be agreed between all three parties.  It was never envisaged that this salary would be paid directly on the Vote of the Department of Health.&quot;<br/><br/>Yet it would be seen to be paid from an agency under the remit of the Department of Health.<br/><br/>Point No. 43 refers to &quot;the Public Service Management Act 1997, which stipulates that the administration of Government Departments is a matter for Secretaries General&quot;, and I do not dispute that.  He is not a lone ranger, however.  He is a manager within a system that is accountable to the people through Oireachtas committees, and he should be accountable to the Government, if it is interested at all, particularly given the sums of money involved.<br/><br/>In point No. 44, Mr. Watt indicates:</p><blockquote>	It also has been suggested that the Taoiseach and other members of the Government were &quot;kept in the dark&quot;.  The Secretary to the Government was aware of the proposed secondment move (but not of course the precise details) and I understood that the fact of discussions regarding the CMO's future plans were known in the Department of An Taoiseach.  I assumed that key decision-makers were aware of the proposal but of course not the precise details. [...]  In early March the Secretary to the Government spoke to me and asked me to confirm that I was working on the details.  I confirmed &quot;yes&quot;.  I inferred from this that this had political support in Government Buildings. </blockquote><p>Everyone seems to be running a mile from that one.<br/><br/>In point No. 56, Mr. Watt states:</p><blockquote>	...it is disappointing that some commentary alleges erroneously that I failed to keep the Minister appropriately informed.  The Minister was informed of the proposal for Dr. Holohan to take up a professorship at TCD in advance of the announcement and was supportive. </blockquote><p>I wonder if the advance announcement the night before was his way of informing the Minister, as he did with us last night at 8 p.m., sending us the email that he sent.<br/><br/>This brings me to the final point.  After all that, the committee was available to Mr. Watt and others such as the Minister to come before it.  It is a two-way street here and people get the chance to clarify their positions.  They get a chance to put the facts before the general public because it is a public meeting.  We all get the chance to learn from mistakes because nobody gets it right all the time.<br/><br/>We are now faced with the investigation to bring what the terms of reference refer to as &quot;learnings&quot; from this.  It has been a debacle from start to finish and it has cast a shadow on Dr. Tony Holohan, for whom I have the greatest respect.  Even the commentary over the past few days in the D&aacute;il has been nothing short of an attempt to cloud the matter, as I said earlier.  I find it truly shocking that senior politicians and civil servants do not see beyond the position they are currently holding and cannot understand that the public is furious about what is going on.  It is not so much about Dr. Holohan but the carry-on of Ministers, comments of senior civil servants and particularly the misleading commentary put to the D&aacute;il by the Taoiseach when he speaks about a &quot;witch hunt&quot; in three committees taking this up and his referring to what should or should not happen.  I made the point that this committee certainly has a remit to be involved.  I ask for Mr. Watt to reconsider his position on attending before this committee.  I ask the Taoiseach and the two Ministers to consider their position on attending before this committee and giving clarity not to me but to this forum as a committee of Parliament with representatives of the public.  I ask that this be done sooner rather than later.<br/><br/>If Mr. Fraser wishes to clarify any point, he should please do so now.  I acknowledge that this is not the first time he has come before this committee when others would not, and I respect him for that.  It is a pity others do not take his example and attend committee meetings when they are asked to do so.</p></speech>

So Mr. Fraser is off on his ambassadorial role now to the United Kingdom.  I wish him well in that.  I hoped the Civil Service could have been left behind well reformed and with its members attuned to attending committee meetings but maybe we have a little more work to do on that.  As I mentioned, I recognise Mr. Fraser's input to this meeting.  I will leave it at that unless any other member wishes to come in.  If they do not, we will leave it.  It is unfinished work and as Bertie said, there is a lot done, more to do.  There is certainly much transparency and accountability required.  I thank Mr. Fraser and the members for attending.</p></speech>
