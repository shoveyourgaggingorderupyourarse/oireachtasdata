This morning, we will engage with witnesses from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, regarding its 2020 financial statements.  After lunch, the committee will consider correspondence and other business of the committee.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from Tusla: Mr. Bernard Gloster, chief executive; Ms Kate Duggan, director of services and integration; Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance; and Ms Niamh Doody, business manager.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As witnesses are within the precincts of Leinster House, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action or anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they do so.</p> <p>  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Its primary responsibility is to safeguard and improve the welfare of children.  Prior to 2014, most of the agency's functions were undertaken by the HSE.  Staff, assets and systems were transferred from the HSE to Tusla on its establishment, but the agency still relies on the HSE for support with certain functions, including procurement and ICT systems.<br/><br/>The agency's financial statements for 2020 record total income of around &euro;870 million, almost all of which comes from the Vote for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  This includes &euro;17 million provided to support the agency's capital investment.  The agency's expenditure in 2020 was &euro;858 million.  Around one-third of the expenditure related to staff costs.  The agency employed around 4,600 whole-time equivalent staff at the end of 2020.<br/><br/>Most of the remaining expenditure in 2020 comprised direct payments or grant funding for the provision of services to support children and families.  This included &euro;119 million spent on foster care and aftercare allowances; &euro;142 million spent on independent placement provision, including residential care; and &euro;182 million paid as grants to organisations delivering a wide range of child and family services.  The agency incurred expenditure amounting to around &euro;30 million on guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs and legal fees.  The agency's office and administration expenses were &euro;36 million.<br/><br/>I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2020, which I certified on 30 June 2021.  However, I drew attention to two matters disclosed by the agency in its statement on internal control.  First, the agency acknowledges that in excess of &euro;6 million was spent on goods and services where the relevant public procurement rules were not complied with.  Second, as members are aware, the HSE suffered a ransomware cyberattack on its ICT systems in May 2021 resulting in the shutdown of all its ICT systems, including those supporting Tusla's operations.  In the statement on internal control, the agency outlines its plans to migrate its ICT systems away from the HSE network, except in respect of the HSE's integrated financial management system, IFMS, that is under development.  While the disruption to the agency's operations was significant, it happened after the period of account and does not impact the financial statements for 2020.</p></speech>

I am joined as supporting witnesses by my colleagues, Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance, and Ms. Kate Duggan, national director of services and integration and deputy CEO.  I have, as requested, provided the members with a short briefing document as an appendix to my opening statement and so I will confine my remarks here to some key themes.</p> <p>  The agency received referrals to its child protection and welfare service in 2020 at just below 70,000.  It is important to note that in the early stages of the Covid-19 response, we saw a concerning decrease.  I am satisfied this concern was proactively addressed and referral rates recovered.  Those children of specific levels of concern requiring a continuing social work service for a period were either at home - just over 15,000 - or in State care - 5,882 - at December 2020.</p> <p>  Not all referrals to the agency involve an abuse concern and many are welfare-based.  Some 22,300 of these children received a family support service in 2020 while 2,943 young adults received an aftercare service, including additional supports to reflect the context of the pandemic.  This is an area for further development.</p> <p>  The agency focused almost exclusively throughout the first months of the pandemic in ensuring the provision of domestic and sexual violence response services, child protection services and children in care supports.  In our specialist services separate to those above, 2020 saw key activity and statutory duties fulfilled in several ways.  Members will be aware of the repeated commentary on the ability of the agency to recruit staff and fill approved posts over recent years.  Tusla had developed an increasing dependence on temporary agency staffing.  A programme to convert these to Tusla employment took place in 2020 resulting in a reduction to a more appropriate level and a decrease in spend on agency staffing of &euro;19.5 million, which is continuing thus far to a saving of approximately &euro;4 million annually.  This has been maintained in 2021.  Our focus then shifted to improved graduate recruitment.</p> <p>  I also again note that concern for staff safety and welfare remains a priority in the context of understanding the staffing of the agency.  Within the workforce, social work recruitment and retention remains a serious challenge.  Generating supply is one area of activity.  The agency participates in the Department-led social work education group and, separately, the chair of the agency and I have engaged with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on this issue.  Increased supply and retention efforts alone will not deal with this issue, and there is a critical need to examine the utilisation of multidisciplinary teams for child protection and welfare work.  That noted, Tusla at the end of 2020 was effectively at full employment of its funded workforce, representing a substantial improvement on previous years.</p> <p>  Tusla is subject to regulatory oversight from several sources, including HIQA, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Health and Safety Authority, the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman for Children, the Information Commissioner and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Progress is being made in respect of the various functions that lead to more improved compliance, but there can be no doubting that challenges remain.  In respect of care and protection services, we have seen significant improvements in many HIQA reports while also remaining clear that some individual services or parts of them are found to be non-compliant, and this is concerning.</p> <p>  The agency concluded the year 2020 in a stable position financially through one-off adjustment and relative to the projected deficits cumulating from activity of previous years.  The target of the agency was to achieve a stable position coming into 2021, and thanks to the intervention of the Minister and the Department, this was achieved.  I am concerned regarding the long-term challenges for some of our funded organisations in the community and voluntary sector.  Efforts are continuing to mitigate those challenges to the greatest extent possible.  These organisations, many of them service providers, are critical to the effectiveness of the agency.  We did make some progress in 2020 and 2021 for this sector on a once-off basis.  However, the long-term solution to the challenge is beyond the scope of Tusla.</p> <p>  Eighteen out of the past 24 months during which I have been CEO of the agency have been characterised by two major events: Covid-19, and the cyberattack on HSE systems in May of this year.  The impact of both is still evident and well documented.  I am pleased to report to this committee that, notwithstanding these major disruptions, the board and the executive of the agency have remained focused on two key activities.  The first is the continuity of critical services to children and families throughout those events.  Tusla, as the State child protection agency, was identified by Government at the start of the pandemic and in the cyberattack as one of the key essential front-line services to be maintained.  Our response capability to each crisis was of a very high standard.</p> <p>  The second is the continuity of major changes and reforms within the agency.  These are in response to fundamental challenges.  On commencing my role, I agreed with the board that these were our priority and remain so.  I am pleased to report significant progress in key areas of change in the organisation.  At the end of this month, Tusla will have completed a major part of the reform of governance of the agency through the recruitment of a revised executive management team and six new defined regions, each with its own chief officer.  Through empowering local regions, we will see an even greater focus on need, better integration and improved performance management with appropriate accountability.</p><p>The board and I recognise that many challenges and issues remain to be addressed.  Be they in the context of history or current-day service provision, it is fair to say we have challenges.  I have no doubt some of those will be reported and commented on in the future.  Equally, there is substantial evidence to show we have made, and continue to make, progress on many fronts, with excellent work being done by some 5,000 staff every day.  Consistency and continuous improvement are central for the coming years.</p><p> I thank the Chair and am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

We can give a written response but I will give the Deputy an overview.  The same as every agency in the State at the time, we faced a challenge in getting face masks, goggles, surgical gloves, cleaning materials, etc., to ensure staff and clients were safe.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, we use the same system as the HSE and tend to use the same suppliers.  The same approach was taken by us and the same suppliers supplied the same products at similar prices as to the HSE.  That was the type of material.  We had to take some emergency measures in terms of residential homes to ensure screens, etc., were erected at various points, as well as in places where staff were continuing to work.  The &euro;900,000-----</p></speech>

If we did not have Covid, there is still the same level of non-compliant procurement.  What is Tusla doing about that?  It has been ongoing for several years.  It is detailed here that it has risen, rather than gone down.  Whatever measures are in place are not working.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-21a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Smyth" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021102100002#B01650"><p>Tusla's focus has always been on trying to ensure we have the major expenditures in the agency covered.  We have heavy expenditures around legal contracts, for instance.  That is a &euro;12 million contract we procured in 2021.  It landed across all legal services.  We have put in place a major contract around private residential services, which is around &euro;90 million per annum, that was completed across 2020 and 2021.  We have a major procurement under way around private foster care, which is due to be completed before the end of the year.  Our resources tend to be focused on those major procurements and through the past year and a half, that is what we have had to do.</p> <p>  We have had, and still have, plans in place to address that non-compliance in areas focused on lots of local services.  We have approximately 300 locations across the country in Tusla.  Cleaning, security, office supplies, etc., fall to those local areas.  In many cases, people are compliant and the figure is under &euro;25,000 in many cases.  When we consolidate that for the agency, those contracts add up to more than &euro;25,000.  We have been trying to address that and have had difficulty, part of which has been that we do not have automated systems to prevent people purchasing when they cross those type of contracts.  It is a very manual system we have had to operate with.  That is part of our agenda in terms of-----</p></speech>

Non-compliance has increased by &euro;3 million in four or five years.  What accountability is there?  Where is the agency when it comes to accountability for non-compliance?</p></speech>

Part of the solution not just to this but to many issues we have regarding centralised versus local accountability is in developing that structure out to local areas.

I point her to the update I gave the committee in response to the previous recommendations it made in 2017 and 2019.  The &euro;6.3 million reported that the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to is down a small amount from the &euro;7.1 million in 2019.  It is &euro;6.3 million non-compliance out of a commercial spend activity of &euro;228 million.  In public service terms, that is a significant progression-----</p></speech>

If one were to add back the &euro;900,000 now excused by Covid regulations, non-compliance is up on last year, rather than down.  We are the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is about value for money and being accountable to the taxpayer for money spent.  I have not had an answer to the question on how Tusla is dealing with it.  If it is rising, Tusla is clearly not dealing with it.</p></speech>

The cost saving there was around &euro;4 million so it was a very evident piece.  The other measures I talked about, such as procurement contracts that have been engaged in for 2020 and 2021, relate to very serious expenditures.

I cannot say I would excuse the procurement improvement in non-compliance in the same way at all.  There are a significant number of localised agencies that Tusla deals with in relation to one thing or another and several service providers and bodies provide health and personal social services on its behalf.  Mr. Gloster himself has said there is a control weakness and that it has been actively addressed.  On that basis, is Tusla solely reliant on the HSE for the internal audit function, or does it have the capacity to carry out its own internal audits?

Tusla was established back in 2014 under the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  Prior to this, the majority of the agency's functions were undertaken by the HSE.

When the agency was established in 2014, the view of the Departments involved in its establishment was that it should try to achieve the best possible use of shared services and that has been pursued across the public service over many years.  That was the starting point.  In 2014, we were also in the middle of a very significant financial constraint in the macroeconomy that would not have allowed for the elaborate building of completely separate functions.</p></speech>

That is a continuous process but it is reducing.  We have our own estates staff and we are building that function.  We have commenced our own procurement function, as I pointed out to Deputy Murphy.  We are in the middle of a major ICT migration, post cyberattack, to a Tusla IRL system which is more or less completely independent.  We would still be dependent on the HSE for two things, and it makes perfect sense that we would be, as part of the overall ICT system.  We are expediting that and are a year ahead of time because of the impact of the cyberattack.  We continue to be dependent on the HSE for the internal audit function.  I suspect that will continue through 2022 but it certainly would be a desire of the board to establish our own internal audit function in the long term.</p></speech>

That featured as part of our plans at the time of the cyberattack.  It was our long-term plan but we brought it forward.</p><p>I have estimated a risk cost associated with that of between &euro;7.5 million and &euro;8 million.  I still believe that will hold through, but we will not really know the full cost of that until the middle of 2022, when we complete it.  After that, we will have two dependencies on HSE ICT, one of which is the national childcare information system.  We hope to move to the next generation of that system in 2022.  When we do, it will be built in Tusla, and we will be left with the SAP system for driving payroll and HR.  Currently, the indicated cost of the Tusla IRL system is &euro;8 million, and this year a cost of around &euro;500,000 went into recovery in the first few weeks following the cyberattack.</p></speech>

However, the impact on direct service provision of the cyberattack was much more sharp and severe.  I have not hidden the fact it brought us to our knees.  That is the reality of the situation we found ourselves in.  Inasmuch as we have certainty of recovery and continued recovery of systems, there are still some levels of disruption, but most of the systems are back.  Inasmuch as we have certainty, we have the same certainty as the HSE.  We must remain open to the possibility there is a risk of data exfiltration that could yet emerge.  So far, the assessments have not indicated that is the case, but I must say we are a long way from being able to be definitive about that.  The HSE is conducting an extensive analysis in relation to assessing the damage to servers and whether there is evidence of exfiltration on those servers, and we are fully party to that.  So far, there is no such evidence, but we must remain open to that possibility.</p></speech>

One of the things that is contributing to a delay in the Tusla IRL project is the problem with the supply chain of laptops globally.  Various component parts are presenting a difficulty in terms of demand and supply.  However, the cost of that is included in the &euro;8 million.</p> <p>  In relation to data systems, most of our systems are back up and running.  Ironically, it is the basics of the connectivity of email in some parts of the country that is presenting as problematic.  The national childcare information system, which is our biggest database and continues to be hosted on the HSE system, is very significant in its sensitivity and the data it holds.  We have no evidence of exfiltration from that, but it was severely damaged by the encryption of the attackers, the immediate shutdown that was done by the HSE on the morning of 14 May, and the attempt to rebuild.  We had to use the backups of the system to rebuild the database from there, because the one we were operating on up to 14 May was so badly damaged it was rendered unusable.</p></speech>

Note 7 in the accounts breaks that spend down.  It shows we spent &euro;88 million on statutory foster care allowances.  The statutory foster care allowance rates are &euro;325 for a child under the age of 12 and &euro;352 for a child from the ages of 12 to 18.  Aftercare allowances are provided for a large range of young people aged 18 to 22, and we spent &euro;24 million on those allowances in 2020.  The aftercare allowances can range up to &euro;300 per child.</p></speech>

I might defer to my colleague to provide more detail on the types of different care arrangements, but that is basically the difference that occurs.  Different circumstances will dictate the aftercare arrangements, but the rates for foster care arrangements for children up to the age of 18 are the same nationally.</p></speech>

Often at the Committee of Public Accounts we concentrate on the procurement elements of Tusla's budget, whereas often staffing represents the most significant level of spending.  In Tusla's line of business, it is also the area that has the greatest impact in terms of service delivery.  I am not sure if Mr. Gloster is familiar with the Montague report, entitled Ballymun - A Brighter Future, which Dublin City Council published.  The report focused quite a bit on the impact of the drugs industry on the community in Ballymun.  It mentioned the engagement of Tusla in that area.  It pointed out that north Dublin city, which of course includes Cabra, Finglas and other areas, has the highest number of children in care in the country.  While it also has one of the highest allocations of staffing, there are a huge number of vacancies.  Perhaps Mr. Gloster can provide us with detail on filling those vacancies and the costs of doing so, and explain why the posts are so consistently vacant.  I will ask more questions after that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-21a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kate Duggan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021102100002#D01600"><p>We are very familiar with the Montague report.  Our area manager in Dublin north city, Joy McGlynn, has been part of the inter-agency approach to that report in terms of its findings and recommendations.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, Dublin north city is one of the areas where we are significantly challenged in the profile of children and families who require our support and the profile of children and young people who touch off our system in terms of either family support or the care system.  The Deputy has also pointed out that Dublin north city has the highest number of children in care.  It also has the highest number of community and voluntary services within that region.  One of the areas we look at and focus on in Dublin north city is how to work much more collaboratively and work in partnership with our community and voluntary partners to respond to the need that is there.</p> <p>  Dublin north city, like the rest of the country, is challenged in terms of our ability to allocate an adequate number of social workers.</p><p>At the moment, the agency has a headcount of approximately 1,770 social workers.  However, we have a number of vacancies and that is compounded by the approximately 70 staff who are on maternity leave and, in the context of Covid-19, for health and safety reasons,k those staff are often working away from the front line from the beginning of their pregnancy.  Therefore, we are challenged our allocation of social workers across the country.</p><p> We are taking a number of actions.  We have already spoken about the agency conversion programme that has happened.  We are facilitating a number of student placements and our CEO is engaging with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in looking to increase the number of student placements.  We offered a permanent contract to every new graduate who was qualifying from the universities this year.  So far, out of 184 places in the universities, 130 individuals have expressed an interest in coming to work for Tusla.  After qualification and interview, that has translated into securing 99 additional social workers for the whole of the country, whereas 89 social workers left the agency between January and July this year.  Therefore, we are significantly challenged in our ability to allocate social workers.  In 2021, out of additional Government funding of approximately &euro;7 million, we allocated 65 new social work posts across the country, but the challenge remains.  The solution is around working with partner agencies and diversifying our workforce.  The Deputy talked about drugs and substance abuse issues and issues such as domestic violence in Dublin north city, and we are looking to diversify our workforce to meet that response.</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear Tusla is more than familiar with the report and is participating in the inter-agency response.  I know it is something the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office is also involved in.  Regarding the two issues she touched on, recruitment is one element but retention is another.  In Dublin north city, 4% of cases are allocated within the 40 days whereas the national average for Tusla is 22%.  There is something else going on in Dublin north city and it is obviously to do with the difficulty of the work for many social workers and the retention issue.  The report points out that the appointment of more senior social workers would be one way of responding to that, giving people more responsibility, obviously, but also perhaps keeping them in post for longer.  I wonder if that is something Tusla has had an opportunity to consider.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-21a.104" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021102100002#E00300"><p>That is a very fair observation.  There are myriad reasons it is difficult to retain staff.  We have invested a lot of energy this year in understanding fully the people who leave us with less than two years&rsquo; service and the people who leave with less than five years&rsquo; service, because it is in that band of years that the retention problem is.  People who leave after five years tend to leave for probably more understandable reasons.</p> <p>  I would point to a couple of factors.  First, pre-Covid, in Dublin city, in particular, it was difficult to attract social workers to come and stay.  There are some very good social workers in Dublin and we are delighted they are with us.  However, it is difficult to attract new social workers to come and stay given the cost of living and many different reasons, so that was one factor.</p> <p>  The other factor is there has been an increase among social work employers across the country in their demand for social workers.  This year, 184 people came off the courses in Ireland and 144 of them had registered with CORU by September, which means 40 are probably thinking about travel or something like that and 144 are available.  I could use every one of those and I did offer a job to every one of those who wanted a job.  However, my colleagues in the health service are recruiting social workers, the Probation Service recruits social workers, the section 38 agencies across the disability sector recruit social workers, and so on.  Social work has now become part of the multidisciplinary team in every health and social care context and that is a challenge for us.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that statutory child protection is considered to be one of the most hard-end areas of work to do.  While that is not to undervalue the work of anybody else, it is considered to be one of the hardest areas of social work to do.  I have said many times, including in my opening statement, that I think we have to move to a new model of multidisciplinary teams because there are lots of other disciplines and professions that could contribute.</p></speech>

Mr. Gloster has brought me to the point I was going to follow on to with Ms Duggan, which is the idea of multidisciplinary teams.  While there are recruitment issues, I would come back to the issue of the senior social workers, and the report talks about 15 senior social workers in that area.  I do not expect the witnesses to give me a commitment today but it might be something they consider and I will come back to them on this.</p> <p>  On the issue of diversifying, I would make two comments.  Youth workers, in particular those involved in school completion programmes, the family support agencies and family support centres, are a huge asset and should form part of that.  I was at an amazing event yesterday for Valerie O&rsquo;Carroll, the manager of the Ballymun Family Resource Centre who retired yesterday, a woman with a tireless commitment to Ballymun and a tireless commitment to social justice.  We hope her replacement will be just as good.  Having those people on the ground supports the social workers who are in place.  Sometimes, people in the school completion programmes and the family support centres feel like the Cinderella of Tusla and they do not feel they get the priority and resources they deserve.</p></speech>

I am certainly extremely committed to this and, as I mentioned in my opening statement, I believe the community and voluntary sector is the bedrock of communities such as Dublin north city.  That is why I said I am concerned about the sustainability of some of the services.  I have been out to Ballymun and Finglas and to some of the after-school clubs, and I know the Minister has been out there as well.  Our service in Dublin relies critically on those and certainly, within what is in our range to give, we are very focused on building those supports, not just leaving them, as the Deputy said, to be somewhat taken for granted.</p></speech>

Perhaps Tusla might join me in putting as much pressure as possible on the Minister to also provide a capital programme for those family support centres because there is no point in funding the staff if they do not have a facility or premises.  In Finglas, certainly, we have had to put it together from multiple different pots, including Tusla, but there should be a dedicated capital programme.  I am out of time.  I thank the witnesses for their time.</p></speech>

An article appeared on Monday, 27 September, in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>where Mr. Gloster spoke at length in respect of private provision of residential care.  The article stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Mr Gloster said that many private care placements were working well but added: &ldquo;The bigger risk of that level of dependency on private care is private operators can leave the market; they can leave quickly, they can sell on; company structures can become very complex, and the reality is that if you have a private provider in a house with four young people, if that private provider left the market, the State has only one option and that is for us to take over that provision there&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>Is there a shift in policy in Tusla such that it is going to wind down private care providers?  Is that a signalling of a policy shift?  What is the real-time position in respect of that?  The witnesses might bear in mind that I have ten minutes and there are four questions I would like to ask.</p></speech>

In that interview, as in many others, I pointed to the fact that social care services in Ireland - in private nursing homes for the elderly, in the disability sector and in other areas - all have private provision.  There are some very good providers so I do not want to make this about disparaging any type of provision.  The point I was making in that article is very simply this: more than 60% of children in residential care are now dependent on private provision and that is far too significant a dependency for a sector that is populated by companies and organisations that can exit the market any time they choose to do so, or where other circumstances arise.  It is the level of dependency rather than the existence of the dependency.</p><p>The policy direction in Tusla is to come up with a plan, by the end of this year, to redress that balance and create more public provision.  That will take several years to achieve.  There is no doubt that we have reached the lowest number we will have in terms of children in residential care.  That number will probably increase slightly.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there is an entity called Positive Care, which is on Tusla's list of private providers.  A cursory look at the information for this organisation shows that it runs 13 or 14 houses.  Based on the ratios of staff to children, I conclude that there could be anything between 30 and 60 children being cared for across those services.  What does the future look like for an entity like Positive Care and why does such an organisation exist in the first instance?  It seems obvious that Tusla is not able to meet the provision it is required to deliver.  I am not trying to use loaded language here but such entities would not exist if Tusla, objectively speaking, were doing its job and making provision for those places within its own system.</p></speech>

However, we have to look at the context from which residential care provision came.  The extent of the growth of private provision is partly because the public sector, during more scarce times, did not invest in keeping public capacity at the level that was needed.  That is the first aspect.  The second point is that there has always been provision outside of the direct State provision.  There has been voluntary sector provision by NGOs, many of which had their origins in the religious orders that provided residential care in the past.  A large number of those organisations are no longer operating.  There are still some NGOs providing a service but part of that need was filled by the private sector.  When a State agency like Tusla is considering spending money on a service that it is not going to provide itself, EU procurement rules and all sorts of other rules, as we discussed, dictate that private providers are eligible to apply for that work.  There is a history and context to this.</p></speech>

This issue remains on the agenda of those meetings, as it does in my engagements with the Department and the Minister.  I am told that consideration is being actively given to amending the legislative provision to allow for that change, after which there would have to be a consideration of transfer of resource from Tusla to HIQA to allow the latter to undertake the inspections.  The same applied when the HSE allowed HIQA to take over inspections of private nursing homes in 2009.</p> <p>  As to when I envisage that transfer happening, I do not have a definitive timeline.  It is not within my gift.  I have been very clear that we do the inspections as well as we can and we do the monitoring very well.  We try to keep abreast of all the different providers to ensure the best level of safety.  I have repeatedly said that it is a fundamental contradiction of governance in the most basic terms that I am statutorily responsible for providing residential care for children - I am a provider and purchaser - but for half of that system, I am the regulator.  That does not make for good governance.</p></speech>

It is about as frank as one can get.  I hope the regime will change to reflect it.</p><p>Historically, the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported significantly on the cost of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  We are all mindful that the Child and Family Agency is about providing care for children and ensuring, in a court hearing or any judicial process, that the voice of the child is heard.  I am concerned about the costs of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  We had gone some way towards legislating for change in that area during the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il.  What is the Child and Family Agency's understanding of the status of the draft heads of a Bill to make changes to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service and what engagement has it had with the Department in that respect?</p></speech>

Legislation to put matters on a statutory footing is something I would welcome.  It would put the service at a step remove from Tusla, which would be appropriate.  The Deputy is correct in his point about the cost of the service.  Approximately half, if not slightly more, of the total legal spend in the agency goes on guardian <i>ad litem</i>services and associated legal costs.  It is a very significant cost in any one year and we do not have control over it.  We have some control over the fees, and the agency made an effort to bring some balance in that regard a few years ago.  There was a lot of activity on the legislation prior to the Covid crisis and in the previous D&aacute;il.  The pandemic has impacted that, as has the legislative programme of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  To be fair to the Secretary General of that Department, for whom I do not want to speak, it has had a very heavy programme, with the measures to do with information on tracing and other legislative demands.  Activity has resumed now on the legislation and I hope to see its passage through the Houses as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The challenge for us is to respond to those referrals as quickly as we can, particularly in terms of the level of priority we give to them as they come in.  What we hear from our HIQA inspections is that, at times, those referrals are not responded to in as timely a way as we would want to see happening consistently across the country.</p> <p>  A significant part of our reform programme, which has commenced, is around practice reform, which ultimately involves ensuring that when a referral is made to our services, our front door, which includes our social work, the diverse workforce and parts of our service such as the Tusla education support service, which was referred to earlier, can respond to it in the right way and at the right time.  To reassure the Deputy, our high-priority and child protection referrals are responded to as a matter of priority.  It is when we have particular referrals in regard to a low-harm situation or where a support role is required that there may be more of a delay in responding.</p></speech>

Out of that, we got some &euro;67 million coming in this year, which gave us a lot to work from, a good deal of stability and enabled us to reduce our historical deficit.  We have been able to remain in that position coming into the recently announced 2022 budget.</p><p>As all public service bodies do, we listed the various things we would like to do and their estimated cost.  While the initial estimate ran at approximately &euro;80 million, or whatever it was, we finished up with &euro;40.5 million.  We also have a capital allocation of approximately &euro;17.5 million.  From the point of view of a success of estimates in terms of what we ask for and what we get, I am quite happy we have done reasonably well to build on what we can.</p></speech>

I will take two or three significant ones figures.  A little while ago we talked about building additional public residential care capacity.  I will be able to do some of this in 2022 but I will not be able to do as much as I would have wanted.  This will slow down the pace at which we get to address the imbalance of private provision.</p> <p>  We indicated a need to bring the community and voluntary sector to a more sustainable level of certainty in future.  The cost of this was approximately &euro;10 million or &euro;11 million at the time we were doing the Estimate.  We will be able to do less of this.

This is down to external assessments we do on an agency's published accounts or other issues that may have turned up in the press or issues that may have turned up from review meetings we have had with agencies.  The audit and risk committee oversees the audit plan each year.  In terms of a plan of what we audit, the agencies that might be suggested for audit would include those that have been risk assessed.  General audit samples are also done to make sure within it there is a representative sample.</p> <p>  To clarify the number because I did not have the figures to hand, we did 82 audits between 2016 and 2020 on the funded agencies.</p></speech>

In his opening statement Mr. Gloster said he had been <i>in situ</i>with Tusla for 24 months.  I congratulate him on that, but I can imagine it has been a tumultuous 24 months, particularly for Tusla and all of the staff in the organisation with the work they do.  We acknowledge that.</p><p>Recently I asked two parliamentary questions about the number of front-line social workers in Dublin.  There were 506 whole-time equivalents in December 2020.  This fell by eight to 498 in June of this year.  Taking into consideration what my colleague Deputy McAuliffe referred to about Dublin north city, the parliamentary questions also confirmed Tusla was in the process of recruiting 181 social workers in Dublin to the end of August, and 102 posts were listed as recruitment complete, 48 of those posts accepted, 31 were posts in progress, and I am not sure what happened to the remaining 23.  Will Mr. Gloster confirm how many front-line social workers there are across the five Dublin Tusla areas currently, having recruited 102?  Have the people in those 102 posts started?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we offered every graduate a job, and 99 have accepted positions with us.  They are being taken on board at the moment.  It now just depends on their registration date being completed with CORU.  Some of them have already started.</p></speech>

The point was made by Ms Duggan that we also have social workers who are on the payroll but we have a high volume of maternity leave.  When we add this to the vacancies, I have no doubt this is having an impact in Dublin.  Equally, of the new posts we have funding for this year, which is in excess of 100 jobs, the majority of those posts were assigned to Dublin mid-Leinster and Dublin north-east.  This covers the Dublin city areas referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Some of the figures were supplied to me in response to a parliamentary question recently, just about two weeks ago, so I have that.  I also note from the figures that, as of December 2020, there were 1,169 staff members.</p></speech>

I might get to that later on in the second round questions because I am very limited for time.</p> <p>  Mr. Gloster mentioned the 99 new recruits, which is very welcome.  Based on a significant proportion of the staff working as front-line social workers, does Mr. Gloster feel there is adequate supervision and training, given that more than the 20% of the social workers are new starts?  It would be a relatively high level of untrained staff.  I am aware they have been academically trained, but in going into an organisation such as Tusla initially, is adequate supervision and training given to those new recruits?</p></speech>

To be fair to the Irish Association of Social Workers and others, there is good supervision given.  The pressure, the demands, and the volume of the work does interfere with that and interferes with the availability of the time we might desirably want to give to that.  Our chief social worker and his team are working on and have built additional measures to try to enhance supports, especially for people in the first two years of employment.  It is a continuously improving piece.  To be fair to young social workers or their supervisors, I would not want to say that by any means we could be complacent about it.</p></speech>

I appreciate what Mr. Gloster said earlier about those who leave the organisation in under two years or under five years.  Given the area in which some are working, be it the volume or types of caseloads, I appreciate this is going to be a challenge for some of them.</p> <p>  I turn to more operational matters.  In the accounts there is a cost of &euro;34 million for administration, payroll and so on.  Are social workers provided with mobile phones if they are working for the organisation?</p></speech>

It is very hard, even for Members of the Oireachtas, to engage with the organisation.  There is one email address and that is it.  Will this be reviewed under Mr. Gloster's tenure as CEO?</p></speech>

I recall that some months ago a social media post or mainstream media made reference to that issue of social workers not giving email addresses.  I did go looking to try to establish what was behind that and I genuinely could not land on it.  Every staff member of Tusla has an email address and every staff member who deals with the public would be obliged to provide that email address to the people they are dealing with so they can contact them and communicate with them.  There may be a small number of situations in which, for personal safety and security reasons, that may not be possible.</p> <p>  With regard to the mobile phone numbers, the mobile phone numbers and the contact numbers for the duty teams are all available on the website in terms of the landline.  The mobile numbers are more for emergency work and for work between the worker and the office.  They do give their mobile numbers to service users with whom they may be dealing, and the aftercare workers give their number to the young adults they work with.  It is not the case, however, that we could have every Tusla child protection social worker's mobile phone number generally available in the public domain.  The demand would be significant.  I refer back to my opening statement also.  It is important to say I have increasing evidence to be seriously concerned for the safety and welfare of my staff in certain contexts.</p></speech>

I do not want to demean it by any stretch of the imagination.  Given some of the extremely challenging areas and situations in which Tusla staff are working, I absolutely can appreciate why the mobile phone numbers would not be readily available.  I am talking about general run-of-the-mill cases.  Are business cards provided to staff?</p></speech>

I will talk to the staff and some of the people around the ways we have of communicating with groups who use our services.  If that is helpful, then I have no difficulty with that.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Gloster for that.</p> <p>  In my last minute, will Mr. Gloster confirm if Tusla carries out quantitative and qualitative research on the outcomes of cases, particularly across various socioeconomic areas and communities, to ensure the quality of treatment of all children?  Is that being done at present?</p></speech>

I had a fairly lengthy meeting yesterday with the group that developed the draft approach to that.  As I am sure the Deputy knows, outcomes is a longitudinal issue.  It was a recommendation going back as far as the Ryan report, if I am not mistaken, in respect of children in care.  It is something I am hoping to get further down the road with over the course of 2022.</p></speech>

I had to step out for a few minutes; the bilocation thing does not really work very well.  I apologise if I go over some of the same ground.</p> <p>  Mr. Gloster talked about the number of social workers and other staff on maternity leave.  How many people are out sick as opposed to on maternity leave?  Maternity leave is very different and is not an illness.  Does Tusla categorise the reasons?  There have been reports in the past of caseloads, fatigue and things like that.  Is that a factor?</p></speech>

One of the things we do is we try to separate out our residential care staff absenteeism from the rest of the workforce to get a better understanding because residential care has a particularly high absence rate.  That is to do with things like the stress levels the Deputy talked about but also very high incidence of assault and assault-related injury.  In relation to social workers, we do not measure the specific causes because a lot of people when they are certified as sick may choose to say it is work related or they may choose not to, so it is difficult.  I would have no doubt in agreeing with the Deputy that it is a factor.</p></speech>

He said the factor that has created a stable position was a one-off, but it is not an ongoing position.  I ask him to give a short explanation of some of those challenges.  I ask him to provide us with a note listing the 660 organisations by category.</p></speech>

We gave the community and voluntary organisations a 5% once-off increase this year to support them.  The Minister, to be fair, was very supportive in obtaining that.  Similarly, in the domestic violence sector, which is part of our funded sector, we did some additional interventions.  What I mean about sustainability fundamentally is this.  I do not think it will be any surprise to the Deputy.  A lot of agencies would have experienced retraction, cutbacks and reductions in different lines of funding during the economic crisis.  Some of those would have had that restored or had levels of recovery and others would not have.  Particularly for the agencies that are actually providing services to children and families with staff on the ground, their ability to pay staff at the rates that they can attract them is more compromised because of their financial position since the economic downturn.</p></speech>

We have in this country a very fragmented approach to service delivery.  If we are to move to a rights-based approach to the provision of services, we need to have control over those services.  Most of us who deal with the public will be aware of how threadbare the services are in some cases and it is a challenge.  In his opening statement, Mr. Gloster spoke about reforms in an agency that was set up in 2014.  Were some of these things not anticipated from the outset, given the way Tusla was set up?  Why are we into a reform process so soon after the setting up of an organisation?</p></speech>

There were lots of different competing priorities, I guess.  One of the things they did was they inherited a structure from the HSE which the HSE has long since abandoned.  In addition to that, the nature and type of crisis and work that arises in the course of an agency like Tusla added to the very significant events leading to the 2018 HIQA report, the Charleton tribunal and so on.  The agency became very centralised, very heavily dependent on the centre, to the point where there was no significant level of local autonomy and local authority, and all that goes with that.  The reform of the structure I pointed to is about correcting that imbalance.  That is just one part of many changes.  I will not draw the Deputy into the detail of all the others, but that is what it is about.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the cyberattack.  Some of Tusla's IT systems are under development at the moment.  What is the time and cost associated?  Are any Tusla systems still on Windows 7?  Did the risk register identify weakness and the potential of a cyberattack?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-10-21a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Gloster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021102100002#J01300"><p>The corporate risk register before the cyberattack identified the risk level because of our dependency on the wider HSE platform and the history of that platform.  That is the first thing.  The second thing is that the major part of the correction is moving the majority of ICT to being hosted on Tusla's own platform, which is called Tusla IRL.  The indicated cost of that between now and the middle of next year is about &euro;8 million.  That is entirely separate from the development of the next phase of the national childcare information system for which I do not have a cost yet, but that will come in 2022.  As we develop more capacity and more things, we will have more costs every year.</p> <p>  In relation to Windows 7, Tusla has worked exceptionally hard in the years since 2017.  We started with two or three ICT staff in 2017; I think we now have close to 65, moving to 100.  We have the most modern versions of laptops.  We have the most modern versions of connectivity that we can have through mobile phones, but because of our dependency on some parts of the HSE network we still may be dealing with older legacy systems.  By the time we get everyone over to Tusla, we will have everybody on Microsoft 365, which is one of the latest versions.</p></speech>

According to a reply to a parliamentary question I asked, the cost was &euro;12,000.  Is there an update on that in respect of 2021?</p></speech>

Two external investigations would sound extremely low, in fact.  In fairness, I would just need to check the provenance of the answer against the question that was asked.  I will come back to the Deputy on the 2021 figure.</p></speech>

The agency would, therefore, make a decision from time to time to move to an external investigation to give the greatest level of assurance possible and to give the greatest level of fairness as possible, indeed.  My preference is to try to come back to inhouse capacity as much as possible.  I have this month just established a new special investigations unit with two legally trained people who, from January, will take over a significant portion of that.  There will still be some external requirement in terms of complaints at a certain level but I would hope to reduce that.  External investigation covers everything from HR and protected disclosures to serious complaints from members of the public.</p></speech>

I may have missed some of the meeting because I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber so I apologise if I go back over issues that have been discussed.</p> <p>  I wish to talk about social workers and the demand on the system at the moment from various different areas of the Government agencies.  Regarding the recruitment of workers in this area, what level of co-operation or connectivity has there been with third-level colleges on this issue?  Is there a need for third-level colleges to expand the number of places in this area?</p> <p>  I have questions on colleges and the role of placement.  I mean where students are assigned a placement as part of their three or four-year course.  Has Tusla the capacity to take people in on placement?  Has work been done on the issue?</p></speech>

Yes, we have engagement with the universities at a number of levels.  Our chief social worker and his team are engaged with them at a developmental level.  The Department has a social work education group, which has the education sector on it also, and we are on that.  As I said in my opening statement, I have had engagement along with my chair with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  So they are all of the pieces to try and move it on.  To come to the core of the question, there were 184 graduates available from eight courses in Ireland this year and so far we are looking at a position where 144 registered with CORU.  That is what is available to Ireland and that is certainly the amount of available positions.  The need beyond Tusla exceeds that.</p> <p>  We did take some steps in recent years to try out different initiatives.  We did do a one-round scholarship programme with Maynooth University, which started a course.  We certainly got a reasonable yield out of that.  They are now continuing as a provider themselves.  We would look to sponsorship across the university sector in the future but it is something that we would have to get into more detailed planning about in terms of the cost and the return for it.</p> <p>  Again the chief social worker, who has a significant developmental role in social work practice in the agency, and his team, have put huge work into the provision of placements.  We have a high number of placement supervisors across our social work workforce.  We take a significant number of students.  Usually, half the students in training will come to Tusla for a placement either in the first or second year of their masters programme and then they go to other providers in disability services, mental health services and so on.  We, therefore, have very good placement capacity.  I have indicated to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that we could absorb another 50 placements if the colleges had those places in place to expand the supply.</p></speech>

Many different agencies need people with a social work qualification.  Have the universities set out a reason they are not increasing the number of places available?</p></speech>

For example, Sligo Institute of Technology, which traditionally was not a provider of social work training, set up a social work programme because they found that a number of their graduates from their social care programme wanted to go on and convert to social work, as well as others.  It is those types of initiatives for the future rather than just expecting the traditional courses to expand because there is demand in universities for expansion of lots of different programmes from social work to nursing and right across the spectrum of health and social services.  I think it is in the bigger mix of the university piece.  I do not think they are against creating places.</p></speech>

Some of them are at undergraduate level and others are at masters level.  People can come in with different backgrounds rather than just straight from school.  The programme structure has changed over the years.  As I say, it is probably quite innovative because-----</p></speech>

I would like to see the other institutes, or technological universities as some of them are now, following Sligo's lead.  We have an equal demand for social care workers and I would not like to see all of them becoming social workers either because we have to keep a spread across both.

I was involved in a project in Cork for many years that focused on young people who had dropped out of school.  We reviewed the programme of training we were providing because An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na referred many of the young people we worked with to us.  We reviewed the people who had gone through the programme in earlier years to see how they had fared since.  It involved looking at their employment and accommodation situation, etc.  It was a good review.  Has Tusla undertaken a review, say, five years after people have left foster care or residential care, to find out where they are, what they are doing and what levels of support they require?  Has Tusla undertaken such a review to see if there might be a need to amend the system in place?</p></speech>

That will take some time.  Individual pockets of work have been done.  Where we capture many of our care leavers and how they do after turning 18 is in the period up to 21 or 23 years with those who remain involved with the after-care system and are being supported by it.  That is about 3,000 people.  We see significant numbers going on to third level education.  For some, that is neither a suitable nor desirable option.  We have now started to provide alternative pathways for things like apprenticeships.  We have developed partnerships with the construction industry and other providers to create lots of different pathways for people.  With the development of after-care workers, we are now staying in touch with people longer so we are able to see how a lot of people are doing, certainly into their early 20s.</p></speech>

They are allowed, however, to develop their own different support mechanisms.  The level and type of supports they can provide to families, because they might have smaller numbers and smaller groups, is much more significant.  That is what is reflected in the associated costs.  The overall cost of private foster care is about &euro;22 million or &euro;23 million each year.</p></speech>

The cost of a placement through a private foster care provider is about &euro;1,000 a week.  As Ms Duggan pointed out, the basic rate of funding in respect of the foster care allowance is between &euro;325 and &euro;352.  On the costings we have done, there is a comparative cost when we add in the cost of staff.  We must compare it in terms of the private organisations providing staff in the areas of social care, legal services, etc.  We are looking at an approximate comparative cost of about &euro;800 <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the agency cost that we are paying of about &euro;1,000.  Therefore, there is a mark-up of about &euro;200 in that regard.</p></speech>

To clarify, as the CEO said, private foster companies have been in existence since before the agency was set up.  In many cases, they were there because we could not source foster carers in particular areas.  The challenge is that once a foster child enters care, the agency is very reluctant to move that child, certainly on the basis of cost.  A child might be moved on the basis of care, but not on the basis of cost.</p></speech>

Does the agency ever make contact directly with those placements, or the families who are engaged in the placements, to see whether they would be happy to move from a private care operation under Tusla's auspices?</p></speech>

It is open to foster carers with private companies to apply to register as general foster carers with Tusla, as indeed it is open to general foster carers with Tusla to register with private providers.  All of the families are approved through the Tusla approvals panel system, regardless of who they are with.

To be perfectly honest, some of the people I have met in foster care would say they believe Tusla has a reputation or Tusla would not support them as well if they were direct foster carers with Tusla.  Whether that is a real experience or is perceived or they have heard it somewhere, I am sure that informs part of their thinking.  I have met people, albeit a very small number, who have left Tusla foster care provision and would say the level of support they get is better from the private provider.  That is what people experience.</p></speech>

Obviously that makes economic sense and I also presume from a management point of view it is more difficult when dealing with a multiple number of outside agencies.  We all accept a certain number of them are necessary and I can see the amount spent on them decreased from &euro;32 million in 2019 to &euro;19.5 million last year.  According to the table in the briefing provided, for which I thank the witnesses, there are 55 social workers still employed by outside agencies that Tusla is using.  That has increased from 34 whole-time equivalents in 2020.  As of August this year it is 55.  What kind of difficulties does that cause with cases?  I am thinking about continuity in terms of a social worker being familiar with a particular family.  When dealing with an agency, anyone could turn up.  What kind of difficulties does that cause for Tusla in operational terms?</p></speech>

We have never breached that figure of 250.  In fact, we are staying at an average of around 210 or 211.  I certainly do not intend to let that get out of control.  The slight growth there is because agencies were able to give us available staff who wanted to work for a short-term period in a particular way or in a particular setting.  The reason we had to increase that was because of what Ms Duggan mentioned regarding the significant impact of maternity leave, Covid during maternity leave and staff leaving.  If you put all of that together, there is some pressure.  While I would rather have maximum in-house provision when it comes to getting social workers for children, we will take them in whatever way we can most expeditiously get them.</p> <p>  The Chairman is 100% correct about the impact on services.  Agency workers are very good but temporary agency staffing in a function like social work, except for the shortest period of time, does cause a level of disruption to continuity.  The difficulty with that fundamentally, and children would often articulate this, is that children have to get used to somebody new again.  They have to tell their story again and build that relationship again.  That is the nature of the impact of turnover in a profession like social work.  Like a lot of professions in the past decade, turnover is now a significant feature of it.  It would be foolish to say there is not an impact.</p></speech>

I hear this from constituents sometimes.  They say a different social worker shows up and they speak about starting again, as has been mentioned.  From a management point of view in a local area, this must create challenges in trying to maintain a level of care.</p></speech>

What I would say is that the constant tension for us as an organisation, and the management tension, is that we have cases waiting to have a social worker allocated.  We have a gap and we have a social worker who happens to be available for a period of time.  This certainly is a better service than no service.  In terms of continuity of care in what is a relationship-based profession, there is no doubt it has an impact.  I agree fully with the Chair on this.</p></speech>

It is very important that we highlight that somebody not having an allocated social worker does not mean they are not being provided with a service.  We also have a large majority of children, young people and families who are accessing our family support services.  They do not require the intervention of a social worker child protection response.  What they are receiving are family supports and early intervention services.</p></speech>

It is certainly that if we are looking at the services we provide just through a social work lens.  Obviously we need an increased number of social workers to meet our statutory obligations.  We recognise this.  What we also recognise, and one of the Deputies raised it earlier, is that some of the responses the children, families and young people require from us is not a social work response.  What we are looking at now is diversifying our workforce.  We have added an additional 120 front-line posts in the service in 2021 to meet increased demand.  We will be looking to add the same number of posts again for front-line supports.  These front-line supports are in domestic and sexual gender-based violence services, family support, early intervention and our therapeutic services.  We certainly have recognised this and we are very grateful to the Minister and his Department for increased funding for therapeutic services this year.</p></speech>

Earlier, Mr. Gloster referenced that in 2021 we allocated an additional 65 social workers.  They certainly went into the Dublin and midlands areas.  These were recognised as the areas where we needed them and where vacancies were more difficult to fill.  I can certainly get the information to the Chair on the existing number of social workers and the vacancies that are there.  It comes back to what Mr. Gloster said about new graduates this year.</p><p>We secured funding for 99 graduates this year and they are going to the areas of highest need.

In fact, in 2021 we made amendments to our respite protocol.  Prior to that, where a foster child went on respite, the allowance to the foster carer ceased, and that has now been changed so that when a foster child goes on respite, the foster carer continues to receive the allowance.  Where a foster child has specific needs that require additional support, we have a mechanism to provide enhanced payments to those foster carers for the specific needs of the children.</p></speech>

They are now being offered respite, but it is in Enniskerry.  The concern is that it is a long way for an autistic child to be removed for respite and for a family to have to travel in the event a difficulty arises.  I appreciate everything cannot be solved on the one day.  Is it the case that Tusla depends on the HSE to provide respite facilities?</p></speech>

I have one quick question.  I am concerned as to whether a family providing foster care is receiving more support.  If there is &euro;200 of a disparity, that does not seem like a lot of money for a private provider to be able to give more support for the care provided.  This family has a visit four times a year from a social worker, generally four different social workers, which they refer to as a box-ticking exercise, but they have received no response to requests for support.  I will communicate with Ms Duggan on the case directly.</p></speech>

A good foster care placement can make all the difference for a child.  Mr. Gloster indicated that for the 12 to 18 years category, &euro;350 is provided per week.  That is fine, but what happens when the child reaches 18 and, for example, is still in education?  What is the follow-through there?  That could be a cliff edge for a household that would be doing a great job but which would not have the financial wherewithal.  How is that dealt with?</p></speech>

One is the aftercare allowance Mr. Smyth outlined earlier, which is a significant allowance to the young person.  If the young person is staying on with the foster carer, which some often choose to do, some of that would contribute to the upkeep of his or her care.  In very exceptional circumstances, we will make provision directly to the foster carers if the young person needs that support and wants to avail of it.  During Covid-19, for example, I made a decision to extend the process for any child who was due to leave the foster care or aftercare system so that child could continue with the support he or she had for as long as he or she wanted.  That proved to be very successful.  There are supports there.</p></speech>

We called those out.  The statement on internal control is our own document where we identify our own weaknesses.</p><p>We have had an improving position in terms of governance over the moneys that are paid to funded agencies that work with us.  That is very much a work in progress because it is something that the Comptroller and Auditor General called out for special mention in the past.  The controls have improved significantly to a point where we now have robust controls engaged with those agencies.  They are not perfect, though, or at a level where we believe we can stand our efforts down.  As such, we continue to mention the weaknesses as something that the agency needs to address.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the Garda will deal directly with the callers.  Where the Garda would need to deal with the service provider, all domestic and sexual violence services are provided by the 60 organisations that we fund and I presume that Garda would deal with them if it needed to, but I believe individual contacts are being made with the caller, not with ourselves.  The Garda is aware that, because of our other working mechanisms, it could bring us in if, out of any work like an analysis of the 999 calls, it encountered a situation that it felt was relevant for us to be involved with or aware of.</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks at the residential care context, which I dealt with with Deputy Sherlock, the balance has gone over 50% dependency.  That is far too significant for us and is the piece that I want to correct.  It is not an all-or-nothing situation, though, as the private sector has a role to play.  The dependency rate in foster care is not anywhere near that level, so we do not have the same concern, but we have some concern.  I will be trying to find ways of developing our own fostering capacity in the public sector in order to maintain the number of children in publicly provided care at more than 90%.  Internationally, we are a leader in that regard.  We will be watching the situation.  It is the growth rate of private provision of residential care that is the concern, not its existence.</p></speech>

Based on the figures we were given, the reliance on private companies has increased by more than 10% since 2017.  If Tusla's objective is to reduce that level of reliance, then it is not achieving its objective.</p></speech>

Coming off the back of a pandemic, we perhaps had other priorities with our carers.  Leaving aside the issue of private providers for the moment, and many of them are very good, my more fundamental concern is that Ireland be able to maintain 90% of fostering in State care or the alternative care system, in which respect we are an international leader.  I can see that becoming increasingly difficult, though.  Society is changing, as are families' wishes and circumstances, and our ability to attract foster carers is reducing.</p></speech>

In terms of financial remuneration, the conditions in which the family operate are the same.  The only difference is the additional cost of employing a private provider, which is primarily the concern of this committee.</p></speech>

We have identified and are in the process of recruiting expertise in that space to increase our ability to recruit foster carers.  Second, we have identified the need to put additional supports into each of our new six regions in 2022.  There will be an additional liaison worker going into each region to support Tusla foster carers in terms of responding to families in a more timely and integrated way, meeting them and helping them deal with the challenges they face, particularly around sustaining foster care places.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses outline the role of Tusla in monitoring the private companies' work?  How does Tusla ensure that they are doing everything according to the same rules, regulations and standards as apply to Tusla's own carers?  Can the witnesses quantify the cost of that work?  When the cost of that monitoring and, for want of a better term, regulatory work is coupled with the additional cost of &euro;23 million and so on, do the witnesses not agree that the money would be better invested in Tusla's own services directly so as to ensure that every family that engages in the foster care scheme has a positive experience?</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point.  The staff Tusla uses internally are not additional and do not comprise a separate unit.  Rather, there is a cohort of staff in each region who engage with the private providers in respect of their service-level agreements.</p></speech>

No different from what we discussed with Deputy Verona Murphy, the variations across the country are vast and wide.  Some family resource centres have different points of focus in the work they do.  There is nothing wrong with that because they are responding to local needs.  The work of centres also crosses age ranges, so they do not just deal with children.  Their relevance is across a wider spectrum.</p> <p>  I do not have a fundamental objection to growing the programme, but I equally do not have a single-preference policy position of pursuing only that option.  In terms of their work with Tusla, what family resource centres provide to children and families is also provided by many other family support-like organisations that we fund and that are not in the FRC programme.  I am more focused on the development of family support services as part of what we do in each area, including Erris, than just on the family resource centres.  If a family resource centre started under the programme tomorrow, we would fund some core costs, for example, for a manager and an administrator, and perhaps some programme costs.  That of itself will not substantially increase the volume of services in an area at the very start, as it also depends on the level of service that we can develop.</p><p>I have received representations in respect of the Erris issue.  It is a difficult one to determine because there are obviously different views.</p></speech>

We look at the context of the full resource we are funding in any one area.  In some areas it could be another organisation that is not in the FRC programme but doing quite similar, if not the same, work.  We also look at the volume of our own staff in that area.  This year we drew a line across what services are in place, and determined that what exists, exists.  We now have to look at how we can bring everyone up to the same level.  We have just discussed Dublin and the dearth of social work services there.  In County Mayo, there is an excellent child protection, welfare and children in care service, which has been judged repeatedly so by HIQA, and there are some very good aspects.  However, we must try to support the area manager there, and indeed, those on the western, southeastern and southern seaboards, to develop more family support services.  If the best solution happens to be an FRC programme, we are not closed to the idea.  However, we are not pursuing a specific initiative singly focused on family resource centres.  We are focusing on the broader definition of family support services.</p> <p>  I told one of the Deputy's constituency colleagues last year that I would love to see the local authority in Mayo and other organisations coming together where they have interests in areas of disadvantage, and perhaps create a centre of a type.  I would be very happy for us to fund, support and seek additional funding to put family support staff and services into such a centre.  If it happens to end up being a family resource centre or something else, that is secondary, in my view, to the point of getting services into the area.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there were 774 notifications received in 2020 in respect of the early years services.  That figure was up from 403 in 2019.  What was the main driver of that increase?  What happened there?  It is significant that the number of notifications almost doubled in a year.   I refer to cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities.</p></speech>

So far this year, we have done approximately 1,800 inspections.  Last year, I believe we did a similar number of inspections, which is less than what we were doing before Covid.  Obviously, many of the services were closed last year during the pandemic.  There are 53 new providers this year.  Perhaps they are the notifications to which the Chair has referred.  According to the most up-to-date figures, 53 new providers have registered with us this year.  We have also been notified of 122 closures of providers across the system.  Separately, there are-school age providers, who mind children of school age and after-school and so on, and the number of them is increasing.  That is the level and type of activity.  I hope I have answered the Chair's question.</p></speech>

I am asking about the 774 notifications of complaints of incidents in 2020.  That increased from 403 in 2019.  The number of such complaints almost doubled in 2020 in comparison to 2019 from 403 to 774.  What is the main driver of that?  What happened there?  What caused that?</p></speech>

Those 90 concerns triggered 17 inspections.  The Chair may recall that during the previous D&aacute;il, I met the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children and Youth Affairs.  I believe Deputy Sherlock was a member of that committee.  When I met that committee, I committed to developing and increasing the opportunities for parents to be more fully informed about inspection activity and for them to participate in it, effectively.  We have done that incrementally over the past 18 months.  Covid distorted it because centres were closed.  We are starting to see an increase in notifications, complaints and issues.  That is probably because we have a better reporting system.  It is not necessarily indicative of the service deteriorating in any particular way.</p></speech>

There were 460 claims against Tusla in the most recent five-year period.  As I understand it,152 claims were made in 2019, representing the highest number of claims in that period.  The average for the five-period was 75 claims per year.  Why was the number of claims made in 2019 so high?</p></speech>

I am not sure, and I do not want to mislead the Chair, if the claim count in 2019 is instant from an incident in previous years that happened to come to fruition in 2019.  I would need to check that.  The general feature of damages claims against the agency, apart from what we might refer to as public liability slips, trips and falls material, is that they fall into the categories of cases where people pursue a claim because they have either been abused or mistreated by some aspect of the public services or some aspect that the public services have oversight for, or cases of staff who have been assaulted or significantly impacted on by work-related events.  They are two of the significant categories of claims.  Many of the abuse claims tend to relate to historical events, which may only emerge in subsequent years.  Perhaps Mr. Smyth can add to the response to the question relating to claims made in 2019.</p></speech>

The ongoing challenge for us, which we pointed to earlier, is that staff in residential services encounter assault and other issues that are uncommon in other work environments.  A number of claims result from that.  There are also historical claims, which go back quite a number of years and are still being dealt with by the State Claims Agency.  The agency gathers a lot of data, which can be provided in quarterly breakdowns of the types of claims.  That information is publicly available and we are quite happy to share that with the committee.</p></speech>

Are any steps being taken to reduce that figure?  When Tusla procures legal assistance and representation, does it go through a full procurement process?</p></speech>

The total legal bill for 2020 was more than &euro;30 million.  Mr. Gloster pointed out earlier that around half of that relates to guardians <i>ad litem</i>and the associated guardian<i>ad litem </i>costs.  In respect of our own costs, we have a full procurement process.</p><p>In real terms, when we go through that procurement is quite an extensive process.  We are just finalising the current round of that.  Those procurement agreements last between three and four years and are fixed-price agreements which do not really expand as work expands.  It is effectively for the work for Tusla in particular regions.  Obviously, there are exceptions, but that is tightly managed and is a process on which we have done significant work over the past seven years to make sure it is there.  There is a lot of control around that expenditure.</p></speech>

I suspect part of the figure to which he is referring may also include the regulatory requirement where service providers would have had to notify incidents of Covid-19 when they reopened.  That is possibly part of the explanation of the figure the Chair mentioned.</p></speech>

It can be a useful way of spending resources, in terms of being proactive rather than reactive.  Diversionary programmes can be included in that.  It appeared to be very patchy around the country, where new services were not developed.  Does Tusla have a capacity review of youth services or is it looking at what the needs for youth services are around the country?  These services can be a very good use of funding.  We get a lot from them for very little.  Spending on youth services was very static and there appeared to be a postcode lottery.  Without additional funding coming in, it did not look as though there was any prospect of new services being provided where there have been demographic shifts.</p></speech>

For&oacute;ige does some of our engagement programmes with young people and so on.  If I am not mistaken, the predominant programme of youth funding for the youth sector is done outside of Tusla.  It is a Department-led construct and the two would need to be put together to get the full picture.  I am certainly happy to come back to the Deputy with further detail.  As to the Deputy's point, no more than what I said earlier about people who could become very effective in the child protection, child welfare and family support systems in multidisciplinary teams, I include the youth sector in that.  It plays a critical role in communities and keeping young people much safer than they would otherwise be.</p></speech>

What tends to happen with many foster carers is they come into foster caring, are approved and assessed and work for a number of years.  They may provide short-term placements, but those providing long-term placements may just reach a particular point in life where they feel they have done that and they maintain connections with the young people they had, but do not take new placements.  I will certainly see if we can get the Deputy some accurate information on that.</p></speech>

When a social work service does not make a timely notification to the Garda, it might be that it is working the case in great detail and is waiting to tidy up some information, but the Kerry situation was indicative of a significant problem.  I was not assured that we could satisfy ourselves by just responding to the Kerry incident, so we did a national self-assessment audit with our 17 area managers.  We arrived at a position where the best estimate we had was approximately 12% to 13% of what legitimately should be notified to the Garda as suspected abuse was not being or had not been notified on time.  We have put in place significant correction and audit measures to check that is now more effective.  Of course, there will always be individual incidents and slips, given the number of notifications we make to the Garda and the number we receive.  Apart from the corrective action taken on the Kerry situation, there is also a disciplinary action by way of an investigation, which is just about to come to conclusion.</p></speech>

I will quickly run down through the accounts.</p> <p>  The first is the Insurance Compensation Fund for 2020.  It is a clear audit opinion and I draw attention to chapter 14 of the report on the accounts of the public services 2020, which examines the controls over the assessment and collection of the Insurance Compensation Fund levy.</p> <p>  Nos. 2 and 3 are related. The first is the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, for which there is a clear audit opinion.  Related to that is the Broadcasting Fund, which is a separate account but is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and again there is a clear audit opinion for that fund.</p> <p>  No. 4 is TG4 for 2020.  I draw attention to a case of significant non-compliant procurement in that case.  This related to an ICT contract to develop a system for use by TG4 but it was not competitively procured. </p> <p>  No. 5 is the Social Insurance Fund and it is quite a significant account.  I can see that there is a typo there.  The turnover of the fund should be &euro;14.8 billion not &euro;14.8 million.  There is a clear audit opinion on this but I draw attention to two chapters from the report and the accounts of the public services.  Chapter 9 deals with regularity of payments and chapter 11 takes a deeper look at the pandemic unemployment payment scheme, the bulk of which was charged to the Social Insurance Fund.</p> <p>  Nos. 6 and 7 are related.  These are the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal special account and the Hepatitis C and HIV compensation reparation fund.  There is a clear audit opinion in both cases there.</p> <p>  No. 8 is the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which gets a clear audit opinion. </p> <p>  No. 9 is the Crawford Art Gallery Cork Limited, which gets a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  No.10 is the Environmental Protection Agency, which received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> No. 11 is the Heritage Fund for which there is a clear audit opinion.</p><p> No. 12 is the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  I gave it a clear audit opinion but I draw attention to the recognition of a deferred pension funding asset on the basis that this asset will be payable.  The NSAI raises almost all of its funding from charges to service users and does not draw on the State but, as I said, it is accounting on the basis that the asset will be payable by the State in the future.</p></speech>

The collection is managed by the Revenue Commissioners on behalf of the Central Bank.  The moneys in the fund are used in the first instance at the direction of the High Court where there is potential for a default in insurance compensation.  The levy is at a rate of 2%, is charged on all relevant insurances on business in Ireland and is payable into the fund to meet the compensation.  To meet the compensation in the first place, a loan was issued from the Exchequer.  I think the figure was about &euro;1 billion in total.  As the levy proceeds are collected, they are being used to pay back the Exchequer.</p></speech>

No. 834 B is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 18 October 2021, providing information requested by the committee regarding mental health facilities in Cork.  While this was received after the cut-off for this week&rsquo;s correspondence, and the clerk raised this with me, it has been added for today&rsquo;s meeting because, as pointed out by Deputy Hourigan, it is a time-sensitive matter, particularly with regard to the proposed closure of the Owenacurra centre.  Essentially, the HSE&rsquo;s position is that there are a range of unacceptable deficiencies and issues with the premises and it states that investment of significant funding into the building would still not bring it up to an acceptable accommodation standard for residents.  On that basis, the decision was taken to close the centre.  I do not know if Deputy Hourigan is with us.  I do not think she is.  Do any other members wish to speak on that?</p></speech>

I do not think that committee has seen the correspondence we received so I think it should be made available to it.  Should both committees be dealing with this?  Should a decision be taken about which committee should focus on it rather than two committees dealing with it?</p></speech>

It would be helpful if the correspondence we received was made available to the Committee on Health.</p></speech>

Deputy Buckley raised it with me in recent days.  The report we have here is quite concerning.  It appears to me the problem is as a result of a historical lack of investment.  Time and again we see services are depleted to such an extent that the HSE then tells us they must be removed because they are in such a poor state.  It is quite concerning.  Obviously, we have a different role from that of the Oireachtas Committee on Health because our job is to look at public expenditure and whether there is value for money.  In line with Deputy Burke's proposal, I suggest we forward the correspondence to the members of the Oireachtas Committee on Health to make sure they have it and possibly request that committee to indicate whether it is planning to pursue this issue and whether it sees a role for us that would help it in its deliberations.  I agree we do not want to duplicate work but we have an obligation to ensure this issue is investigated fully by the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I came across a very similar situation in another part of the country.  There were 27 residents in that facility.  Nine people died during a two-week period because of Covid and because there were six people per room.  I am not talking about the Owenacurra centre in Midleton.  It was a geriatric psychiatric facility.  Nine people died in a two-week period.  That facility is undergoing refurbishment.</p><p>All of the inpatients had to be moved out for a period of more than 12 months because of extensive renovation work that is needed.  My understanding is that the renovation work is going ahead in that facility.</p></speech>

We will also forward it to the health committee and include the question from Deputy Carthy as to whether, in that committee's opinion, this committee is required to examine the matter further.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next business is the work programme.  The D&aacute;il is not scheduled to sit next week.  That brings us to 4 November, when we are planning to engage with RT&Eacute; on its receipt of Exchequer funding, which is now the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  A representative from the Department will be in attendance.</p> <p>  When we agreed our work programme to the end of the year last week, I mentioned that we might need to reschedule some engagements depending on availability.  The secretariat received a response from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to advise that it is scheduled for oral parliamentary questions on 11 November, which is the date on which we wanted departmental officials to attend.  Representatives of the Department of Transport were scheduled for 25 November but have agreed to swap with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 11 November.  The secretariat has requested that the officials from the Department of Transport make available to the committee the information we have requested on MetroLink, BusConnects, the DART and the strategic rail fleet review no later than 5 November, to ensure we have it before the meeting on 11 November.  I note that there is information flagged up regarding the search and rescue service, which is included in the invitation to the meeting.</p> <p>  Accordingly, the schedule, which is reflected in the work programme circulated for today's meeting, is revised as follows: 4 November, Exchequer funding of RT&Eacute;; 11 November, Department of Transport; 18 November, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; 25 November, Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; 2 December, Office of the Revenue Commissioners; 9 December, Department of Social Protection; and 16 December, Department of Health.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to revisit the work programme for the new year in late November or early December.  I suggest that we do so at the end of November rather than letting it go on too long.  The list of engagements to the end of the year has been circulated.  Does any member wish to raise any other matter relating to the work programme?  As no matters have been raised, that concludes our consideration of the work programme.</p> <p>  Finally, under any other business, I note that we have work to do on a number of reports, which we will discuss in private session.  Do members want to raise any other issues?  As there are no other matters to discuss, we will, as agreed, go into private session, after which we will adjourn until 4 November, when we will engage with representatives of RT&Eacute; on Exchequer funding.</p></speech>
