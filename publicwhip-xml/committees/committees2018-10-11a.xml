We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee and he is joined by Peter Kinsley, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings on 27 September and 4 October agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  A couple of matters arise from the minutes which I want to move through quickly.  Some are of particular interest to our work.  In the minutes of the meeting of 27 September we referred to item of correspondence No. 1585 from the Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, regarding the Tax Appeals Commission which is doing an independent review of staffing requirements and it was agreed that the Department keep the committee updated on the review.  I do not think we have yet got a copy of the review.  The Minister announced on budget day that it was published.  It should be here by now and we want that urgently because the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is coming in next week.  </p> <p>  At that meeting we dealt with correspondence from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills regarding the contribution of the religious congregations to the cost incurred by the State for residential institutional child abuse and he gave us an appendix in that letter, which we received on 23 July, about several properties and transactions that were to be completed by the end of quarter 3, 2018, which was the end of September.  We expect to see the outcome of that by next Thursday and to see whether that the promise made in July has been fulfilled.  We want that for next week because it should be completed.  It is a question of sending us that summary.  </p> <p>  In respect of correspondence No. 1507 from Mr. Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the general indemnity scheme that arose when we were talking about local authorities, he will be here next week to discuss the Office of Public Works, OPW.  We want that report before he comes in.  Nobody has any work to do on it.  I do not know how long the report has been sitting there.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#B00400"><p>We did say in the minutes that we would include the national broadband plan and the information and communications technology, ICT, programme for the Department in our work programme for that meeting.  We want answers to every single item of correspondence we have sent to the Secretary General of the Department in recent months before he appears here next week.  Maybe we have got all the replies but I would like that doublechecked.</p> <p>  The next item arising out of the minutes of the last meeting, on 4 October, is that we noted all the financial statements over the course of the summer.  We noted with regard to No. 412, that the accounts of the Dublin Greyhound and Sports Association Limited were certified in June 2018 and were received in August 2018.  It received a clear audit opinion and the Comptroller and Auditor General noted on the documents given to us last week that the committee ceased trading in February 2017 and the agreement was reached for the sale of the premises, Harold's Cross Stadium, for &euro;23 million, which is sufficient to allow the company discharge its residential liability.  I think that is a fair assessment of how the price was arrived at.</p> <p>  Arising from the minutes we want a detailed report from the Department of Education and Skills on how it felt it was appropriate to spend &euro;23 million of the schools land acquisition budget to bail out the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.  It would have been far more transparent if the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had wanted to bail out the IGB and clear its debts to put in a supplementary Estimate and do it that way.  That might have been in breach of state aid rules but maybe it said if it put a value on the asset and got another Department to buy the asset for &euro;23 million perhaps that would not breach state aid rules.  I do not know if that was a factor.  Bord na gCon was in here some time ago a day or two after this sale was announced but there was a lack of candour.  It did not tell us that it had two in-house valuations discussed by its own board of &euro;6 million and &euro;12 million.  That was not made known to the committee. </p></speech>

I will call members to speak because I am not letting this issue pass.  It specifically arises out of the minutes the last day when we noted the accounts.  We want a detailed report from the Department of Education and Skills.  It wrote the cheque.  The IGB is the happy camper.  It got its money.  We want a detailed report on how it agreed to pay the &euro;23 million and whether that was that included in its Estimates for that year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#B00700"><p>It is a 2018 expenditure.  The agreement was made in 2017 but the payment occurred only in 2018 and it was provided for or at least it had budgeted for it in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#B00800"><p>It will talk about the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Office is a State body and all State assets are a matter of concern to it, including the assets of Bord na gCon and the Department of Education and Skills.  It was not working for the Department, it was working for the State.  Whether that asset transferred for &euro;2 million, &euro;22 million or &euro;42 million is a matter of indifference to the Valuation Office because the land was staying in State ownership, either with the Greyhound Board or the Department of Education and Skills.  Its setting of a price is not the issue.  The issue is why the Department agreed to proceed with the payment of &euro;23 million.  It is very coincidental.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General remarked it was sufficient to allow the company, Dublin Greyhound Sports Association Limited discharge its residential liability.</p> <p>  I am suggesting that next Thursday, when the Department of Education and Skills is here with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, we must allocate a separate portion of the meeting, maybe before we bring in the HEA, whether it is 30 minutes or an hour, to discuss this payment out of its budget, if members are agreeable.  It is fishy to say the least that the Department of Education and Skills came up with &euro;23 million to solve the greyhound board's problem.  This is arising strictly out of the minutes of last week's meeting. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#B00900"><p>There is a report today in <i>The Times</i>, Ireland edition, by Sean McCarthy who has done some good work on this through freedom of information.  Under circular 11/15 Bord na gCon as the seller, being a State body, was obliged to go to the Valuation Office.  It went to Savills, a private valuation company instead.  It never went to the Valuation Office.  My first question is why did it breach that circular.  The purchaser, the Department of Education and Skills, then had the valuation done on a property which it did not own and is counter to the circular because it is the State body selling that goes to the Valuation Office.  We now know the difference between the two prices which amounts to &euro;11 million.  We need to find out why the IGB did not go to the Valuation Office as it should have done and what prompted the Department of Education and Skills to go to the Valuation Office.  Surely it is aware of this circular too.  Would it not have found out that the IGB should have gone to it and if the IGB did not go to it and was aware of it did it not ask why?</p><p>Did the Department of Education and Skills not ask why it rather than the IGB was going to the Valuation Office, as per the protocol and the circular?  A reason would have been needed for the Department to be informed that it had to take an action, that being, to get the valuations done.  This brings me to the need to determine who knew what in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Education and Skills.  There is no way that the latter could have gone to the Valuation Office, given that it would have been aware of the circular stating that the IGB should go to the Valuation Office.  Who told it?  How was the Department aware that it should go in breach of the circular?  Were there discussions between the two Departments and between Bord na gCon, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Education and Skills?  We need to find out all of that.  Ultimately, we need to find out why the Department of Education and Skills accepted the requirement to pay this amount of money, which I understand was &euro;23 million of a total budget for land purchases of &euro;28 million, or more than three quarters of its money for the year.</p></speech>

Their happy attitude, based on their understanding that this bailout was effectively coming anyway, raised questions about what it was that people understood was really happening.  There was no transparency in the process.</p> <p>  What galls me is that the Department of Education and Skills wrote the cheque.  Did the Department get value for money?  We all have constituencies, and I have several schools on my books for which I am trying to get sites acquired.  The Department has come back with reams of stuff to the effect that this or that site is not value for money, but those amounts pale into insignificance compared with Harold's Cross.  I would like to know how consistently the Department is applying its methodology if one deal can be justified as being value for money when the smaller projects that we are dealing with are not.  It would shine a light on the situation.</p></speech>

I will be as brief as I can.  Questions were asked of the Department and Bord na gCon when they were last before us.  Casting my memory back to the exchanges, it was not a good showing from the board and its CEO.  Their performance left much to be desired.  The overall question related to whether a bailout had been given by a Department to an organisation audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely, Bord na gCon, which is accountable to us, and whether the sale of the property was effectively that bailout.  I was not aware of the two valuations and I am unsure as to whether the Comptroller and Auditor General was at the time.  Maybe that information would not have come across his desk anyway.</p></speech>

We need to be focused in how we approach this.  It may require more than one session.  There are many issues involved.  Before Thursday, can we separate out the issues that we know will be returning to us, given the forthcoming reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General and other reports that we still must reach, for example, the Thorn report, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report into Limerick and the Waterford report?  We could deal with them when they are before us.  I want to have a sense of what it is exactly that we will be doing on Thursday.  What are the issues that we want to put to the HEA?</p></speech>

For example, if I owe &euro;5,000 to Bank of Ireland and I have a &euro;5,000 overdraft in Permanent TSB, I pay the cheque off that.  When that is paid off, then I start paying off the Permanent TSB one and the money keeps going around in circles.  If this was a bailout for Bord na gCon, it should be called that.  Do not treat the people like fools and claim that this was worth &euro;23 million.  Pages 48 to 56 of the transcript of the meeting of 18 May 2017 contains the exchange on the valuation.  Bord na gCon stated that it had received a valuation from Savills.  Whether it was a red book valuation or one that was invoiced out at &euro;10,000 plus VAT, companies like Savills are not going to risk their reputations over a Mickey Mouse fee, which is what that amount would be to it, by valuing it at &euro;12 million and not referring to it as a formal valuation.  A valuation is a valuation.  It might not have been accompanied by the 50 pages and background material that accompany a full valuation, but neither was it a verbal or informal valuation of &euro;12 million that then became &euro;23 million.  In fact, it would not even become &euro;12.1 million.</p> <p>  This is a disgrace.  This is Departments clearing up the sloppiness of organisations' debts.  Arguably, Dublin City Council is implicated.  It voted down a rezoning for the private sector.  I am not saying that was right or wrong, but everyone was at the party.</p> <p>  My next point probably feeds into some of the matters that we will discuss with the OPW, but no one is paying the price.  Consider how this was structured.  If it was a State bailout of Bord na gCon, that is fine.  Was the Minister involved, did he know and did the Government sanction it?  If so, fair enough.  Alternatively, was this creative accounting by officials on the premise that a school was needed in that area - of course it is - and here was the money to pay for it?  A figure of &euro;23 million?  Forget it.  I valued it.  I do not have the experience of Savills, but zoned as it was, I think it amounted to &euro;750,000 per acre.  If it had the appropriate institutional zoning, that could have increased to &euro;1.5 million in cost to the Department of Education and Skills.  The Savills valuation was slightly higher than that at &euro;12 million.  I said at our previous meeting that, once Bord na gCon was prepared to supply it to us, we would see that the Savills valuation would be substantially less than &euro;23 million.  Although the witnesses told us that it was sensitive information because the deal had not yet been closed, I asked them to provide it to us for our examination.  I assume it did not come.</p></speech>

It has taken hours even to read a little bit for today, and then we are waylaid into something else.  There is the issue of Bord na gCon and the Department of Education and Skills, and I definitely agree with Deputy Cassells that we need a separate session.  We struggled to try to make this open and accountable and it certainly did not happen.  If a freedom of information request is trumping a constitutional committee, we are in serious trouble.  It has serious implications for all the other work on our desk.  I asked from the very beginning about staff, and the Chairman was very supportive of the staff, but this is a big issue.  If this is the committee to which the public is looking to try to bring some measure of accountability, we cannot continue like this.  It is not possible.  I for one cannot continue like this.  That is a bit of an exaggeration, but it has taken a huge amount of work for all the Deputies-----</p></speech>

The &euro;12 million valuation we hear about is now only &euro;12 million if it was for housing.  In fact, it was a lower valuation if it was for something else.  I think I recall &euro;6 million being talked about, so it is actually multiples of what the valuation was when one considers that if it had been a site for a school, the amount of the valuation would have been an issue.  What is really getting to be more than infuriating is that the word "candour" has been used in here and commercial sensitivity almost inhibits the candour we require of public bodies to hold them to account.  They can come in here and validly say a matter is commercially sensitive and that they cannot tell us whether there is a valuation, and then it can end up in the newspaper.  The whole issue of commercial sensitivity is therefore something we must find some way of defining or find a way through when we are trying to deal with an issue such as this.  It feels to me like they bought something in Limerick, they ran into trouble, they were not getting the numbers in Limerick, they had to sell one of the assets, the asset that would get them out of trouble was Harold's Cross, but Harold's Cross would not get them out of trouble unless it was of a particular value, and it was not of that particular value if the valuation that appeared in the newspaper at the weekend was the true valuation.  Can we go back and get a valuation on it, even at this stage?</p></speech>

The Accounting Officer for the Department, the Secretary General, when he was here, however, was absolutely adamant that they were paying at market value.  It strikes me now that maybe they were not, given the information we have, which to me is serious.  What was fishy, to use the Chairman's word, at the time was that the valuation, or what was actually paid, almost hit the bulls eye in terms of the debts that were owed.  That is what jumped out of the pages - why does the valuation pretty much come in at the amount in legacy debts the organisation had?  It seems that our concerns and what was pretty obvious to many of us at the time have now come to pass.  A separate session is therefore needed, to be fair, to get to the bottom of this.  We need the Department and Bord na gCon in at the same time.  To have them in separately would be wrong.  Both need to be here at the same time for us to get to the bottom of this.</p></speech>

I agree with what members are saying.  I think it needs to be a separate session.  This is a symbolic issue, however, given what is going on and what people are saying here and how we can actually do our job.  There is the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Bord na gCon, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Valuation Office, which I think comes under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, does it not?

I am not asking whether we should have a doctor instead.  It is not a case of either-or.  I have asked Mr. McCarthy before whether we value State assets as a matter of form.  We do not.  We just have a book value versus what it was booked at last year.  I think that is remiss of us as a State, not a reflection on Mr. McCarthy, and it is something he should look at.</p></speech>

There are three categories, the first of which is category A.

We will note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  No. 1632A is correspondence received from the Office of Public Works, enclosing the opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish the correspondence.</p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and/or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publishing.  We held over a number of items from last week&rsquo;s meeting.  I propose that we continue to hold them over until we work them into our work programme.

It runs to hundreds of pages and contains a huge amount of interesting information which, in itself, would almost warrant a follow-up meeting with the HSE and the Department.  For example, some of it deals with the expenditure of &euro;176 million on private ambulances, which is an extraordinary sum.  There are issues surrounding CervicalCheck and how the audit was carried out.  That plays into what Dr. Scally said yesterday to the effect that, because the audit process had concentrated only on women who had cancer, it was not really a proper audit.  It was never recorded in the risk register.  There are issues at Mount Carmel with the private operator which is managing it.  It was meant to be managed on a temporary basis, but it will now be long-term.  The company is owned by Mr. Denis O'Brien, something which will raise concerns for some as he seems to have his finger in lots of pies.  There are lots of other issues such as those surrounding the figure for private patient debt - &euro;270 million - in acute hospitals.  There is extraordinary stuff in the report.</p></speech>

It is very easy for them to say they will send the correspondence afterwards.  It is our job to hold them to account for money that is spent.  There is no point in them giving us information afterwards because it is never put to the test or scrutinised.  We receive a large volume of documents after a meeting which we should receive in advance.  Is there a way we can be smarter about what we do, perhaps by requesting some information before they come to make sure they will have it available?  There are 400 pages.</p></speech>

It is easy for them to do so.  They go out through the door and we receive the stuff afterwards, but we do not follow up on it because we have too much to do and our staff are too busy.

If we are not happy, we do not let much go once we receive the information in writing.  However, because of its sheer volume, it has us snowed under.  The point has been well made.  We need to discuss it one of the days in private session.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 1538, correspondence received from Mr. Ray Mitchell, providing further information.  </p> <p>  No. 1560 is correspondence received from Dr. Barry O'Connor, Cork Institute of Technology, which we have held over, but we will come back to it.  We will also hold over No. 1561.  There is nothing new in any of it.  However, No. 1609 is new.  It is correspondence, dated 2 October 2018, received from Mr. Derek Finnegan of the parliamentary affairs division of the Department of Health on a capacity review, providing information requested by the committee on the health service capacity review, including details of the audit of empty beds in public hospitals.  We will note and publish the correspondence, to which we will come back.</p><p> No. 1614 is from Mr. Nick Reddy, private secretary to the Taoiseach, in response to our inquiry regarding data protection issues and commissions of investigation.  This seems to be a copy; we dealt with the matter previously.  The letter states that changing the terms of reference of a commission of investigation would not change the general law which applies to commissions of investigation and data protection.  In other words, the Taoiseach was saying that they have powers of the High Court when carrying out their investigations.  In the context of data protection, therefore, they can make their own orders regardless.  We will publish that.</p><p> The next item is correspondence held over from the last meeting.  There is correspondence from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We have noted it before and we hold it over.</p><p> No. 1572 is related to the previous item.  We have noted it and held it over.</p><p> Nos. 1605 and 1616 relate to the remediation of a landfill site in County Wicklow.  We will note and hold that over.  At our meeting on 27 September, we agreed to send the response from the Department to the correspondent and last week we noted that the secretariat had done this.  The individual has since responded to say that he believes the issues will be ventilated and resolved in due course.  We note this correspondence.</p><p> Nos. 1611 and 1612, dated 4 October 2018, are from an individual regarding human resources, HR, practices in the HSE.  We sent the individual a response received from the HSE which confirmed that all divisions of the organisation and the section 38 agencies were notified of the provisions of the agreement and of the necessity of advising those who had been unsuccessful in their applications for regularisation or who had otherwise not received any outcome to their applications.  This further correspondence requests that committee make inquiries with the HSE regarding evidence that it circulated the circular to the relevant staff.  I propose to forward the item to the HSE - in redacted form, if necessary - for a response to the questions raised.  This is an ongoing issue.  The HSE claims that it informed everybody about this matter regarding one of the pay agreements.  People could apply for regularisation.  Members of staff are saying that they never received notice and, as a result, we want the HSE to prove its statement that people were notified.  If there was a breakdown in communication from the top level to the people on the ground, we need to know where it happened.</p><p> No. 1613 is correspondence, dated 29 September 2018, from an individual questioning the Department of Defence's spending on ships at a time when, according to the correspondent, wages and allowances are driving personnel out of the Naval Service.  Essentially, this correspondence states that we have eight naval ships but only enough staff for seven.  The Naval Service is bringing a ninth ship into service.  There might only be sufficient staff for six by the time that vessel comes into service.  While this is a staffing issue, it is also a financial issue because what is the point in having nine vessels if we do not have the people to man them?  We are writing to the Secretary General of the Department of Defence for a detailed response.</p><p> No. 1615 is from a co-ordinator in Chartered Accountants Voluntary Advice.  We dealt with this at a previous meeting.  The secretariat has already sent the transcript to the correspondent and communicated the decision of the committee which was that we considered the matter closed at our previous meeting.  I think the correspondence essentially crossed in the post; that is all.</p><p> No. 1617 dated 5 October 2018 is from the whistleblowers who corresponded with the committee regarding issues at the University of Limerick.  We had said that we would meet them and they are inquiring about where that stands.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report on handling of remuneration for certain senior staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology Sligo is related to this and is with the Minister.  We expect to receive it shortly.  I propose that we arrange a meeting following that to engage with the two whistleblowers mentioned.  We will inform them accordingly.  I ask the secretariat to set up the meeting with those people and to come back to us with a time for it.</p><p> No. 1623 is correspondence from Deputy David Cullinane providing radio clips relating to Waterford Institute of Technology and the McLoone report.  Does the Deputy want to speak about this?</p></speech>

We are now in October of the following year and there is still no report.</p> <p>  The concerns I raised at our previous meeting were not necessarily directed at Waterford Institute of Technology, they were directed at the HEA and whether it had dotted the i's and crossed the t's with the terms of reference and, perhaps, overreached in the context of the scope of the report.  Anything we put on the record is a matter of fact.  We know, as a matter of fact, that strong legal letters were issued by a number of individuals, as is their right.  They felt that the draft report might have been unfair to them.  That is how it appears and that is what Dr. Love told us previously.</p> <p>  Obviously the HEA needs to protect itself.  I have no difficulty with that.  People are entitled to due process.  If people have concerns, they have a right to take legal action and that is what is happening.  At no point did anyone ever undermine their right to do that.  However, what the Accounting Officer and the president of the institute said is that I was trying to deconstruct 20 years' hard work by the institute, that I was being negative, that I was trying to do down Waterford and that my motivations were not to protect the staff at the institute.  He suggested that there was an ulterior motive.  I am dealing with facts.  I have not responded publicly because he talked about due process.  This is due process.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a job to do.  I will respond at the Committee of Public Accounts, which is part of the due process to which he refers.</p> <p>  We received a letter from the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, which represents the staff.  Members of staff obviously approached the union and stated that, having come forward and been part of a process where the HEA was conducting a review, they are concerned that there is nothing at the end of it and that they feel isolated.  That is their concern; it is not an invention of mine or an invention of any other member of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is real.</p> <p>  There a number of different issues arising.  There is an attempt by the Accounting Officer - he used the words himself - that I should stop asking questions.  I resent being told by an Accounting Officer that I should stop asking questions.  Even by saying that, it makes it very difficult for me to raise these issues again.  I will raise them in any event because I will not be deterred.  We need to get information from the HEA as to whether the report will ever be published.  Does it need to go back to the drawing board?  Where is it?  What is its status?  It is reasonable that we get responses to those questions.  It is very disingenuous and almost unprecedented for an Accounting Officer to attack, in my view, a member of the Committee of Public Accounts on his local radio station in that way and to suggest that I have an ulterior motive.  I do not have to defend myself; I think my record speaks for itself.  I represent the city and county of Waterford.  I will always do that to the best of my ability.  I have no ulterior motive other than to protect and defend staff who work at the institute and who have raised concerns separate from those articulated in the TUI report.  I have received separate emails from individuals who go further and say they are concerned that they came forward.  I have not put any of that into the public domain.</p> <p>  I seek the Chair's protection in the first instance.  Accounting Officers - especially this Accounting Officer - should understand there would be no HEA review if it were not for the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is due process.  There would not have been any examination of this if the Committee of Public Accounts had not examined it.  That is due process.  It is perfectly reasonable for me or anybody else to ask questions about the status of a report that should have been published in September 2017.  We can all be vulnerable.  It happened to Deputy Kelly in the past, although that was political.  It is a horse of a different colour when an Accounting Officer says, "I want to take on Cullinane and look forward to taking him on at the Committee of Public Accounts."  That is a bit much; it is overstepping the mark.  I am uncomfortable with his choice of language and with the way in which he has chosen to respond to issues.</p><p> I will make a final point.  Given that he was the vice president of research and development who oversaw the process that is being examined, to then attack me in this way is highly problematic and unusual.  I am very concerned about it and have put my concerns on record.  I will continue to ask questions without fear or favour.  Whether issues impact locally, regionally or nationally, we are here to do a job and I will do my job.  </p></speech>

That type of attack may well be counterproductive.  There is an attitude within some of the third level sector - I do not say it is the entire sector - that this concerns their independence, that they have put in 20 years of hard work but that we are sticking our nose in.  There are very valid issues in terms of spin-out companies, the funding of universities and all of the rest of it.  It is welcome that the additional money allocated to the Comptroller and Auditor General is for this sector because it is the sector where issues keep on reoccurring.</p> <p>  What can we do?  There is very little we can do except make sure to invite people in when that kind of an attack happens.  </p></speech>

I suggest that we allow the last speaker, Deputy Kelly, to comment and then Mr. McCarthy will comment.  Deputy Kelly indicated a wish to comment.</p></speech>

I support the previous speakers.  First, the obvious question is where is the report so let us find that out.</p> <p>  Second, I agree with the previous speaker that, potentially, we have to bring the individual back in here again.  That could be a way of dealing with some issues.</p> <p>  Third, there is a more generic issue of principle.  I have been down the road where issues were brought up inside here.  Park the politics because given my constituency in particular, there was always going to be politics, as is the case in every constituency.  When issues are brought up in here of a national importance that certainly have political consequences and direct political issues in a constituency, I have not seen people shy away inside here.</p></speech>

Maybe they are not turning up for different reasons but I have no idea.  For those of us who are here regularly, I have not seen anyone shy away and that means we are doing our job.</p> <p>  Where there is a case in which Accounting Officers, dare I say it, or others who are in some way connected to Accounting Officers etc., are actually using processes to possibly influence - I use these words very loosely - intimidate or have some form of consequence on the potential direction of this committee because it would have a political consequence for a member in here, that is very dangerous territory.  I do not know how we should deal with it, Chair.  I have had to deal with this down in Tipperary in terms of the obvious issue at Templemore, where the discourse around Templemore was that I was inside here, talking about the Committee of Public Accounts, and it was having consequences for tendering and so on.  I have had direct political hits, continuously up until last week and I have had other commentary from other people, all because I did my job in here.  Now we have an Accounting Officer directly taking on what is going on here in the Committee of Public Accounts.  We need to set some ground rules and while I will be guided by the Chairman, we need to do something as otherwise people who come in here will do so, and I mean negative political value.  </p></speech>

It does have implications for us and needs to be responded to.  This is an Accounting Officer.  This is somebody who has a responsibility to come and be held to account by the Committee of Public Accounts.  He said there has been a breach in due process, called into question the motivations behind the questions being asked, and claimed that false information was being put into the public record which, in view, is not the case.</p> <p>  In general overall terms, in my view, and the words were used that the Deputy, which is me, - he did not refer to me by my first name or call me a Deputy but I will leave that aside - should stop asking questions and stop doing what he is doing.  It is serious when an Accounting Officer says stop.  It is not an Accounting Officer's job to tell us what we should or should not do.  We, as members, have to follow through on all of the issues.</p> <p>  On the McLoone report, we had Dr. Love here to discuss this matter in private session.  My understanding is that he sought to redraft some elements of it.  The report, as with all of these reports, goes out into the institute.  Obviously people then have an opportunity to respond, which they did.  They then got a number of legal letters, which were with the legal unit of the HEA.  Dr. Love hoped that he would be able to resolve all of that and then produce a draft report very quickly.  Unfortunately, six months have elapsed and we are nowhere closer to having the report. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General is preparing a separate report, which is only one element.  It is one company.  We will have that report, which will give us an opportunity to invite the Accounting Officer to return here.  I agree with my colleagues that we need to find out what issues are delaying the McLoone report because I think it would be unacceptable if we ended up with no report. </p></speech>

We need to hear the current position early in the week.</p> <p>  In terms of the issue that Deputy Cullinane has raised, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has to stand four-square with any member who has been attacked by an Accounting Officer in public in respect of the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think the committee needs to write to that Accounting Officer and ask him to set out, the comments he made, in writing to this committee because it is to this committee he should be responding.</p><p>When the committee gets his letter outlining his criticism of the committee, or individual members of the committee, we will consider that.  He has to man up now and put in writing to the committee what he may have said locally.  I propose that in the first instance.  We need to do that at this stage.  I thank the Deputy for raising that because it is a difficult issue.</p><p> The next item is No. 1625 from Deputy O'Connell requesting representatives from the approved housing bodies to be present at our meeting.  That is agreed.  We will work it into our work schedule.  We will talk about the format of that meeting as part of our work programme.</p></speech>

I look forward to it - I cannot wait - but the Department of Education and Skills genuinely cannot wait.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of media reports about his resignation letter and the reason for the resignation.  Thankfully he will come in here before he leaves the role.  A copy of that resignation letter is paramount to our discussions.  The letter has been requested and refused under freedom of information for some media outlets but it is essential to our discussions next week and a copy of it should be supplied to the Committee of Public Accounts because next week's discussions relate to a range of issues that have been brought up before the committee.  Furthermore, as we saw in the committee, the relationship between the Department and the HEA is of serious concern.  According to reports, that is reflected in the contents of the letter.  I would like to see the reasons for Mr. Love's resignation in order that we can go to it.</p></speech>

Payments that will need to be made in the future must be recognised now and put on the balance sheet.</p> <p>  Pensions operate on a pay-as-you-go basis in the public service.  Most State bodies recognise a matching funding asset so that the liabilities are on one hand but there is an expectation that the funding will be got in the future to meet the liability.  One balances out the other.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has taken a different view.</p></speech>

One was a funded pension scheme and its assets were taken to the Exchequer in 2009 with a statutory guarantee that the liabilities would be met by the Exchequer in the future.  There is another scheme that also has a statutory guarantee but there are two schemes it operates that do not have a statutory guarantee.  That is similar to other State bodies which also do not have a statutory guarantee.  On the basis that the establishment of the schemes is statutory, there is a well-established practice that pensions are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p> <p>  There is also the fact that employee contributions are being taken.  In effect, there is an existing contract with the employees that the pension benefits will be delivered in due course.  It is not within the gift of the Department to say it makes that guarantee.</p> <p>  My opinion is that F&aacute;ilte Ireland should be recognising a matching asset in relation to those liabilities but it takes the view it should not.

Every State body has this overhang, or liability to be met in the future.  What most of them will do is recognise that the State, in the future, will fund them to that extent and so they recognise an equivalent liability.  Effectively it neutralises the liability on the balance sheet so that one can see what is the underlying net asset position.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the resignation of Dr. Graham Love, the meeting will not be personal to him; rather, it will be about the interaction of the HEA with the Department and the functioning of the HEA board.  The chairman of the board will be coming.  We will also discuss higher education matters.  We will start with the HEA's 2017 financial statements.

We sought the meeting to discuss the governance arrangements between the HEA and the Department.  There were some media reports following Dr. Love's resignation that there was tension.  Obviously, we want to understand what is happening.  We have been looking for reforms and changes in governance in a lot of areas and if there is an impediment or block, we will want to know about it.  There are other issues related to the Cork Institute of Technology, the University of Limerick and Waterford ETB, which is why I am trying to separate them out.  Are we agreeing that they should all be separated and that we should have some sense as to when they will be brought back to the committee?  I am aware that we discussed the Waterford Institute of Technology earlier and that we have a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, but the less said about it the better because it is nearly finished and must be presented to the Minister.  Is there not a separate Comptroller and Auditor General report on the University of Limerick?  It is with the Department and may be published at some point.

I will request the secretariat to send an information note to members in the next day or two.  Not everyone will remember the status of all the colleges in that regard.  The note will have a clear paragraph on the issue.  It will indicate whether the report is with us, the Minister, the Comptroller and Auditor General or is still awaited.  The reports that are not with the committee cannot be discussed, unless the discussion is about how soon we can expect to receive them.  We will have the note circulated.  Are members satisfied that the committee should discuss the matters mentioned in the afternoon?  It will all hang on the financial statements, but we will be conscious that the reports that are not with the committee cannot be discussed.</p> <p>  The meeting to be held the following week, on Thursday, 25 October, will be about housing, in respect of which the secretariat has made a proposal.   There are two issues to be dealt with.  First, there is the housing supply issue which covers the building and provision of houses.  Second, there is the issue of housing supports such as rent supplement, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and so on.  It will take two meetings to consider them.  There is so much to be discussed that we could not possibly cover every aspect in one meeting.  I propose that we start with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The committee has received its 2017 accounts and we will deal with the issue of housing and the local government fund.  Representatives of the Housing Agency will also be before the committee.  As mentioned in the financial statements, it promotes the concept of sustainable communities.  We will also discuss the issue of land use.  Do we also need to speak to representatives from the Housing Finance Agency, the body that provides finance for local authorities for housing provision?</p></speech>

It will take a second meeting and we will have to divide the agenda.  The meeting on 25 October will cover housing, the local government fund and the Housing Agency.  I will also invite the chairman of the housing committee of the County and City Management Association to attend.</p></speech>

The meeting will also deal with supports such as the housing assistance payment and rent supplement.  We would get lost and not get our work done if we were to try to do everything in one meeting.

If we do not, it will be next year before we get to these issues.</p></speech>

The following week, for definite, we will hear from Revenue.  Perhaps the meeting with the Department of Education and Skills and Bord na gCon could be held later.  We will come back to the work programme every week to see where meetings can be slotted in.  We do not have to sign off on that matter today.  The purpose of the discussion is to allow the secretariat to confirm the date for the meeting on housing and 1 November as the date of the meeting with the Revenue Commissioners which will be an important meeting.  If the secretariat believes we will have to consider holdindg another meeting, we will have to discuss the issue.</p></speech>

The Housing Finance Agency borrows funding commercially to gain value from the State being able to borrow at a good rate.  It lends it on commercially to the approved housing bodies which pay back the loans over a period of time.  I think some of the loans run forever.  In many cases, the loans given out are interest-only.  There are different schemes, which leads me to the next point.  I want to receive a note from the Department early next week - well before the meeting - on what I call the different schemes.  I am not referring to the housing assistance payment scheme but about the capital assistance plan and the long-term leasing schemes.  We want to receive a note on each of these schemes.  Otherwise, we will get lost as we use different names.</p></speech>

We have covered what is to be dealt with at the meeting on 25 October.</p><p>On 1 November we have scheduled a meeting with Revenue to discuss a couple of interesting chapters in the report, as well as its annual report.  I am asking for a letter to be sent to the Department of Finance and Revenue seeking an explanation for the extra &euro;700 million in tax that arrived from the multinational corporation sector.  I have no problem with the money arriving and will explain why we need the note.  We have been told that this money came to be paid because of changes in accounting rules.  My view is that these changes in accounting rules were well known a year or two out.  They did not happen during the course of the year.  Regardless of whether the moneys relate to the accounts for the last accounting year, or even this accounting year, the rules were well known and established.  When the Department was drawing up its estimates of corporation tax receipts for this year, it must have known that the rules had changed.  It did not happen this year.  It was well known at least a year ago and possibly two.  I want to know about the work done by Revenue and the Department in the knowledge that the accounting rules were going to change in a way that would affect corporation tax receipts.  This has been known for quite some time.  What work was done by Revenue and the Department to estimate how much in additional taxation the rule changes would bring in?  Is it possible that there could have been a loss of corporation tax, depending on how it worked?  I do not believe the Department did not know this was in the offing.  I do not accept it.  If I were to accept that it did not know about the rule changes, I would be saying it was utterly incompetent.  We want to receive information notes from Revenue and the Department breaking down the details of this matter.  They can work together to clear the relevant memos.  If we were to ask just one of them to clear up this matter, it would tell us that the other one had the answers and <i>vice versa</i>.  We are asking the question.  We need to know these things.  It was probably well known at the time of last year's estimates that there was a possibility that much more would be taken in.  Perhaps it was decided to hold it in reserve.  We need to be a little more transparent and accurate.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#K02100"><p>That is a good follow-through question.  We should ask whether other changes in accounting rules might affect corporation tax receipts positively or negatively.  It is good for Ireland that the changes have had a positive effect, but the opposite could also have been the case.  We will ask whether there are other potential changes.  We will also ask what Revenue and the Department of Finance are doing to estimate the impact of the changes on receipts.  A few years ago, we used to have big debates here about the inadequacy of the estimates of receipts of taxation prepared by Revenue and the Department.  I know that, depending on the economic cycle, it can be difficult to make such estimates, but Revenue and the Department should have known about this one.  We will have representatives from the Revenue Commissioners before us on 1 November.</p> <p>  The following week - on 8 November - we will consider matters related to cervical cancer and thalidomide litigation.  We will examine how the State Claims Agency is handling all of these cases.  The thalidomide issue is long-standing.</p> <p>  On 15 November we will ask the Department of Health about the hepatitis C fund, which has cost &euro;1.5 billion to date.  We really need to know what lessons have been learned.  If lessons had been learned in dealing with the hepatitis C issue, we would not be heading into what we are heading into in dealing with the cervical cancer issue, potentially at major cost to the Exchequer.  I feel lessons are never learned.</p></speech>

It lasted approximately three and a half hours.  We had a detailed discussion on information coming out on this area and we should be concerned about it.  It is important to have the correct lines of demarcation between the committees in order that we do not fall into issues in the way we did in the past.  If there is a clear demarcation line, this committee will be responsible for looking at the contracts, the tendering process and the money spent on those matters.  I ask the clerk to the committee to liaise with the clerk to the health committee.  After I asked questions yesterday, Dr. Scally revealed that he had received no documents for the tendering process.  He has found that the HSE shredded them as soon as the time limits were up, which is the only example of efficiency on the part of the HSE that he has found.  Now the HSE has to go to the laboratories to obtain copies of its own tender documents.  The second extraordinary thing is that, even now, Dr. Scally cannot guarantee that the HSE has provided him with every version of every contract with every laboratory.  The third extraordinary thing is that Dr. Scally does not know whether there were other examples of laboratory work being outsourced in the past ten years.  He does not know where it begins and ends but thinks he has some of it.  However, he cannot guarantee that there were no more examples.  The demarcation line that applies to this committee relates to our responsibility to examine the spending of taxpayers' money.  It is important for this committee to liaise with the health committee to hone in on these areas in advance of our meeting on 8 November.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Alan Kelly, I am a member of both committees.  There are serious issues with the tender documents.  As Deputy Alan Kelly said, they have been shredded.  I am not sure we will receive them from laboratories that did not receive contracts.  Why would they give them to us?  In addition to the lack of contracts, there is the lack of a paper trail showing how things were done.  That is the job of this committee rather than the health committee.</p></speech>

That means switching them to aeroplane mode.  Switching them to silent mode is not sufficient because they can still interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and he or she continues to so do, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of the evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  We expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour.  We have not fully experienced that with other witnesses in the past and it is an issue we will be getting stronger on as a committee.  If there is information and the witnesses are not specifically asked about it but they know it is very relevant to the topic, we would ask them to share it with us.  Witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We will start by taking the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#M00600"><p>Thank you.  The 2017 appropriation account for Vote 13 - Office of Public Works records gross expenditure of just over &euro;394 million.  Appropriations-in-aid were almost &euro;34 million, resulting in net voted expenditure of just over &euro;360 million.  The surplus for surrender at the year-end was &euro;4.6 million.  The appropriation account is presented under two programme headings: flood risk management, on which a total of &euro;75 million was spent, and estate portfolio management, in respect of which the total expenditure was &euro;319 million.  The graphic that is shown on screen outlines the main areas of expenditure in 2017.</p> <p>  In addition to activities funded by the Vote, the OPW acts on an agency basis in the property management area, mainly managing capital works projects on behalf of other Departments and agencies and leasing accommodation for small State agencies.  The associated expenditure is reflected in the accounts of the client Departments and agencies.  Total expenditure handled by the OPW on an agency basis amounted to &euro;84 million in 2017.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion in regard to the appropriation account but drew attention to procurement in 2017 to the value of &euro;812,000 that was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control.</p> <p>  The OPW signed a new, 25 year lease in May 2017 in respect of large office premises at Miesian Plaza in Baggot Street, mainly to accommodate the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Even though lease payments were incurred from December 2016, the premises remained unoccupied until May 2018.  Chapter 6 of my report examines the issues that gave rise to the delay in occupying the premises and a number of other matters related to the lease.</p> <p>  The Miesian Plaza lease represents a very significant commitment of public funds, with annual rent starting at &euro;10 million and subject to five-year rent reviews in line with inflation over the 25 year period of the lease.  The examination found little evidence of the key elements of a standard business case that should support the commitment of that level of public funds.  In particular, there was little evidence of detailed evaluation of other options, no economic appraisal was carried out and the full costs and risks associated with the project were not documented and considered in advance.</p> <p>  In March 2016, the OPW board approved the lease on the basis of the terms negotiated by consultants on its behalf.  At that stage, it was envisaged that, allowing for a fit-out period of eight to ten months, the premises would be ready for occupancy in the first quarter of 2017.  As it turned out, the first occupancy was achieved only in May 2018 and full occupancy was achieved only in July 2018.  We estimated that the delays that occurred from March 2017 resulted in ineffective expenditure on unoccupied premises of around &euro;11 million.</p> <p>  There was extensive engagement between the OPW and the two main client Departments in seeking to achieve timely occupancy of the leased premises.  The main issues that gave rise to delay were finalisation of the number of staff to be accommodated and agreement on the layout of the accommodation and on shared facilities.  Currently, Miesian Plaza does not have capacity to accommodate all of the staff of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the expected future staffing needs of both Departments.  Currently, the OPW targets a space allocation of 12 sq. m per person.  In Miesian Plaza the space allocation achieved is 15.3 sq. m per person, about 27% more than the target level.  The report recommends that the OPW review its approach to agreeing accommodation needs with Departments and that it should establish standards for space allocation and fit-out that take account of the business needs of different categories of occupant.</p><p>The examination also identified an issue with the area of the premises to which the agreed rental rate was applied.  There are different standards for measuring property which result in different reported areas for a building.  The rental rate agreed for Miesian Plaza was based on what is known as the net internal area.  From 2016, a new international property measurement standard was introduced and measurement of Miesian Plaza on this basis resulted in a larger reported area.  The rental rate agreed should have been adjusted <i>pro rata</i>to reflect the change in the basis of measurement.  However, this did not happen and the signed lease applied the rate per square metre negotiated on the basis of the net internal area to the larger area, as measured by the new standard.  We estimated that this error resulted in annual rent that was &euro;344,000 higher than what was negotiated.  After taking account of inflation, the projected additional cost to the Exchequer is of the order of &euro;10 million over the 25-year term of the lease.  At the time of finalisation of the report, the Office of Public Works stated that it had engaged with the landlord with a view to rectifying the matter.<br/><br/>The examination team reviewed a sample of 20 other live OPW leases with various start dates, and identified one other possible excess payment case in that sample.  This involves a 20-year lease entered into in 2006 where confusion about measurement appears to have resulted in an excess annual payment of some &euro;141,000.  I understand the OPW is examining that case. <br/><br/>I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

Temporarily at least, we have taken a step backwards but not in the whole organisation.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present to the Committee of Public Accounts the expenditure and works of the Office of Public Works across its different areas of activity.  The OPW is the lead body responsible for flood risk management and the stewardship of the nation&rsquo;s national monuments and historic properties.  Through these activities, the OPW interacts with and supports communities and local authorities in every county in Ireland. <br/><br/>The third primary area of OPW activity is the management of the State&rsquo;s modern property estate, including accommodation for Government staff and numerous specialist facilities such as Garda stations, courthouses, laboratories, data centres and customs infrastructure, which has become topical again now in the context of Brexit.  I provided an information briefing on Garda accommodation in advance of this meeting.  Later in this statement, I will address the matters raised in Chapter 6 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report titled, Lease of Offices at Miesian Plaza.<br/><br/>The OPW is responsible for a range of other important functions, including the State art collection, the day-to-day running of &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and organising State visits and events.  Recent examples of events include the May referendum, the visit of Pope Francis in August and the upcoming inauguration of the President.<br/><br/>As Members are aware, flooding is a natural phenomenon which can cause widespread damage and have a devastating effect on communities, property and infrastructure.  We have to think only of the poor people in Spain who suffered a disaster of flash flooding in the past couple of days when ten people lost their lives.  This risk is likely to increase in the future due to rising sea levels and other potential effects of climate change.  The Government has recognised these risks and committed &euro;1 billion of capital investment to flood risk management over the next decade.<br/><br/>The OPW has responsibility for leading and co-ordinating the implementation of the national flood risk policy, which involves the development of a planned programme of works.  In 2017, the OPW completed the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken in the history of the State, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  The CFRAM programme involved analysis of flood risk across 300 designated communities, including 90 coastal areas and the production of 29 flood risk management plans with a prioritisation of those measures that can manage the assessed flood risk nationwide.  It includes building our capability to protect 95% of properties assessed to be at risk through 118 new flood relief schemes in addition to the 75 schemes that are complete or under way.<br/><br/>This capital programme was launched on the 3 May 2018 and we are now moving into the detailed development and implementation of these measures with the local authorities.  During 2017, the OPW carried out capital works at a cost of more than &euro;45 million, including the completion of major projects at Bray and Foynes; the substantial progression of construction on schemes at Bandon, Skibbereen, the River Dodder, Claregalway and Dunkellin River; the provision of more than &euro;2 million to local authorities to carry out minor flood works; the commencement of new schemes in Athlone and Templemore; and the progression of design work on a large number of other major schemes to be implemented in the coming years.  In addition, the OPW maintains all arterial drainage schemes completed by it under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  This investment involves providing ongoing protection to 263,000 ha of agricultural land through the annual maintenance programme for 11,500 km of river channel, including 800 km of embankments.<br/><br/>My office manages a range of other measures to tackle flood risk, including the OPW minor flood mitigation and coastal protection scheme in partnership with local authorities.  A total of 500 projects have been completed under this scheme protecting 6,500 properties, two thirds of which are outside the CFRAM study areas.<br/><br/>The OPW continues to support and co-ordinate sectoral led work on non-structural solutions to help protect and-or mitigate flood risk.  Key to these solutions is the development by Met &Eacute;ireann, in conjunction with the OPW, of a national flood forecasting service.  Also, a new website, <i>www.floodinfo.ie</i>, has been developed by the OPW.  This is an important resource in supporting emergency response planning by local authorities and empowering people and communities to plan and respond to their flood risk. <br/><br/>As caretakers of the built heritage estate, the OPW is responsible for the management, conservation, maintenance and presentation of some 780 national monuments and 70 OPW managed heritage sites.  Responsibilities include the day-to-day management and presentation of 30 major historical properties, gardens, parks and arboreta.<br/><br/>The OPW has consistently been of the opinion that the importance of the State&rsquo;s national heritage cannot be overestimated, either in a cultural or economic sense.  This is especially true in the context of rural regeneration and is borne out by the increase, year on year, of the number of visitors to these sites.  The OPW enjoyed a very successful 2017 with a record total of 7.9 million visitors to OPW managed heritage sites.  The leading visitor sites continue to do remarkably well, including Dublin Castle, Kilmainham Gaol, the Rock of Cashel and the Phoenix Park, the largest city park in Europe and an enormous green resource for the people of Dublin. <br/><br/>In addition, a strategic partnership with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and F&aacute;ilte Ireland has enabled the OPW to develop and enhance tourism investment possibilities within the cultural and heritage estate.  The broad focus of this programme is to enhance the visitor experience at sites managed by the OPW, with particular reference to less visited sites so that a greater volume of increased footfall on a wider base can be sustained.  This will ensure that we continue to increase tourism numbers and the generation of Exchequer revenue.<br/><br/>Efficient and modern accommodation is a key requirement for the successful delivery of many Government priorities.  Estate management by the OPW is an all encompassing discipline of strategically aligning the use of State and leased property with Government priorities while ensuring value for money through the optimal use of resources.  Estate management includes the acquisition and disposal of properties and leases, essential property maintenance, necessary development and retrofits and the provision of storage and mechanical and engineering works to more than 70 different client Departments and public bodies.  In order to facilitate the management of that portfolio the OPW is developing a much needed estate management system which will shortly go live in the office.</p><p>The system will provide centralised information to staff, which will allow for effective and efficient estate management planning in the commercial environment within which the office operates.</p><p> On climate change, members will be aware that the recent Citizens' Assembly recommended that the State take a leadership role in addressing this risk through mitigation measures, including retrofitting and renewables generation on public buildings.  The OPW portfolio consists of more than 2,500 properties and the total investment was &euro;319 million in 2017, which included the fit-out of several properties, including Miesian Plaza.</p><p> I will now turn to the Comptroller and Auditor General's chapter on the lease of offices at Miesian Plaza.  The lease was part of the OPW accommodation strategy to move staff from Hawkins House, a large, end-of-life building, to a fourth generation energy-efficient building that could support almost 1,000 staff.  Miesian Plaza, at approximately 15,000 sq. m, is the largest lease acquisition that the OPW has secured in recent years and has 936 workstations.  The imperative of acquiring a new headquarters for the Department of Health arose from the deteriorating condition of Hawkins House which was constructed in the early 1960s.  In addition, the lease on a property on Mespil Road which accommodated the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was due to expire and could no longer cater for the expanding requirements of that Department.</p><p> Following a review of the available properties in what was an exceptionally tight market, Miesian Plaza on Baggot Street was identified as the most suitable option for the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs and certain units of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Central to its acceptance as a potential location was its proximity to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The OPW retained an independent professional negotiation team to determine if a satisfactory commercial arrangement could be concluded.  Following several months of engagement with the landlord, the negotiation team secured a 25-year lease at approximately 15% below the prevailing market rent.  With the addition of five-year rent reviews linked only to the consumer price index, the deal effectively insulates the State against any significant or erratic market fluctuations in the medium term.  In the context of the rising Dublin property market, which is related to Brexit, the OPW considers this index linking to be of significant benefit.</p><p> The large-scale permanent relocation of any group of staff is a challenging task.  This was particularly complex in the Miesian Plaza project because of the physical and cultural challenges of moving almost 1,000 staff spread across four major Departments.  It is a common misunderstanding that the identification of a building and securing of lease terms are effectively the end of the process and that people just move in.  In fact, it is only at this stage that the fit-out process which transforms the building from a grey shell to a habitable modern office and takes up to ten months can commence.  These issues were particularly intense in the Miesian Plaza project in light of the ground-breaking steps being taken relating to open plan work spaces and a dramatic reduction in the use of cellular offices.  The project very quickly moved from one involving mere bricks and mortar to one encompassing human relationships and business process reform.  In the OPW&rsquo;s experience, it is quite common that staff and business considerations trump those relating to the physical building in terms of complexity and the time needed to complete the project.</p><p> Reflecting on the project, I suspect that some aspects, including the change management process, were underestimated by all involved, including the OPW.  The protracted discussions designed to ensure buy-in and to bring everybody along on a difficult journey undoubtedly caused delays.  The cost of the delay is very much regretted by the OPW and, I am sure, all those associated with the project.</p><p> It is rare for major projects to progress without some problems.  The Miesian Plaza project experienced problems, including the aforementioned programme overrun and an issue relating to the application of a new measurement standard.  Although those issues serve to lessen the very significant value negotiated, the demonstrable benefits of the overall deal and ground-breaking business transformation outcomes significantly outweigh all other considerations.  The building secured by the OPW will serve as a flagship for the State&rsquo;s property portfolio for the next 25 years while accommodating some of the most important Departments in a leadership in energy and environmental design, LEED, platinum-rated office accommodation.</p><p> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their assistance and courtesy during the audit.  I have no doubt that the committee and Chairman will have questions on the matters I have raised.  I thank them for their attention and will attempt to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

The origin of this whole series of correspondence, as I understand it, was a submission that was made to a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform consultation process on accountability.  There were certain extracts from the report that was submitted by two staff members of OPW.  Extracts were taken from that and sent to the committee because there were specific references to my function and to the Committee of Public Account's function.  That kicked off a process which culminated in a substantive report in November 2017.  The substantive piece of work that I believe Mr. Morgan is referring to is the 2017 report.  I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

In principle, the content is very similar.  We are talking about the same issues.  There is no problem in principle.  This all happened in the last couple of days.  Certainly, as I understand it, the letter of response, which gives some indication of the content as well, should have gone to the committee.  If it has not, it will be sent in now.  It is a short letter.  If we were asked for the 2017 report, I was not aware of that and I apologise.

The second issue is also related to the Office of Public Works.  The Committee of Public Accounts issued its periodic report on 23 January 2018 and one of the issues it dealt with was the reopening Garda stations.  One of the recommendations of our report was that the cost implications of the review to reopen Garda stations should be considered in the context of the 2018 Estimates.  This need not be written down.  The report was published by the Committee of Public Account.  We recently received a response to our recommendation from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 18 July 2018.  We sent a letter to his Department in January 2018 asking that the costs of reopening Stepaside Garda station and some other Garda stations be considered in the context of the 2018 Estimates, bearing in mind that the decision was made in June 2017.  We reported on that in January 2018.</p><p>Mr. Watt's reply states:</p><blockquote>The Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is informed by the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that this recommendation is accepted in principle.  The 2018 estimate provision for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is long since complete. However, over recent months, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Office of Public Works have been working to quantify the final projected costs to reopen all six stations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicates that the estimated costings produced will be reviewed and discussed with the sanctioning authorities, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Public Expenditure and Reform, once concluded.</blockquote><p>As Chairman of the Committee on Public Accounts, I find it totally unsatisfactory that the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took seven months to reply to our recommendation.  We wrote to Mr. Watt early in the year to give him plenty of advance notice for this matter to be raised in the Estimates in 2018.  He wrote to us in July saying he was sorry but the Estimates were over.  The matter should have been encompassed in the 2018 Estimate, as recommended by this committee.  Mr. Watt states that while he agrees in principle with our recommendation, it is too late.  That is an unsatisfactory response and delay and we want to ensure there is accountability.  Given that it may not have happened in 2018, I will put a question on it to Mr. Buckley now because this follows directly from the report we published.  If we are to do our business, we need to follow through on our recommendations.  Mr. Buckley says in his briefing note today that in February 2018 he received the final brief in respect of Stepaside.  He said the OPW has to issue a notice to quit in respect of Stepaside, that it considered a modular solution and is now renovating the existing building, which it hopes to have completed by the end of June 2019.  I have seen the Estimates announced by the Minister on budget day.  What figure for the reopening of Stepaside Garda station is provided in the Estimates for 2019, given that none was provided in the 2018 Estimate? </p></speech>

People think the OPW manages Garda stations and so on.  In some cases it does absorb the full cost of some Departments, then some of the cost of the work it does is absorbed by the line Department, as in this case, by the Department of Justice and Equality.

I did point out that we were considering a modular approach and in recent months the dialogue has changed to the possibility, which we welcome, of integrating the Garda requirement in the existing Stepaside building.  I have not seen the impact of that on the budget.  It might be a little less.  I do not think it will cost more but it is certainly in the long-term benefit of the State to be working on an existing building rather than on something outside that and &euro;1.5 million would be a good ballpark figure there.</p></speech>

There is no evidence of a detailed consideration of other options and no cost-effectiveness analysis.  No economic appraisal was carried out.  There was no consideration of the lease, buy or build options.  There is no evidence that the full costs of leasing Miesian Plaza were identified and evaluated, specifically fit-out costs, furniture, maintenance costs, operating costs, value added tax, VAT, and the cost of OPW staff involved in the project.  The risks associated with the project were not set out.  Issues arose with regard to agreeing the client Departments' accommodation needs and the effect on a practical completion date.

It was a balance of all the criteria and, from what I have seen of the internal processes, that was done very thoroughly and professionally but what fell down was the proper documentation and recording of that in the way that it should be done.  As a Civil Service body, we accept it should be done in compliance with the best practice of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

We would have realised this point last year during our dialogue with the Comptroller and Auditor General and once the auditor started his work.  We immediately assessed how this happened and looked at the checks and balances that we thought we had in place.  Like any system, something happens to show a gap and that gap has been addressed.  We now have an independent, final check of the lease package at the very end by someone who has not been involved.</p><p>A lot of this is a case of not seeing the wood for the trees.  One can see quite clearly that because of staff resources, because systems we had in place since before the recession had not changed, and because we were trying to cover the same systems with fewer staff, as I mentioned in terms of not seeing the wood for the trees, a blind spot entered into the control process.  Obviously, it should not have and we have put systems in place now so that cannot happen in the future.</p></speech>

It is &euro;300,000 per year.  I do not dismiss the fact that it amounts to &euro;10 million over the 25 years of the term, but even &euro;300,000 would do a lot in the OPW Vote on the heritage side and, as Deputy O'Brien said, in healthcare, education, and other areas.

That is part of an explanation which I will give when the time comes in terms of why it took so long.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien can see there was good reason to have that dialogue because we were coming out of a recession and the Departments involved were expanding.</p></speech>

If we were to take, for example, a one-year, rent-free period, it would mean the rent for the other 24 years would be correspondingly higher.  In terms of the rent reviews based on the CPI, each time the index would be applied to a higher figure.  We have done some internal calculations that show the State would have lost between &euro;5 million and &euro;6 million had we had a one-year, rent-free period on this lease.  Our normal practice is to try to negotiate a rent-free period to allow for the fit-out and everything else, but in this case because of the CPI linkage, the circumstances surrounding the deal and the negotiation, what was beneficial for both parties and what was the best deal that could be obtained, we obtained a deal for roughly 15% below market rent.  That was one of the factors in how we could do that.</p></speech>

Had nothing else happened, we would have saved &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million by negotiating a very competitive rent rate on the basis of the different points the Deputy raised.  Unfortunately, because of the measurement issue, which we hope to clarify, but let us say we cannot, that has eaten into that &euro;45,000 saving.  The delay in occupying the building, which I would argue was about five to six months, so it is part of the &euro;11 million figure the Deputy mentioned, but it is not the full figure by any means, has also eaten into that saving, but there is still a significant saving.</p></speech>

Are they the same consultants the OPW employed on a previous project and then it was decided to give them this project as well?  I think they were doing work on the Hawkins House project.</p></speech>

From our point of view, as a property transaction the two projects are intrinsically linked.  While we were moving the Department of Health because of the deteriorating condition of Hawkins House, it also opened up a major redevelopment opportunity to make more efficient use of that property on behalf of the State.  The evaluation of one and the other at that time was interlinked.</p></speech>

Is it also not correct that the OPW then decided to extend it and give them the additional space and it did not look for any expertise but just decided to go with this particular consultant?</p></speech>

To use those to trade for an attractive rent term was a job well done.  Unless there is a procurement issue I would not wish to change the negotiation of that lease.

The committee will have to allow me to explain because it is a little bit complicated, but it is important that I explain it.  In 2016, first of all the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors introduced the international property measurement standard 3, IPMS 3, standard and it was mandatory for its members in the UK and worldwide from January 2016.  The corresponding adoption in Ireland by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland was one month later and it was mandatory for chartered surveyors to use this new code from February 2016.  It must be understood that the Miesian Plaza transaction was just in full swing at this stage.  The terms had been negotiated under the old system and there was a discussion and an agreement.  The agreement is where the confusion arises.  The agreement was that the final lease documentation should be based on floor area measured to the new IPMS 3 standard.  Where the confusion arises is that what was not picked up on early enough were the implications that might have for the rent rate and the lease value.  In the normal run of events-----</p></speech>

Despite the efforts of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, the new standard is still not widely accepted and used in the Irish market.  It takes a long time because long negotiations, long leases etc. are being dealt with.  The OPW has the attitude of being once bitten twice shy and is very much on top of this issue but in the wider property market in Dublin and Ireland I would say that it is still causing confusion left, right and centre.</p> <p>  To finish the point I was making, I am not a property expert but my colleagues are and I would have thought that the square metres should be constant because a building is a building but it actually changes from what is measured in the drawing to what is finally measured on site.  That measurement only took place in December 2016.  All of this dialogue and querying between my staff and the CSSO had already happened and then the measurement took place and there was a difference between the physical measurement and the drawing measurement of about 3.5% in area, as happens sometimes, on the old standard.  We are used to dealing with that standard and it was negotiated through.</p><p>At the same time, the same measurement specialist measured the building under the international property measurement standard, IPMS 3.  Normally, we would not expect a modern open-plan office block to be much different.  Normally, it would be negligible but in this case because it was a renovated building it was actually quite significant.  It was in the order of 3% to 4%.  That is the point at which this went astray.</p></speech>

I will start with chapter 6 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Miesian Plaza offices for the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs.  The answers thus far have been insightful.  These offices lay vacant for 18 months at a cost of &euro;11 million.  It was far from a good deal overall.  That is not even with the basin point in the public sphere.  I have one question.  Can we have the &euro;11 million back please?  It is a simple straightforward question.  Can we have the &euro;11 million that the OPW squandered back?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.604" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Buckley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#U02600"><p>There is a delay.  There is a period between December 2016, when the rent payment started for the building, and the occupancy of the building, as set out in the report, in April or May of 2018.  There was 15 months.  That period needs to be understood properly and it has not been as of yet.  No matter what tenants do in a new building, they have to take possession of the building before they can fit out that building for whatever reason they want to use it.  We could not commence any work related to the OPW or client Department occupation of that building until we had possession of it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.606" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Buckley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#U02800"><p>It is important.  I must explain it now.  It was referenced in the introduction from the Comptroller and Auditor General and in my introduction.  The fit-out of a building this complex takes in the region of ten months.  There was always going to be a ten-month period with no one in the building when our builders were, as quickly and efficiently as possible, preparing the building for occupation.  When we get it, it is a shell or core and it is basic.  It is the same as anything else.  There was a delay &ndash; I am not saying there was no delay &ndash; but we must put a perspective on this.  We needed approval to start the contractor on the fit-out in January 2017 as soon as we had possession.  We were not able to give the go-ahead to the developer until July 2017 because we did not have sufficient agreement between the OPW and the client Departments.  That is a six-month delay.  We are renting the building for &euro;10 million per year, so that is &euro;5 million gross, and, if we take away VAT that is &euro;4 million.  One could attribute &euro;4 million to the delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#U02900"><p>That is Mr. Buckley's claim.  The constitutional officer of the State has said &euro;11 million.  The answer is "No".  The two words Mr. Buckley has used are "not compatible".  He also used the term, "quickly and efficiently".  Then in the following breath, he said there was a delay.  They are not compatible.  The answer to what Mr. Buckley has said is "No".</p> <p>  That is my frustration with this situation and with so many other public bodies that come before the committee having squandered public money.  The attitude is that they will hunker down, maybe say "Sorry" and get a rap on the knuckles .  Then they are out the door until next year and life goes on.  It goes on for the OPW but it does not go on as normal for thousands of our citizens because of OPW's actions.  We do not talk about this enough.  More specifically, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, there was a lack of action and failure to act.  I have a hostel in my home town of Navan, close to the OPW headquarters in Trim, that has vacant sites.  I am repeatedly told there is no money to provide that.  I can tell Mr. Buckley that &euro;11 million would do a good deal for that.  I have a Garda chief superintendent who is looking for a divisional headquarters in Meath but there is no progress on that or even a straight answer from the OPW in respect of the site acquisition for that.  The impact of the people in the OPW flittering away &euro;11 million has consequences for whether money being available for services that the public desperately need.</p> <p>  Mr. Buckley has come before the committee and his statement referred to how there was a difficult journey to bring everyone along and how it undoubtedly caused delays.  It was a difficult journey.  Mr. Buckley should note they were not carrying their crosses to Golgotha; they were going from Hawkins House to Baggot Street.  The fact is that rows were documented in the report about open-plan space, who would have an office or whether the water cooler would go in a given corner.  That resulted in &euro;11 million of ineffective expenditure.  It is a complete and utter scandal.  The attempt to say before the committee that it was a good deal is inexcusable.</p> <p>  Since there is ineffective expenditure on a grand scale at this level, the culture seeps down throughout the organisation.  We have seen it with other bodies here and it has happened here as well.  I will ask Mr. Buckley one more time about this deal.  Is he seriously saying that this is a good deal that he is prepared to stand over?</p></speech>

I have also explained that we accept that it was not possible to conclude the planning of the occupation of the building more quickly.  I said in my opening statement that we regret it and I think everyone does.  That delay or overrun has cost approximately &euro;4 million and not &euro;11 million; I dispute that assertion.  Any delay or cost is unacceptable.  It does not matter if the cost was &euro;40,000; it would still be unacceptable.</p> <p>  We have to look at the time available for what is a major business process change.  I do not accept that it is anything to do with the distance between the two buildings.  It has a great deal to do with the nature of the buildings.  We are comparing a 1962 building, Hawkins House, with old-fashioned modular offices and a Department that has learned to do a good job in those circumstances.  The Department adapted all its business circumstances and processes accordingly.  Miesian Plaza is a far more modern office, but it does not simply happen overnight.  One cannot simply move from one to the other.  Every detail has to be adjusted and adapted.  There is a process in place and there is a time for it.</p></speech>

Page 2 of the report refers to a significant commitment of public funds.</p><p>Why were there no documents detailing the risks associated with what Mr. Buckley has said was a significant project and a difficult journey?  It is not the first time we have had bodies before the committee with no documentation corresponding to the claims made.  At Christmas in 2016 we had NAMA in the same scenario.  Can Mr. Buckley take me through why there is no documentation in respect of what was to be anticipated?</p></speech>

It needs to be made much more thoroughly and better documented.  We have introduced systems since that time to do it in a more formal way.  I put much value on that because it is the modern way of running businesses.</p> <p>  On the business case and the assessments made, they are also important.  We followed the procedures of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is no excuse, but it is an explanation.  The property market is dynamic at any one time.  One does not have the ten or 15 options one might have in some other projects and  has to move quickly.  That is not an excuse, as we must still engage in the process.  However, sometimes it has to be expedited to cover all of these matters.</p></speech>

Will he take me through it?</p> <p>  Let us take the timeline in chapter 6.5 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the interaction between Mr. Buckley&rsquo;s office and the Secretary General in the Department of Health and the issues which arose from 2016 onwards.  A red flag was raised in October 2016 when the Secretary General wrote to the chairman of the OPW stating that, based on the plans provided, the Department of Health could not at that stage proceed with the relocation.  Chapter 6.46 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states: &ldquo;The main issues were in relation to the open plan working environment and the allocation of open plan workstations to assistant principal officers, who at that time were accommodated in individual cellular offices in Hawkins House&rdquo;.  Will Mr. Buckley take me through the timeline of when all of these red flags were being raised in the build-up to the negotiations, the lease and so forth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Buckley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#V00400"><p>During 2016 there was an intensive continual interaction between the OPW, the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The interaction revolved around the points mentioned.  They were the critical building differences which would result in business process differences.  In fairness to the Departments involved, they accepted early on that, in the nature of the building move, it would not be possible or correct to provide cellular offices for the same number of people or anything like it, as was the case in Hawkins House.  The Departments agreed with the OPW that it was a big change and step forward for the public sector in general that a particular grade, the assistant principal officer grade, would be housed in open plan office space in Miesian Plaza.  It was the first time it had been done on a large scale in the Civil Service or the public sector.  It was at a time when we were recovering from a recession, dealing with a clawback under the Haddington Road agreement, while the Department of Health was dealing with issue after issue in managing the health service.  We took on those issues, but it was difficult and took much negotiation during the year.  I saw some difficult periods when people were trying to do their best in the public interest in representing different bodies.  It was not just about staffing issues.  It was also about management being sure its system could be run.  We could not risk jeopardising the work of the Department of Health in the move.  If it could not function properly for even one month, can one think of the devastation it would have caused?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.614" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#V00500"><p>I want to get into those issues.  There were many issues at the time.  People were losing their jobs and whether they were in a cellular or open plan office was not their concern.  I acknowledge that in December 2016 Mr. Buckley initiated meetings to resolve the ongoing issues.</p> <p>  Chapter 6.41 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General states the &ldquo;OPW has a directive power in relation to civil service office accommodation [but] it did not exercise that power in this case&rdquo;.  That is an important point that I would like Mr. Buckley to consider.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated the OPW did not exercise that power because it felt &ldquo;far more effective when engaging with client Departments in relation to office relocations&rdquo; and &ldquo;that directive powers are useful in certain situations but are a &lsquo;blunt instrument&rsquo; and ... would not have dealt with the complete culture change associated with a move from &lsquo;cellular&rsquo; to open plan layouts&rdquo;.  In his opening statement Mr. Buckley stated: &ldquo;In the OPW&rsquo;s experience, it is quite common that staff ... considerations trump those relating to the physical building itself&rdquo;.  What stage does it have to reach for the protection of the take from the public purse to trump the feelings of the people discommoded by having to look at someone across a desk, rather than being in an office?  That goes to the heart of what Mr. Buckley said in his statement and the fact that he had powers at his discretion to bypass all of this nonsense of whether guys&rsquo; feelings were out of check because they were moving from a cellular to an open plan office.  Modern companies do this all of the time.  It is extremely frustrating to think the public service cannot adapt in the same fashion and that the net result was a loss of &euro;11 million.  No private company would even countenance such a scenario.  A private company would tell its employees that they would not have a job the following morning if they did not get over their feelings.  At what stage does protection of the public purse trump the ineffective use of money?</p></speech>

I have put the emphasis on business processes.  They have to work right and do.  Let us look at the evidence.  The staff are now in the building.  All four Departments are reporting that it is effective and that they are seeing improvements in the climate in which they can do their business.  They believe that, in time, they will see definite benefits in productivity and efficiency.  It takes time in both the private sector and the public sector.  My background is in the private sector.  I have made several moves and they are planned several years ahead.  The technology and processes have to be put in place.  I am not saying staff are not important, but they  are part of it.  A body like a Department is nothing else but the staff in it.  They are the people who are writing the policies.  However, the business process has to work.  Some are paper-based but will be IT-based.  Teamwork, collegiality, the use of meeting rooms and the way we interact with visitors are different in a different environment.  It takes a little time.  There was engagement over two years, but it could only become intense once we had clear visibility of the type of building into which we were moving.  We have put steps in place to assist our clients and ourselves in managing it and in order that we can tackle these issues more quickly, but it is always going to take some time.  The 18 months it took in this case was not a bad result.</p></speech>

In the following March the Department had still not agreed the layout of common areas in offices.  This goes to the heart of the matter.  There was the wrong attitude.  What is the situation pertaining to the fact that not all of the staff from the Department of Children and Youth affairs can be accommodated there?</p></speech>

We must pick a number on which we plan the business.  In this case, we worked with the Departments and the numbers of staff they had at the time the project started.  We allowed for a certain degree of expansion, say, 5% or 10%.  We are in the business of providing accommodation, not empty buildings.  We were certainly concerned, but there was dialogue because, credibly, the two Departments foresaw their numbers growing.</p><p>However, it is not our role to predict numbers in a Department.  That is the job of Government.  We dealt with the information available to us.  It would be lovely if we had 100% of the two Departments in but 95% of both of them are in.  There are certainly areas within both Departments where, at least on a temporary basis for a number of years, we can accommodate people at a second location but by and large, the core functions of both Departments are side by side in an efficient work structure.  That is a success.  I would be more worried if the Deputy asked me why there are 50 empty desks in that building.  </p></speech>

I am looking at the spending review from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is a very good overview.  I am not too sure about the conclusions.  I wish I was here looking at the OPW in respect of the very important work it carries out.  It looks after over 2,000 buildings and flood prevention and relief, which are extremely important.  I am going home tonight to a city threatened by a storm and possible flooding.  I really wish we were doing that.  I have always had the greatest respect for the OPW on the ground.  It is an extremely important Department so I really regret that we are now mired in this.  It is really putting forward the wrong view of the OPW whose role is essential in any functioning democracy.  It is responsible for 2,000 buildings.  I wish we were here looking at what the OPW feels or how it is implementing Government policy in respect of the colossal spend on rents - &euro;96 million per year.  I do not mean to be disrespectful in any way but the OPW should have as an addendum "the Office of Public Rents" because we are now in the market and are actively colluding with high rents in a market.  These are just my general comments.</p> <p>  I return to the specifics and I hope I have a chance this afternoon to return to the many aspects I would like to address such as flood risk.  In respect of the report, we are here today because the Comptroller and Auditor General produced this full document.  Unfortunately, the OPW's handling of the Miesian Plaza affair gets an entire chapter, which is very unusual.  I have read the chapter and the comments on it.  I have read everything at this point.  One could have a sense of being overwhelmed.  I will deal first with the problem relating to the extra &euro;300,000 per year as a result of miscalculations.  It reminds me of when NAMA came before us and the debate was pushed into what was the appropriate percentage to use, which is not really relevant.  What has happened here is that there was a negotiated rent based on certain measurements - net internal space or something like that - and an agreement was reached.  The OPW then had to use other measurements that were introduced in January 2016 that should have resulted in the rent being recalibrated.  </p></speech>

I will go to paragraph 21.  It is not the way Mr. Buckley is telling it; it was actually brought to his attention.  If we look at paragraph 6.21, we can see that it was clearly brought to Mr. Buckley's attention.  Paragraph 6.21 states that "in finalising the lease, the issue of the different measurement bases was considered."  It states that before the lease was finalised, the Chief State Solicitor's Office requested the OPW to confirm with its in-house valuer whether the new measurement was the appropriate standard for measurement in this case.  This is black and white.  The paragraph goes on to state that the OPW then sought advice from one of its internal chartered surveyors who advised that if measurement under the new IPMS code resulted in a larger reported area, the OPW should ensure that the rate per m2 is recalibrated.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

I disagree with him and think that he should not have included that in his statement.  What I would like have to seen in his statement were the issues outlined by the Comptroller and Auditor General - certainly the major issues with the figures being one of them.  It would have been very easy for Mr. Buckley to do that rather than telling us it was a flagship building.  It is not relevant in terms of the mistakes that were made and the cost to the taxpayer of &euro;11 million and an ongoing &euro;300,000 or something like it per year.</p> <p>  The next issue concerns the internal controls.  The Comptroller and Auditor General looked at 20 samples.  Of those 20 samples, he discovered a building in Galway.  Is Mr. Buckley at liberty to name that building?  </p></speech>

Mr. Buckley does not know.  I might come back with specific questions separate from that.  It is interesting because that building remained empty for a very long time.  It was to be a flagship building in Galway with new modern hubs but it remained empty.  Suddenly it was rescued by State rents over a process.</p><p>State rents have rescued a building in Galway.  Social welfare is at one end and Revenue is at the other.  It is a story for another day because it should have become a public building.  It is now privately rented.  This is what I would love to be discussing today but I have run out of time.  We are now renting a building that should have been publicly acquired because there should have been a return to the taxpayer in Galway.  Again, there was a problem.  It was not a recalibration problem and it was not a measurement problem.  What was the problem here?</p></speech>

Reference is made to Mr. Maurice Buckley, Accounting Officer, 17 September 2018, and to rents receivable.  It is stated an internal review into rent collection controls was carried out in 2017.  The review identified that there are weaknesses in controls, due largely to the scale and diverse nature of the portfolio.  I accept not the weaknesses but the diverse nature of the portfolio.  Also identified is the lack of a central register of all lease agreements.  Who carried out that review internally?  Why did it happen?  Was it as a result of the activity of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

This has been the case for some time.  The management board, in addressing that, is now at the point of completing that piece of work and putting in a contracts register.  We are also, as I mentioned in my opening statement, putting in an entire estate management system, which is a very sophisticated piece of software that involves the approval of the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and all that.  Those items have been well known among OPW management for many years.  We are coming to a conclusion now.  They would have been highlighted by the internal auditor.</p></speech>

I believe the analysis of OPW spending arose as a result of this committee highlighting rents repeatedly.  In any event, a property asset management unit was established six years ago, in 2012.  A steering group was set up.  It finished its work in 2016.  A property asset management delivery plan was set up in 2013.</p></speech>

We are talking about two different points.  The property asset management delivery plan, PAMDP, relates to the full public sector property remit, which the OPW was asked to lead in 2013.  That is a project with work items.  To confuse matters further, there is a register of all public property owned by the OPW, local authorities and other bodies which has been created through that and will now be integrated into the new Land Development Agency as it comes on stream.  That is one piece of work.  The contracts register, about which I was speaking, was an OPW internal register dealing with OPW contracts.  I refer to the OPW only, or to managing our own business.</p></speech>

As Mr. Buckley will be aware, Mr. Morgan wrote to us.</p> <p>  In March 2014, we had the submission by Mr. Morgan and a colleague in relation to the accountability board in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  On 19 June 2014, the OPW Chairman had a meeting with Mr. Morgan on the matter of the submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and five high-value cases were provided.  In March 2015, the OPW surveyors made a submission that was distributed to the Committee of Public Accounts.  On 25 May 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General requested a response from the OPW to the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry.  In July 2015, the OPW requested the surveyors who wrote this to directly investigate the previously identified five sample cases with a particular emphasis on certain areas.  On 1 December, the OPW surveyors provided a detailed report on the same five cases for the OPW and that was brought forward.</p> <p>  The following is what I want to find out.  In December last, these two individuals provided a detailed report on five cases of concern that they had been asked to investigate by the OPW and I want to know what has happened since.  This report, of 1 December 2017, a copy of which I have to hand, is an extremely comprehensive report on five expenditure concerns.  I refer to numerous occasions, I have the letters, on which Mr. Morgan wrote.  On 8 March, he wrote to the Chairman asking where this was at.  On 12 March, the Chairman's private secretary wrote back acknowledging the letter, and on 30 April, wrote back stating it was being looked at.  On 8 May, Mr. Morgan wrote again to Mr. Buckley asking where this was at.  On 7 June, he wrote again, stating he was concerned about the lack of information coming back.  On 14 June, the OPW director of corporate services wrote back to Mr. Morgan stating basically there had been changes etc.  I have read the letter, which does not really say much.  On 2 July 2018, Mr. Morgan wrote to Mr. Buckley, as Chairman, again outlining his concerns and wondering why they had not been addressed, and stating he was willing to come in and speak.  On 4 July, that was acknowledged.  Then, on 2 August, Mr. Morgan wrote again, basically offering to assist and stating that the replies to date have been anodyne in nature and non-specific in their content.  On 9 August, this was acknowledged and then, on 26 August, Mr. Morgan wrote again to the director of corporate services.  There is the chronology, which I have read into the record, more or less.</p> <p>  I want to know, since 1 December 2017, after this report was published to OPW by two individuals one of whom has written to this committee, what Mr. Buckley has done about it.  It has been the guts of a year.  There are serious concerns raised in this report.  To some of the members here on the committee, the letter that was written by Mr. Alan Morgan is one of the most extraordinary letters we have ever received.  I want to know what Mr. Buckley has done.</p></speech>

The first time these were mentioned was going back to 1999, well before 2014.  As Deputy Kelly quite rightly points out - the Deputy's chronology is correct - the matters escalated in 2014 when they were formally raised with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the review.  At that stage, they were thoroughly investigated by the OPW, by my predecessor, Ms Clare McGrath.  It was very thoroughly done.  A good action, I think, was to involve the person, two members of staff, actually, at the time in the process.  They are very experienced valuers.  These are senior people.  These are people who we would really respect and whose views we would take very seriously.  I, personally, certainly would be concerned at the issues raised and want them addressed, and that was done in-depth during 2014-2015.  Various conversations took place.  Various reports and various interim feedback took place.  As Deputy Kelly correctly states, in November-December 2017, a full report was issued.  That report dealt with the same issues.</p></speech>

It is a very different organisation in 2017 and 2018 than what it was ten years previously.</p> <p>  The director of corporate services undertook to go through that report in forensic detail, and did so.  It took some time.  He pulled in expertise, as required-----</p></speech>

I should just explain these issues have been addressed for a long time.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had been kept informed of the dialogue.  A meeting was arranged in 2017.  I think in July 2017, a meeting was facilitated by the OPW with the Comptroller and Auditor General and the two individuals concerned.  We felt it was an ongoing process and very fully aired, and did not identify anything new.  The November report was passed on to the Comptroller and Auditor General at the Comptroller and Auditor General's request in June of this year and that is where matters stand.</p></speech>

Essentially, the report that was done in November 2017 identified the five completed OPW property acquisitions to identify accountability vulnerabilities in the context of non-optimal outcomes.  From that date until now, is there anything new to be concerned about in what happened in those five projects or anything that would result in a change in the manner in which the OPW does its business?</p></speech>

We will look at every aspect of any case or any other instance of misuse of public funds raised.</p></speech>

Following the OPW's request for it to be done in the first place, the report has since been sent to the Comptroller and Auditor General and he will do what he does best.  I look forward to his report.  I genuinely do.  I want to know the following, however.  There was a process in place and a request from the OPW to have this report done.  The report comments seriously on five projects.  How can Mr. Buckley come in here and not substantiate, in real terms, what has been done with this report?  What has been done to guarantee to this committee that there was not a significant loss to taxpayers?  What has been done to change processes in the OPW to ensure situations like this do not happen again?  From what Mr. Buckley has said today, I have seen nothing that addresses those two issues.</p></speech>

We are now talking about it four and a half years later.  It was not as if nothing was happening during those four and a half years.  There was constant dialogue and multiple discussions with the individual involved and interim documents were reviewed on <i>ad hoc</i>basis before the formal submission came together.

We all know the taxpayer lost out massively.  Some of the details of the others, however, have not been aired and certainly not with the knowledge in this report.  This is down to a level of detail that has never been seen before.  I am completely dissatisfied with the manner of the response being given here.  I came in here to give Mr. Buckley a chance to respond.  I have no confidence that the issues and the level of detail in this report have been addressed.  I also have no confidence that the taxpayer has been protected and will be protected into the future as a consequence of the changes that have been made as a result of this.  Equally, I have seen no correspondence to demonstrate that.  I say this in advance.  This report has gone to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I bet I will be proven right in saying that we will be discussing the issues in this report - I am not prejudicing anything that will happen - in a future report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It would probably have been done this time around except that the issue of the new home for the HSE took up so much time and space.  I expect the Comptroller and Auditor General will be doing the same thing for all of these cases as well.  I also expect that will happen, dare I say it, with future cases as well.  I am referring to the children's exploration station, the laboratory for the Department of Agriculture, the opera house in Limerick, the Revenue headquarters in Cork and a number of others as well on top of this.  I am saying this today.  Here is an opportunity in advance for Mr. Buckley to tell me what actions have been taken to ensure that lessons have been learned from this and there has been acknowledgement that mistakes were made.</p></speech>

I agree some of them are public knowledge and some less so.  It is hard to go through this without tackling each item individually.  I do not think that would be fair because the committee does not have the information yet.  I do not know how I can go through it.  I will certainly address any questions the Comptroller and Auditor General might have-----</p></speech>

I have one last question I want to ask on Miesian Plaza and then I will come back to this.  The change in the measurement protocol slipped in or fell in, or whatever phrase Mr. Buckley used earlier in an unfortunate choice of words that I will not hang him on.  Is there any documentation that warned that the change in the measurement protocol was going to cause an increased rent and, as a consequence, care needed to be taken?  Is there any internal documentation that shows that and, if so, why was it not dealt with?  If there is documentation, will Mr. Buckley provide it to the committee?</p></speech>

In retrospect, there is no doubt at all.  I said that openly.  I am not trying to defend this.  In retrospect, it is clear that this should have been picked up at the time.  It was not.  It should have been picked up at the final review of the lease.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was not, but it is being addressed now with the developer and will be followed through.  It has to do with the timing, with the measurements and with the lack of experience at that stage anywhere in the market of the implications of this measurement change.</p></speech>

As far as I am concerned, on the issues raised here, the lessons have not been learned to the level I would have expected.  I cannot be guaranteed the internal changes have happened in the OPW.  By extension, I do not have any confidence as a result of what I have seen in this documentation with regard to responding to the author.  Despite the deep concerns the author expressed to the OPW, it has not responded.  Second, I predict that the projects and the purchases outlined here will have to be looked at in the future by the Comptroller and Auditor General, just as the newly purchased headquarters of the HSE were looked at.  The fact Mr. Buckley is not getting into the detail of this, and the fact he is not willing to go through the loss of money to the taxpayer to the level that is required, and to respond to the author, for me, is deeply worrying.</p></speech>

Before I call Deputy Cullinane, it would be helpful to the Committee of Public Accounts and the public at large to see the documentation Mr. Buckley has just referred to from various people in the organisation on the various aspects of this issue.  What we really want to know about is governance.  Somebody at a more senior level must have decided either to disagree with it, or perhaps it was an uncomfortable truth they did not want to deal with at the time.  They may have said, "If it goes one way or the other way, it is the toss of a coin, and if it works out at a higher cost, so be it.  It is still good value for money", which Mr. Buckley seems to say the whole thing is anyway.  They might have thought perhaps it was not a big deal if they got it wrong as they still were getting a great deal anyway.  It would be helpful for us to see why the process was not followed through.  At what level did somebody say he or she saw all of that and heard what was being said but that they were not going there?  Does Mr. Buckley understand what I am asking?</p></speech>

In terms of the documentation, we do not have the correspondence the Committee of Public Accounts received previously on what is before us.  Just so I am clear, and the Chairman or the Comptroller and Auditor General might be able to clarify this, the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report deals with the Miesian Plaza and the failures in process that his office identified.  That is fair enough and we will deal with them.  The correspondence we have now got, which is PAC correspondence from a Mr. John Dowds and Mr. Alan Morgan, is from 2014, and there was a separate report at some point in 2017 that we will get.  Certainly, the 2014 letter talks about multiple property transactions and then potential issues such as mistaken, superficial judgments by the surveyor, hidden but legitimate considerations, ignorance of the market by the negotiating body or person, poor negotiating skills, compromised negotiating positions and corrupt actions.  We should say there is no evidence whatsoever of any corruption but that is what was said.  Am I right in saying the concerns in the 2014 letter and the 2017 report were not in regard to the building that is subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and it was a more general concern that these two individuals had?  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Mr. Buckley has a job to do and we have a job to do, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has a job to do.  I want to go back to some of the issues that were raised earlier because I was far from satisfied with Mr. Buckley's response.  The first one is in regard to the reports which would have been submitted to the board when it was making a decision.  Two alternative accommodation options were considered, namely, the former Central Bank premises on Dame Street and premises on St. Stephen's Green.  In response to another Teachta, Mr. Buckley said those alternative options were presented to the board.</p></speech>

Although I do not know who gave him the information, Mr. Buckley said earlier there was consideration at board level of the two alternative sites.  In what Mr. Bourke is reading out, there is no reference to St. Stephen's Green and no reference to the former Central Bank premises on Dame Street.  I ask Mr. Buckley again: at what board meeting were the two alternative options discussed and in what context?  Was documentation supplied to the board?  Was it done in an oral fashion?  Are there minutes of any meeting to show they were discussed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Maurice Buckley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018101100002#AA02400"><p>I have already explained the general context and the fact the previous Chairman visited one of those buildings in that context.  To get the actual documentation, as Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked, I will have to do a trawl of the meetings of the board at that time.  It is two years ago but we can do that.</p></speech>

It is a very specific question.  Section 6.12 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states "These [two alternative] options were noted in internal correspondence in August 2015 but were not formally documented in the submission to the Board in March 2016."  They were not formally submitted to the board, and "formally" is the appropriate word here.  What I want Mr. Buckley to do is come back to me with actual facts in regard to what and how these two alternative options were presented to the board.  I would imagine the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General asked for this information in the course of its examination and was not satisfied, which is why we have section 6.12.</p></speech>

It is important to have follow-through on the processes in place to protect the OPW, its staff and taxpayers' money being spent and also to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General do his job and for the Committee of Public Accounts to do our job.</p> <p>  I mentioned the alternative sites earlier.  If a proper business case was formally presented for both of those, the Comptroller and Auditor General would have had that information and been able to make a better assessment as to whether the Miesian Plaza was the better option.  We would be in a better position, but we are not in a position to do it.  By not doing that, by not following due process, by not giving the board the information it needs, and by not having the business cases and the formal processes correct, the Comptroller and Auditor General could not do his job in making a proper determination.

This comes up over and over again.  We saw it with NAMA and different organisations.  Sometimes I believe it is deliberate and intentional not to put these benchmarks in place because then organisations can do what they want to do or maybe it is easier for them.  I believe it goes back to some of the correspondence provided in 2014.  Mr. Bourke seems perplexed by my contribution.  It is bizarre that the board would not have been given the information on the alternatives it should have been given.  That is not some sort of minor oversight.  It is fundamental to the Comptroller and Auditor General doing his job and for us to adjudicate as to whether we got value for money.</p></speech>

These alternative sites would have been thoroughly discussed and evaluated.  The board members and all the expertise in that board would have been fully involved.  I am confident of that.  What we are talking about is a formal documentation of that process.  I have said that I will check the records of the management board to see if documents were produced evaluating the two alternatives and if they were, I will make them available to the committee.  We are talking about the documentation around the process.  We are not talking about the evaluation itself.  It is important to state that.  That has not been called into question and I would not like it called into question.  A thorough evaluation of alternatives did take place, but the Deputy is correct to say it was not documented in a way that makes it easy for the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the committee to follow.</p></speech>

In fact, it was not a slip at all.  People were aware of this.  Section 6.21 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states:</p><blockquote>In finalising the lease, the issue of the different measurement bases was considered.  When reviewing the lease, the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office (CSSO) requested OPW to confirm with its in-house valuer whether IPMS was the appropriate standard ... OPW then sought advice from one of its internal chartered surveyors...</blockquote> <p>Section 6.22 states:</p><blockquote>The reason for not reducing the rent per m<sup>2</sup>proportionately as a result of including the IPMS measurements in the lease is not clear.</blockquote> <p>My reading of this is that the Comptroller and Auditor General was not given a satisfactory answer by the OPW as to why that was not picked up and why that happened in the first place.

The critical point is that it was picked up but not acted upon.  When the Comptroller and Auditor General was doing his job examining this, he was not given a credible reason as to why it was not acted upon.  Certainly if a credible reason was given, it is not in his report, which is unacceptable.</p> <p>  I have one final question and I will come back in on the second round.  Mr. Bourke made an interesting observation earlier when he said that he was concerned about this in September 2017 when he took over his role and he sought an internal review in November 2017.   I think he was just about to say that in May 2018 a first draft of that review was available.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

When issues come to anybody's attention that may be of relevance to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, it should be informed, whether in draft form or otherwise.  The OPW had a responsibility in this regard.  If it had concerns and sought a report, it ought to have at least notified the Comptroller and Auditor General's office that an internal report had been requested, that it may take some time to do, and when and if that report is complete, it would be given to the office.  Did that ever happen?  Was Mr. McCarthy ever informed that an internal review was carried out?</p></speech>

People can comment a lot on one case or another, but I need to know the facts of the case.  The purpose of the review was that someone would independently go through the documentation and the copious files, and there is no doubt that the initial draft in May, for instance, started indicating the measurement issue.  That was the first time I became aware of that issue.  Parallel to that, the Comptroller and Auditor General was proceeding with his inquiries.</p></speech>

We set regulatory standards for everybody else except the people at the top.  Mr. Buckley understands the point I am making.  I agree he may have a team with access to the largest payable rent roll in the country, and who have access to the most square footage, at 800,000 sq.m or 900,000 sq. m, for civil servants, but we have chosen not to make it an essential prerequisite for officials to have qualifications.  The point is made and I want to move on.</p> <p>  The difference between the international property measurement standard, IPMS 3, and net lettable area, which Mr. Buckley refers to as net internal area, is not rocket science.  It would have taken basic common sense and not a degree to know that the OPW or its agents negotiated a lease based on net lettable area.  That is measurement to the walls, which does not include service cores such as elevators and stairs, or pillars.</p></speech>

This accounts for the 3% or 4%.  The OPW negotiates a price, directly or through its agents, with the owner or landlord based on net lettable area, effectively divided by the number of square feet, to come up with a per square foot area, and then multiplies this by the bigger area, which is IPMS3, thus giving a higher rent.  Is this correct?  Is that what happened?</p></speech>

It is worth reading something before it is signed.  I would not have the expertise of the big valuer firms but I know the difference between the two measurements and I know how they are done.

So far it has cost us &euro;17 million because of the delay, and I appreciate Mr. Buckley is saying the OPW had to do the fit-out, and then there will be a payment of &euro;344,000 per year after that.  So far, nobody is responsible but we have established that nobody at the top is qualified in terms of academic qualifications.</p> <p>  Mr. Buckley said net lettable area and IPMS3 is a complex issue but it is not.  It is basic banana maths except we are dealing with millions of euro of the public's money.  A five year old with 20 cent in a sweet shop would not make the mistakes we are making as a nation with millions of euro.  There is nothing specialist about the maths 101 mistake that was made in this deal, which cost people a fortune.</p> <p>  We can only judge what is provided to us in writing.  We have it in writing that the OPW was told this in February 2017.  With the best of respect to Mr. Burke and the experience he has in the OPW, the entire assistant secretary level in the OPW has no property qualification.  I am the only licensed property professional in the room and I am on the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have my licence from the PSRA.  I am a member of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV.  None of the witnesses is but they have significant experience, more experience than anybody else here in property.  One thing is certain, if the person who made banana maths mistake that cost &euro;1 million was working for Jones Lang LaSalle, he or she would not have made it to the end of that week.  That person would be gone.  People would be identified.  As is the norm here, we take refuge in words such as "culture", "systemic failure" and "review".  Deputy Connolly ascertained that there was internal review.  An external reviewer has been brought in who will get a brief from the OPW and who will be able to give it some credibility through the fact there will be an outcome that states the OPW has new processes and procedures in place.  Mr. Buckley mentioned this.  What new processes and procedures have been put in place to prevent this happening again?</p></speech>

I can tell Mr. Buckley if that was still his attitude and he was still in the private sector, he would be gone out of business.</p> <p>  Did the experts that the OPW secured to help with the procurement of the Miesian Plaza come to the organisation with a suggestion for a building that might work for it, or did the OPW go to them saying that this is a building it was interested in and ask them to negotiate on its behalf?</p></speech>

In fact, therefore, only one building was seriously in play.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

It is an old building, however, and there were a lot of structural and technical issues and it was considered not to be a good choice.  It is not that one could say in advance that there is only one option, but, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, there were not many options available at the time.  Five or ten years earlier in the middle of the downturn, there would have been options aplenty to review and evaluate.  At that time, there were three reasonable and credible options, but one clearly emerged as the preference among them.</p></speech>

The CSSO further pointed out that issues could arise where the landlord sold the premises, if the repairs and maintenance were not carried out satisfactorily, or if the landlord went into receivership or liquidation.</p><p>It is then stated that there is a side agreement in addition to the lease.  Can Mr. Buckley decipher that side agreement?  My understanding is that the OPW also has maintenance obligations.

The Deputy is quite right.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office pointed out that despite the fact that we have full repair and maintenance obligations in respect of the building, an agreement was entered into whereby the landlord would carry out certain work.  That is not unusual at all.  I will outline the first reason it was deemed appropriate that the landlord would do it and there was no real need for an agreement.</p></speech>

According to paragraph 6.15, the OPW agreed 13,293 sq. m of office space.  The agency negotiated and signed off on that.  Who draws up the lease in these cases?

Our valuers and property professionals will attest that measurement is one of the biggest issues in every deal on a lease.

To show how confusing it is, the measurement was made in December 2017.  The lease negotiation was well advanced, the lawyers had been all over it and we still did not have an accurate measurement.

At the time it was negotiated, the lease was clearly based on net internal area in our opinion.  Due to the SCSI guidelines moving to IPMS 3, by the time we closed the lease it was clearly based on IPMS 3.  That much was understood and clear.  What was not clear was the agreement to readjust the rent so that the total sum remained the same.  That is where the issue we discussed this morning arose.</p></speech>

The witnesses said this is a good deal overall.  We are all aware of what Hawkins House looks like, what an awful building it is and the opportunity for redevelopment of that whole area.  Some of it has started.  However paragraph 6.35 refers to the delay in getting into the building, which added to the costs.  The OPW disputed the quantum of the cost, given the refit and the other things that happened.  Paragraph 6.35 shows that costs were involved in staying in Hawkins House.  Was that accounted for in the amount the witnesses mentioned earlier?   One cannot pick one and not pick the other.</p></speech>

We picked the higher cost.  The higher cost is the Miesian Plaza building.  One could say it was not costing anything to keep the civil servants in Hawkins House apart from the small maintenance costs, but there was an opportunity cost.  The whole point was to take advantage of the new building and the new work environment.  We took the higher cost.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will agree we have not argued that the alternative had no rent associated with it.</p></speech>

The public is being very attentive to the proceedings of this committee this morning.  My constituency office received several phone calls from people saying that they could not follow all of the debate because some people in this room are clicking their pens or affecting the microphones in some way.  Those who are listening and watching attentively have not been able to hear the audio properly because individuals in this room are not aware of this.  The phones calls to which I refer show that people are watching everything.  Some of us are clicking our pens too loudly.  I ask that people refrain from doing so in future.</p></speech>

There was confusion this morning about whether we had received the documentation for 2017.  It was received during the week.  The request relating to it was sent from the Committee of Public Accounts email account but the response came back to a different email address and it was not picked up.  We did not receive the 2014 report originally - probably due to the size of the document or some other technical issue - but we have it now.  We have everything we need and copies have been made for members.  I must inform members that the document we received is not for publication.  We can discuss it at a subsequent meeting or decide whether to publish it all or to publish a redacted version.  As of now, it is a confidential document for members only.  It is not for publication.</p></speech>

We were talking about the job description or job profile for the head of planning and estate management.  I contributed loosely to outlining the job specification.  The actual specification was written by the Top Level Appointments Committee, the Public Appointments Service and our HR department.  It goes through all of that process.  I am sure, however, that was understood.</p></speech>

I understand that previously another person at this committee had referred to a policy.  There actually is no policy, at least we are not aware of a policy.  The decision-making relating to build, buy or lease is very much considered at the time the accommodation is required, but it is heavily driven by public finances.</p></speech>

The OPW spending review by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform looked at spending by the OPW on State rents.  The report says that consideration should be given to "analysis of the effectiveness of the current model in meeting accommodation requirements, and, assessing if value for money is being obtained".  An analysis of the effectiveness has not been done and we need further research on it.  In a sense, the OPW is a symptom of policy in this regard, yet Mr. Buckley states that there is no policy.</p></speech>

It was produced under pressure in response to the frequency with which the issue of rent paid for buildings is raised at this committee and, possibly, others.  We are actively colluding with the market to make the rents higher.  The OPW thinks that &euro;300 million is good value for money.  We have been through that and I will not go back into it.</p></speech>

My colleagues would confirm that any project we have that is worth over &euro;20 million has a very thorough business case.  We have introduced changes since that time.  We have a very formal project procedure now through a mechanism called the project oversight group, which has very strict rules, not only covering the internal approval of projects but also the assignment of those projects to the different teams in the Office of Public Works, OPW, or externally.  As a result of this report and our work over the last number of years - including a full competency and capability review since 2013 - many good new systems have been added within the OPW.  I am confident that the current situation is very strong.</p></speech>

I do not believe that any public service should be demonised in any way, but I do believe they should be held to account.  The lack of process here does not help.  I do not believe the private sector is any better in this regard; in fact, I believe it is worse, but it is not subjected to the same scrutiny.  To put my comments in context, the private sector has not served us well in Ireland.  Fortunately there is a higher standard for our public service.  I do not believe that it is correct to say that going private would be better.  In my experience, it is not.  However, serious process difficulties have been highlighted here.</p> <p>  I was a councillor for a long time and was there when the OPW was doing great work on the ground analysing the flooding situation.

There is another 50,000 sq. ft unit at 1GQ and the cost includes car parking spaces.  It is a 20-year lease, with a break clause after 15 years.  There is 12 months' free rent.

What I would be happy to do, with the luxury of having my phone turned on, is to come back with other properties that we would see as comparable with our deal to see how they would actually square up in the market.  A specific question I asked of TWM, in anticipation of such an exchange, was where it would see the market going.  It stated it was certainly moving towards a figure of &euro;60 or in excess of it for an equivalent deal.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that it was poor practice not to go in.  Whether the OPW decided off the record, privately and internally that the Central Bank or George's Quay, for example, was not appropriate, in its brief TWM ought to have listed the five options it was looking to have.  We are all human and TWM is only as good as the target set for it.  What I am suggesting to the witnesses is that we set the bar pretty low.

As I understand it, there is a Minister and two or three Ministers of State in that Department alone.  I know from another life that it handles about 11,000 or 12,000 parliamentary questions a year, which is a phenomenal number.  That shows how closely associated it is with the D&aacute;il and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is, therefore, a choice: do you go farther out of the city and have rafts of officials in taxis and particularly on overtime, constantly coming to and out of the D&aacute;il, or do you take a prudent decision and decide that it is more sensible that they be closer to the D&aacute;il with maybe someone else who is not in the D&aacute;il as often being slightly further out?  That is the balance to be struck.  For instance, one would not locate a warehouse in the city centre; one would locate it out towards the M50 or farther out in the countryside.  It is about the nature of the Department; the Department of Health, although there are others, is particularly policy-driven.</p></speech>

If one asks the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection a parliamentary question related to pensions, it is answered from Sligo.  If one asks something to do with the Saolta hospital group, it will probably be answered from Galway.  Telecommunication is instantaneous.</p></speech>

As the Committee of Public Accounts, this is the kind of thing we need to be recommending.  I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General agrees.  I want to move over to Harcourt Square for a second, where we have the ongoing debacle with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We had an issue with the lease some years ago.  We had to try to get an extension to the lease and it was changing hands for approximately &euro;40 million or &euro;45 million.  NAMA was involved.  I believe Hibernia REIT has it now.  The site has the potential to provide 360,000 sq. ft.  Why did we not try to buy that?  Was a case made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to approach NAMA and say that this site could be bought for &euro;40 million?  The Garda does not need 360,000 sq. ft so it could have more than covered its needs and perhaps have provided for others.  Was any case made?</p></speech>

Its key units, including the drugs squad, the Criminal Assets Bureau, and the emergency response units, operate out of Harcourt Square.  It is probably one of the most sensitive policing installations in the country.  People are familiar with the ongoing change and transition in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is in a constant state of flux.  It is something at which we have looked.  The opportunity to restructure the leases was mentioned previously.  The strategy we have now developed is to leave An Garda there.  We looked at temporarily moving it but the price we calculated was prohibitive.  The strategy is to build a brand new building on Military Road, tailored to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's unique accommodation requirements, so we extended the lease.</p></speech>

We went through a formal evaluation of a number of sites.  Some of them would have been on the perimeter of the M50.  We were even looking at a major redevelopment of An Garda headquarters in the Phoenix Park.  Looking at all the criteria, which include economic benefit, key elements within the assessment were operational requirements, particularly for elements like the emergency response unit.  Out of all the assessments, that site was the one that came out on top.  It had the added advantage of being in State ownership.</p></speech>

If we had access to substantial capital, we could build a bigger building.  The decision on whether we put an extra floor on it or drop the floor is a function of affordability.  Once we capped spending at &euro;80 million we were limited in terms of the height, so we had to drop a floor of the preliminary design.</p></speech>

In terms of the Estimates process, we will ask for substantially more than is actually given to us but even in the justice sector there is a huge number of developments including a new forensic science laboratory and other major developments.  There is &euro;100 million gone on three major regional Garda centres - Kevin Street, Wexford and Galway.  There is huge investment, but it is a finite pool.  Anyone of us would say that if we could get money - and this also relates to the previous Deputy's questioning - it would colour our decisions on whether to lease or construct new facilities.  The key issue with Military Road is that while, yes, we can meet the demands of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are capped at &euro;80 million.</p></speech>

As I say, it is unfortunate that we are before the committee on a number of issues but, as an organisation, we do have these conversations.  We had intensive negotiations with various entities.  We actually engaged in a partnership with the owners of Apollo House.  We used the same design team and went through the same planning process in order to defray costs.  The designs of both buildings were in sync with each other so we got way above what we would have gotten if we had gone ahead on our own.  We have had conversations with other developers who would be interested in doing an equity swap or developing an asset for us elsewhere, although not for a Garda facility which is highly specialised building.  Once we tease through those possibilities, I do not think they are viable options.  Apropos of the Deputy's previous conversation, Government Departments insist on being in the centre of the city - whether it is right, wrong or indifferent of them to do so - given their interaction with Government.  That is essential.</p></speech>

It is an issue of the people who hold the lease, the charity, claiming that they require funding in order to make it viable.  That would not be the view taken by the OPW.  There is a 99 year lease which needs to perform.  Papers have been served on this in the courts.  I would be a little wary of saying anything else from a legal point of view.</p></speech>

Two speakers who had indicated, Deputies Alan Farrell and David Cullinane, are not here.  Why did the OPW spend &euro;6 million less on flood management in 2017 than in 2016?

It gives an increase of &euro;3.694 million relative to what what was provided for in appropriations-in-aid.  It was mainly due to an increase of admissions at Kilmainham Gaol, amounting to &euro;662,000, and other sites, amounting to &euro;953,000.  In addition, tour operator receipts increased by &euro;924,000 in the year.</p></speech>

That is fine.  People will be disappointed to hear that the OPW spent less last year, whatever the reason, whether it was the result of cycles of capital investment or 2016 being an exceptional year.  People would expect more, although projects are ongoing.</p> <p>  I have more questions.  On page 22 of the appropriation accounts it states, "Expenditure in 2017 includes payments of &euro;4.880 million ... made to contractors and others to cover costs as a result of conciliation and arbitration proceedings."  What were the four cases that cost &euro;4.88 million in arbitration and conciliation?  Why are we in this situation?  What type of disputes are happening that they would go to arbitration and conciliation?</p></speech>

When there is something in the appropriation account, we expect representatives to bring the details with them when they come before this committee.  The appropriation account lists four things and what those four things were is an obvious, stand-out question.  The OPW will send the information to us but our guests will understand my point.  If other people were here, they would give out to out guests twice as much as I am.  It is included in the accounts and we would expect answers in respect of it.</p> <p>  The OPW is owed &euro;14.2 million by various different Departments and agencies for work carried out.  Can we have a breakdown and age analysis in respect of that?  What does the OPW do to collect that?  It has increased by &euro;4 million over the year.

I have not seen that yet.  I want to know if the site has been purchased.  We all know the site to which we are referring but I want to know if it has been bought yet.  I am seeking information on the most up-to-date position.</p><p>My last question is on the national children's science centre.  I do not know too much about it but I have discussed it with a few people and read an article about it in <i>The Times </i>, Ireland Edition on 4 October.  The OPW worked on this and can explain what is involved.  Essentially, it is a new planetarium and science centre for children with plans for more than 200 exhibits at the back of Earlsfort Terrace, close to Iveagh Gardens.  There are planning issues involving trees, tennis courts and so on and the application has gone to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Who has borne the costs of getting the project to this point?</p></speech>

The building for the science museum, as the Chairman has said, is to be developed by the OPW at Earlsfort Terrace.  The project has been pursued by 13 very eminent individuals for the last 25 to 30 years who have been supported by three Government Departments.</p></speech>

The OPW has supported it in kind by providing architectural designs for the building.  The history of this dates from the beginning of the century.  A project was developed back in 2003 for Heuston Gate.  The OPW had a huge development planned there and it proved possible, at the behest of the then Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, and T&aacute;naiste, Ms Mary Harney, to include this science centre.  It is a very worthy project, which links into our STEM education promotion and so on.  The idea was that it would not cost the State any money and the building could be provided as part of the total development.  So far, so good but unfortunately, when the recession hit, like so many Celtic tiger projects, the museum got blown out the window and could not go ahead.  At that time, the OPW had umpteen projects in the heritage and cultural areas that had to paused or stopped.  All of the different promoters went back to the drawing board, reassembled their teams, rebuilt their business case as well as the public and political support to go ahead with the project.  For reasons best explained by themselves, the promoters of the national children's science centre chose a different route and pursued a legal angle in that they determined that they had a binding legal commitment from the State, through the OPW, and that seemed to be the case.  The OPW then had to enter into a follow-on agreement in 2013 to provide a premises.  We did that very carefully and located a premises in Earlsfort Terrace so that at least the building would be on a very important historical property owned, long term, by the State.  There is a commitment to provide that building free of charge to the promoters of the centre.  I have correspondence-----</p></speech>

It is very hard.  Even if we do a cost-benefit analysis, it is very hard to do it in an objective way if, hanging over that process, is a commitment to build a building for &euro;40 million.  The project is a very good project.  I am sure it should stand on its own merits.  I am sure the promoters believe that.  If that is the case, I am sure the Government will back it and it does not need a legal contract.

I want to thank the witnesses from the OPW and the Comptroller and Auditor General for their attendance today and for the material provided.  There was a little bit of a mix-up about information but we have it now.  It shows the value of being able to check back with the office during the course of a long meeting and getting the information to us.  We are not publishing that document at this stage.</p><p>We will not do anything without consulting the witnesses and we may not even go there at all with the document.  We asked for some items of information and they will be sent in writing to the secretariat.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.</p><p> Before we adjourn, I note that the report of the Charleton tribunal gives glowing praise to Mr. Maurice McCabe, who met members of the Committee of Public Accounts and spoke to the Comptroller and Auditor General about speeding fines and the loss to the Exchequer.  Much time was spent following up on the matter.  It was mentioned earlier that the committee was heavily criticised for examining matters such as speeding fines but we knew the job we were doing and we were right to do it.  Mr. McCabe was right to do what he did.  Mr. Justice Charleton gave him a glowing report in saying he always put the interests of the State above all other issues, including his loyalty to his day job.  He put the State first and came out with some good praise.  We acknowledge the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General helped to get the matter to the Charleton tribunal.  I know examination of the issues is not yet complete but it is important to note the findings.  At our next meeting we will meet representatives of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the morning before meeting representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority in the afternoon.</p></speech>

I appreciate it is under time pressure and, therefore, I will be as brief as possible and skip over some of the slides.</p> <p>  I will focus on the wholesale broadband markets, which, unlike retail markets, we regulate.  ComReg's objectives in regulating them are to ensure end users get the benefit of choice and competition, as well as the benefit of efficient investment in new networks and services, as my slides will illustrate.</p> <p>  ComReg made a major decision in 2013 about what the rules should be for the wholesale access to Eir's high-speed network, which we are now rolling out.  We had the objective of promoting competition and so on.  Since then, one can see that the speeds available and taken up by consumers in Ireland have increased.  The red line on the slide shows the speeds greater than 30 Mbps.  When we made that decision in 2013, it was a little under 30%, whereas now almost three quarters of all users have speeds above 30 Mbps, according to our latest figures.  One should acknowledge that while the commercial roll-out that has enabled that increase to happen has been in an area of the country where it is commercially viable, there is another area where it has not been commercially viable for Eir or its competitors to roll out high-speed broadband, which is the subject of the Government's intervention programme and which is a matter for it rather than us.</p> <p>  I mentioned that the provision of competition and choice was one of our objectives.  As one can see on the slides, competition has also developed over the same period since 2013.  There has been a growth in the market share taken by Sky, which is the dark blue line second from the top, and growth in the share taken by Vodafone, largely at the expense of the two largest players in 2013.  Vodafone's and Sky's ability to compete in the market depends greatly on their use of Eir's network.  If not for the rules that ComReg had put in place to ensure access to those networks, we would just have the two big players, Virgin Media and Eir.</p><p>In terms of the platforms, one can see the roll-out of the investment by Eir.  Virgin has also slightly extended its network.  It has also increased the speeds over that time.  One can see from the chart on slide 5 that the number of customers using the higher-speed service platforms, represented by the light blue section of the chart upwards, has grown while the number of customers using the lower-speed platforms has fallen.  Again, it is interesting to note that the two blue sections of the chart both represent Eir platforms.  That shows how there has been a shift from Eir's lower-speed services to its higher-speed services in both its retail business and the services used by wholesale customers using Eir's network.  The last thing to talk about, which I know was discussed at the previous sessions the committee has had on this topic, is the fibre to the home service, which is represented by the red bar at the very top of the chart.  That has really only just gotten going.  Some of that is Eir's fibre to the home service in rural areas and some of it is provided by SIRO in some of the second-tier towns.</p><p> There was a comment made in a previous session of the committee about whether ComReg might be too pro-competition and not pro-investment enough.  We do not think there is a tension between the two.  One of the biggest incentives to invest is the need to meet competitive threats.  I am sure that Deputies get complaints from constituents about unavailability more often in areas in which there is less competition rather than areas in which there is more.  That has certainly been our experience.  One can see that the investment figures have held up very well over that time.  Investment can be a bit cyclical depending on what is going on in the marketplace, but there is no evidence at all of investment being deterred by regulation.  Of course, in the last few months, we have seen an announcement by Eir of a further big investment programme in fibre to the home services in urban areas.</p><p> I want to give a little bit of context about how we regulate.  The way we regulate the wholesale markets is set by the European framework.  There are really three questions we have to answer.  We have to look at the wholesale markets and see whether there is any operator in those markets which has significant market power.  That means ascertaining whether there is an operator that could do what it likes without having to worry too much about the impact of competition on it.  If we find an operator that has such significant market power, we must think about the problems that could cause and how we can remedy them.  The way we remedy the problems is by requiring such operators to allow competitors access to their network.  We set a number of conditions about how that access is to be granted.  One of these, which is very important is a condition on how prices should be set.  I will not go through all the steps on slide 7 but I will observe that there are many steps to be gone through.  There are a lot of data, it is a very painstaking process, and there are a number of consultations and other people involved.  It can take a bit of time to do but once we have made our decisions we move to the box on the right of the slide, which refers to monitoring what is going on, checking that Eir is complying and enforcing when it does not.  Those are extremely important tasks for us.   We also update the remedies, particularly the pricing remedies, as the data change.</p><p> We got to the next-to-last stage, which involves notifying our decisions to the European Commission.  Those notified decisions are public.  I can tell the committee that just a few hours ago we got comments back from the European Commission.  As it has no serious doubts and very few comments, there will be no delay as a result of that process.  We expect to make those decisions final within the next week or two.  As for what we are proposing, it includes the usual remedy of Eir having to provide access to third parties that want to use its fibre, its copper networks and its ducts and poles.  The second proposal, that Eir must act in a way that does not discriminate and must treat its own retail business in the same way as that of third parties, is very important.  That was also a big issue in some of the committee's previous hearings on this matter.  The other thing I will comment on in respect of slide 8 is that we are planning to remove regulation from some parts of the market.  While we will continue to regulate the last mile, the connection from the telephone exchange or from the exchange to the customers' premises, previously we had also regulated the backhaul from the exchanges to the central part of the network.  We are reducing the area in which we are imposing that regulation.</p><p> I wanted to talk specifically about prices because that was also something that had come up.  We are proposing to reduce the prices charged by Eir for the use of the last mile of its network.  We are moving the basis of regulation.  Previously Eir had a lot of flexibility on the price it charged as long as it left enough room between its retail prices and its wholesale prices for competitors to make a margin.  For the fibre to the cabinet service, we are now changing that and setting the precise price Eir is allowed to charge.  Those prices will come down in comparison with what Eir is currently charging.  </p><p> I will talk a little bit about the fibre to the home connection charge, which was raised in the two most recent sessions.  At the moment, Eir is free to set that charge as it wishes, again subject only to the rules on there being a sufficient margin between wholesale prices and retail prices.  We have been concerned about that charge however.  At the last hearing, Eir informed the committee that its cost of connecting a premises was &euro;450 on average.  ComReg has not verified that number but we will take it as correct for now.  The committee asked a very good question of Eir, which was how long does the asset last.  The answer given was that it lasted for 20 years.  The problem was that connection charge is the best part of two thirds of the cost of the asset, which will last 20 years, but a competitor might retain the customer and the use of that asset for only 42 months on average.  Therefore, there is a real mismatch between the real risk the competitor has to take in paying that proportion of the costs with no guarantee that it would retain the customer for that long.  We thought that had a significant potential to inhibit the development of competition.  In fact, so far we have not seen any competitors use that fibre to the home network.  We think that may be one of the reasons.  We are therefore changing the regulation.  We are still giving Eir some flexibility about the charge, but we have changed the rules.  We think that the amount it will charge might be in the range of &euro;80 to &euro;150.  It will still have some flexibility.</p><p> The last thing about which I will talk, which again came up in previous sessions the committee has had, was about ComReg's staff and powers.  It is quite unusual for regulated entities, that is, organisations being regulated, to ask for the regulator to have more staff and more powers.  I have to say that we agree with them.  We think that if we had more staff we would be able to move more quickly, do more things and fulfil our remit, which is very broad, a little better.  Equally, we think that having adequate deterrent powers is very important.  In other sectors and in other member states it is common for regulators to have the ability to directly impose financial penalties.  We have been discussing both these issues with the Government.  They are both regarded as high priority issues.  Of course we recognise that, particularly on the issue of staff, there are wider public policy issues at play in terms of the overall size of the public sector.  Therefore, just because we think we need something, it does not mean that it is the right thing for the Government to do.  The ultimate decisions on these issues will, of course, be a matter for the Government.  The question of powers will ultimately be a matter for the Oireachtas.  That was a gallop through the slides.</p></speech>

I have one or two questions before I bring in the members.  Would Mr. Godfrey consider carrying out an external independent analysis of the regulatory environment, similar to that undertaken by Commission for Regulation of Utilities in Ireland, CRU?  It undertook a peer review.  That is one question.</p> <p>  On the Stiles report, Eir was found to be in breach of a regulation and subsequently there were investigations by Cartesian and KPMG.  I know that Eir expressed surprise that other members of the industry were upset by the breaches found.</p><p>I know there are High Court proceedings and I am not asking Mr. Godfrey to get into any detail, but in general would ComReg take these breaches seriously?</p></speech>

Regulatory governance is important because if Eir does not have a good way of managing its compliance it will not know whether it is complying, and neither will ComReg or the industry.  If the industry does not know, its confidence to invest can be affected.  There has been ongoing discussion between ComReg and Eir for many years.  In 2013, Eir started a wholesale compliance programme intended to address some of those issues.  ComReg stated it would review the programme after it had been running for a while and, based on ComReg's evaluation of how well it was doing, it would decide whether more needed to be done.</p> <p>  The Stiles report was one of the reports produced as a result of that programme and Eircom was encouraged to publish it in the interests of transparency.  That report disclosed a number of failings, as well as some good things.  Eir had made progress on operational issues like order processing, particularly in respect of its mature products.  The report disclosed some breaches, some of which ComReg had already identified and about which we were taking compliance action.  It probably speaks for itself that ComReg has taken five compliance cases and has sought penalties from the courts amounting to &euro;10 million.  </p> <p>  There is a sixth case where ComReg has formed an opinion of non-compliance but has not yet taken it to court.  That speaks to the seriousness with which ComReg sees the breaches.</p> <p>  ComReg commissioned Cartesian and KPMG to review how well the governance model was working following the Stiles report.  Those reviews found good things and serious flaws, particularly around strategic decision making and incentives and some information technology issues.  ComReg consulted the industry on its views and there have been discussions with Eir about how those things could be remedied.  Regulatory action may be taken, but there were also discussions about Eir taking action on a non-regulatory basis.  Those discussions are part of settlement discussions relating to ongoing legal action.  We were in court on Monday this week and informed the court those discussions were going well and that we hoped that, by 12 November, which is the next court date, an agreement would be finalised.  As that is part of the ongoing court proceeding, I do not want to say more than that.</p></speech>

One thing that is happening at the moment in the telecoms space is that an entirely new European regulatory regime is coming into force, although many of the provisions will be developments of what is in place at the moment.  It will be necessary for ComReg to work out what difference that will make and how it might change how the codes are implemented.  It would be more timely to consider an external review after those changes have been implemented.</p></speech>

As Mr. Godfrey said, Vodafone and Sky use Eir on the last mile.  Do they use Eir for the backhaul as well?  Are they using the entire Eir network in terms of getting that service or do they tend to separate out their retail last mile, to the connection to the customer, and then do separate backhaul, or is that typically an integrated package?</p></speech>

ComReg is deregulating parts of the backhaul market and that is a reflection of the fact that there are now alternatives to Eir for backhaul in many parts of Ireland.</p></speech>

From casual conversations with different operators, it does not seem there has been a huge development of backhaul alternatives, certainly using State infrastructure.  What ducting is used on roads?  I understand the rail network is still with BT.  ESB has a figure-of-eight backhaul network.  Could Mr. Godfrey outline why the backhaul was deregulated?

Fibre to the home is capable of speeds up to 1 Gbps.  The highest speed with cable offered by retail at the moment is 300 Mbps.  The contention issues are different between the two networks so they will undoubtedly compete with each other but they will have a different proposition for customers.</p> <p>  ComReg has not publically broken down how much of that is on the Eir network and how much is on the SIRO network because of commercial sensitivity.  Those would be the two main fibre to the home roll-outs.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the delegates have an indicative figure for what the spend on mobile broadband will be in 2018.  While one can understand, as Mr. Godfrey says, fixed broadband increases and the fact that people are increasingly using Wi-Fi hotspots, it is still rather worrying, given that we should be moving towards next generation services, that many parts of the country still do not have access to 4G or the network coverage is really poor.  I have had to stop making mobile calls around here because the network cuts out all of the time.  My mobile phone has a radio on it and it is no of bloody use because every now and then I lose the signal.  Why is the level of investment in mobile broadband falling when the quality, even for voice and mobile Internet services away from a hotspot or Wi-Fi connection, is really poor?  Is Mr. Godfrey even slightly concerned about this?</p></speech>

There was a large investment when 4G was being rolled out first.  There is continuing investment to improve the quality of 4G by operators.  We are concerned about the mobile broadband customer experience.  I think we have discussed this matter with the committee most times we have been before it recently.  We have done a number of things to improve the mobile broadband customer experience.  There are some things users could do to help themselves.  We have been testing handsets in order that users in marginal coverage areas who experience a poor service can identify whether they might be able to improve their experience with a better handset.  We have liberalised the use of mobile phone repeaters in order that people can have better coverage and a better service inside their own homes.  Towards the end of the year we will produce a coverage map.  It will be the first time there will have been authoritative independent information on how people can expect different networks to perform in different locations.  These things can all help the mobile broadband customer experience.  In the longer term, towards the beginning of 2020, we will assign further spectrum.  I know that coverage obligations will be front and centre of our consideration of how to run the assigning process.</p></speech>

There is a proposal that local authorities map black spots.  I think it was announced last year that this process would happen and that local engineers were testing main roads to see where the black spots were.  How extensive will the map ComReg will produce be?  Will it be at the level of minute detail, showing the gaps in coverage along roads?  There is talk that local government infrastructure will be used to increase the level of coverage.  Has ComReg been involved in that process to any degree?</p></speech>

To answer the Senator's question about the level of detail, I will give a little information on how we are producing the map.  We have obtained from all of the operators information on where their masts are, the technology and antennas used on the masts and the level of power.  We are using this raw information and standard engineering rules to predict signal strength.  I think our model is based on a 10 m square which provides a fine level of detail of signal strength.  The map will, therefore, be of that resolution to allow people to see what the level of coverage is.  These are engineering predictions and the actual experience may differ because of the leaves growing on trees - it can be affected by all sorts of things - but the prediction will be very finely grained.  The prediction model is also calibrated by on-the-ground drive tests.  I think in putting the model together there have been 96 drives in different circumstances to ensure we finetune the prediction in order that it will match the reality.  It will be a very good piece of information for people to have.</p> <p>  I think the Senator talked about local authority infrastructure.  One of the things that has certainly proved difficult for mobile broadband operators in improving coverage for various reasons has been finding sites on which to place masts.  It has been a very good initiative to have mobile broadband offices in the local authorities to help tjo address that issue.</p></speech>

It, of course, made a big difference to our ability to deliver the reviews.  They are very complicated, but there is no question that if we had more resources, we would have been able to deliver them more quickly.  We need more resources in the area of market analysis.  We have also taken steps to improve our productivity and redeployed resources within ComReg, but we have also sought more resources from the Government.  We are in discussions with the Department, for which I know that it is a high priority, but as I said, there are wider Government policy issues about the overall size of the public sector and so forth, which are not specifically issues for ComReg.  However, they need to be taken into account when the Government makes its decision on whether to authorise us to increase our headcount.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Eamonn Crowley, group chief financial officer, and Shane O'Sullivan, group director of operations.</p> <p>  I wish to set out my views on Project Glas in four sections.  The first is the question of why we have performed this transaction.  Permanent TSB is a regulated entity.  We are required to follow the rules and directions of our regulator.  On the subject of non-performing loans the direction is very clear in that we must reduce the ratio of non-performing loans on our balance sheet from 25% in a relatively short timeframe.  This transaction is a critical part of our strategy to do so.  Even without any regulatory requirement, reducing the non-performing loans ratio is the correct strategy to pursue.  Non-performing loans make the bank less secure, less able to compete, less able to grow or prosper and less able to lend to new customers.</p><p>No bank can continue indefinitely with an elevated non-performing loan ratio because to do so would run undue risk for it, its customers and the taxpayer.  Permanent TSB is conscious of this and has therefore reduced the value of non-performing loans on its balance sheet by almost &euro;4 billion, or 42%, since 2013.  Loans linked to over 13,800 homes have been restored to performing status thanks to the hard work of the relevant customers and the bank.</p><p> Permanent TSB's non-performing loan ratio remains elevated, however.  Ten years on from the start of the financial crisis - many commentators say that we are closer to the start of the next one than to the end of the last one &ndash; the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, requires urgent action from banks across Europe to reduce non-performing loan levels, including within Permanent TSB and other Irish banks.  In this context, the European Commission, the SSM and the Central Bank of Ireland have all said that loan sales constitute a legitimate tool for banks to use to reduce non-performing loan ratios.  This tool is being used by Permanent TSB, by other Irish banks and by NAMA.  It is worth noting that key external observers have welcomed this transaction.  Earlier this month, Moody's upgraded a range of key ratings and assessments for Permanent TSB.  It highlighted the Project Glas loan sale and noted "the Bank's improved asset risk profile following a decrease in its stock of problem loans."</p><p> The second question we must ask is what are the alternatives .  If we accept that the answer to the first question rules out continuing as we are as a viable option, we are saying that the main alternatives to loan sales are debt forgiveness, individual deal arrangements, a provide-and-derecognise approach and scale repossessions.  I will look at each of these four options in turn.  It is important to distinguish between debt forgiveness and debt write-off as the two terms are often incorrectly used interchangeably.  Permanent TSB agreed to write off debt owed by over 2,000 buy-to-let customers on the condition that they surrendered their investment properties for sale.  The key is that the customer agreed to forfeit the property that had secured the mortgage.  The proponents of debt forgiveness want a bank to forget a part of a customer's debt, or perhaps all of it, without the customer having to surrender the underlying security in return.  As the Governor of the Central Bank told this committee last week, if Ireland is to have a functioning secured lending market, security must mean something when borrowers default.  The intolerable situation created by debt forgiveness means that a bank must, in effect, choose who among similar customers it should favour and should penalise.</p><p> I will give an example to emphasise the point I am making.  Customer A and customer B are two neighbours who have similar mortgages with the same bank.  Customer A continues to meet his repayments despite great challenges and hardship.  Despite customer B's best efforts, he cannot meet his repayments and, as a consequence, has built up arrears.  Those who advocate the debt forgiveness approach suggest we should reduce the mortgage owed by customer B to a more affordable amount while maintaining the mortgage of customer A as it is.  In effect, this is a relative punishment for customer A for keeping his repayments up to date.  While it is accepted that customer B deserves help and protection in finding a sustainable solution, no bank should want to have the power or responsibility to decide who to reward and who to punish in these circumstances.  The same problem - that all customers will not be treated equally - arises in respect of individual deal arrangements.  It is a real moral hazard.  We have not pursued a provide and derecognise approach because questions remain about whether we could derecognise the non-performing loans set against the increased provisions, and indeed the cost to the taxpayer.  As the system has spent ten years avoiding the scale repossessions approach, I do not believe it warrants further consideration.  This leaves loan sale as the least worst alternative.</p><p> The third question we must ask is what a loan sale transaction means for a customer.  I will seek to clarify the situation of customers whose loans are included in such transactions.  Such customers have been poorly served by inflammatory and inaccurate commentary around loan sale transactions.  They deserve to be treated with respect and care by Permanent TSB and by commentators, consumer advocates and other influencers whose opinions command attention.  The Governor of the Central Bank has stated, clearly and explicitly - including to this committee - that the protections which a mortgage customer enjoys with one institution remain when his or her loan is sold to a different institution.  The only thing that changes is the owner of the loan.  Unfortunately, this reassuring message is ignored by many commentators, ultimately to the detriment of customers.  The views of the Governor of the Central Bank are supported by evidence.  Project Glas is one of numerous loan sales which have taken place in this country in recent years.  Where is the so-called tsunami of repossessions which have been forecast with such certainty by certain commentators?  Where are the thousands of customers who have found that their terms were altered after their loans were sold?  Where are the examples of the courts allowing new owners to renege on pre-existing contractual commitments?</p><p> The final aspect of this matter I would like to focus on is the transaction itself.  Project Glas was launched to the market in February.  Binding legal contracts were signed on 31 July.  The transaction will close before the end of the year.  For the sake of informed debate, it is worth clarifying exactly what loans were included and excluded from Project Glas, and why they were so included or excluded.  Permanent TSB originally identified approximately &euro;4.8 billion of non-performing loans for potential inclusion in the sale.  A rigorous set of principles was developed to ensure a fair and consistent process was followed.  This included the application of a specific set of exclusion criteria.  As a result, approximately &euro;2.6 billion of loans, or 48% of the total, were excluded from the sale.  The categories of loans - as they stood at the cut-off date for the transaction on 31 March last - which were excluded in this way were: private dwelling home split mortgages which were performing to their restructured terms and were not connected to other non-performing loans; private dwelling home loans that were identified as meeting the terms of their agreed repayment arrangements, were on a path to performing status within 12 months and were not connected to other non-performing loan accounts; loans that had cured from non-performing loan status prior to the cut-off date; and operational exclusions, for example in cases of personal insolvency arrangements, bankruptcy, voluntary surrender, tracker mortgage examination loans and mortgage-to-rent loans.</p><p> I reiterate that &euro;2.6 billion of loans, or 48% of the total, were excluded from the original perimeter of this transaction.  I emphasise that these exclusions include private dwelling home loans that were identified at the time of the cut-off as being on a path to performing status.  Accordingly, the final Project Glas perimeter had a notional balance of approximately &euro;2.1 billion.  The categories of loans - again by reference to their status on 31 March last - which were included this transaction were all buy-to-let or buy-to-let-linked non-performing loans; private dwelling home loans in respect of which customers had failed to operate in line with agreed treatments or had refused forbearance offers; private dwelling home loans that were deemed not to be co-operating; private dwelling home loans that were deemed to be unsustainable following an assessment of customers' circumstances and in respect of which no formal restructure offer could be made; and private dwelling home loans in long-term arrears.</p><p> I want to make two important points about these inclusions.  First, while the status of the loan at the cut-off date is key, we continue to work with individual customers after that cut-off date because it is the right thing to do.  However, any treatments or restructures which are agreed now will transfer with the accounts when the transaction completes.  Second, a great deal of attention has been paid to the inclusion of what people have called performing split mortgages.  If any such loans have been included in Project Glas, it is because of their links to other loans which are non-performing, rather than because of their status as split mortgages meeting the terms of an agreed restructure.</p><p>The committee should remember that we removed thousands of stand-alone private dwelling home split mortgages from the transactions with an approximate value of &euro;900 million where they were meeting the terms of an agreed restructure.  By the same measure, therefore, if a customer had a fully performing loan and a non-performing loan, both of them would have transferred in this transaction.  In deciding and applying the criteria mentioned the bank has to balance the SSM definition of what constitutes a non-performing loan against the individual customer's circumstances, while maintaining the governing objective of a meaningful reduction in the NPL ratio.  The bank is satisfied it met the required tests.</p><p> To be clear, Permanent TSB does not decide unilaterally whether a loan is performing or non-performing.  It operates in a rules-based regulatory environment.  We apply the rules which are strict.  We assess whether an account is performing or non-performing at the end of each month.  By the start of January 2021, we will be required to make the assessment each day.  As to what constitutes a non-performing loan, I appreciate that this is a complex area and that it can be confusing for customers and others.  It is further complicated by the fact that some people describe loans as performing if they are meeting the terms of a restructure agreement, which, of course, means that they are not performing by reference to the original loan contract.  That is the critical reference point for the regulator.  Ultimately, therefore, the bank's NPL strategy is about identifying individual loans which are in default in respect of the original terms of the mortgage contract; linked with other loans which are non-performing via either cross-default or cross-collateralisation; or deemed to be &ldquo;unlikely to pay&rdquo;, that is, loans in respect of which there is no clear evidence that the borrowers are capable of honouring the terms by the end of the contract.</p><p> We are bound by the SSM definition of what constitutes a non-performing loan and by the comprehensive guidelines set down as to the factors we other banks must take into account in assessing whether an account is non-performing or performing.  To date, when we have reviewed the various cases highlighted in the media on this issue, we have seen no evidence that any of the relevant loans has been incorrectly classified as non-performing on the relevant cut-off date by reference to the rules and guidelines of the regulator, the SSM.  We will continue to monitor the position up to the completion of the transaction.</p><p> I should advise the committee that while we will, as always, endeavour to be as helpful as possible in responding to questions, this is a commercial agreement and that we are bound by a confidentiality clause in discussing the transaction, which will probably restrict our ability to deal with all questions.  Similarly, we are not in a position to answer questions related to specific customers.  This is the third time we have met the committee this year to discuss this transaction and we have always sought to be as helpful as possible, while being mindful that this was a dynamic, evolving transaction with lots of moving parts.  I assure the committee, however, that we will try to be helpful in the same manner.  </p><p> That brings me to the end of my opening remarks.  We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>

Mr. Masding has talked about inflammatory comments by individuals and the care and respect that need to be shown to customers.  I will put one case to him.  It is the case of a loyal customer who banked with his bank for 20 years, who right throughout the recession continued to meet her mortgage repayments and who, in certain instances, went without fuel, food and all the rest to satisfy the repayments due to the bank.  This year, however, she fell on harder times and had to enter into a restructuring arrangement with the bank, the terms of which she met for a period of six months.  She was in the process of sending her standard financial statement to the bank when she informed it that she believed she had identified cancer cells in her body.  Three days later it told her that the mortgage was being sold to a vulture fund, despite the fact that there were arrears if only &euro;1,800 on the mortgage.  Its letter to her - by this stage she was battling cancer and now had a second battle on her hands, to keep a roof over her head - stated she had to pay the full amount outstanding on the mortgage within two months if she wanted to prevent it being sold to Start Mortgages.  In the context of that statement from one of his loyal customers, how can Mr. Masding sit there with a straight face and say his bank is showing respect and care to customers when clearly it is turning its back on them and selling their loans off to vulture funds?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.1732" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Masding" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101100002#E00300"><p>There are a number of responses I would make.  First, post the crisis, in a secure lending market, one would expect many thousands of pieces of collateral to be realised by the bank because it is secured lending, not just for Permanent TSB but all banks.  For very good reasons, Ireland decided to avoid scale repossessions.  At the time Permanent TSB engaged in a programme of long-term forbearance which kept many people in their homes, using the various tools and techniques we had designed.  Second, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, ours is a regulated entity.  I am bound, therefore, by the rules and regulations which enable the bank to keep its banking licence and continue to compete.  I do not set the rules for what is a non-performing loan.  Third, we again need to emphasise that we spent many hours trying to have the right mix of assets for project loss.  That is why we have such a high level of exclusions.  I cannot comment on the individual case, but I will conclude by saying my job is, was and always will be to try to do the right thing for all taxpayers.  It is about trying to get all of the various dimensions in balance.  Project Glas is part of that process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.1733" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101100002#E00400"><p>Does Mr. Masding think the response of his bank and his response as its CEO are respectful and caring of that individual who, for 19 years, through very hard times, continued to meet every single repayment?  In the last year she fell on hard times, entered into a restructuring arrangement with the bank, the terms of which she met for six months.  The bank then told her that it was selling off her mortgage and that she had to pay the outstanding amount in full within two months if she wanted to prevent that from happening, despite only being &euro;1,800 in arrears.  How can Mr. Masding say this in all sincerity?  He can dress it up as a non-performing loan and all the rest, but AIB is not doing what Permanent TSB is doing; it is not selling family homes.  Bank of Ireland is also not doing what it is doing and they have the exact same regulator, deal with the exact same ECB and have the exact same definition of non-performing loans.  However, what Permanent TSB has done and is doing to thousands of families is causing concern.</p> <p>  Mr. Masding can blame others for making inflammatory statements, but let me tell him this.  The most inflammatory statement the individuals in question received was in the letter received from the bank informing them that it had turned its back on them and was selling off their mortgages.  Will Mr. Masding withdraw his comment that the bank is dealing with them in a caring and respectful manner because it is not?  It is only looking after itself, as an institution.  If he was customer focused, he would have read the letter from the woman mentioned.  He would understand the trauma she is going through in her personal life.  He would have looked to see that there were arrears of &euro;1,800 and acknowledged that for 19 years, ten in a period of deep austerity, the family met everything the bank had put in front of them.  He would not now be turning his back on her and her family and selling the mortgage.  That is just one case.</p><p>We can pull out case files over and over again to show that what Permanent TSB is doing is wrong.  No other bank is doing what it is doing.  It is was forced by this committee and others to deal with the issue of split mortgages, and the representatives come in as if the bank has done a great job and stripped out this and that.  Its original intention, however, was to put split mortgages in.  How many of the 7,400 owner-occupiers, that is, people in family homes, are meeting their restructuring arrangements or the original terms of their agreement with the bank?</p></speech>

In my opening remarks I described Project Glas as the "least worst" alternative.  The least compassion the bank could show would be to repossess the properties.  As an industry, we collectively have done everything we can to avoid that.</p> <p>  The buyers of the loans have been clear that they will continue to honour the long-term treatments as provided by Permanent TSB.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.1736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane O'Sullivan" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101100002#F00300"><p>This bank has offered a significant number of long-term treatments - 30,000 - over the past five or six years.  We have a deep level of experience, therefore, of what customers went through in that period.  I have met a large number of those customers and I understand the difficulty of their circumstances.</p> <p>  As Mr. Masding said in his opening remarks, when the bank looked at its NPL ratio of 25%, which is much higher than the other banks to which the Deputy referred, we worked to take out a large number of cases.  Mr. Masding referred to a figure of 48%, or &euro;2.6 billion, within which were vulnerable customers who were known to us and whose loans were removed from the sales process.  Once the sale happened at the end of July, we no longer had a general discretion to remove cases because they are for the new owner to decide upon.  As the committee has heard, the terms and conditions do not change and nor do the regulatory environment and the legal system.  The new owner has the same responsibility to vulnerable customers as we do.  I imagine that is how matters developed in that case.</p> <p>  On the question about performing loans, our NPL ratio is 25% but this transaction will bring that down to 16%.</p></speech>

Let us be clear: there are no performing loans in Project Glas.  The loans are either restructured and, therefore, non-performing, by definition, or they are part of a connection, which means it is the connection that is not performing.</p></speech>

The bank has not provided the figure yet but it is selling off hundreds, if not thousands, of loans that are meeting the agreements and arrangements made with Permanent TSB.

We disclosed to the market that Project Glas includes approximately 10,700 properties, comprising 3,300 buy-to-lets and 7,400 private dwelling homes, PDHs.  The disclosure stated that 7,400 PDHs consisted primarily of 2,500 non-co-operating and 3,850 cases where the treatments had been refused.  The remainder of the PDHs, that is, the 1,050 to which the Deputy refers, can be broken down into three categories.  First are those which were originally buy-to-let but where the connection has changed to primarily PDH and is non-performing.  The second category concerns PDHs that are classified as not sustainable, which means the treatment is just not possible.  Third, there are PDHs that are in long-term arrears and are identified as unlikely to pay.  I have provided that clarification in response to media queries and, therefore, I am happy to do it in front of this committee.  </p> <p>  The bottom line for me is twofold.  I am trying as much as I can to get the best decision for all Irish taxpayers.  The pyramids include those which are defined as non-performing loans, as per the regulatory guidelines.</p></speech>

In his presentation, Mr. Masding seemed to be asking what the bank could do after having tried everything, but it has not.  There are five options, which the bank simply will not entertain for customers, that could form part of its basket of solutions, but it has decided not to use them.</p></speech>

The role of any bank CEO is to ensure that the bank applies the best alternative for all taxpayers.  We would have gone through all of those and will apply those that meet that test.</p></speech>

I should add that they are not all mutually exclusive in that there are variations on a theme in some.  We have probably offered more long-term solutions to borrowers than any other bank.  We have 30,000 long-term treatments in place.  We are also the bank that has offered more than 40% of all split mortgages.</p></speech>

I am looking for details.  Mr. Masding talks in bravado terms and asks to be shown the court cases that will change these legal documents and so on, but that is not the issue.  We all know what the issue is.  A large number of the customers on whom Permanent TSB is now turning its back have arrangements with it and these arrangements will come up for review after a time, but the vultures do not offer the options the bank does.  That is the problem.  A customer may have an arrangement now that the vulture will legally be obliged to honour, but when it comes up for review, the customer will be on his or her own.  That is how the bank is turning its back on these customers.  Of the 7,400 owner-occupier homes that are being sold, how many have arrangements?  Of those arrangements, how many will be up for review each year?</p></speech>

First, I do not accept in any way, shape or form the Deputy's description of my opening remarks as bravado.  I purposely kept my voice as level as I possibly could.  I do not make a point about bravado.  I merely put some facts out there to create some debate.  I do not accept the Deputy's comment.</p> <p>  Second, I cannot comment on the investment funds or, as the Deputy calls them, vulture funds.  It is unreasonable to ask me to.  I assume in the committee's protocols that it has engagements with those who buy loans.  I will leave it at that.</p> <p>  Third, and unless my team corrects me, we do not have an agreement with the purchaser to give that level of detail.</p></speech>

I would ask the Chairman to try to pursue this matter.  They are Permanent TSB's loans at this time.  The State owns them.  The State owns the witnesses' bank.  We are the Oireachtas finance committee.  How many of the family homes are in restructuring and at what periods are those restructures up for review are appropriate questions that should be answered by a State-owned bank.  That is the dynamite.  It is when we know the vultures will prey.</p></speech>

At that time, both parties entered into the contract as per market conventions.  There is a non-disclosure agreement in that contract.  I am afraid I cannot answer the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It should be said publicly that Start Mortgages was invited to attend but declined the invitation.  LoanStar has refused a number of times to appear before the committee.  Contrary to the suggestion that some of the concerns held by people whose loans are being sold are unfounded, the fact that we cannot get engagement from those buying the loans will raise their concerns even further.  It is legitimate for us as a committee to seek to engage with those who are buying the loans and ask them questions about long-term restructurings, what they do after purchasing these mortgages, the nature of the arrangements they enter into and so on.  We cannot get any of that information.  That is not a matter for Permanent TSB, but it needs to be said publicly.  It is deeply regrettable and disappointing that we cannot get that level of engagement.  If they have nothing to hide, they have nothing to fear from attending and taking questions about how they will handle loans that are intrinsic to people's day-to-day lives.</p> <p>  When will this transaction be executed?  The bank signed contracts on the last day of July and wrote to customers on 2 August telling them that the transfer date would not be in less than two months.  The two months have now expired.  When will the transaction go through?</p></speech>

I am referring to loans that have cured since the contract was signed at the end of July and are no longer non-performing.  From the end of July to the end of November is four months.  As I understand it, loans that have been in arrangements for 12 months where those arrangements have been honoured can migrate from being non-performing to performing, subject to certain conditions.  It is almost certainly the case that some loans that were classified as non-performing in July will be deemed to be performing come November.  Is there any flexibility to remove cured loans or loans that are well on the way to being reclassified as performing?</p></speech>

That is the best way to answer the Deputy's question.  Let me provide some context.  As I told Deputy Doherty, we concluded a significant exercise to try to reach the best perimeter possible.  That resulted in us excluding 48% of the original perimeter.  We have now entered into a commercial agreement with the purchaser that precludes us from disclosing its details.  What I can confirm is that all loans at the time of signing were non-performing loans, NPLs.  Post signing and subject to final reconciliation, there will be no further exclusions.  This also means that there will be no further inclusions.  By definition, banking is an evolving beast and there will be customers who go into NPL status between 31 July and the day of the final cash consideration.</p><p>There will be no further inclusions either.  That is essentially conventional market practice.  Regarding the deleveraging we have done and any future capital market relationship, it is important that Permanent TSB meets the standards the capital markets expect.</p></speech>

I am sorry, I was answering the Deputy's question at a macro level.  The deal was done on 31 July.  There is a commercial arrangement.

We are looking at all that information and all our communication staff are communicating with customers as well.  As mentioned by Mr. Masding, the cut-off date was 31 March.  That is the perimeter within which we work.  If a customer classification error is found that is not an NPL classification, we will deal with that accordingly.  Indeed that is part of the communication process with the customer.  That is more of a technical reconciliation which takes place up until 31 July.  Other than that, it is a normal part of the final closure of any transaction.</p></speech>

To speculate would be unfair to this team.  I can assure the Deputy of three things.  First, there is a line of communication into Permanent TSB.  Indeed all of the committee members use it, and the team looks at every case individually.  Second, if there is a genuine error, whatever that means, we of course have the right to take it out.  Third, to absolutely emphasise what Mr. Crowley said, the loans in Project Glas after 31 March are NPLs.  They are NPLs either by dint of the fact they are 90 days past due or because they are unlikely to pay.  The phrase "unlikely to pay" includes those which might be defined as performing but which are connected to a non-performing loan.  It is the connection that is defined as the NPL.  Those are the rules of the game we play.</p></speech>

There has been a definite increase in engagement with the bank since the announcement of Project Glas.  What has been noticeable is the number of conversations that have happened and the amount of cash that has been put to the mortgages.  That is a good thing and I would encourage customers to continue to talk to us.</p> <p>  In terms of further plans, we have said that we are looking at all options, including capital market solutions.  I am not at liberty today to give any further detail, but we are looking at all options.  As soon as we are in a position to make a market announcement, we will do so.  I say market announcement because market disclosures, when inappropriate, have very adverse consequences for the bank and its directors.  I do not have anything further to say, save that we continue to look for further solutions.  As the members have collectively said, we are at 16%, which is an NPL ratio that is just not sustainable for a financial services business.</p></speech>

To clarify, those family home mortgages are correctly classified as non-performing even if a mortgage payment was never missed because the owner of that home also has a buy-to-let mortgage which is classified as non-performing.</p></speech>

We made every effort to get to the best combination of NPLs that would get us the best result for the taxpayer within that construct.  I have talked about the exclusions.  The exclusions are stand-alone private dwelling house, PDH, split mortgages.  In the same way, however, a performing loan, which is either up to date or performing as the Deputy might describe it as per the terms of restructure, can still be included in Project Glas if it was part of a wider package containing an NPL or cross-collateralised with an NPL.  The same is true of a split mortgage.</p></speech>

Is a buy-to-let loan, which has been on interest only by agreement from the very beginning and no payment ever missed, classified as non-performing?</p></speech>

If it has a classification that it is unlikely to repay in the future, that is where there is a low value versus the outstanding loan, it can be classified as non-performing because of the unlikeliness to repay or indeed where by way of interaction with the customer it is deemed that they will unlikely be able to meet their responsibilities.  Therefore, it is possible, yes.</p></speech>

That is the cream on the top of this transaction for the buyer, Start Mortgages.  The perfectly good loans will be fully redeemed, fully repaid, and a discount of 38% is being applied in the aggregate.</p></speech>

I am afraid I can only go back to my opening remarks.  NPL definition is complex.  We are bound by the rules of the regulator who holds our banking licence.  At its simplest, a loan is an NPL if it is greater than 90 days past due or is unlikely to pay.  The team will have gone through the accounts and any account with an "unlikely to pay" code on it would be in Project Glas.  If it is in Project Glas and there is a connected account, the whole connection is brought into Project Glas.  I am afraid they are the rules of the game that we play.</p></speech>

They feel very aggrieved and feel it is very unfair and unnecessary.  I would not understate the level of stress, anxiety and mental health issues this transaction is causing for a great many of Permanent TSB customers.  Many of them have asked me if this was necessary given that their loans were well on the way to being reclassified as performing.  I am not talking about mortgages where nothing has been repaid for several years.  I have no sympathy with such cases.  I certainly imagine this bundle contains some of them.  There are, however, also many good and loyal customers doing their very best, who have made sacrifices, have engaged, have made agreements with the bank, have kept their word and are well on the way to being reclassified.  Could Permanent TSB not have given those loans more time to be cured, in the technical sense, and reclassified as performing?</p></speech>

Obviously this point has come up frequently in our attendances at the committee.  The Deputy can believe it or not but I do not sit in a gilded cage with a glass ceiling.  I have been in front of customers all my working career and I speak to customers.  From the letters I receive and from the people I talk to I am acutely conscious that some customers feel really aggrieved that despite having a loan that is meeting its restructure terms, it is included in a sale.  Of course, I can understand why they might feel this way, but there are two things.  First, Start Mortgages is obliged to honour that agreement at the day of transfer.</p></speech>

Therefore, links to principal dwelling homes, which are performing in line with an agreed restructuring and not connected, are not in Project Glas.  I understand why the Deputy asked me the question.  Words are meaningless but let us say them anyway.  I can try to empathise when I can.  At the end of the day we have a non-performing loan ratio that makes the bank quite risky for Ireland, as the Governor mentioned last week.  It is important for Ireland that that risk gets diluted and potentially transferred.  I have a duty to all taxpayers and I am trying to balance all the different parts.  I am comfortable that the team is doing that.</p></speech>

We met representatives of the ECB recently and a large part of our discussion was on non-performing loans.  We wanted to understand the extent of the pressure from the ECB on Permanent TSB in terms of the sell-off.  We spoke about the impact Project Glas was having.  They made it abundantly clear that they were not in any way instructing the sell-off.  Everyone understands the need to reduce the non-performing loans.  It is astounding that Mr. Masding has this list of options and yet he has five options within that. My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, pointed out all the options from A to K.  Why are they there in the code of conduct if they are not being used?  Is the ECB aware that Permanent TSB is using a very limited number of options?</p></speech>

The second question is around the ECB not being prescriptive in terms of what we can and cannot do.  That is true.

As a guest in Ireland I believe that I can say that and perhaps be a bit more objective than most.  Our NPL ratio is-----</p></speech>

If there is another economic shock those assets are likely to be the assets that will cause us real difficulty around our capital base.  Banks need to have low NPL ratios.  It is a regulatory requirement for us to have ambitious and credible plans to reduce NPLs.  Permanent TSB is an outlier and therefore we have to look at all alternatives.  In my opening remarks I explained to the committee the different alternatives we have considered.  We are very clear that a loan sale is the least worst alternative.  There is one data point that I asked the team to get for me, which I thought was quite interesting.  I asked the team to get the historical Irish average of bank NPL ratios in the 1990s and the 2000s in order to get a comparator at a time when we are talking about NPLs.  It was less than 1%.  Ours is currently at 16%.  We all need to take a step back and agree what it is we are trying to do here.  From my perspective, I am trying to do the right things for the taxpayer.  I have a quote from last week-----</p></speech>

We have to look at the causes and ask why the level of non-performing loans is as high as it is.  The banks played a very active part in that.  This is what really gets to me.  Now the bank comes along, it has a suite of options and it decides "Well no, we will not use five of those."  That is what I have a problem with.</p></speech>

I apologise if I am not making myself clear.  The suite of options is for long-term treatments.  If we go back in time to 2012 the troika, the Irish Government and Irish public policy decided that the banks must avoid scale repossessions.  That was the policy decision then.  As a consequence of that the Central Bank of Ireland asked all banks to put in place long-term treatments, which Mr. O'Sullivan has been at the vanguard of.  In the world we live in, those long-term treatments are still non-performing loans.  Just because they are treated does not mean they are not non-performing loans.  They are still non-performing loans.  With a non-performing loan ratio of 16% for a State-owned Irish bank the Governor of the central Bank has said "In terms of risk management, the transfer of credit risk and funding risk to the investment funds that buy loan portfolios constitutes a national reduction in macro-financial risk ...".  That is a really critical point.  We have run out of options for reducing our NPL ratio.  We have looked at all the different alternatives.  As I have said, the loan sale is the least worst alternative on the basis that the protection is-----</p></speech>

Did Mr. Masding speak to Start Mortgages about its non-attendance at this committee meeting today?  Did Mr. Masding have any discussion about this before today and at what point did he know that Start Mortgages was not going to be here with him?

We were given assurances that everything will continue the same and it is the same from the Minister for Finance - "There are no concerns here" - yet, Start Mortgages will not appear before an Oireachtas committee.  What do they have to hide?  This is what rings alarm bells with people and with those who have these loans, especially around how they will be treated in the future.

He is giving us assurances that homeowners are going to be protected.  Really, when one scratches the surface, they are not going to be protected at all.  They certainly will not be protected from the flipping over of the mortgages to somebody else, and Start Mortgages will not even come before the committee.  Mr. Masding can see where our concerns are coming from.</p> <p>  I am really concerned about performing loans where the homeowner is paying his or her mortgage diligently.

Then we stated that of the 7,400, 2,500 are non-co-operating and 3,850 are cases in which treatments had been refused or were no longer being adhered to.  They are all NPLs.

Of the 7,400 PDHs, 2,500 are non-co-operating, treatments have been refused in respect of 3,850, and this essentially leaves a "shortfall" of 1,050, which Deputy Pearse Doherty asked me about.  The 1,050 were originally buy-to-lets where the connection has changed to PDHs but they are NPLs.  They are classified as non-sustainable, and the average arrears in respect of them is greater than &euro;90,000, or it is a PDH which is in long-term arrears.  That is the breakdown.</p></speech>

I will make two points.  First, we are a regulated entity and, therefore, we have to go by the rules of the Central Bank.  There is a second point, however.  Let us hypothesise for a second and say there is no regulation of the banks.  The board of Permanent TSB, including its chief executive, would still be trying to reduce the ratio of NPLs because, as I said in my opening remarks, a high NPL ratio is wholly unsatisfactory for Permanent TSB in the long term.  Yes, there are some rules, but I do not want to get into a place where I hide behind the Central Bank.  Irrespective of the Central Bank, I would still be driving the organisation to manage down the NPL ratio.</p></speech>

Mr. Masding has said that.  In some of these cases, where the loans are not performing or there are second homes in respect of which the loans are not performing, where they are paying in full for their primary home but they are not paying for the second one, is it a matter of their not handing back that property to the bank or is it the case that the bank has decided to lump the two together?</p></speech>

This happened and has been completed.  That is different from what Mr. Masding has just explained.  Then there is what is left, and the bank is obliged to follow the rules that it is obliged to follow.  Mr. Masding has explained them.  Those loans, in the connection he described, make up the 25% NPL ratio, now down to 16%, that we have talked about.  The bank is working through the end of that transaction, the 25% down to 16%.

I have questions on some elements of his statement.  Perhaps he will elaborate on some of the things he said in his statement.</p><p>On page 2 of the statement, Mr. Masding offered the example of Customer A who pays the mortgage in full and Customer B who clearly has difficulties.  The latter is unable to pay the mortgage in full, on time and in accordance to the conditions.  He stated:</p><blockquote>The same problem - that all customers will not be treated equally - arises in respect of individual deal arrangements.  It is a real moral hazard.</blockquote> <p>In the context of a lot of the previous discussion, it might be helpful to us if we could understand, or certainly if I could understand, the bank's definition of a &quot;real moral hazard&quot;.  Is it an ethical, financial or social concept?  Even though today's statement is one of the clearest statements that I have ever heard being made by a banker, which included examples of a moral hazard, I must confess that I still do not fully understand it.  I ask Mr. Masding to start by defining what he and his bank mean by the term &quot;real moral hazard&quot;.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.1998" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Masding" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101100002#N00800"><p>I will do my best.  Good afternoon, Deputy.</p> <p>  First, I wish to reiterate the difference between debt write-off and debt forgiveness.  Debt write-off is what I would define as traditional banking.  One lends money.  If a customer finds himself or herself in payment difficulties one does all one can to try to help that customer.  Sometimes that means one is unable to find a treatment or it is in a customer's best interest that he or she returns the collateral.  If, when one has got that collateral the value of that collateral is less than the loan that is outstanding, one has a shortfall.  Then a bank has a choice as to whether it chases that shortfall or writes it off.  In the case that Senator Paddy Burke talked about, the large buy-to-let and a voluntary surrender campaign, we determined beforehand that what we would do would be to write off the shortfall.  That is what is meant by debt write-off.</p> <p>  Debt forgiveness is where one creates a situation where, essentially, the bank must choose between two customers about how it uses its capital.  That is not for the bank to do.  On the one hand, one has a customer, as I described here as Customer A, who continues to make his or her repayments.  On the other hand, one has Customer B who has been unable to and, essentially, we reduce the mortgage to him or her on a unilateral basis.  That has a moral hazard, I think, for two reasons.  First, if the customers live next door to each other, one creates the moral hazard around the relationship between those two people because one of them is saying, "Okay, well I work really hard to pay the mortgage and yet you are in a situation where the bank has written you a cheque."  That creates a moral hazard because it creates a knock-on effect. </p> <p>  Second, it creates a moral hazard for the banking industry because if the bank does that for one particular customer one then has to ask oneself the question of why would one not use capital to do that for all customers.  Therefore, that takes one to the final place which is as follows.  The responsibility of the management team is to use the capital that was given to us - the &euro;4 billion by the Irish State - in a most judicious fashion.  I could not countenance debt forgiveness, moral hazard and the use of that capital as something that Permanent TSB would do.  That is my best effort to answer the question.</p></speech>

In other words, it has an impact on the Irish State.  Does he agree with me that it affects Irish society?</p></speech>

I come back to linking moral hazard to avoiding repossessions.  At the time the Irish State had a choice.  The choice was, from a social perspective, that all the banks avoided scare repossessions.  From a social perspective, in terms of contributing to Irish society, I would argue - the Deputy may disagree with me - that the long-term treatments that have kept people in their homes have been a huge contribution to Irish society.  I am not sure that the Deputy will agree with me on this but the unilateral use of capital to individual customers is not in the best interest of all Irish taxpayers.  That is not something, certainly on my watch, I could countenance.</p></speech>

I do not know whether some of the people on the bank's board and so on were.  I did not have the benefit of that particular form of education but moral hazard is something that the Jesuits, as an order, have spoken about over a long period.</p> <p>   I will set out what I am trying to understand.  If this is a moral hazard in Mr. Masding's construct, he has acknowledged there is a social dimension to what we are talking about in terms of impacts on society and obviously there are impacts, as he described, on the households of Customers A and B.  Again, taking the broad moral hazard construct, does Mr. Masding think that the issues around the housing crisis and, for example, the consequences for people who are forced to vacate a home, constitute another type of moral hazard for Irish society?  Certainly, in my constituency of Dublin West at present, where the bank has quite a lot of customers and an active banking presence, no replacement properties are available for many of the families who, in the ultimate workout, may be people affected by the bank's moral hazard construct.  In a Jesuitical sense, is there also a social construct, which says that a level of debt forgiveness may be reasonable in the context of how the situation arose?  Is this also the case because of the consequence for people for whom the working out of this particular doctrine may be extremely difficult, particularly if small children are involved in the family, and who have experienced a great deal of stress?  I do not advocate anybody not paying their mortgage.  A lot of people seated around this table have struggled to pay their mortgages and we have paid them in full.  I am sure that the people on Mr. Masding's side of the table have the same framework and approach.  I think that is a shared view it is likely we all have.</p><p>With regard to the level of the crash, I stood in queues at one stage because I had bank accounts with Permanent TSB in Blanchardstown, as indeed I still have.  Ten years ago, people were queueing up to arrange and finalise deposits on properties that their children were purchasing.  These parents were doing their best.  People were not advised by Permanent TSB or other banks about what they were taking on.  That is their own problem, in a certain sense.  I would say the banking system created quite a bit of the moral hazard, in the sense that it popped loan offers in the door, out the door or anywhere to tell people they could get loans regardless of how limited their incomes might have been.  That is what happened in the past.</p><p> I understand all the economic arguments in favour of the decision to offload all of this.  In light of Mr. Masding's really strong statement about "a real moral hazard", and his implication that this is really bad for the bank, for people and for society, I am interested to know whether this means that his bank, in a moral hazard context, is under an obligation to seek to assist people.  I put it to Mr. Masding that this has not happened, as my colleague has said and as I know myself.  I know that many Permanent TSB staff members are distressed about this as well.  People who made arrangements and agreements with the bank are in jobs and, in many cases, have faithfully worked their backs off and faced intense mental stress at various times.  It is possible that this has partly contributed to family illnesses.  They could be working in public service jobs, which means that continuing payments are pretty much assured as long as their health holds up.  It may be the case that things have to be worked out over a longer period of time.  I do not understand why the bank cannot show some compassion to those people.  I understand that they are not perfect borrowers, but the crash was not a perfect crash.  It crashed on top of people who may have lacked foresight or an economic education.  As I have suggested, the bank threw money at them.  I realise that Mr. Masding came into the bank some time afterwards.</p><p> I do not understand a moral hazard which does not have a wider social construct around it.  I know this is an ethical question.  I am aware of Permanent TSB's corporate and social responsibility statements.  I think it seeks to have an ethical framework.  What would be wrong with the bank continuing the workouts?  As Mr. Masding said earlier, it is giving a discount of 38% or so to the mortgage company that it is selling on to, and ultimately to Lone Star.  That is a really big discount.  We can ask members of the committee to speak about the cases with which they are familiar, but in many of the cases with which I am familiar, even half of that 38% discount would obliterate the problem.  In cases in which people have been really trying and are in work, why is this not possible given that the bank can see that an income is going to be coming in?  Someone aged 45 has at least another 15 working years, and maybe a bit longer.  A crystal ball is not needed to see that such a family is committed and is trying.  Why is this not possible?  Is the moral hazard argument preventing Permanent TSB from holding on to such a family?  Has Permanent TSB ever written to the European Central Bank to say it cannot deal with people who never pay and make no effort and it wants to hand them on?  Like others, I am talking about people who have really tried.  Now they seem to have been found guilty of this real moral hazard in the bank's court of opinion.  I ask Mr. Masding to enlighten us about how we should deal with such cases.  How should we address them?</p></speech>

It would be fair to say that my experience of secured lending, or mortgages, is as I have described it to some of the Deputy's colleagues.  Money is loaned at a point in time on the basis of affordability.  As it is secured lending, it has a certain price.  The bank engages in a relationship with the customer.  If a customer unfortunately finds him or herself in a situation in which it is difficult to make repayments, the bank does all it can to try to help him or her.  If the arrears reach such a level that the loan is unlikely to be repaid, the collateral is repossessed and put back on the market to be sold.  That is a banking model that I would be very used to.</p></speech>

Mortgages in Europe are not generally designed like that, so it is a different question.  There is a huge crisis in Ireland, as the Deputy is aware.  We had a conversation in 2012.  If the banking model I have described had been applied at that time, there would have been thousands of repossessions.  The first point I would make is that Permanent TSB and all the other banks set out to avoid large-scale repossessions.  I think the data would support that.</p> <p>  The second point I would make is that a large non-performing loan ratio has enormous impacts for banks and future customers, as I have described.  If the capital markets perceive that a bank is riskier, the cost of capital to that bank becomes higher.  Therefore, the next best alternative is to undertake to the best of our ability a loan sale where the protections travel with the loans and, at the time when we sell the loans, the buyer is there and there are treatments which will be maintained.</p> <p>  The third point I would make is that for me, debt forgiveness essentially involves having to choose between different customers.  I am not in a position to do that.  We might disagree about what my job entails, but as I see it my job is to get the best return on capital that I can for all Irish taxpayers.  I believe that is being accomplished through the long-term treatments and the loan sale.  I think the Deputy's question has some broader connotations with regard to housing supply and the role of Irish society.  I cannot comment on that.  I think we have done all we can within the boundaries we were given.  Mr. O'Sullivan put in place many long-term treatments.  Mr. Crowley designed a loan sale that was the best construct we could come up with in the context of what we had.  I would summarise moral hazard as having to choose between customers when making decisions on how to use capital.  Debt forgiveness forces banks to make such choices.  It is not for a bank to make such a choice because all of the capital is the taxpayers' capital.</p></speech>

In other words, the bank is already envisaging the next crisis.  At the moment, some of the pressure of the last crisis is being released by the capital values of the overpriced properties in respect of which Permanent TSB offered mortgages some years ago.</p><p>With hindsight I suspect Mr. Masding would agree that many of the properties were heavily overpriced.  The individual customer is not a market maker.  The customer does not have that power in the market.  If we are now closer to the next crisis, and if moral hazard is Mr. Masding's ethical framework, it is reasonable for people in the housing market - Mr. Masding has impressive statistics there about new lending of &euro;0.5 billion plus - where interest rates are slowly but surely rising to ask what if anything he is doing to protect those people in the statistics on the total new lending?  Does the bank expect interest rates to rise?</p><p> Mr. Masding said there is a next crisis.  Can he fill us in on his view on that and , in particular, on people taking out loans?  Does he expect interest rates to rise?  That could make them just as affordable.</p></speech>

I repeat what the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland said, in terms of national risk management, that the transfer of credit risk and funding risk to investment funds constitute a national reduction in macro-financial risk.  In the broadest sense, we are contributing to the diversification of that risk.</p> <p>  On individual customers, we, along with our colleagues across the banks, have raised underwriting standards.  It is more focused on affordability as against a belief that asset prices only go one way.</p> <p>  On the product portfolios we have, customers can take a view on interest rates and should they choose to have a certainty of repayment, we offer fixed rate mortgages.  On what we can do, we are using all the resources that we can.</p></speech>

We did some digging on what they regarded as restructured loans.  I put it on the record that they were quite offended in that they felt they were being blamed for the Irish banks being put under pressure to bring their non-performing loan ratio down in a rapid fashion.  In fact, they took grave exception to this and were highly offended.</p> <p>  They told us that their definition of a restructured functioning loan was putting a loan in place after the restructure where people could meet the repayments.  In the example of a &euro;200,000 mortgage, where the individual can afford &euro;150,000 of that but not the other &euro;50,000, they spoke about junior and senior.  The senior was the &euro;150,000.  They had no concern about the time period as long as the person could meet the repayments.  On the &euro;50,000 element, the junior side, that had to be fully provided by the bank.  If a person had a &euro;200,000 loan, and a &euro;100,000 was sustainable, that &euro;100,000 would be senior.  It could be repayable over whatever period the individual could afford - it could be 15 or 20 years.  The other &euro;100,000 would have to be junior - fully provided and a full write-off.  Is that Mr. Masding's understanding of it?</p> <p>  They felt that they were the fall guy or fall lady - perhaps some of my colleagues might disagree - for the banks selling to funds.  They said that they are not the bad guys or bad ladies and did not wish to be treated as such.  To say that they were offended would be an understatement.  Could Mr. Masding deal with their point?  It was a very interesting high-level meeting and they have concerns about Permanent TSB, which I expect is nothing new to Mr. Masding in terms of how they view the bank.  Mr. O'Sullivan might respond on restructuring and Mr. Masding might respond on the macro side.</p></speech>

We have a further &euro;160 million worth of loans to customers whom we believe fit into mortgage to rent solutions, on which we are working extensively.  It is a slow process, but we have identified that cohort.  There are others that we continue to work out.

Will Mr. O'Sullivan take up that point?  The ECB is only interested in finding out the percentage of a loan that could be classed as performing over ten, 15 or 20 years, to be called senior debt, with the balance that cannot be paid being classified as junior debt and warehoused and full provision made for it.  I do not like to see the sale of loans to vulture funds which I do not think are structured to deal with them.  I would prefer loans to be dealt with in-house.  We formed the impression from what the ECB had stated that it would like to see more and more loans being restructured in-house.  I felt it was frustrated at what the banks were doing and that they were not doing enough.  What I hear from bank customers is that there has been non-engagement by the banks on the basis of moral hazard in being able to sell on to vulture funds.  Will Mr. O'Sullivan deal with the technical point about which the ECB informed us?  Can it feed back towards the non-performing loans of &euro;1.5 billion that need to be addressed?</p></speech>

Let me take the example of a &euro;200,000 mortgage.  Is it the case that the bank will not go for restructuring below a figure of &euro;100,000, half of the amount being deemed to be functioning on the basis that the 100% provision the bank needs on the balance sheet for junior debt is not sustainable for it?</p></speech>

The Senator described it extremely well in terms of senior and junior debt.  The only flaw in his example of a &euro;200,000 mortgage is where he referred to senior debt of &euro;150,000 and junior debt of &euro;50,000.  The actual figures are senior deb of &euro;100,000 and junior debt of &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

The ECB stated that if a loan of &euro;100,000 was functioning, it was not interested in the period of the loan.  As long as the person was in his or her 30s, the term of the loan could be 25 or 30 years.  As long as the loan in the senior category was deemed to be functioning, the ECB would make provision for the junior debt.  Is Mr. Masding saying Permanent TSB cannot afford that level of restructuring?</p></speech>

If what the Senator is suggesting is a legitimate alternative for the bank, the answer is yes.  However, what the bank needs to think about is that within its capital envelope and its duty to all taxpayers.  We need to compare that option to others I do not yet have on the table.  I can assure the committee that the board and I would make a recommendation to the Minister which would be based on the best decision for all taxpayers.  That is probably all I can say.</p></speech>

He asked me a question.  It is in the first paragraph of his opening statement.  At no stage did any of the three organisations I have mentioned ever tell Mr. Masding directly what to do in his bank relative to the 3.5% or how he could achieve it.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The next point is that he complimented the 13,800 homes that have been restored to performing loans.  Again, that is to give the impression that those that are left in his bank are the ones that responded the least to any kind of treatment or cure.  He said that selling them to the vulture funds is a legitimate tool for banks to use to reduce NPLs.  He is saying again that the European Commission, the SSM and the Central Bank of Ireland have all said that loan sales are a legitimate tool to sell.  It may very well be a legitimate tool but they never told Mr. Masding to sell directly to vulture funds.  They just recognise that it is a legitimate tool.  That is all.  There are many other options, so I find that misleading.</p> <p>  In terms of debt forgiveness and write-offs, Mr. Masding gave us his definition of moral hazard and all the rest of it.  I find that hard to take coming from a bank that led these people into the debt they are now in.  He went on to mention alternatives, including to provide and derecognise loans, and he said the bank did not pursue that particular method, but there is nothing wrong with that method.  He could very easily have taken that as an option.  The residential mortgage backed securitisation would have allowed the bank to derecognise the loans from its balance sheet, reducing the NPL ratio and avoiding a portfolio sale.  That is what would have happened.  It is an accounting procedure, and the loan holder is still on the hook, yet Mr. Masding will not consider that.  I find the way he has presented this to be completely offensive.  He said "customers have been poorly served by inflammatory and inaccurate commentary around the transaction".  Can he drop us a line and let us know specifically what he means by that?  Who are the people who put out these inflammatory and inaccurate statements?  Surely, we will have to hold them to account, will we not?  They cannot be saying bad things about Mr. Masding's bank.  If he believes this, perhaps he might write and tell us where these statements were made.  I doubt if he is referring to the committee members.  Is he?</p></speech>

When PTSB was challenging 2,500 homeowners around the country, that was the time to address it.  What it is now doing is outsourcing its dirty work to a vulture fund.  It is ignoring the possibility of working individually with the people we are speaking about.  That is essentially what Mr. Masding's response means.  It is cold comfort for the 2,500 people who were before the courts legitimately seeking justice for the predicament that they found themselves in that PTSB has pulled that legal process from under them and sold their loans to a vulture fund.</p> <p>  How many of the 2,500 could have been helped by, say, Mr. David Hall's agency, iCare Housing?  Did PTSB run these cases by that agency?</p></speech>

We took up to 700 accounts out of the sale that we felt could qualify for mortgage-to-rent.  Not only have we worked with iCare Housing, we have also worked with Home4Life and the approved housing bodies, AHBs.  Currently, 300 of those 700 accounts are being progressed through the mortgage-to-rent scheme, either through the AHBs, iCare Housing or Home4Life.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The second point is in regard to the courts, which was raised earlier by a Deputy.  In terms of what we have all been attempting to work through over the past ten years, approximately one in five mortgages has been arrears but fewer than one in 300 homes have been repossessed through the courts.  It is a clich&eacute; that it is the last resort.  We do not rush quickly to the courts.  I have sat in many courts and watched many cases play out.  The court system will give the borrower every chance it can until it can give no more chances.  That is-----</p></speech>

It is a nonsense that PTSB has been peddling for some time now, supported by some commentators, but it totally untrue in reality and in practice.

My understanding is that it broke out the 1,050 and explained that some of them originally were buy-to-let properties, others were not sustainable and the remaining were a catch-all for long-term arrears.  That is my recollection of what was stated.  I do not believe that any statement says that those 1,050 were home loans.</p></speech>

All of the loans, as part of the Glas portfolio, are non-performing.</p></speech>

The witnesses constantly refer to the taxpayer and the best deal for the Irish taxpayer.  The bank has sold off thousands of loans and some mortgage holders may end up losing their homes.  There may be a tsunami of repossessions, in spite of what the witnesses say.  These very same people will then end up on housing waiting lists, looking for homes to be provided to them by the State.  One is back to the question of moral hazard again and to the fact that repossessions will happen, which will cost the State.  I do not take the statements regarding the Irish taxpayer very seriously.  The witnesses have no interest in the Irish taxpayer; they are only interested in their bank, which is borne out by their actions.</p> <p>  Let us go back to Senator Conway-Walsh's question because I want to understand these figures.

Once the loan continues to be repaid as it should over that 12 month period, the loan is no longer deemed to be non-performing.</p></speech>

If someone goes into the bank today with arrears that are owed, does the bank accept those arrears?</p><p>If they continue to pay the interest and the original loan over a 12-month period, they will automatically come out of the non-performing category.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

As Mr Masding has said, it comes back to the original contract.  It depends on what is paid.  Is the amount that was not paid now paid?  Is the interest that was due but not paid now paid?  Has the account performed as it should for 12 months?  If that happens, then the account can go back to be considered performing.</p> <p>  For some of the deeper restructures the interest is not repaid.  We heard an example earlier of where &euro;100,000 continues to be paid, the other &euro;100,000 is not paid and the interest is not asked for.  That account will never go back to non-performing status until all the capital that is not paid and all of the interest that was not paid is paid.  It is unlikely that customers with split mortgages would pay interest that they did not have to pay.</p></speech>

We also have to be careful that a loan is not connected or cross-collateralised with a different loan that is a non-performing loan.

I will outline a case that touches on the point.  I am not going into detail but I want you to understand the effect it has.  A borrower who was with Permanent TSB for the past ten years got a letter from the bank at the beginning of August saying the mortgage had been transferred.  The borrower fell into arrears in 2016 for six months and the amount was &euro;3,000.  The mortgage is being transferred.  The borrower has outlined in detail in the letter the fact that the family are living in fear and feel they have been very badly treated by the bank.  That is a letter from one of Permanent TSB's customers.</p> <p>  I have highlighted another case.  The writer says to me that Permanent TSB issued a response that was received a little over a week ago.  The writer is not happy with the response and does not believe the bank actually looked at anything in any different way.  The writer simply got holding letters.  If you think that is a response in some sort of special way to a member of the committee, I do not agree with you.</p> <p>  Other correspondence relates to a case I raise with the bank officials.  Out of courtesy, this person wrote back to give me the update.  The person said there was no outcome whatsoever from Permanent TSB or even a response from Mr. Masding regarding the &euro;60,000 overpayment.  It is now one year since the query began and eight months since Mr. Masding said he would look into it and nothing constructive has happened.</p> <p>  I have before me another letter from an individual whose loans have been sent on to a vulture fund and sold again by that vulture fund to someone else.  What struck me about it was that it started at a very low amount.  There was a resolution to it.  The man went into bad health and tried to deal with it as best he could.  Again the response from the bank was such that he believes he got no hearing whatsoever.</p> <p>  These are some of the letters I wanted to refer to and say to you that the bank is not building confidence with its customers by virtue of the number of letters I receive and by your interaction with this committee.  I will pass some of these letters on to you again in the hope that you will look at them in a different way.  For the record, I find your approach to all of this shocking, as is what you are prepared to do for the bottom line in your bank.</p> <p>  Deputy Burton, do you want to ask a question before we wrap up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.2223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018101100002#U01600"><p>It is a brief question and follows from some of the points raised.  First, we have been advised that the average loan value in the context of our discussion today is &euro;175,000.  Second, we have been advised that the average arrears time of the loans is three and a half years.  Third, we have been advised that the average arrears value is &euro;28,800.  The bank is telling us this is a management process.  Many of us are struggling to understand this from the bank's perspective.  Would the bank officials be kind enough to get us details on the highest-value loans in the top category?  Are there people who are in arrears to the tune of more than &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000?  What are the lowest values?</p> <p>  The committee has received letters, which the Chairman has passed on to the bank officials, showing that particular loans have no arrears at all.  In an earlier conversation with the Chairman and others the Permanent TSB officials said the same person may well have another loan.  If someone has no loan arrears on the family home but has a business situation or a buy-to-let loan, as referenced earlier by Mr. Crowley, it is quite unfair to undermine the security of the family home that is being repaid.  It is not an unreasonable tactic for a family with several loans to say they will prioritise the family home to ensure it is secure.  It is reasonable to decide to repay all of that and perhaps have another loan from the bank that is related to a tracker mortgage or development land.  Again, it is a question of moral hazard.  The moral hazard at the moment rests with families losing homes.  When a family loses the home, there are no easy alternatives in most of Ireland to replace that home and no easy alternatives in most of Ireland in terms of finding a rental property at a reasonable cost to allow a family to rent.  Can the bank officials go behind the figures that have been made available on the averages?  An average arrears value of &euro;28,800 seems rather low.</p></speech>

I am happy to respond to it to address the committee on the topic of housing standards, with specific reference to fire safety and damp.  I am joined by colleagues Mr. John Barry, Mr. Conor O&rsquo;Sullivan and Ms Sarah Neary from the Department's national directorate for fire and emergency management and the building standards unit.  The national directorate for fire and emergency management, NDFEM, was established in 2009 and operates under a management board structure within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It has a mandate to develop consistent, effective, quality and value for money fire services to protect communities from fire.  It includes developing national policies and standards and supporting and overseeing their implementation at local level.  Additionally, the directorate has a role in developing arrangements for co-ordinating emergency responses across government services and has led national level responses as the lead government body in the case of severe weather events such as Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma.  In the nine years since its inception the management board of the NDFEM has made significant progress in aligning national and local efforts around common public safety objectives.</p> <p>  I will focus on recent work undertaken by the NDFEM, following the tragic fire in Grenfell Tower in London.  On 27 June last year, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy and in recognition of concerns arising about fire safety in Ireland, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, tasked the NDFEM with convening and co-ordinating a high level task force to lead a reappraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  Earlier this year the Government approved the publication of the fire safety task force report and a summary of conclusions and recommendations.  As well as making a range of recommendations to improve provisions for fire safety, the task force found, following a country-wide review of medium to high rise buildings, that the combination of contributory factors which appeared to have existed in Grenfell Tower did not seem to be present in medium to high rise buildings in Ireland.  However, fire safety improvement works are ongoing in 35 buildings where assessments were required.</p> <p>  The report also found that the experience of actual fires gave confidence that the fire safety strategy was appropriate and effective in protecting the lives of persons living in medium to high rise buildings.  The activation of fire detection and alarm systems, the effective evacuation of premises, the success of compartmentation and construction in containing fire and the efficacy of the fire service response are all part of the current recommended approach to life safety in medium to high rise buildings.  The task force also found that the assessment by local authorities of fire safety measures in their existing multi-storey, multi-unit social housing provided considerable reassurance of the standard of fire safety within this profile of social housing building stock.  At the time of publication of the report, almost 95% of units had been found to have appropriate facilities and the assessment process had resulted in improvements works in the remaining units, where necessary.  The task force has recommended that national oversight be maintained of the fire safety assessment process under way in 219 medium to high rise buildings and that emergent issues be dealt with and an oversight report provided for the Minister at the end of the process.</p> <p>  A further recommendation of the task force concerns the statutory responsibilities of the person having control of premises, as set out in section 18 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003.  This emerged as a key focus for the task force which proposes a number of amendments to the current regulatory system to enhance and ensure fire safety in certain categories of buildings, in particular, in residential and sleeping accommodation, which is identified as a priority area for fire safety efforts.  The legislative amendments proposed by the task force seek to clarify and strengthen the statutory obligations imposed on the person having control and introduce new reporting mechanisms through which the fire safety arrangements in place in premises will be brought to the attention of the public.  To ensure persons having control of premises take action to fulfil their statutory obligations, the task force also recommends that a revised focus on enforcement be put in place in parallel to address any disregard for fire safety considerations.</p> <p>  The Minister has accepted the recommendations made in the task force's report and mandated the management board of the NDFEM to carry through on the recommendations within his direct ambit and oversee and report on the implementation of other recommendations.  At its meeting on 13 September the management board of the NDFEM agreed to establish a fire safety sub-committee and working structure which would undertake the work arising from the report of the task force.  Progress will be reported to the Minister by the NDFEM management board.  I note that the report concludes that the overall composition of Ireland&rsquo;s fire safety system is appropriate and generally fit for purpose.</p> <p>  I turn to housing standards and fire safety.  Part B, fire safety, of the second schedule to the building regulations sets out the legal requirements in respect of fire safety in new buildings, including dwellings, as well as existing buildings which are undergoing works which involve an extension, material alteration or certain material changes of use.  The Part B technical guidance document B, TGD B, on fire safety is under review.  In the interests of clarity, I note that the technical guidance document has been split into separate volumes.  Volume 1 deals with all buildings, other than dwelling houses, while volume 2 deals exclusively with dwelling houses.  On 1 July 2017 the Building Regulations (Part B Amendment) Regulations 2017, SI 57/2017, and Technical Guidance Document B Fire Safety &ndash; Volume 2 &ndash; Dwelling Houses (2017) were published and came into force.  Work is still ongoing on buildings, other than dwelling houses, and the next step in the process will be to issue draft amendments to Part B and a draft version of Technical Guidance Document B Fire Safety &ndash; Volume 1 &ndash; Buildings other than Dwelling Houses for public consultation.  Until the full review is complete, however, the current requirements and guidance for all buildings, other than dwelling houses, including apartment buildings, are set out in the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2006, SI 115/2006, and the relevant parts of Technical Guidance Document B Fire Safety (2006), respectively.</p><p> Building control regulations require a fire safety certificate to be obtained for new buildings, with some exceptions, and certain works to existing buildings.  The fire safety certificate ensures that the building or works, if constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted, comply with the requirements of Part B.  As such, an application is examined technically by the chief fire officer or building control authority for compliance with Part B.  This may be on the basis of technical guidance document B or through alternative approaches to providing fire safety.</p><p> Regarding damp, Part C on site preparation and resistance to moisture, Part F on ventilation and Part L on conservation of fuel and energy of the Second Schedule to the building regulations set performance requirements to prevent the passage of moisture into the building, ensure adequate ventilation and limit heat loss.  The associated technical guidance provides practical advice on limiting thermal bridging, ensuring adequate ventilation and avoiding rising damp.</p><p> I look forward to hearing the views of committee members and I am happy to answer whatever questions they may have on our areas of work.</p></speech>

These regulations have undoubtedly saved many lives since.  We are again discussing regulatory change in the aftermath of another tragedy, that being the Grenfell Tower fire in London in 2017.  Both of these events were foreseeable and preventable.  It should not take a tragedy to act when the risks are evident and preventable, but warnings frequently go unheeded.  Events of this scale do not happen regularly and we can become complacent about the risks.<br/><br/>Fire safety is one of the most visible types of building failure.  Other building failures that are damaging to health and the environment often go unreported because they are not so visible and play out in private.  They need the same attention in public policy, particularly where there are new and emerging risks.  The next pyrite will not be pyrite and the next Grenfell Tower will not be about cladding.<br/><br/>It is evident that Grenfell is part of a very complex failure, in that it is as much a procurement failure as a regulatory one.  Combustible cladding was a factor, but it was only part of a bigger story.  We can learn much from such events because they point to weaknesses across the sector, including flaws in industry practices, poor procurement policies, inadequate regulatory systems, inadequate controls on how buildings are designed, procured and managed, and a failure to keep pace with rapid changes in technology and materials.  In the 28 years since the 1990 Act, buildings have become larger and more complex, housing is being built more densely, and the materials being used have become lighter, more combustible, more toxic and less forgiving of poor design, unskilled workers and inadequate testing and control systems.<br/><br/>I would first like to address some fire safety issues specifically, after which I will briefly mention more general concerns about the risk of other potential building failures.  Fire Safety in Ireland, the report of the fire safety task force, follows closely behind two 2017 reports into fire safety failings, one on schools and another on timber-framed housing.  There needs to be a follow-through so that the findings of these reports are widely disseminated and actively addressed.<br/><br/>I have been following the UK response to the Grenfell fire very closely.  By comparison, the response in Ireland has been limited.  No regulatory change has been signalled and no guidance has been issued to building designers.  Public safety concerns around this matter are legitimate.  The remit of the task force's report was narrow, being limited to buildings of more than six storeys or more than 18 m with external cladding or rainscreen systems.  It did not include buildings under six storeys, including apartment buildings, schools, hospitals and other buildings that could be high risk.  The technical failings in Grenfell were much wider than the cladding specification.<br/><br/>The task force identified 226 buildings by contacting 31 local authorities to provide statistics.  Using freedom of information requests, I have undertaken some research into the data provided.  There is no national listing of these buildings - the 31 authorities acted independently and just provided statistics.  Each of the local authorities acts as a separate building control authority, meaning that there was not a consistent response.  While there was an ongoing issue with monitoring, the report asserted that there was no concern about a Grenfell situation.  At the time of the report's production, however, fewer than half of the 226 buildings identified had undergone fire risk assessments.  It was premature to say there were no issues or concerns.<br/><br/>The departmental circular on this matter does not address the fundamental issue, that being public safety.  The direction to local authorities is cautious and defers all responsibility to building owners on the assumption that they can be identified, which is still not the case in some instances, that they will act promptly and responsibly, that they will have resources to deal with the problem and that remedial works will be carried out correctly.  There is no requirement for anyone living in the buildings to be notified.<br/><br/>The Irish building regulations - the technical standards - rely heavily on UK regulations, research, testing and codes.  The Grenfell fire is subject to a number of reviews and inquiries in the UK and regulatory reform is being implemented there.  It is not clear how the Irish regulatory authorities intend to act in response.  Brexit will compound some of these issues, particularly as regards building materials.<br/><br/>The implication of the catastrophic &quot;systems failure&quot; at Grenfell warrants a much broader review and risk assessment.  Many issues are technical and evolving and are beyond the remit of this committee or <i>ad hoc</i>committees.  There is an urgent need to re-establish the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board, which was disbanded in 2012.  Following Grenfell, the UK Government established an independent expert advisory panel, and that group has been reporting as the issues emerge.<br/><br/>Policymakers, the construction industry and owners need support.  They also need transparency.  The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations, BCAR, are not a robust system or entail what is described in the Hackett report.  Producing technical building regulations and standards is not enough.  They will not be rolled out without addressing the weaknesses across the system, including skills shortages, an absence of technical information, poor procurement practices, a lack of independent inspections and controls, poorly structured and resourced systems for building management, a lack of public information, and a lack of technical support.<br/><br/>There needs to be a system of active market surveillance of dangerous, illegal and fraudulent construction products, as required under the EU construction products regulations, and more active dissemination of alerts for building materials.  The State authorities need to be resourced to ensure that public safety is protected.  This is not just about high-rise buildings or apartments.  It is also about our hospitals, schools, airports, shopping centres, student housing and hotels.  The Stardust inquiry was unequivocal about the responsibilities of State authorities to protect the public.  We cannot conclude that our systems are appropriate and fit for purpose when people are living in dangerous buildings that have been constructed since BCAR came into effect in 2014.<br/><br/>I will briefly address the issues of damp, mould, condensation and ventilation.  Mould should not be singled out.  It can serve as a visible indicator of wider indoor air quality problems that can be damaging to the occupants' health and the fabric of the building over time.  Modern building regulation standards require buildings to be tested for air tightness to achieve high levels of energy efficiency.  Issues of damp, condensation and mould are the result of a failure in the building physics, which can be a consequence of poor design, poor construction, inappropriate materials, inadequate ventilation, conflicting regulatory requirements or a combination of these factors.<br/><br/>The technical issues are beyond the scope of this committee, but this is an area of serious concern, particularly given that some recent research indicates that there are significant levels of non-compliance in recently built homes.</p></speech>

I would like to introduce my colleague, Mr. Peter Bluett, an architect and fire engineer who sat on the fire safety task force.</p> <p>  Founded in 1839 and now comprising 3,380 members, the RIAI is the support and registration body for architects in Ireland and the membership body for architectural technologists.  The RIAI works to ensure the safety of the public through the efficient and effective administration of the register of architects and the maintenance of standards within architectural education.</p> <p>  Since the introduction and ongoing implementation of BCAR, the RIAI considers this legislation to be far-reaching in improving the standards of design and construction of building, particularly the building of houses and apartments.  BCAR, SI 9 of 2014, ensures that all parties involved in the design and construction are aware of their responsibilities.  These responsibilities are confirmed by documentation, inspection plans, certification and ancillary certification, enabling houses and apartments to be registered on the local authority register.</p><p>The RIAI acknowledges the annual reviews of SI 9 of 2014 by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the construction industry and has proposed a number of amendments to the legislation which we believe will further improve the purpose of the legislation.  First, putting the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, on a statutory footing would help to ensure appropriate competencies in building, which is the principal way of ensuring compliant and good quality building.  The requirements that such developments are carried out by members of a statutory CIRI register should be seriously considered in the legislation.</p><p> Second, the introduction of the requirement for latent defects insurance, LDI, for all new housing and apartments should be executed by the developer during the conveyancing process to ensure consumer protection.  LDI, when invoked, enables the insurer to immediately rectify the construction defects without recourse to law and at no cost to the consumer of the property, usually up to a ten-year period. </p><p> Third, we propose the repeal of Statutory Instrument 365 of 2015.  The RIAI considers SI 365 is not in the consumer interest, either in short or long term, as the rigours of this statutory instrument are diluted to such an extent that it could permit bad construction practice without recourse for the consumer and subsequent consumers.</p><p> The RIAI, in conjunction with Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, ACEI, Engineers Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, made technical recommendations for amendment to the Vacant Housing Bill 2017.  I will briefly outline our 11 recommendations.</p><p> We identified that there is no need for a second layer of building regulation technical documents as proposed in the Bill.  A single suite of technical guidance documents relating to the vacant homes legislation should be specific and sufficient.  Documentation required at application stage should demonstrate compliance with the building regulations and the documentation should be described in the Bill.</p><p> Any existing vacant building being considered for occupancy must be structurally assessed by a qualified structural engineer and a condition survey executed by a qualified architect or building surveyor, all of whom must be covered by professional indemnity insurance.</p><p> Applications for the use of vacant properties should include proposals for dealing with specific risks, including radon, avoiding cold bridging and mould growth, timber rot and pests and access and facilities, particularly for people with compromised mobility.</p><p> The provisions of the Bill are not capable of coming into immediate effect as the local authorities' level of resources and competencies need to be put in place with the assistance of central government.  Therefore, the Bill should not proceed to have force until these resources are carefully evaluated and demonstrably provided.  Further focus on utilising the existing framework under the Building Control (Amendment) Regulation, BCAR, system should be considered.</p><p> The competency of authorised persons both at assessment of technical submission and inspection of works stages should be defined.  These competencies must align with those of design certifier and assigned certifier as set out in Statutory Instrument 9 of 2014. </p><p> The proposed inspection plan must align in compliance and complexity with the SI 9 risk based inspection plan and be executed in accordance with the code of practice for inspecting and certifying buildings and works.</p><p> The employment of the project supervisor design process, PSDP, and project supervisor construction stage, PSCS, will still be required as per SI 9.  Issues relating to co-owned party walls require particular attention.  The provision of a fast-track appeals process must also be considered. </p><p> We have concerns regarding the replacement of the BCAR model with the permit approval process as we consider it is impracticable to enforce and will undermine the current regulation procedure.</p><p>  I will now address fire safety in houses and apartments.  The code of practice for fire safety in flats of July 1994 could be reconsidered and updated to deal with change of use of existing buildings to apartments and flats, rather than a new full technical guidance document.  The current 1994 document is valid for existing buildings containing flats and existing mixed use, but does not cover change of use.</p><p> The RIAI would welcome the publication for consultation of an updated technical guidance document, Part B, which will include provisions for apartments and other buildings.</p><p> There are practicability issues for upgrading of existing buildings, in particular in relation to change of use of existing building stock.  Current technical guidance documents are more appropriate for new builds.</p><p> Concerns relating to the construction stage and quality of workmanship and training, certification of quality of work in timber frame and stud partition systems, fire stopping, etc., could be addressed by the introduction of the CIRI legislation.</p></speech>

I am the acting chief fire officer for Dublin Fire Brigade.  I am accompanied my colleague, Ms Mary O&rsquo;Brien, senior executive fire prevention officer.</p> <p>  In 2017, Dublin Fire Brigade processed in excess of 160,000 emergency fire and ambulance 999 or 112 calls.  There were 39,427 mobilisations to fire and rescue calls and 86,405 mobilisations to ambulance calls.</p> <p>  In addition, our objective is to promote fire safety through education and advice, help ensure fire safety standards are being adhered to in existing buildings and ensure the compliance with building regulations is achieved through good building design practice by competent professional designers.  Consequently, our role is to ensure best practice in terms of fire safety in new and existing buildings.</p> <p>  In 2017, Dublin Fire Brigade issued 14 fire safety notices, three closure notices and 12 prosecutions and two High Court orders.  In 2018, we have served 20 fire safety notices.</p><p>The building regulations are not prescriptive but are performance-based.  The DFB administers Part B of the building regulations within Dublin City Council and supports the administration of Part B in the other three Dublin counties.  Each Part is accompanied with a technical guidance document, TGD, and the DFB primarily deals with TGDB.  Works carried out in accordance with TGDB are assumed to demonstrate <i>prima facie</i>evidence of compliance with building regulations.<br/><br/>The Building Control Regulations, 1997 to 2015, set out procedures and controls that require owners, builders, and registered construction professionals to demonstrate through the statutory register of building control activity that the works or buildings concerned have been designed and constructed in compliance with building regulations.  The regulations apply to the construction of new buildings and to existing buildings which undergo an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use, with some exceptions.  It is a statutory requirement under the regulations that a fire safety certificate must be sought and obtained for the construction, material alteration, and material change of use or extension to a building.  The DFB, working in conjunction with the building control authorities of the four Dublin councils, process approximately 1,500 fire safety certificate applications per annum.  A fire safety certificate, once granted, indicates that a building, if built in accordance with the design submitted, will be in accordance with building regulations.  It is the responsibility of the designer, the builder and the owner to ensure that the building is built in accordance with the fire safety certificate and the building regulations.  With the advent of the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, in 2014 there is now greater oversight and accountability of the construction of building and works.<br/><br/>I will now refer to challenges in respect of housing standards and fire safety.  The DFB has no power of inspection or enforcement in a single dwelling.  We can only advise about fire safety.  Tragically, most fatalities due to fire occur in a single dwelling, and, to address that, we undertake community fire safety initiatives throughout the community to give advice and create awareness of fire safety best practice, in essence, to help people keep themselves safe from fire.  All other buildings used for housing, including apartments and hostels, should comply with building regulations, if new or if materially changed or extended.  Additionally, the Fire Services Act places responsibility on persons in control of a building for fire safety in that building in terms of the operation and management of the building, apartment or hostel.  However, it is important that persons in control of buildings are aware of their responsibilities.  That is especially important in the context of apartments.<br/><br/>The Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 provided for the setting up of an owners management company, OMC, for each apartment complex.  It Is important that a formal OMC is created for each apartment complex, complete with sufficient funds to operate.  Under the Fire Services Act, with regard to apartment buildings, the OMC is considered to be the person in control of the building and, therefore, responsible for fire safely in the apartment building.  Any enforcement action carried out would be directed against the OMC or persons in control of an apartment building.  Unless an OMC is adequately funded, it will be impeded in its capacity to manage fire safety in the apartment building.  The OMC should ensure that active systems are maintained and passive fire safety elements are kept in good repair to ensure the fire safety design strategy of the apartment building is in place.<br/><br/>I would like to highlight the challenges and issues we have noted through our inspection programme, and, in particular, the deficiencies identified based on legacy building defects that occurred in that decade.  We have found both construction defects and management inadequacies.  While we have extensive powers, as explained under the aforementioned legislation, we are mindful of the impact of our actions and cost to homeowners.  Our focus is on safety, risk mitigation and improving the safety of buildings. The DFB continues to work and engage with stakeholders in that regard.  We will, however, use our powers to full effect, if warranted, to minimise risk to owners and occupiers.<br/><br/>At the fire safety certificate application design stage, the DFB is being presented with new building techniques and complex fire safety engineering design innovations.  That poses challenges for us in terms of ensuring the design is in compliance with building regulations and will be built correctly.  It is vital that there be good education and handover to the owner or eventual users in terms of the fire safety strategy of the building once the building is complete to ensure it will be operated within the fire safety strategy design parameters.  We also consider the effect of the design innovations on our firefighting capabilities and the health and safety and training of firefighters.  That is particularly pertinent in both high rise and complex building design.  Those types of buildings are designed with a myriad fire safety features, both passive and active systems, to ensure compliance with building regulations, and the safety of occupants and firefighters.<br/><br/>In May 2018, the report of the fire safety task force, Fire Safety in Ireland, was published by Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The report addresses the public concerns and fears that were generated on foot of the Grenfell Tower fire and makes a number of recommendations to guide fire safety in Ireland.  I welcome this report and its recommendations.  It highlights the &quot;engineer, educate and enforce&quot; approach to fire safety in Ireland.  I also welcome the recommendation of a more targeted inspection and enforcement approach based on risk assessment prioritisation.  I further welcome the emphasis on education of persons in control and OMCs on their responsibilities under the Fire Services Act.  I recommend that advice be given to apartment owners and representative bodies on their fire safety responsibilities and the importance of an adequately funded OMC.  The continued emphasis towards community fire safety and helping citizens stay safe from fire is important and should be supported.  We have a high prevalence of smoke alarms in homes but more could be done to ensure they are working correctly.  More targeted campaigns and programmes should be developed based on operational intelligence.  The leveraging and increased use of social media platforms should also be developed.<br/><br/>Dublin Fire Brigade is at the coalface in ensuring that building design is in compliance with building regulations and in responding to fires in buildings.  As our building regulations are performance-based, we rely on fire safety engineering and also current codes of practice and guidance to check compliance of designs.  It is important that standards referenced in guidance are kept current.  It is also important that compliance with building regulations is demonstrated in respect of new building techniques and designs.  The DFB will continue to support the national directive for fire and emergency management and the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government in the review of new codes of practice and standards with the purpose of improving fire safety in Ireland.  I recommend that the review of TGDB be brought to a conclusion and published.  In that regard, it will be important to take account of the findings in the Grenfell Tower inquiry.<br/><br/>DFB is committed to ensuring that Dublin is best prepared against the risk of fire.  We will continue to promote fire safety best practice in all buildings and to help people stay safe in their homes.<br/><br/><b>Vice Chairman:</b>I thank Mr. Keeley.

I commend the men and women of the DFB and our fire services generally for often putting themselves at risk of harm to keep us safe.  Everybody on the committee will agree with me on that.</p><p>Part of the purpose of today's session is to look specifically at the Fire Safety in Ireland report and its recommendations.  I am mindful that it is important that members of this committee be responsible how we deal with this issue and that we do not engage in scaremongering or frightening people but we have a responsibility to scrutinise the report and the outworking of it.  That is the spirit in which I will put questions.</p><p>I am interested in both the view of the Department and DFB on Ms Hegarty's suggestion that the terms of reference of the report may have been too limited at the outset, in particular in terms of height and the scope of the issues being addressed.  I would welcome information on the rationale as to why those terms of reference were chosen and why, for example, other lower rise multiple unit developments were not included in the original decision because that is important.</p><p>I am also interested to hear the view of both fire brigade and the Department on the issues beyond the Grenfell Tower cladding in terms of other systems failures or regulatory failures that have been identified across the water, and some of the changes that have been implemented there as well.</p><p>I would like the Department to be explicit with the committee about how many buildings with fire safety risks were identified.  What works were required to be done on those buildings and has the work been carried out?  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i>a few weeks ago identified 19 buildings where none of the required works had been done at that point, which is a concern given the report was published early this year.  Could they also comment on the progress of the works?</p><p>There is a broader issue in terms of whether the existing regulations have been fully complied with.  The second is whether the review throws up the need for regulatory change.</p><p>Could positive regulatory changes be made learning from the investigations into the Grenfell Tower fire and how the British authorities are dealing with that, as well as the Fire Safety in Ireland report?</p><p> The DFB presentation stated it is important that the standards referencing guidance be kept up to date.  Is that a soft way of saying some of the standards referenced are not necessarily as current as the fire service would like them?  Do the witnesses believe more updating needs to be done with some of those standards to ensure they are as current as needs be?</p><p> One of my concerns regarding the regulatory framework is this issue of dwelling houses occupied as single dwellings.  I do not know the legislation as well as those on the panel.  However, will they explain as clearly as possible the exclusions under the legislation for dwelling houses occupied as single dwellings?  Given that these were defined in the 1980s, we are now in a period where even semi-detached or terraced houses are much more interlinked in terms of the construction mechanisms.  Can we talk about any dwelling, bar a stand-alone house or bungalow, which is occupied in that way?  I am thinking of Millfield Manor in Kildare in that what happens in one house or one apartment is automatically interlinked with others.  Is the interpretation of that a problem?  Is that an area in which we need legislative change?  When I talk to people who live in multi-unit developments, they often express a concern that this particular statutory provision is used by either developers or owners to limit the application of the regulatory framework to protect their interests as inhabitants of single-use dwellings, but they are fundamentally interconnected with their neighbouring dwellings.</p><p> Whatever about the inspection regime and SI No. 9/2014, the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, for multiple use developments, whether residential or commercial, or those kinds of developments that have higher fire safety risks, should we not move to a stage where those buildings are all subject to mandatory fire risk inspections during the construction process, whether it be local authority fire safety inspectors, etc?  Given the issues we are dealing with, surely that type of building should be subject to those mandatory inspections.</p><p> What is the Department's response to the four recommendations made by Ms Orla Hegarty?  When we as politicians talk to residents affected by these matters, the one point they make is that nobody shares information with them.  Millfield Manor is a good case in point.  The families who owned the homes surrounding the block in Millfield Manor that went on fire were the last to know the outcome of the fire safety inspections.  That is the wrong way to do this.  How can we improve the communication between people who occupy, or live adjacent to, affected buildings that have fire safety risks in order that they are fully informed at all times of the risks to themselves?  The idea that residents in Millfield Manor or Belmayne, for example, have to wait 18 months before they get information that many other people, including departmental, local authority officials and fire safety experts have at an earlier stage, is wrong.  We need to think about this can be improved.</p><p> We are increasingly encountering constituents in local authority and in private multi-unit developments built at the height of the boom where damp and mould are becoming a significant problem.  It is not just in the big urban areas but in rural towns.  The standard response in a local authority setting, for example, is that this is a lifestyle issue.  My local authority has a wonderful booklet which tells one should not put one&rsquo;s clothes hanging on dryers and so forth.  While all of that is true, it is clear that failure to comply with building standards, certainly pre-2014, has created structural problems in many of these buildings.  We need to have an informed discussion on Government and local authority policy to deal with that issue.  Simply throwing it back on the residents telling them to use their dryer less, even if they are not doing that, is not an adequate response.  We have a structural problem we need to discuss.  If the panel could briefly comment on this, we might return to it at a later stage.</p></speech>

The report very much sets a blueprint of where we need to get to.  It also underlines existing good practice.  Many of the measures in the report are happening.  We want to document and endorse them through the report.  In my opening statement, I referred to the group that has been set up to take this forward as part of the subgroup.  There is a significant work in progress.</p> <p>  The report deals in detail with buildings over six storeys and multi-occupancy social housing but it goes way beyond that.  The terms of reference referred to identifying and considering urgent issues of fire safety in Ireland in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.  They also referred to appraising existing arrangements for fire safety and preparing a report thereon for the Minister.  If one looks at the report, we have embraced those second terms of reference actively and we address a range of issues, not just those associated with high rise buildings.</p> <p>  On the fourth point which Ms Orla Hegarty identified regarding the State authorities and resourcing, during the downturn, local authorities shed staff in many areas.  The total of 37,000 whole-time equivalents was reduced to 27,000, which was a significant retrenchment.  In all of that time, the one area that was ring-fenced was the fire service and the capacity to respond operationally to fires.  When everyone was taking pain, fire services were not cut.  That is a fair reflection of the priority that has been given to that area.  It has not suffered from the retrenchment in the ways other sectors have.  It is an important point in the context of adequately resourcing State agencies.</p></speech>

Then the Department requested local authorities to consider in the case of buildings fitted with cladding whether it would be warranted for fire services to use their powers under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Act to require the person having control over the building to carry out a fire safety assessment.  That assessment can then give further information as to whether there is a need for remedial works for the general building or to the cladding insulation.</p> <p>  Some 838 buildings above 18 m or six storeys were identified.  Of those, 373 of those were residential buildings and 465 non-residential.  Of the 838 buildings identified, 287 were fitted with a cladding insulation which was of interest.  Of those, 104 were residential and 183 non-residential.</p><p>Fire safety assessments were required by fire services in 219 cases.  That is an adjustment to the figure of 226 that we have heard.  The current figure is 219.  Of these, 102 were residential and 117 non-residential buildings.  According to the most recent figures we have received from local authorities, 138 fire safety assessments have been received, 61 of which are for residential and 77 for non-residential buildings.  That leaves 81 fire safety assessments outstanding, 41 for residential and 40 for non-residential buildings.  Some 67 of the 81 are in process, that is, the fire safety assessments are being made and prepared, of which 34 are for residential and 33 for non-residential buildings.  That leaves 14 where fire safety assessments have not yet been started, of which seven are for residential and seven for non-residential buildings.</p></speech>

There is a range of issues.  When I say assessments have not been started, it is not in all cases necessarily due to an owner not co-operating.

In a very small number of cases the concerns identified relate to cladding.  Most of the issues relate to matters that arise in buildings generally.  Before the Grenfell Tower fire, we were hearing about issues arising in buildings.  There are management or procedural issues in buildings such as the management of fire safety measures, the maintenance of fire detection alarm systems, the maintenance of emergency lighting systems and the keeping of maintenance records, including the maintenance of fire resistant doors in working order.  Then there are matters such as fire stopping in compartmentation within buildings, issues about which we have heard in recent years.  They have arisen in some of these cases.  In a very small number of buildings - I have been informed of two cases - it has been found necessary to consider the replacement of cladding.  That work is under way in one building and about to start in another.  They are more significant works.</p> <p>  In December, as part of the work of the fire safety task force, we developed and issued guidance for fire services and professionals involved in fire safety assessment work.  The guidance is on the assessment of cladding systems and factors that could be taken into account.  There is a great deal of technical detail in the guidance, but one of the important points is that if an issue is found where a concern about rapid fire spread in the building is considered to be very serious, consideration should be given to the building ceasing to be occupied, pending the completion of remedial works to cladding systems.  No case has yet been brought forward where the fire service has considered this to be necessary.</p> <p>  Of the buildings I have mentioned where fire safety assessments are outstanding, in process and expected, fire officers have been in all of them.  They have confirmed, or the person having control has confirmed, the existence of life safety systems, fire detection alarm systems and emergency lighting systems and that there are adequate means of escape for people in the premises.  These are the basic things that are examined first to ensure they are in place in buildings within this category.  While remedial work needs to be done to bring the buildings and cladding insulation on the buildings up to standard, in the meantime, if the basic provisions for life safety are in place, fire services generally do not see the need to cease the occupation of buildings.</p> <p>  On the time being taken to complete this work throughout the country, the fire safety assessment, particularly of cladding insulation on buildings, is work that should be done by persons with a high degree of specialist knowledge.  There are only a certain number of people in the country who have that expertise and they are already busy working in the fire safety certification process about which we heard in the opening statements.  They tend to be quite engaged in that work on an ongoing basis; therefore, finding the capacity within the fire safety consultancy industry to carry out this work has been an issue.  That explains why it is an ongoing process.  While it is an ongoing process, in general, fire services have not reported to us on issues that are causing them such immediate concern that buildings should cease to be occupied.  We will continue to oversee this work and intend to report to the Minister at the end of the process.</p></speech>

He went through a complex set of numbers, which leaves two sets of seven where assessments have not yet started.  In all of these cases chief fire officers or assistant chief fire officers have visited the buildings and are satisfied that alarms, emergency lighting systems and escape routes are in place.  Combining this with the policy to evacuate the building in the event of a fire and the strong awareness at local level of where the buildings are gives us comfort that there is no life safety issue.</p></speech>

It was part of a wider programme of reducing the numbers of agencies and independent bodies.  From 2012 we were working on the new building control regulations that were introduced in 2014.  There was extensive public consultation on them; there were high level working groups both in the Department and the local authorities and extensive consultation with the industry.  Much of that work has continued in the review and implementation of the BCAR.  Yesterday there was a meeting with industry representatives.  Even a year after the BCAR was introduced in 2015, there was another public consultation process.  We consider that there is good communication between various sectors in how building control legislation is evolving.</p> <p>  On market surveillance, the building control authorities are the market surveillance authorities.  There is a framework in place that explains the roles and responsibilities and processes involved.  Ms Hegarty mentioned the RAPEX notices, a number of which have been issued.  We liaise with our European counterparts and anything of relevance is disseminated through building control authorities.  Our market surveillance is largely on a reactive basis, but in the past few years we have carried out market surveillance projects each year on a number of products.</p> <p>  Regarding the building regulations and standards not being sufficient, a huge amount of work goes into developing the technical guidance documents on the regulations in order that they can be communicated across the industry.  Since 2014 we have seen an increasing number of queries about the interpretation of the technical guidance documents.  They are being read and used probably more than ever before.  </p> <p>  On the training of building control officers and training across the industry - the RIAI might explain what it is doing in that regard - there is a huge amount of training being carried out on various aspects of the building regulations and inspections.  Competency is ensured through the three regulated professions.</p> <p>  As regards the building control management project, the lead local authority has been established in Dublin City Council.  It provides a central governance and oversight structure for building control officers across the country.</p><p>The lead local authority is embedded in Dublin City Council.  Three regional committees have been established and meetings are taking place on a quarterly basis.  It is a very important opportunity to disseminate the national position and provide upward feedback from building control officers relating to what they are finding on the ground.  This is all in the interest of increasing consistency across the country and establishing a better understanding of the detail in the guidance documents and how to achieve compliance.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to inspections of residential and commercial buildings, the more risky buildings, if you like.  The task force recommended that fire safety inspections should be carried out by competent people from the local authority.  That is very much embedded in the building control management project.  I will not go into the policy around the inspections process but our goal is risk-based targeted inspections.  We have several measures in place and much work has been undertaken this year to set methodologies and policies around identifying the risk.  We have discussed some of those previously.  That creates a situation where one can identify risk and target the buildings that are most at risk.</p><p> I would be happy to deal with the matter of mould on another occasion.  As Mr. Lemass noted in his opening statement, there are three parts to the regulations that deal with preventing mould occurring in buildings.  If one looks at the underlying causes of mould growth, it is either one of two things.  It can be ingressive water from the outside or from the ground and cold areas in buildings.  The ingressive water is dealt with under part C of the regulations which are designed to prevent ground water rising into a building or rain water getting into a building.  Part L deals with limiting thermal bridging which are cold spots in buildings which, given certain conditions, would facilitate the growth of mould or condensation on a surface.  Proper ventilation in the building is also fundamental to preventing these.  We often see situations where vents are blocked up or not used properly or mechanical systems not being maintained properly.  These are all contributory factors.  Occupant behaviour is a huge aspect.  I would welcome an opportunity to discuss it in more detail later. </p></speech>

I was not aware until just now that there an annual review of Building Control Amendment Regulations, BCAR, has been undertaken.  Those reports have not been published.</p> <p>  There is also a risk, to which I alluded earlier, about new methods of construction in lighter buildings.  There needs to be transparency about this because new products are coming on stream and they are different to traditional construction where a small pallet of materials we re put together on a site.  There are now very sophisticated constructions and we need to know there regulatory process and approval process for them because they are evolving very quickly.  One recommendation is that there is a broader participation and that the reporting is published.</p> <p>  I wanted to make a point about the Hackitt report which was the UK response to the Grenfell fire.  The headline issue on the Hackitt report is that the current system of building regulations and fire safety is not fit for purpose.  The Irish system is modelled on the UK system, although one could argue that the UK system has more controls and more independence than the Irish system.  If the UK system is not fit for purpose and the Irish system is modelled on it, but weaker, then we should take that very seriously.  Some specific recommendations in the Hackitt report point to the fact that the BCAR system is inadequate.  The Hackitt report addresses issues specifically where BCAR would be inadequate and I will name just a couple.</p> <p>  One is that, "It should not be possible for a client to choose their own regulator or for a regulator to be unable to apply sanctions against a dutyholder where such action is warranted".  That does not happen under BCAR.  There should not be any conflicts of interest, where we have conflicts of interest right through our system.  It says that "The sanctions and enforcement regime should be reinforced so that penalties are an effective deterrent."  We do not have a system beyond a soft approach towards enforcement.  It also recommends a regulator and a mandatory reporting system, as happens in the aviation industry and in good practice quality assurance in other sectors, and a requirement to report on a no-blame basis.  If someone is involved in a building management or construction process there should to be mandatory reporting on a no-blame basis.  The thing that has improved standards in the aviation industry and many other sectors is having a culture of transparency about mistakes and errors and a constant feedback loop on information for improvement.  We do not have a feedback loop in our system of construction and building regulation, we do not have transparency about any of that, and if anything, because of the litigation culture, we have a system of closing down information which means that mistakes are being repeated everywhere and there is no learning coming back.  It is proliferating the problem rather than solving it.</p></speech>

I know that Ms Neary wishes to come back in but I will bring her back in at the end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.2274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Mahoney" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018101100002#K00400"><p>I will make a few comments before handing over to Mr. Bluett who is more versed in relation to fire.</p> <p>  In relation to mould, the way we seal buildings these days means that they are completely airtight.  The problem with new buildings is that one can still put vents in a wall which means that the air does not circulate around the building.  As practitioners we are starting to insist that there is a handling system within apartments and houses that actually extracts the air.  There are methods of doing this and it is important that, perhaps through the regulations, they become a requirement.  Otherwise one is dealing with stale, bad air which in turn leads to all problems that we are dealing with.</p> <p>  Just observing the Millfield Manor fire as an architect, it seemed clear that the fire prevention methodologies on the party walls were not in place so the fire spread at a very fast rate.  That leads to the problem of how we supervise and how fire safety regulations are applied on site.  As practitioners, for us as architects, making sure that the fire elements are in place would be our top priority for inspection.  Within the building construction industry now, particularly in more complicated buildings, there is a management construction system which means that effectively the contractor is managing a whole series of subcontractors.  We are now starting to find, because of the inspection plans that BCAR has put in place, that when it comes to the builder inspecting the works, subcontractors works are all done independently and the inspections by the contractors fall between two stools.  We, as professionals, are constantly coming back and inspecting subcontractors work and condemning it which is really not our job.  Therefore, things can fall between the cracks.  The institute is starting to consider the idea of a supervision plan.  While we have an inspection plan at the moment which identifies responsibilities for professions and so on in inspection, we think the introduction of a supervision plan which puts a much stronger onus on the contractor signing off on his or her inspection responsibilities may help to reduce this potential for falling between the cracks.  Mr. Bluett may care to comment more specifically on the issue of fire.</p></speech>

For clarity, we must distinguish between older buildings and the newer buildings which were built under the building control.  There is a whole different set of items that must be looked at in relation to fire safety between those two.  I will first focus on the older buildings.  Older buildings do not have the same issues that one has with the building regulations but, for instance, with mould, one must open the window and let the air through.  There are issues with fire safety.</p><p>These issues relate to the fact the building regulations may not be appropriate for those buildings and one may need to use guidance that is more appropriate for existing buildings.  There are also issues with change of use in these buildings, which I have noted in the report.</p><p> With regard to the technical guidance document, we have two types of buildings.  The technical guidance document is excellent and as an architect I have found the whole process very useful and helpful because it helps to guide us in the right direction.  I call part B of the technical guidance document a 95% document because it has been designed to try to assist architects, designers and the building industry to build 95% of the building types we produce.  These are the non-innovative type products.  For most of our building types the technical guidance document is suitable and useful.  The issue with specialist materials becomes the problem.  We need to study these and work out whether they are suitable for purpose before they are used because they are not in the technical guidance document.</p><p> To go on to the Hackitt report, and the comparison between the UK and Ireland, there is another forum for this.  We have a system here that is quite robust from the point of view of the technical guidance document.  The fire safety certificate process is robust and very rigorous.  One gets a fire safety certificate, which identifies as safe a building that is built in line with it.  It then goes on site.  The issues I find as a practitioner are down to quality control, trying to get the right products, not having replacement of products and ensuring the people building it understand what they are building.  There are training processes that need to be put in place with regard to the people applying all of these products.  This comes back to the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, the qualification of the building contractor and CIRI's processes and controls with regard to the construction.</p><p> People think building is simple but it is not.  The building process is complex.  It needs a lot of learning and study.  We cannot just send in someone to build a wall and hope it works.  The person must understand what is being built.  The example of the fire in Kildare was given.  Someone putting in a panel must understand fire stopping needs to be put in place to stop a fire going from one side to another.  What we find in the industry are people who understand what they are doing themselves but they do not understand the big picture.  As has been mentioned, we need to understand the overall process.  The master builder, who has put himself or herself forward to construct the building, needs to understand what he or she is doing, understand that the safety of people is what is being achieved and he or she needs to get these details right.  We should not be coming on site as an architect to pick up all of these basic issues that should be understood in the construction process.</p><p> Going through the building control (amendment) regulations, BCAR, and conflicts of interest, these are areas that would take a whole day to speak about.  A mandatory reporting process was mentioned.  I do not have the qualifications to discuss these.</p><p> The design process generally is very good if it is done by people who are qualified.  The fire safety certificate process is robust.  People get a final safety certificate.  The drawings are prepared and checked.  It is important the process is implemented on site.  The transfer of information to building owners is very important and there is a process for this.  The taskforce has brought up items to try to make it stronger.  I was on the taskforce and I raised many of these issues.  Some of them were taken on board.  It is important that building owners understand their responsibilities and what they need to do to keep the building up to standard.  Buildings are technical units and they need to be provided with proper maintenance as the building goes on.</p></speech>

There is no building like Grenfell in the Dublin area and this should give people some comfort.</p> <p>  We visually inspected 650 residential tall buildings and 285 commercial tall buildings.  They included apartments, hotels, hostels and airports.  It was a fairly broad spectrum of building types.  Following this, we wrote to 63 of those identified buildings, 21 of which were residential and 42 were commercial.  We engaged with all of them and we received a response from all of them.  Seven of them merited further discussion and investigation.  The cladding of one building is in the process of being removed but this is more because of the integrity of the cladding itself as opposed to fire safety aspects.  These are the facts and figures on the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on standards, it was more with regard to technical guidance document B, which we use for compliance, and the importance of having it completed, taking account of the Grenfell inquiry.</p> <p>  Another issue related to mandatory inspections.  There were 1,000 inspections in Dublin city last year and to date we are at 1,500.  Some of this is due to additional personnel over that time, which allowed us to increase our inspection capacity.</p></speech>

With regard to new products on the market, if products do not fall within European or Irish standards the way to demonstrate compliance with the building regulations is through third-party certification.  This is the only way we can ensure products are suitable for their intended specific use and the conditions in which they are being used.</p> <p>   I do not agree that Dame Hackitt's report undermines BCAR.  It finds many of the same problems as were identified in the Irish system by the high level group in 2011, such as the lack of professional involvement throughout the construction process and the lack of accountability.  Dame Hackitt's report deals with clarity of roles and responsibilities, on which we have an entire document.  We have identified people and their responsibilities in the design and construction stages.  This is her point on the golden thread of responsibility.  Another item she raised was on change controls.  Where people change products or designs during construction it is a major risk to a project.  This is explicitly referenced in our 2014 code of practice  Significant changes on issues that relate to compliance with building regulations must be notified.  Dame Hackitt refers to health and safety legislation and, in many ways, BCAR is based on a similar model, whereby the people involved in construction and design are directly responsible for their work.  There is effective oversight inspection and a risk-based approach through the control authorities.  I am happy to discuss this in more detail on another occasion.</p></speech>

Most of all, I have had reassurance from the fire officer that neither he nor the Department is aware of any buildings which have the potential to cause a fire such as happened at Grenfell Tower.  He said fire officers had inspected the 14 remaining buildings and found no issues regarding cladding.  He said there was sometimes no clarity as to who owned a building and often no management company.  Do local authorities or statutory agencies have powers to go in and get these things done themselves?  Are these bodies ultimately responsible?  If there are fire hazards it is important they are dealt with immediately.</p> <p>  During the boom, many fine housing estates were built and there was some appalling and disgraceful construction.  The difficulty was that the local authority did not have the capacity to keep an eye on everything, notwithstanding the huge fees it got and the expansion in staff it had.  That was entirely unacceptable.  I recognise the professionalism of the architects present but when one buys a house or rents an apartment one assumes everything is right.  I agree with Ms Hegarty that transparency and accountability go to the heart of this.  Everybody believes the statutory agencies are doing their job and that professional people have done their job but when they have not, how do we know?  Where are the oversight, the vigilance and the analysis?</p> <p>  I do not have professional knowledge but I have listened to the professionals' recommendations.  I am very concerned about what they said about the Hackitt report.  More transparency and accountability are needed and there should be action if people are not doing their job.  If the Hackitt report is as critical as they say, what should we do now?  What do we have to change? </p></speech>

My first question is to the Department.  What happens now with the fire safety report?  Will there be further research to confirm the extent to which fire safety measures are in place and will this research be ongoing?</p> <p>  In light of the necessity for new buildings, does the fire department have the necessary resources to scale up its work?  I ask the same question of the architectural department.  Does it have the resources to conduct the necessary inspections?</p> <p>  Ms Hegarty spoke of a feedback loop.  What does she mean by that in regard to the Department and how will it happen?  She spoke of the physics of buildings and of dampness.  Mr. O'Mahony said residents will now have to come up with a piece of equipment to suck air out.  What is happening there?  We have always been aware of dampness in buildings but is it a growing problem as a result of changes in temperatures?  Is there more moisture as a result of climate change?  Is it related to the way buildings are designed?</p> <p>  We spoke to Ms Neary at the meeting of the Committee on Climate Action yesterday.  We spoke about renovating older housing stock and the deep retrofitting of buildings.  Does she expect this will help mitigate the problem of dampness?  Could it contribute to dampness if the physics is not properly dealt with?</p></speech>

What exclusions pertain to that?  Can the witnesses give their view on whether that bit of the legislation is outdated, given the changes in building technology?  Only Ms Hegarty responded to the question on the failure of authorities to give information at the earliest possible opportunity to residents who were affected by this.  I am thinking of the fire safety report for Millfield Manor and the fact that it took 18 months for people to get it from when the report was commissioned.</p> <p>  The information about the inspections which have been carried out was very helpful and reassuring but are there any buildings where works are required but not progressing, causing concerns for the taskforce or the fire services?</p></speech>

A subcommittee has been set up to take that work forward.  It is a charter for the future development of fire services and it will be led by the national directorate for fire and emergency management.  It will involve a significant increase in resourcing for the directorate and we are in the process of putting additional resources in place for that purpose.  It will also involve the implementation of the 63 recommendations and will not, therefore, only apply to multi-unit or multi-storey properties.</p> <p>  It was stated earlier that no regulatory change had been signalled and I wish to correct that.  There will be significant regulatory change as part of the process including, but not limited to, the question of a person having control of a building, which is what Mr. Bluett referenced.  Mr. Barry will talk about single dwellings and Ms Neary will talk about the provision of information.</p></speech>

Most of the others relate to building features or fire safety issues in buildings that were found before Grenfell Tower and are the sorts of things that can arise in buildings.  If the Deputy is asking me if there is a concern that no building has been reported that is of such serious concern that the fire service has taken the view that occupation of that building should cease, it is perhaps worth saying that from the reports I hear from fire services, as far as we can tell, while I am not able to say that there is none in the country, I have no report of the specific type of cladding that caused concern with Grenfell Tower being present.  I am not able to say there is none in the country but people do not seem to be finding it as part of this exercise.  That is worth noting.  While there is fire safety work to be done, there is no building that is the sort of concern the Deputy is asking me about.</p><p> On single dwellings and the exclusion in legislation, it is worth clarifying the particulars.  I could characterise the legislation dealing with fire safety in buildings in two ways.  The Building Control Act and the provisions under building regulations deal with the construction of buildings and their preparation for occupation.  The Fire Services Act deals with the management of that building, its operation and provisions for fire safety during the occupation of that building.  That second Act has an exclusion for houses occupied as single dwellings from those requirements and the powers of inspection and enforcement of fire services.  There is not an exclusion, however, to construct dwelling houses to meet the requirements of building regulations in the first place.</p><p> With regard to fire safety in buildings, fire services do not have powers to require people to manage fire safety in their own homes.  However, we have a significant communications exercise.  Members will be aware that last week was fire safety week when we promote fire safety, fire safety awareness and fire safe behaviours in homes.  We kick off a campaign at this time every year in which we emphasise the importance of installing and testing smoke alarms; dealing with obvious dangers in the home, including sources of ignition and smokers' materials; switching off electrical appliances and unplugging them at night; having a night-time routine; and having in place a plan in case of fire or alarm during the night or any time during the day to get family members safely out of a home, including those who may need assistance, such young, old and vulnerable members of the household.  That is the sort of advice we give to householders about fire safety in houses and homes across the country.  Given that last week was fire safety week, I am glad to have the opportunity to bring that forward.  We constantly emphasise that the most important action householders can take for fire safety for families is to install a smoke alarm.</p></speech>

A steering group was convened by Kildare County Council in conjunction with the Department and during that process, the chair met the residents on a number of occasions to explain what the committee was doing and seeking volunteers to inspect the house.  The terms of reference included carrying out a case study based on the housing estate in question.  The residents were communicated with throughout that process.</p></speech>

The document was the first of its kind.  Something similar was done in Canada a number of years before that but this brought together all available advice on how to retrofit individual houses in the right way to the right standards.  A large part of the code of practice deals with the requirement to put in ventilation when one is increasing airtightness through insulation, whether external or internal.  Specific offline studies were done on particular aspects on which we needed further information.  That is a core document in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant scheme.  The SEAI refers to it with regard to compliance with the standard recommendation.  It is the SR 54 code of practice for retrofitting existing buildings.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that this is a global issue.  The issue with combustible cladding did not start at Grenfell.  Major fires were happening approximately every four months globally before Grenfell.  It would misrepresent the position to argue that the issue is one of one rogue material finding its way onto a building.  The issue with Grenfell is not just the cladding but the way it was assembled, the location of windows, the failure of compartmentation, the inadequacy of escape routes and the fact that ventilation and lighting on alarms did not work.  There are myriad reasons which go to the root of how construction industry procurement is happening, including how the regulatory systems have been deregulated and outsourced.  I emphasise that this needs to be very broadly considered and not in some narrow way.</p> <p>  The way in which this would be paid for and resourced and the way in which enforcement will work with regard to requiring buildings to be evacuated or works to be done are live issues in many countries.  We need a broader forum where this can be actively done.  My personal view is that having invited stakeholder groups does not open up the process to the rest of the industry to enable it to know what is happening and anticipate what is coming next.  This affects how people are designing buildings.  We need a much more open system to signal what the issues are, who is providing input and what likely future paths through this will be.  I do not believe we have that at the moment.</p> <p>  What happens next is all part of it.  There will definitely be an issue with resources for these buildings.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the large number of defective buildings we already have.  We have an enormous legacy issue of defective buildings that will need to be resourced and funded in some way.  There is an information loop for the designers, the people doing remedial work and those who live in or use these buildings.  There is a broader context.</p></speech>

Numbers were sought from local authorities.</p> <p>  I will address the issue of dampness.  Building regulations are clear about ventilation, insulation and building physics.  Perhaps the committee will return to this issue.  The building energy register compiles all of the data for building energy for buildings that have grant-funded upgrades or new buildings.  It captures a large amount of data on building physics.  Two issues have become clear from the initial research done on that building energy register.  First, there is substantial non-compliance in BER certificates and this issue needs to be addressed.  Perhaps the Joint Committee on Climate Action will address that.  Second, there is an indication that there are issues with ventilation and insulation, which will have an impact on indoor air quality and people's health.  This is a substantial issue which needs to be actively addressed.  There are issues with conflicting regulations, on which work is under way.  There is also the broader issue that not much has been built, particularly houses, for the past ten years.  There has been a rapid change in regulations and a lack of upskilling, public information and technical details about these changes that people can use.  As the details that are publicly available are not up to date, people are using out-of-date information on how to put together materials on building.  It is a significant issue.</p><p>Will Mr. O'Mahony or Mr. Bluett comment please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-11a.2294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Mahony" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018101100002#O00200"><p>We were asked whether the industry has the capacity to conduct the inspections.  Until the introduction of the building control amendment regulations, as professionals, we did one inspection on a building on completion.  We signed a certificate that, from a visible inspection on a single visit, the building complied with the building regulations.  That was clearly totally inadequate at the time.  Since the introduction of BCARs, I remember taking a look at the minimum number of inspections the professionals were carrying out on a very simple house, which was 36 inspections through the construction process.  In our practice, the number would be higher than that and the inspections would be based not only on the inspection plan requirement but also on paying regular drop-in visits to the site.</p> <p>  As a professional practice with a large housing element, we deal with many dwelling houses.  At the last count, it was 26,000 dwellings.  We have specific inspection teams set up whose sole purpose is inspection.  This involves not only inspecting projects but also informing the rest of the practice as to how regulations are changing.  The bigger practitioners do this across the board.  As a profession, building inspectors are stepping up, but there are still gaps, probably in the construction side.</p> <p>  Ventilation was raised and Ms Orla Hegarty spoke about it.  In very simple terms, old buildings were leaky and cold and new buildings are sealed and warm and when one has a sealed, warm building with people breathing, cooking and so on, air must be extracted.  Our regulations should be more specific about extracting and changing the air.  Again from personal practice I find that introducing fresh air using modern system means the internal environment is amazingly different from the normal environment that we experience in old leaky houses.</p> <p>  One of the major issues is the retrofitting.  We have 2 million dwellings in the country.  While the regulations are terrific for the small but increasing number of new buildings since 2014, we then have all of the housing supply that must be retrofitted over time.  That issue must be addressed but I am not sure how that will be done, whether one offers a carrot or uses the stick.  Houses do not get built and knocked down, they last for centuries.  Commercial buildings get knocked down and replaced, but houses do not.  The next step is to look at a retrofitting system.  My colleague, Mr. Bluett, wishes to comment.</p></speech>

Transparency was mentioned.  At the end of a job, the process is to have a safety file and the chain, the golden thread, of getting that to the end user is important.  There is training required, in particular in larger developments, to ensure management companies meet the requirement to have somebody who understands the process of what the building is and is able to implement the safety element.</p> <p>  As to what happens next with the Fire Safety in Ireland report, the report made a number of recommendations.  When proposals have been prepared on these recommendations, in particular on matters such as notices on buildings and the responsible person, the RIAI will want to be able to make comments on, add to and make recommendations on them.</p> <p>  I alluded to existing buildings and the fire regulations.  The upgrading of existing buildings can be complex and difficult.  There is technical guidance on fire in place, namely, the 1994 guide to fire safety in flats, bedsits and apartments in respect of existing apartments.  That could be a basis for change of use as well in the same type of building.  Trying to implement the full rigours of the technical guidelines on older buildings is difficult, if not impossible, and very costly.  To be able to use this guidance for change of use would be important.</p></speech>

Dublin Fire Brigade has 35 members of staff in the fire prevention section.  It is a challenging area in terms of staff retention, as a number of people move on because of external promotions.  There is ongoing recruitment to maintain that number and we try our best to keep the number at that level.  We have a targeted risk-based inspection programme based on our resources.  We profile on a risk basis approach and under that, a high level of risk would be assigned to buildings where people are sleeping, such as hostels, hotels and hospitals.  We are in discussions with Dublin City Council on the issue of staffing and that process is ongoing.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked about the position when works are not progressing.  In such circumstances, we try to engage with the owner occupiers.  We have found the need, unfortunately, to go to court to ensure that people are safe in buildings and make the buildings safe.  In the past year, we served 14 fire safety notices and there were two High Court actions and 12 prosecutions.  Our ultimate idea is to engage with the stakeholders and ensure that people work with us.  Unfortunately, as the figures show, there are occasions where we have to use our powers.</p> <p>  On the question of the non-notifying of householders when action is taking place, when dealing with apartment complexes where we discover faults or fire safety issues, our procedures provide that we will deal with the owners' management companies and inform them of the type of action that will take place.  As part of that process, we try to ensure a leaflet drop for every resident is provided, outlining the action that is taking place and a range of fire safety features that should be considered both generally and while the work is being done.  The remaining issues have been addressed.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that inspection opt-outs are being sought for a substantial number of new houses.  Another substantial sector of new build housing is in the zone where the industry rate for an inspection regime is about &euro;2,000.  This certainly would not deliver the number of inspections that Mr. O'Mahony referenced in his company.</p> <p>  There is a skills shortage across the industry.  If it is anticipated that housing output will increase from 14,500 new homes last year to 25,000 new homes in the next year or two, sufficient resources to inspect these homes will not be available, unless there is some strategic approach to using resources in a targeted way.  We will be back to where we were ten or 15 years ago when inspections were visual.  It will just mean there is more paperwork attached.  The resources are not available to do eight, ten or 20 inspections on every new house.  The regime has to be rethought.</p></speech>

I do not have the exact figures to hand but I believe the Department has sanctioned in the order of 700 to 800 staff in the area of housing in the past three to four years.  Any requests that come in for additional staffing in these areas have been processed very quickly.  We have very few on hand so that if a local authority identifies a resource gap, we do what we can to plug it and to accommodate it in that way.  We are sanctioning staff.</p></speech>

There is a shortage of skilled staff in the construction industry and in the professional resources needed to carry out the inspections.</p><p>Mr. O'Mahony mentioned the 3,380 professional members in the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, who are all available to do the assigned certifier role.  We do not see that there is a significant skills shortage, or at least we have not been made aware of that in terms of the assigned certifier role or the building control amendment regulations, BCAR, role, whatever about the skills shortage on the labouring side of the industry.  We are working with the Department of Education and Skills on that.  There is an entire policy around that and the efficiencies within the industry and the move towards greater off-site construction.  I am not saying that it is perfect but there is work going on this, even though it is not our direct responsibility. </p><p> Even in the social housing realm we have been very actively promoting off-site construction.  We have developed, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, a framework of design-build contractors using off-site construction and social housing projects are pulling off that framework now.  Dublin County Council went earlier in the summer to the industry looking for expressions of interest to do off-site construction apartment building, whether it is a volumetric-type programme.  There is a significant move towards that and that is less labour intensive.</p><p> In the code of practice for inspecting and certifying buildings, which we produced as a guidance document to the introduction of BCAR back in 2014, and revised in 2016, there is a sample inspection plan for housing.  It goes through the risk assessment of how to assess the risk associated with the building, or in this case a house, by identifying the risk and the most appropriate times for inspection.  It gives an example for a non-complex dwelling.  There is guidance out there and we have been working very closely with the industry to develop that and support the process of inspection.</p></speech>

What can we do on this or is there any solution to try to help them to deal with latent defects and, indeed, to try to keep fire standards up to the mark?</p> <p>  On the individual buildings, regrettably and tragically, as Mr. Keeley has said, most of the tragedies occur in single buildings.  When an individual property is sold, does it at that stage have to have any certification that it is fire certified?  Is there any process at that point?  </p> <p>  We are now inspecting HAP properties.  As part of that inspection process, are individual houses inspected for fire certification?  Could the Department give us a quick update on the Construction Industry Register Ireland, CIRI, Bill and where that is at the moment.</p></speech>

On units changing hands or being bought and sold, the introduction of the certificate of compliance on completion, CCC, will now be sought in the initial stage when a new property is being purchased.  This is certainly an aspect of conveyancing practice.  Into the future, as those new buildings start changing hands, that CCC should travel with the building.</p></speech>

It endorses the issue and that is far as it can go with it at this point.</p></speech>

There are a lot of different things going on and as to being efficient with resources, there is a HAP regime for inspections, there is a Residential Tenancies Board regime to be ramped up for inspections and there are the BCAR inspections.  Effectively, the three of them are all looking after public safety.  There is a great opportunity here for some alignment to strategically do a standardised checklist for housing that is safe for occupation and does not necessarily need to be done by registered professionals.  A cohort of trained people could maybe pass it on if they run into difficult situations or complex issues.  The only way that this whole market can be rectified is to have a new system that looks across the board at safe housing and has an inspection regime that can be done, usually in quite a light touch way, by people who would be trained up to do that.</p></speech>

We would wholeheartedly recommend latent defects insurance, LDI, for new builds, as being a part of the system.  There is a no fault approach, it is fixed and it is sorted for the consumer.  It is sorted out separately from a legal point of view.  The consumer's interests are protected.  We would strongly support that.</p> <p>  SI 9 should apply to all new buildings.  It is a very simple fix.  What I am hearing here is that there are two cohorts.  There is a cohort of new build, which is really well regulated.  There is now a necessity to look at current buildings and try to see how we can deal with those in terms of all regulation, legally, practically and in terms of conveyancing and safety.  That is a huge ask.  That is something that needs attention as we start to press vacant buildings back into use.  There is a terrific document which the Department is about to issue called, Bringing Back Homes, which as a piece of work is very good to notify the public as to how they do this.  Within it is a whole cohort of regulation that can be quite daunting.  Addressing these sorts of issues separately from new build is important.</p></speech>

It is not within my remit to comment on some of that.  We are dealing with this practically on the ground by identifying phased approaches to remediation work.  Some of this work can take a considerable amount of time, but it allows people to develop the funding over that period of time and addressing the more safety-critical issues upfront, which is one way to approach it.</p><p>We have established a private rental unit within Dublin City Council to co-ordinate inspections across the environmental health unit and the fire service.  Thus far, 216 referrals have come from that unit relating to fire safety issues which were identified.  That is how resources are supposed to be maximised within Dublin City Council.</p></speech>
