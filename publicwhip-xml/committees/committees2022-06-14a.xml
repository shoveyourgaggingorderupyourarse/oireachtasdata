The purpose of this meeting is to discuss the position Ireland will take at the UN Biodiversity Conference, COP15, which will be held on 1 October 2022 in Kunming, China.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Deirdre Lynn, who is a scientific officer at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  She is very welcome to the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we will begin, I will read the note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  As Dr. Lynn is attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, she may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present in the committee room.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask members joining us online to confirm, prior to making their contribution, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p><p> I invite Dr. Lynn to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Lynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend.</p> <p>  I am a scientific officer with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The service is the statutory authority for nature conservation in Ireland, with a particular focus on the implementation of national, EU and international legislation, plans and policies, in particular the Wildlife Acts, the EU habitats and birds directives and the national biodiversity action plan.</p> <p>  Biodiversity represents the variety of life on earth.  It provides us with important ecosystem services such as food, pollination, soil fertility, water and climate regulation.  Globally, these services have been valued at approximately &euro;1.3 trillion annually.  However, national, regional and global assessments have all demonstrated ongoing declines in biodiversity.  Globally, we are degrading our natural assets by up to &euro;19 trillion annually.  The D&aacute;il has recognised the biodiversity crisis by declaring a biodiversity emergency in 2019.</p> <p>  How has the world responded to this crisis?  At a global level, we have the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which is the sister convention to the climate change convention and both conventions were adopted in Rio in 1992.  All the countries in the world are parties to this convention, apart from the United States and the Vatican.  Decisions are made by the Conference of the Parties, or COP.  The three objectives of the convention are the conservation of biodiversity; the sustainable use of its components, which recognises that we are part of the living fabric and need to use it to exist; and that any benefits arising will be shared equitably.</p> <p>  The  National Parks and Wildlife Service acts as the focal point for this convention.  I am the focal point for the scientific subsidiary body to the convention.  The convention is underpinned by a strategic plan and 20 global biodiversity targets, which were due to run out in 2020.  A new global biodiversity framework is being negotiated.  It was due to be adopted at COP15 in China in 2020 but due to the ongoing Covid situation, the convening of COP15 has been delayed and is likely to take place in quarter 4 of this year, with the venue still to be confirmed.  The European Union is also a party to the convention.  For this reason, all of the negotiations at COP are co-ordinated at an EU level to present a strong EU and member state position.  The Czech Republic will facilitate EU negotiations at COP15 as it will hold the EU Presidency in the second half of 2022.</p> <p>  Several drafting groups have been set up to work on EU positions, which are agreed by member states at the EU Council working party on international environmental issues.  Council conclusions currently being prepared detail the high-level EU position on the preparations for COP15.  We will circulate Council conclusions to our colleagues across government for comment.</p> <p>  Under the draft global biodiversity framework, there are currently four goals and 21 targets being negotiated.  These targets include protected area targets; restoration targets; targets for biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning; targets to reduce pollution and invasive alien species; targets to minimise the impact of climate change on biodiversity; targets for sustainable use and the elimination of incentives harmful to biodiversity; targets for business to move towards sustainable extraction and production practices; and, interestingly, a target to encourage and enable people to make responsible choices.  If we tackle overconsumption, the knock-on consequences will be significant.</p> <p>  In June, there will be another round of global negotiations in Nairobi to ensure the global biodiversity framework is sufficiently advanced for adoption at COP15 later this year.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has provided &euro;100,000 to support the running costs of this very important meeting in June.</p> <p>  The convention is underpinned by several programmes of work that cover agriculture; inland water; marine and coastal; and forest biodiversity.  There are also many cross-cutting areas of work, including climate change, sustainable use, invasive alien species and protected areas.</p> <p>  EU policy and legislation have both informed and been informed by the global agenda.  The stage has already been set for the EU ambition for the global biodiversity framework with the publication of the EU biodiversity strategy in 2020.  The strategy for 2030 is part of the European Green Deal and is very ambitious.  First, the ambition is to have at least 30% of EU land and 30% of EU sea in a protected area network.  The EU is due to publish legislation for legally binding restoration targets under the nature restoration law, which will include actions that will need to be implemented across many sectors, particularly agriculture, forestry and fisheries.  The stark reality is that we need to restore thousands of square kilometres of terrestrial land.  There is also an ambition in the EU biodiversity strategy to halt and reverse the decline of pollinators, reduce the use and harmfulness of pesticides and restore freshwater ecosystems, including 25,000 km of free-flowing rivers across the EU.</p> <p>  A whole-of-government approach will be required in relation to the nature restoration law.  The nature restoration law proposal and the national restoration plan have significant implications for a range of business units in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and other Departments, most notably the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Environment, Climate and Communications.  There may need to be consultation and-or co-ordination with other member states on specific sectoral aspects of this proposal.  These will need to be co-ordinated across government and will feed back into the overall national policy positioning.</p> <p>  All of these new and emerging policy areas need to be folded into the next and fourth national biodiversity action plan, which is being drafted.  We have had many rounds of stakeholder engagement, including our recent national biodiversity conference attended by over 600 delegates.  We hope to have the plan published in early 2023 to ensure that we consider the recommendations that arise from the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss.</p> <p>  Last week, at Ireland's second biodiversity conference, the Taoiseach said that biodiversity loss "will only be successfully tackled as an all-of-Government and all-of-society project, which will require the vigilance of planners, local authorities, agricultural advisers and all manifestations of state who have a hand in regulating interventions in our land, rivers, lakes, seas and air."  The National Parks and Wildlife Service, with the support of the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, is working hard with colleagues across government and society to act now for nature.</p></speech>

A maximum of two hours and 40 minutes remain in this session.  I propose that members take two minutes in which to ask questions thus ensuring everybody gets a chance to contribute.  We may have an opportunity to have a second and third round should members have questions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#B00400"><p>I thank Dr. Lynn for her opening statement, much of which focused on future plans and developments.  I will ask about the current state of affairs.  We keep hearing one word, that is, "implementation", and we have heard at various stages about the resourcing of the NPWS.  Is the NPWS adequately resourced given the impending extension of its mandate and the types of new and complex planning applications that will be submitted?  Does Dr. Lynn envisage that its role will change in the time ahead?</p> <p>  On 2 June, this committee heard from the European Commissioner for Energy.  There is a clear stated policy to fast-track planning for renewables projects and perhaps there is a rationale for doing so.  Is Dr. Lynn concerned about that policy's potential implications for biodiversity?  What needs to be done to ensure we get the best results possible?</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Lynn to reflect on the current state of our inland waterways and rivers.</p><p>I know we will have targets in future.  However, Ireland has been going completely in the wrong direction as I understand it.  I ask Dr. Lynn to give her thoughts on how we might address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Lynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#C00200"><p>I very much welcome recent strategic plan for the renewal of the NPWS.  I have been working in the service for almost 20 years.  It has been a long time coming.  There will be an injection of 60 staff.  Many of them will backfill positions we lost since about 2008.  When considering biodiversity, it is important to look at responsibilities across Government and see where we can increase resources and capacity across Government to tackle this very wide-reaching agenda.  The biodiversity agenda touches almost every Department.  We need good education in schools and universities.  We need to address the crossover between biodiversity and health.  Obviously, biodiversity greatly supports the climate agenda.  Biodiversity meets adaptation measures.  It is a front-line defence against climate change with the ability for natural systems to sequester carbon and regulate water supply at times of heavy rainfall. I reiterate that we need to look at responsibilities across Government.  We also need to look at the internal structures in the NPWS to ensure that we are delivering on our legal responsibilities, particularly regarding European legislation.  That exercise still needs to take place.  We need to look across our structures and see where we need to inject additional resources.</p> <p>  I understand that we need to embrace renewable energy as part of achieving our climate goals.  However, we still need to adhere to legislation that is in place.  Those principles still apply.  I ask the Deputy to remind me of his final question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#C00300"><p>It was about the waterways.  I am particularly interested in the Boyne Estuary SPA and the Boyne and Blackwater SAC.  They are beside me and there are controversial plans.  I ask about the quality of our waterways, the current trends and what might be done to address them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Lynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#C00400"><p>We submitted a report under the habitats directive in 2019.  The biggest pressure on biodiversity related to pollution arising from agricultural practices.  We also see this in EPA reports on water quality.  Hopefully, the next round of river basin management planning will address many of these issues and will be able to scale up its programme of measures for our fresh waters.  In the context of biodiversity in some areas, we need even higher water quality than is required by the broader framework directive.  In some areas we will need to focus our efforts to ensure that we retain some of our really precious habitats, particularly some of our marl lakes and also some of our species that require very clean water, especially freshwater pearl mussel.  We certainly have considerable work ahead of us to ensure we continue to improve the condition of our freshwater systems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#C00500"><p>I thank Dr. Lynn for her opening statement.  I return to a very worthy point raised by Deputy O'Rourke about river basin management.  Dr. Lynn has responsibility for a section within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Resourcing of our local authorities in the context of river basin management is major concern.  This goes beyond the point Deputy O'Rourke made regarding the general capacity of our local authorities, including mine, Fingal County Council.  In Swords, the Ward river valley, which feeds directly into the Broadmeadow Estuary SAC, is of serious concern to me.  The State seems to be heavily reliant on volunteerism.  While that might be great and some wonderful people do some wonderful work, I have concerns about the Department's and local authorities' ability to manage our river basin areas appropriately.  It also has a significant knock-on effect on water quality.  The ability of flora and fauna to thrive in such areas is stymied by waste litter and other issues.  I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising that matter.</p> <p>  My other points about the Department and the NPWS relate to comments Dr. Lynn made about targets.  I refer to building regulations and the clearance of natural habitats, including hedgerows, mature and even semi-mature trees for the purposes of development.  In many other countries, I am thinking specifically of Denmark, local authorities work with developers in order to retain such flora and fauna as part of developments and tend to integrate them into any development taking place.  My experience in Swords and Dublin 15, which is the fastest-growing community in Europe, would be that they simply clear fields and build away.  I also have slight concerns that our green spaces are grass only with perhaps a few trees here and there.  The State needs to step up and put in flower beds, bushes and perennial flowers to enhance the biodiversity of a local community. </p> <p>  My other two questions are related to building regulation.  Regarding sustainable development of our housing stock, we have an over-reliance on concrete.  There are regulation issues relating to the use of timber, structural or otherwise.  I would like to hear Dr. Lynn's comments on that.</p> <p>  My final question is on the eradication of fossil fuel heating sources in A-rated and B-rated homes.  I recently visited a new housing estate in my constituency and was delighted to see that the houses were A2-rated, including things I would like to see becoming normalised such as electric vehicle charging ports and communal spaces.  However, I was very concerned that they had gas boilers.  This is something Senator Higgins has referred to on many occasions in the committee in the last couple of years.  We are building in something with a lifespan of 20 or 30 years beyond our 2030 and 2050 targets.  I am concerned that we are unnecessarily reliant on fossil fuels for high-energy-rated properties.  We are building in the future use of fossil fuels for the purposes of home heating.</p></speech>

Dr. Lynn is from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is unfair to put a question relating to boilers to her, but she may feel free to comment if she wishes.  I do not want to veer from the agenda, which is biodiversity and the conference in October.</p><p>The Deputy asked a number of questions that are relevant so I will turn to Dr. Lynn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Lynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#D00200"><p>I will do my best.  I am not familiar with many of the building regulations.  We are building up capacity within the local authorities with regard to biodiversity officers.  We hope to roll out biodiversity officers across all local authorities in the coming years.  I think there are only five biodiversity officers at the moment.  Hans Visser is the biodiversity officer in Fingal County Council, which recently published a biodiversity plan.  Mr. Visser noted that the council only has funding for a portion of the actions it needs to take so we need to look at our resourcing to make sure biodiversity action is undertaken at the local level.  We provide some funding to biodiversity and heritage officers but we need to look to all areas to pull in that funding to make sure we take on board local action.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned green spaces.  Many local authorities are embracing the all-island pollinator plan.  My preference would be to appreciate that we have amenity spaces.  Obviously, we have spaces where the youth are playing football or Gaelic games but there should also be areas where there is space for nature.  They do not need to have massive seed mixes from God knows where.  They can just be left.  We do not need to have everything so neat and tidy.  That is what I would really like to see.  I would like to see our communities functioning for different purposes.  It is not that I want everything necessarily to be complete wilderness but there should be those little corners and spaces within our urban environments where nature is allowed to thrive.</p> <p>  Local authorities have built up resources relating to climate action.  There are climate action regional offices.  It would be great to see more of a focus on biodiversity even within the climate agenda.  All local authority staff have had mandatory training relating to climate change.  I think they all had about an hour and half of such training.  I believe there may be moves to try to develop a similar programme for biodiversity and water.  Making sure staff in local authorities really understand the issues and solutions they produce for biodiversity at local level would be really excellent.  I look forward to seeing this rolled out in the coming years.  </p> <p>  I recently purchased a home with a BER of A3, which involves air to heat.  We are now seeing financial institutions and companies starting to green their portfolios.  I managed to get a really good interest rate based on my BER.  It is encouraging that financial institutions are also trying to green their portfolios.  There is an EU taxonomy regulation and there will be a dedicated act for biodiversity that should be signed off within the coming year.  A lot of these financial institutions would have to make disclosures relating to directions for biodiversity so that is very encouraging.  A lot is happening at EU level.</p></speech>

They are sent around to colleagues in other Departments.  This is where they have gone to at the moment.  There are several EU drafting groups.  We do not have the capacity to be involved in many of these EU drafting groups.  Some EU countries have huge resources with lots of staff they can put in place to develop the EU positions.  The EU Presidency steps in and works hard to bring on the EU positioning.  It is quite difficult for a small country to engage at that level.</p></speech>

I do not know whether other people struggle the way I do with the enormity of the challenge facing us.  In terms of mobilising people, if people feel a bit overwhelmed - it involves climate, pollution, species, extraction, farm methods and consumer choices, etc. - it all becomes a bit overwhelming for them.  Are there ways in which we can make it more concrete for Irish people as to what the ambition is?  If it is broken into so many silos, it is hard to mobilise people.  There is goodwill out there and you see people rewilding bits of their gardens.  They do not know to what extent that contributes.  Is it vitally important compared to being more sensitive in respect of what they buy in the supermarket versus buying an electric vehicle?  Does Dr. Lynn think that the advent of circular economy legislation, the attempt to look at sectors as a whole, redesigning the way we deliver various services and scrutinising the materials, methodologies and consumer choices constitute a way of bringing this into one programme in which consumers and the food sector can participate?  I am a bit overwhelmed by all the silos and the different inspectors and many ordinary people, particularly businesspeople, will feel that way.</p> <p>  How do we plan to mobilise change?  Dr. Lynn seems to say that we are going to sign up to a lot of ambitions but she does not seem to know what the policy tools that will be used to implement them will be.  I know this is a biodiversity emergency and we have to set targets but to some degree, that is reversing the usual approach of policy where you have a fair idea of what your policy instruments can deliver, and then you set a stretch target relating to whatever instruments you are going to put into the field.  Perhaps I am wrong but we seem to be doing it in reverse.  We are signing up to the targets and then wondering whether there will be policy tools to get us there.  It comes down to whether we are evolving the toolbox of funding streams, incentives, levies - whatever it is.  This is what is missing in this.</p></speech>

Regarding being overwhelmed, I am often overwhelmed by the sheer number of things we should be working on to address the climate and biodiversity crisis.  In terms of trying to break it down for people, it is very important that we engage local communities.  There is an appetite out there among local communities.  They are willing to get involved.  Once they are talking about it at local level, they stop feeling powerless.  We are working with the Community Foundation for Ireland.  We have co-funded some of its work under its environment and nature fund.  This is to link up communities with ecologists to help communities to develop their own local community plans for biodiversity.  About 117 of these community plans are being drafted.  The next stage is for us to put some funding into implementing some of the measures associated with these plans.</p><p> On some of the other elements to do with the circular economy, the next generation is quite versed in this.  I have a six-year-old daughter and she is already coming to me and commenting on recycling and turning off the taps.  It is definitely sinking in for that generation.</p><p> With regard to how we plan to mobilise change and whether we are signing up to targets without having the means of implementation, the EU biodiversity strategy states we should use existing instruments to achieve the targets.  This is where we really need to look at how we spend our money.  A few years ago, I commissioned UCD to undertake research on biodiversity expenditure across government.  The results show that approximately 10% of funding for biodiversity comes through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Approximately 78% goes through the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This is where we need to focus.  We need to look at how the money is spent and whether it is being spent effectively.  There is a move towards more results-based approaches.  We are using a lot of EU funding through the LIFE programmes to test and pilot work which is farmer led.  We state what we want the habitat to look like and that when it does we will provide the payments.  It is results based.  We are looking to scale up a lot of this work.</p><p> The amount needed for restoration is significant.  We need to look at private investment to support the restoration agenda.  We are exploring this.  We have set up the peatland finance Ireland initiative which will look at how we will be able to mobilise private finance for peatland restoration in particular.  Many private companies are very interested in getting involved in the restoration agenda.  We need to build the mechanisms.  We need to make sure we have a code so that everything is transparent and what we do is scientifically underpinned.  It is very important for us to work with local landowners.</p></speech>

These are key issues.  It needs to be made attractive for people to do these things.  People need to be informed of the downside and, in cases, non-compliant activity needs to be levied.  How far down the road are we to having a set of these instruments?</p></speech>

In the National Parks and Wildlife Service in particular many of us have had private industry come to us from different angles expressing an interest in this and asking how to do it.  That is why we have started the initiative.  The important point is that many of us are ecologists and conservationists; we are not financial people.  We need to be able to work not only with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but also the Department of Finance to have them support us.</p></speech>

It forces it into the mainstream.  It is not the ecologists speaking to people.  It is when it is forced into the financial context that every sector is under an obligation to come to terms with it.</p></speech>

My first question is on the European Green Deal and the ambitious target of protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030.  We have signed up to this on a global and European level but my understanding is that we have not signed up to it at national level.  Does that need to happen?  Will it be included in the upcoming biodiversity action plan?  Is it being looked at?  Unless the targets are set, it will be very difficult to achieve.</p> <p>  I would like to know more about the 10% that is highly protected.  There is 30% protected and 10% highly protected.  The next aspect I want to discuss comes back to targets.  The committee has been through setting targets for climate emissions on a legislative basis.  Would it be a good idea to have something similar for biodiversity?  If it is not in legislation, it is more difficult to get it through, particularly for future Governments.  We do not know what will happen down the road.</p> <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, fund was expanded recently to include biodiversity measures.  There is a considerable amount of money in the fund and it tends to be used for climate emission measures.  Is the Department looking to utilise some of this funding?</p></speech>

The targets set in the EU biodiversity strategy are the targets set for EU levels.  It is 30% of EU land and 30% of EU sea.  This does not necessarily translate to the national level.  We will need to discuss internally in the National Parks and Wildlife Service how we tackle it.  A lot of work is being done on marine protected areas.  I hope we will expand the coverage of our marine protected areas considerably.  We will also need to have a lot of discussions about terrestrial land.  The Deputy may be familiar with some of the EU protected areas.  There are special areas of conservation and special protection areas for birds.  It does not need to be that level of protection.  We can have other systems.  We can have contract agreements for example.  We could enter into contract agreements with Bord na M&oacute;na and other public landowners.  There are other effective conservation measures.  There are other areas where we could say we are doing X, Y and Z and, therefore, technically we can include it in our figures.  We have to work out a lot of this.  We have to start making the pledges that will be examined in 2023.</p> <p>  With regard to the 10% that is supposedly strictly protected, these are carbon-rich ecosystems.  This means no activity should take place in these areas unless specifically for the conservation of the habitats on the site.  We will look at some of our carbon-rich habitats and bog areas and possibly salt marshes.  There are some other areas that would be quite carbon rich that we should consider for strict protection.</p> <p>  With regard to targets in legislation, we have our national biodiversity plan.  We are trying to get some kind of legislative statutory footing for the biodiversity action plan.</p><p>This would at least give it more teeth.  We are also seeking to improve the governance of the biodiversity action plan.  It is currently overseen by an interdepartmental group but I hope that we may be able to report to a higher level in the next round so that there will be a greater onus on people when we look for progress on actions in the plan because not all of these actions are undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Many of them are undertaken by our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, its forest service, the Environmental Protection Agency and many other Departments.  It is very important that there be a little bit more political scrutiny.  We also have a watchdog, the National Biodiversity Forum, which is a multi-stakeholder group that oversees the implementation of the plan and makes recommendations to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  We have increased funding for that forum to make sure that it functions properly, has a functioning secretariat and can really progress and give good recommendations.</p><p> On the NORA fund, correct me if I am wrong but the Bord na M&oacute;na rehabilitation scheme was originally funded from the climate action fund.  It may possibly have been passed over to the NORA fund but the &euro;108 million for the rehabilitation of post-production Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands is now being funded by the EU resilience fund.  We should all be looking at all of the available funds to ratchet up our restoration agenda.</p></speech>

I will pick up on a couple of the wider framing issues.  The legislative issue Dr. Lynn mentioned with regard to putting the biodiversity plan on a solid statutory basis is really important.  Things like the pollinator plan also need more teeth.  Dr. Lynn might comment on things like that.  We could then move from these things being aspirational to being very solidly reflected in design.</p> <p>  I was struck by what Dr. Lynn said about 10% of the funding for biodiversity coming through the National Parks and Wildlife Service while 78% comes through the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Do we need a little bit more to go through the National Parks and Wildlife Service?  The &euro;108 million for the rehabilitation scheme seems very small when we consider the &euro;600 million given out in jet kerosene tax reliefs in Ireland.  I am talking about scaling up.  It comes back to the idea of the mechanisms.  Dr. Lynn has mentioned that there are investors and so on and that a financial mechanism in respect of this work is being created but I am concerned that, in waiting to create this financial mechanism, we may not be doing what we can in the immediate and short term, when those actions are needed.  I am talking about public leadership on this issue with, perhaps, space for investors and about the need for scaling up.  Will Dr. Lynn comment on the issue of not just rehabilitation, but also rewetting and full restoration of peatlands so that there is no further degradation?  This strikes me as something that can either do good or do harm.  </p> <p>  I have a concern about over-reliance on the agriculture frame, even though it is important.  I refer to the carbon farming frame.  We might end up in a situation where we are measuring the protection of areas but solely in terms of carbon units.  Ecological care is slightly harder to measure but it is really important.  I am talking about the biodiversity piece.  Will Dr. Lynn comment on the importance of ecological care, biodiversity work and not just considering units of trees that may store carbon in 15 years' time but forests and areas of rich biodiversity and the role that they play?  Will she comment on the importance of making sure that these issues are not sublimated?  I am really interested because these are really important frames in terms of what we can do now and what could be done now, were &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million more put into peatlands, for example.</p> <p>  The National Parks and Wildlife Service and its resources must be strengthened to make sure it has independence and the required resources with regard to staff and so on.  That would be really useful.  There has been some engagement and a review on that issue.  Where is that going?</p> <p>  That complements another issue that has come up a lot in this committee's meetings, the issue of things like environmental impact assessments.  There is an under-resourcing with regard to ecologists, people who can deliver that work.  That is one of the reasons for the bottleneck.  It is not that we should be doing fewer environmental impact assessments.  We have even had wind energy companies tell us that they just want the area to be better resourced so that they can be carried out more efficiently.</p> <p>  I have two last points.  One relates to the part sound pollution, sonar and seismic activity in marine protected areas, MPAs, play in terms of biodiversity protection.  The other point is really important for right now, in June.  As Dr. Lynn has said, there are new global negotiations in Nairobi.  There seems to be a big international debate.  One piece relates to the protection of 30% of land and sea areas.  I am concerned that a conflict is being allowed to develop with regard to these 30% targets being achieved through working with different partners, including commercial partners, as Dr. Lynn mentioned, and the possibility of an effective land grab from indigenous peoples.  We know that indigenous people make up 5% of the global population but protect 80% of the world's biodiversity and 25% of the land.  We are talking about Nairobi, which is in Kenya, where Masai people live.  We are now seeing Masai people in Tanzania being evicted from their ancestral lands to allow those lands to become a conservation park, which will also be a hunting park for those who might bankroll it.  How do we resolve those tensions?  Can Ireland, which does not have as much tension in that regard, be a constructive voice on the issue within the international negotiations on the role of indigenous persons and protection?</p></speech>

The pollinator plan the Senator mentioned is an amazing plan.  It provides excellent guidelines for different sectoral interests.  There has been a keen uptake.  There has also been support from some in private industry, such as SuperValu.  The pollinator plan was mainly drafted by Professor Jane Stout in Trinity College and the National Biodiversity Data Centre so it is not specifically a Government plan.  We sit on the steering committee and support it where we can.  It is possibly something we need to think about in the future.  I do not want to detract from the plan because it is doing really well.  To give credit where credit is due, it has done an excellent job.</p> <p>  On the bottlenecks, the Senator's observations were very interesting, particularly with regard to ecologists and to peatlands.  Restoring peatlands is quite complicated.  You have to make sure you have a really good rehabilitation and restoration plan.  That will involve hydrologists, ecohydrologists and engineers at the very start.  We do not have enough ecohydrologists who understand the interplay between elements of the water story, such as groundwater and the movement of water, and the ecology itself well enough to ensure that we are rehabilitating in the proper way.  If you gave us hundreds of millions tomorrow to ensure we had really good restoration plans, it could still be quite tricky to scale up.  That relates to raised bogs.  The situation is even more complex for blanket bogs with regard to their topography and very degraded systems that have been overgrazed for a long time.</p><p>There are complicated landowner systems as well.  It is complex to tease out and work through and that is what we are trying to do through the EU LIFE programme, Wild Atlantic Nature.  There is so much community involvement there, working with partners like Coillte and private investors as well.  They are trialling, testing and seeing what works on the ground and how to have that community buy-in, which is very important.  We probably have the machinery because there has been so much machinery taking the peat out of the ground that there is probably machinery and contract workers that could help with the restoration.  We are at a scientific support bottleneck.  Maybe we need to look elsewhere, to other EU countries, to try to bring in the skills we need to support this restoration agenda, particularly for bogs.</p><p> On supporting biodiversity and making sure it is also considered to be a common benefit, we are trying to have a biodiversity score and to work on that.  I refer to water also because the three are all interlinked.  We are working with Intel on a pilot restoration project in the Wicklow uplands.  Intel is interested in water and in seeing how much water will be restored if a bog is restored.  It is about linking all of those together and making sure that when we report back we can say what sort of emissions have been reduced, how biodiversity has improved and, where relevant, how much water has been stored.  Private investors are interested in all of those, for different reasons.  They have to make various disclosures under different processes and it is important for them to show what they are doing for biodiversity.  We are ensuring that we are trying to develop those scores at the same time.</p><p> The questions of sonar and the MPAs are probably outside of my area of expertise.  The Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD, is good at producing a lot of guidance and documents and there is a guidance document on underwater noise.  A lot of these documents will be taken through in the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which is known as the OSPAR Convention, and through EU channels as well.  I am sure our colleagues in our marine section are dealing with a lot of that.</p><p> The matter of indigenous peoples is an interesting one.  From the beginning the CBD has involved the views of the indigenous people in local communities.  There is a whole article in the convention dedicated to that and to making sure they are involved in all aspects of decision-making.  It will be interesting to see what will be brought up in Nairobi on what has happened in Kenya recently and on how we deal with a lot of those conflicts.  I know they are very different situations but even in Ireland landowners need to be respected and we need to be able to talk to them and to explain to them the opportunities that are potentially there for them.  Everything has changed, particularly in the potential for carbon farming and the opportunities available to landowners.  They are starting to think in a different way and it will be an interesting next ten years in how all of this evolves.</p></speech>

The key thing for me is the 60 new staff she mentioned and the additional funding of &euro;55 million, which will have enormous benefits for the NPWS.  I know there will be an internal review to improve the service that is there.  I want to compliment Dr. Lynn and her colleagues within the NPWS for the work they do on a daily basis.  Its remit is quite broad, as Dr. Lynn outlined in her opening statement, but I want to touch on a few matters.</p> <p>  One of the issues that have been mentioned was the MPAs and the special protection areas, SPAs.  That was interesting to me because I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire, a coastal constituency, and one where we are familiar with the SPAs.  There has to be a balance between the SPAs and other uses of land adjacent to the SPAs.  We need to find that balance in order to try to make progress on various schemes.</p> <p>  I was glad to hear Dr. Lynn's emphasis on biodiversity.  The pollination corridors are a key function for some of the Tidy Towns groups.  I know that some officials in the local authorities, such as Anne Murray, the biodiversity officer in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, are keen on promoting them but we can never get enough of them.  I hear what Dr. Lynn is saying about open spaces and Deputy Alan Farrell referred to that as well.  They cannot all be manicured to within an inch of their lives either.  We have to let nature grow and we have to protect bees and other wildlife, such as birds, which Dr. Lynn referenced.  How does Dr. Lynn envisage that we can expand pollinating corridors and other such initiatives to ensure that is a crucial element in the next national biodiversity action plan?  We need to see progress being made, not just in rural areas but in urban areas as well.  In Dublin in particular we need to see greater progress on that.  I also agree with Dr. Lynn that there is great buy-in from the public on this.  They want to be informed so they can co-operate on and facilitate this, be that in their back garden, their estate or their community.</p> <p>  I mentioned biodiversity and Dr. Lynn will probably be familiar with Killiney Hill.  I have spoken here several times about the red squirrel project that was launched in 2015.  It was quite innovative at the time but again, local authorities are supported in this way to try to encourage greater biodiversity and protect certain species.  Dalkey Island has an Arctic tern colony and I know the NPWS has been greatly involved in that.</p> <p>  Dr. Lynn mentioned water quality and rivers.  We have to make a greater effort to the ensure the quality of water in our rivers.  They have improved in recent years but things like missed connections, particularly in urban areas, are a big issue.  It is amazing what one missed connection can do to the quality of a river in an urban area.  Dr. Lynn might speak to that point.</p> <p>  We need to see greater progress on reforestation too.  We need to protect the forests we have.  Again I am speaking from an urban perspective because we need to ensure we do everything we can under the next plan to safeguard the forests we enjoy, which are used by the public as great amenities.  I thank Dr. Lynn for her presentation.</p></speech>

Pollination corridors are important in an urban setting and equally so across the country.  We need this green architecture across agricultural systems as well and it is important that we maintain our hedgerows.  We have a heterogenous landscape.  We are a farming nation, which I understand, and we need to produce food but we also need to make space for nature and to allow species to be able to move across the landscape.</p><p>Under the auspices of the next CAP strategic plan, I hope, therefore, that much more space will be made for nature in agricultural systems and that these types of connections will be made, especially in the face of climate change.  Species may have particular areas that they live in because of a specific climate envelope, and if that is shifted, then species may also need to shift.  Species must be able to move through and permeate the landscape, so it is important that we have all these collectivities and green architecture in place.</p><p> At the local level in urban areas, regarding embracing the pollinator plan, it has been encouraging just to see the increased level of awareness.  I also noticed that along all the motorways there are little signs for bees.  I drove up and down from Wexford recently, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is leaving the verges of the roads uncut for much of the summer to facilitate pollinators.  It is great to see that as well.  As I said, we provide funding to the heritage and biodiversity officers for local actions.  Many of the actions that are funded relate to pollinator actions.</p><p> Turning to the reafforestation, we have one of the lowest rates of native woodland cover in Europe.  I think it is running at less than 2% of native woodland, and this aspect must be addressed.  Through the land use review process, we should look across Ireland and exploring where we should focus our efforts.  I refer in particular to alluvium woodlands.  Many alluvial soils in this context would benefit from being wooded.  We need to protect our older oak woodlands and tackle invasive species.  We must also expand our complement of native woodlands.  Equally, regarding the monoculture of Sitka spruce plantations, I appreciate that it is a crop that we need for wood products, but these plantations must be sited in appropriate areas and certainly not on peatlands.  </p><p> The land use review referred to in the programme for Government is a good opportunity for us to come together and to look across the landscape and examine how we live in this landscape, in particular, how people live and how we should be live in harmony with nature within the landscape.  I say that because it is important for us all.  No sector should be polluting.  We really need to look at the common good in this regard.  This is what is important and what should be considered.  I am always very interested when I hear politicians talk about progress and growth, because I do not know what that means if it is not for the common good.  What is progress?  Is progress represented by certain big industries making lots of money?  I do not think that is progress.  Progress is when the common good is considered and that the fact that we all have the right to live in a healthy environment.  </p><p> It is great to see the red squirrels on Killiney Hill; I saw one.  It is always a joy to see that flash of red running in front of you.  I saw one in Wexford last weekend as well and your heart just skips a beat.  It is also great to see the pine marten population expanding and controlling the grey squirrel population.  When we get things back in balance, sometimes nature starts to fix itself.  Therefore, it is great to see the red squirrels-----</p></speech>

I apologise for arriving late to the meeting.  I echo what others have said, and welcome the NPWS review having been done and recommended increased funding and a strengthened role for that agency concerning wildlife crime.  I would be interested to hear, however, whether Dr. Lynn thinks that the service will have the ability to undertake those types of investigations and have the required authority in this regard when it comes to wildlife crime, particularly if that means investigating another organisation in the State.  An example would be what we have seen happen with Emo Court, where the OPW disturbed a bat roost without the necessary derogation licence and then got a retrospective licence from the NPWS.  Therefore, given what we have seen recently in that case, I am concerned about whether the NPWS believes that it will be able to take on other arms of the State, if those organisations are in breach of the habitats directive and the Wildlife Acts.</p></speech>

I could not comment further than that.  I apologise.</p></speech>

Regarding the opening statement and what was said about a-whole-of-government approach, my query again is whether Dr. Lynn believes that the NPWS will be able to go to those other Departments to ensure there is such an approach.  One example concerns rodenticide, and its use and impact, particularly on the barn owl project, but also on other raptors.  Despite this impact, the CAP encourages the use of bait boxes containing rodenticide, even if the farmer knows there are barn owls living on the land.  In this context, will the NPWS be able to bring about a coherent policy that embraces the work of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and what we are trying to achieve with the NPWS?</p></speech>

I have seen, possibly since about 2019, biodiversity creeping up the agenda in other Departments.  They are really starting to listen.  We are having many more cross-departmental meetings.  There is much more respect for the biodiversity agenda.  Interestingly, it may be the climate agenda that has spearheaded the way in respect of this agenda infiltrating awareness and achieving a whole-of-government approach to an issue.  We are coming along on the tails of that development and pointing out that we are here too and that we are all part of this climate agenda.</p> <p>  Therefore, when we consider that we have more resources and that other Departments are listening, and when we also identify the capacity needs across other Departments and, hopefully, try to encourage upskilling in those Departments in respect of biodiversity, I think we will all then be part of the same conversation.  It will, however, take time.  Possibly, we need a little more buy-in from some Departments.  The Department of Health, for example, has had a massive agenda of its own to deal with in recent years in the context of Covid-19, but there are also important crossovers between a healthy environment and health issues and, therefore, trying to build up expertise in health and education will also be important for us.</p></speech>

It is possible to walk down to any high street store and buy them cheaply.  I have asked for a public awareness campaign, and I think the Minister of State is receptive to it.  Putting aside the fact that the agriculture industry will say that it needs these chemicals, surely they should not be available to ordinary domestic households.  I say that because when I speak to many people, they are not aware of the damage these chemicals can do in respect of biodiversity.  I mention this in the context of the local authority level as well.  Is there a need-----</p></speech>

What is Dr. Lynn's sense of the appetite that is there to review very long-standing national legislation?  I am thinking of the Arterial Drainage Act 1945, which I looked at recently, and I found a paper written by a young researcher in the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, named Richard Bruton who explored the matter in depth.  I find he is sitting opposite me now, and he might wish to contribute on the point.</p> <p>  The Arterial Drainage Act was placed on the Statute Book primarily to facilitate the draining of land for agriculture.  It is fair to say that the impact of the Arterial Drainage Act is that the ability of much of our land to hold on to its water has been compromised.  It has led to much downstream flooding, including flash flooding.  We know this is an issue with the management of flooding and we must consider it in that way but I am also thinking of biodiversity.  There must be serious implications for biodiversity in this country, particularly in wetter land, due to the Arterial Drainage Act.  It is 51 years since the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.  It does not seem consistent to me that we would have an Act - a pillar of the Statute Book - that requires us to drain so much land annually.  We spend much time doing so as well and it seems much of that money could be turned over to biodiversity restoration instead of investing it in draining land.  I am interested to hear Dr. Lynn's views of that, if she has any.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Lynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#J00400"><p>From a biodiversity perspective, I am very much in favour of natural systems where possible, including natural flood plains.  Since time began, nature has been holding and releasing water.  That is my personal view, although I appreciate there are other reasons for the legislation.  We might hear Deputy Bruton's views on the matter.</p> <p>  We must assess much of what we do and, in particular, the costs we put in versus the benefits we get.  We must value the ecosystem services that biodiversity gives us in water retention in particular with this instance.  We must consider such a cost-benefit analysis.  I understand the sensitivities around households or urban areas being flooded.  However, and possibly as part of the land use review, we should be looking at all of this, including watershed systems and where water is held.  We should start from the head waters in the mountains and ensure our blanket bogs are in good order so they can retain water before it comes into our lowland systems as well.</p> <p>  Under the climate action plan, there are actions relating to the rewetting of agricultural peatlands.  We know we must go back to a system of rewetting to ensure we store carbon within our systems as well.  We must look at all of this holistically.</p></speech>

There may have been actions related to this in that plan but I cannot quote them at this point.  It is something for the Office of Public Works in discussion not just with us but across several other Departments, and possibly in the land use review process.</p></speech>

Is that a provocation?  Looking at a programme of drainage in a cost-benefit analysis comes down to what we count as costs versus what we count as benefits.  The reality is that if in ten years we price carbon at &euro;100 per tonne, a hectare of land devoted to beef farming, for example, where margins are extremely low, would be tiny next to the &euro;400 per hectare carbon impact.  The issue is how to measure that and whether it factors into the costs and benefits that a farmer looks at, or, indeed, the policymaker.  The difficulty we have is we are not looking at this in a sufficiently holistic way in order to take account of the carbon impacts as well.  The logic is that we pay farmers to switch the use of their land and take a different view.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be taking a similar view when it assesses different schemes for support.  If we just look at the very narrow silos I referred to earlier, we tend to become blind to those wider impacts.</p> <p>  That is why I strongly favour integrating the way we approach challenges like this into the sort of circular thinking that considers how to design the advantage and pay to make it happen.  The reality is that in ten years, other sectors of the economy will be expending &euro;1,000 per tonne for carbon abatement, which could be done very profitably by many in the rural communities and provide a huge alternative income source to them.  We must be imaginative in developing the instruments for that to happen.  Those instruments are not proceeding as quickly as we are signing up to ambitions.  We must devote more to getting those financial and economics people into the room with the likes of Dr. Lynn in order to design those policies rather than having them sitting in the Departments of Finance or Agriculture, Food and the Marine, or wherever they are.</p></speech>

I have a similar perspective to Deputy Bruton on where things are going but a slightly different perspective of how to approach it.  The finance actors and others are very much already there and moving.  What is really important is that public ideas and policy goals can be placed centre stage in order that they are not lost.</p><p>It is something we need to be aware of because while the distinction is not as clear in Ireland, it is important internationally.  Indigenous peoples and local communities are not necessarily the same as landowners.  If we use the term "landowner" as shorthand for indigenous peoples, it is problematic.  There are many industries that need to deliver on carbon impact abatement.  We are seeing very large international land grabs by massive investment firms because there is a market that they correctly see coming - and it is coming - for carbon.  I do not think they are the people who need motivating.  They are there already.  I do not know the detail of the Intel project; it sounds really interesting.  It is also really important that any carbon sequestration that companies engage in is not done to allow them to expand areas of their business, for example, data centres.  I do not know if that is happening.  Our national targets in carbon emission reductions need to be achieved.  It is imperative that public land in particular, and even semi-private public land and other land, is used as part of the national carbon abatement process.  We should also look at the jobs that we can create and support through that in terms of ecological care, rather than simply motivating the market.  The market is already motivated.  For me, the question is whether our other biodiversity and ecological goals will really be delivered and whether we are doing all that we can with the land that we, as a State, can access.  I think that is important.  That is where the tension will be.  There are huge areas of biodiversity that have been protected by indigenous people.  For countries that want to hit their 30% protection target, the easy thing to do is to relabel a whole area of indigenous land - with a commercial partner - as being a biodiversity protection zone that can be commercially marketed.  It is a real tension.  The good thing is that everybody realises that we need to protect land.  How it is done and the approach taken are really important.  That is where having a public leadership vision is important.  I hope that we scale that up.</p><p> I also ask Dr. Lynn to comment on invasive species and the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  The SDGs, and particularly those that focus life on land and life on water and goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, have really interesting targets around biodiversity and habitat protection.  Invasive species is an issue.  The protection of the native honeybee is a measure that we are currently considering in the Seanad at the moment.  It seems to me to fit within those SDGs.  I ask Dr. Lynn to comment on addressing invasive species and the other SDG targets, as well as on the capacity that we need to increase in respect of environmental impact assessments, the habitats directive, the birds directive and the water directive.  Is there potential to have the same kind of tools that we are using there to begin to incorporate and consider some of the SDG targets on biodiversity alongside that work?  Could we upskill in that area in terms of the kind of ecological and environmental impact assessments that we are doing?</p></speech>

There will be provisions within that legislation for Inland Fisheries Ireland, which will have responsibility for aquatic invasive species.</p> <p>  In response to the Senator's question on the SDGs, there are two main goals that are biodiversity-related, namely, goal 14 on the environment below water and goal 15 on the main biodiversity elements.  There is quite a general crossover with everything that we already do in relation to sustainable use and protecting mountain ecosystems.  There are also targets relating to ecosystem accounting, and making sure that it is built into our national accounts.  It goes back to looking at the value of nature, how we build that into our national accounts and moving on to how we do our cost-benefit analysis and understand those values.  There has been some movement on that.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, will report back to EUROSTAT on some of these elements.  It will start building up expertise in this area.  It is great to see the CSO coming on board.  </p> <p>  On the CBD and the public land element, lots of safeguards are built into the convention.  We hope that very strong lines will be taken in terms of the protection of indigenous lands to ensure that the international community is not promoting land grabs.  The ecosystem approach contains 12 principles.  It brings it right back down to the level of the people who were involved with the land at that point.  We are doing work in trying to bring in private investors to help support the restoration agenda.  We are going to produce a peatland code, which will be a sort of restoration code.  We will seek agreement on the code across a lot of different players and stakeholders to ensure that we do not have that slightly sinister move in certain areas towards a land grab.  It has not been happening in Ireland.  None of the companies that we are dealing with are showing any interest in that vein.  They are more keen to support our work.  However, I do not know, in that at the beginning, they might be seeing what is happening and how it works, building up to something.  We are being very careful in the early phases.  The Intel work is being done within our own national park area, supporting that.  I did not really understand the Senator's final question on environmental impact assessments and using the tools available.</p></speech>

The issue was previously raised in respect of planning, in the context of An Bord Plean&aacute;la only having one ecologist, which was significant.  I was referring to the need for more skills in the area.  As well as looking at the EU tools, including environmental impact assessments and considering the directives, I was asking whether there is an opportunity for upskilling on the SDGs and the targets and indicators within them to enable us to begin to factor them in and think about them in planning processes or decision-making, for example.  My question was around awareness.  The SDGs are meant to be getting integrated into everything that we are doing.  I thought that perhaps putting them alongside some of the hard EU tools might be useful.</p> <p>  I might just ask my supplementary question now and Dr. Lynn can respond to both questions together.  Dr. Lynn is correct.  I have been discussing the issue of land grabbing in the international context.  Dr. Lynn mentioned cost-benefit analysis.  There are other important points to raise in respect of the EU.  First, due diligence legislation is coming through.  Second, according to the EU rules on taxonomy, biodiversity should not be damaged.  It is meant to be one of the safeguards built into the taxonomy.  Therefore, we have one legislative tool and one investment tool that require the collation of solid information around biodiversity and the environment.  Is that done through the CSO or will the Department have to upskill staff to ensure that the relevant information is being gathered as part of due diligence and decisions around the taxonomy?  Lastly, the EU proposal on the nature restoration law is due to be adopted on 22 June.  The law may well be considered by this committee and others.  I ask Dr. Lynn for her thoughts on the new restoration law and the package that goes with it.  What should we be looking out for in order to ensure that the law is as strong as it could be?</p></speech>

Some of the bigger companies, in particular, are building up their sustainability teams and their biodiversity expertise.</p><p>We may get into a situation where we find some of the private sector companies have more ecology staff than us.  I am not clear where the reporting lines go back in when they report back.  I assume that goes in on an EU level, for them to determine whether they have undertaken due diligence and they have proceeded with "do no harm".  We have also just launched our own business and biodiversity platform.  We have some founding members for that platform.  We launched it at the biodiversity conference last year.  That is to try to bring businesses on board, to engage them and ensure that they understand the opportunities available to them and their dependencies.  There will be webinars on how they look at their supply chains and how they undertake many of those activities.  There is quite a big business movement ongoing at present at national level and at EU level, where is a business and biodiversity platform.  I think it is called a business movement in the EU biodiversity strategy.  The EU is ramping up, as well, in terms of supporting businesses and bringing them along and both sides exchanging their views.</p><p> The nature restoration law will be very significant.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has already requested that very high-level officials get together to discuss the implications of the EU restoration law when it comes out.  There may be different threads to this.  There will be targets relating to the numbers of the EU protected habitats and species returning to favourable status or ensuring no further decline and there could be wider ecosystem targets for restoration.  We have to draw up our own national restoration plan, as well.  We have to have discussions about who leads on these big biodiversity agenda items.  Where restoration has to happen, agricultural policies will have to be considered.  We will have to figure out how we all work together to develop that restoration plan in the next six months.  That is a very important one that members should probably be bringing back to this committee.  The members should ask, not only the National Parks and Wildlife Service but also some of our colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the forest service about how we all intend to work together to achieve those very ambitious restoration targets.</p></speech>

The siloing of biodiversity within one Department or another can cause difficulties.  Dr. Lynn spoke about the financial issues and considerations.  There are biodiversity elements to areas such as planning and flood defences.  Are the structures in place to enable cross-departmental discussions to happen?  If they are in place, are they working?  What improvements could be made?</p> <p>  I will talk about the pollinator issue.  Dr. Lynn spoke about the pollinator plan, which is a great initiative.  People have really grasped it and they want to do as much as possible.  However, issues have been raised with regard to wildflower mixes and whether they are introducing invasive species we would obviously not want to introduce.  Is the NPWS doing any examination of or study of those wildflower mixes?  Ideally, our wildflowers should be coming from the soil, even if one does not add any seeds to an area.  I have done it in my garden where I have stopped cutting and taken away any of the inputs.  The number of different species in the garden is incredible.  They self-seeded.  Does the NPWS intend to look at those wildflower packets to see whether we should encourage people?  I know there are some corporations that are putting in major investment in this area.  I hear ads on the radio and I become worried about what, potentially, we could be inadvertently encouraging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.75" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Deirdre Lynn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022061400002#L00300"><p>The Deputy's last question is very important.  I do not know if she has seen any of the articles.  An excellent article was recently written by Dr. Noeleen Smyth who used to work in the National Botanic Gardens and is now an associate professor of horticulture in UCD.  I share her views.  One's back garden is one's own.  One should absolutely be able to plant whatever one likes there.  There is no problem with some urban areas and some communities having a nice floral display, perhaps of seed mix.  It is the messaging in terms of whether it is said to be pro-biodiversity.  In some of those cases, it is not really the best thing for biodiversity.  Many of them are not considered to be from native seed sources.  The best thing for biodiversity is to reduce mowing and cut late in the season to allow flowers to flower, seed and increase diversity and to provide a food source for pollinators throughout the season; one with which these pollinators have evolved.  I love dandelions, which are absolutely beautiful, and regular lawn mixes of daisies, buttercups, dandelions and clover.  It is amazing that one sees many people on Twitter now saying they have left an area for a couple of years and showing what is coming up now.  The amount of diversity that can come through those small grassy areas within a few years is remarkable and a real joy to see.  It depends.  I advise caution but one does not want to get totally preachy about it and say "absolutely not" to all seed mixes, in all cases.  People have a right to do what they want in their own gardens.  As far as I am aware, we have not undertaken any studies on the content of these seed mixes.  Dr. Smyth may have started on some of that, but I am not entirely sure.</p> <p>  With regard to the current structures within NPWS and whether we can work effectively across Departments, from my own experience it has been very challenging.  My original role had been monitoring and reporting.  We were reporting back to the EU.  We were commissioning many surveys and coming up with trends of status.  One layers on top of that to link in within the climate, restoration, international and EU agendas.  It can be very challenging and it is really heartening to see that has been recognised and that we are getting the injection of staff to at least get us back to 2008 levels and then, with further injections in the years to come.</p> <p>  When we start rebuilding, we will, I hope, be a louder and more informed voice.  The agenda is very big.  When one is trying to get one's head around all of the EU regulations and the financial implications, one has to put the time and effort into research and review as well.  It would be great to be able to focus back in on that.  I have come from the scientific unit and the idea is that we will be allowed to breathe more and get back into the science and research, in order that we can have a very good understanding and be able to come to fora such as this to give our expert opinion.</p></speech>

I have enjoyed hearing members talk about letting their gardens grow and hearing Deputy Devlin talk about the origins of the red squirrel.</p><p>It is a sign of the times and of how far we have come and how far our thinking has changed on the importance of biodiversity.  Obviously, however, we have a long way to go.</p><p> If Dr. Lynn does not mind, I will start with a very pressing issue, certainly from a biodiversity point of view.  There is an agricultural element to this as well in respect of poultry.  From the point of view of wild birds and other birdlife, we see avian flu having a devastating impact at the moment.  It is wiping out large populations of seabirds, particularly colonies of birds such as gannets.  It is having an impact on tern colonies, guillemots, razorbills and even geese species such as barnacle geese.  Particularly in the UK, the numbers are incredibly concerning and the response is a difficult one.  It is hard to know what to do.  From an Irish perspective, we have had confirmed cases of avian flu in wild birds on Irish shores.  Gannets, in particular, are washing up dead with confirmed avian flu.  From an NPWS and Department perspective, what is the response?  Are we ready to deal with this?  Are we putting in place measures to ensure that this does not spread and have a massive impact on our wild bird population?</p></speech>

My understanding is that officials from the National Parks and Wildlife Service sit on a committee with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who are responsible for animal health and welfare and that they draw up their response plan.  I am personally not familiar with that - I apologise.  If the Deputy would like us to submit a more detailed response-----</p></speech>

Does Dr. Lynn feel that it would be a good idea that, instead of that being a European average, it is done on a country-by-country basis?  The reason I say that is that some EU nations are quite strong already on their conservation areas and protected areas and some are quite weak, and I would include Ireland in the latter.  If we use this average, is there a tendency to let some countries off lightly?</p> <p>  The upcoming agri-environment scheme will be launched shortly.  The NPWS has a role in that, particularly from the points of view of science and data collection.  As for the co-operation areas, that is, the areas, particularly in the west of Ireland, where farmers will be able to avail of the highest payments for results-based or bespoke schemes, I feel there is potentially a lack of data in some of those areas.  For example, the Beara Peninsula and large parts of Kerry in the south west are included, but the Mizen Peninsula, which has very similar features and species to those of the Beara Peninsula, is for some reason excluded.  It is said that that is based on scientific data and NPWS data, but is it worth commenting that there is probably a lack of data in a lot of these areas and that, therefore, they should be looked at again?  I feel there will be very much a missed opportunity if we leave large portions of those areas out.  Dr. Lynn might comment on that.</p> <p>  I attended the biodiversity conference during the week.  The following is more of a general point.  I would like a comment on it from Dr. Lynn.  One of the recurring comments was that we tend in most western countries to measure wealth specifically as economic and financial wealth and that the wealth of our national heritage and biodiversity does not really feature.  Does Dr. Lynn think we should look at that going forward and that when we measure the wealth of a country or how well a country is doing, we should include that?</p> <p>  I have one more question.  I am sorry for overwhelming Dr. Lynn with these.  My last question is about biodiversity officers.  Dr. Lynn touched on it in previous comments.  At the moment we have heritage officers but, unfortunately, when they are in local authorities, the scope of their work is just so broad that biodiversity can sometimes very much take a back seat.  For example, the biodiversity officer in Cork County Council does a fantastic job, but his role is very much focused on heritage, history and the unveiling of plaques for commemorations.  There seems to be very little focus on biodiversity.  I would like an update on the role of biodiversity officers and how quickly we might see them rolled out into local authorities.  Local authorities are significant landowners and, therefore, have a significant role to play in protecting biodiversity and increasing habitat.  Therefore, biodiversity teams - not just an officer - and plans are absolutely essential.</p></speech>

We really need to look at the landscape of a lot of the EU countries.  Some of them are quite extensively forested with natural forests, and a lot of those are state-owned natural forests, so a lot of those countries may have quite a higher proportion of their areas protected.  Ireland's landscape is quite complex in respect of the average landholding size, particularly in the west, where probably most of our more pristine biodiversity areas are, so it is slightly more complicated.  If you look at how long it took us to get through the process of the 14% we have protected, I think we have learned a lot of lessons from that process.  We really need to sit down and think about where we should target to increase some of that terrestrial area.  We certainly should make sure we have captured any of our remaining old oak forests in that as well as, perhaps, some more of our wetlands and fens.  Both those would be more carbon-rich systems.</p> <p>  There is probably a reason for the different percentages in different countries.  Also, Ireland is 90% marine, which is very important to remember.  I think and hope that that is where our contribution will be, proportionately higher than a lot of the other EU countries are in the marine sphere.  We need to look at our State-owned and public lands.  We are looking at our landbanks for housing; we should look at our landbanks for biodiversity purposes as well.  Then we should look very closely at any of the areas where we have been putting EU money in for restoration purposes as well.</p> <p>  As for the lack of data and data collection, we have over the years been building up our monitoring data sets.  It is quite costly to go out and get ecologists in the field, particularly in remote and upland areas and to get really good habitat maps of a lot of our upland or coastal complexes.  However, we have been building them over time, and there is the new land cover map that has been produced by Ordnance Survey Ireland in conjunction with the EPA.  That will be released soon and will give us a much better resolution of the type of land cover across Ireland.  We dealt with a much cruder map in previous times, so we should have a lot more information.</p> <p>  We also now need to look towards more interpretation of satellite imagery.  I remember trying that back in around 2006, it must have been.  We commissioned some satellite imagery from, I think, somewhere in Mayo.  I remember at the time recognising that there would be cloud cover - it is Ireland and some imaging will be lost to cloud cover - but I did not realise there was cloud shadow as well.  We lost a lot to the shadow of the cloud.</p><p> All these technologies are improving over time and different types of remote sensing can also be used to get over this.  We are continually developing in that area.  Some very good EPA-funded projects have been developing habitat mapping using remote imagery.  We hope our data sets will build over time.  In agriculture, people are looking to get biodiversity inventories of many farms.</p><p> We need to build a lot of this information together.  The biodiversity data centre has obviously been collecting a large amount of species information for us over time and that is building.  We are undertaking many measures so we need to look at where these conservation measures are being undertaken, whether they are effective and what change has occurred.  We have applied for funding to European mechanisms called strategic integrated projects and strategic nature projects under the EU LIFE instrument.  This funding would enable us to collate much of this information and build the architecture to give us all better access and better up-to-date data and information.  That is building and we have much to do in that area.</p><p> On wealth, as I said, I always think we should be measuring progress by our common good.  Various indices are worked on, for example, the happiness index.  There should be a different one rather than having only straightforward GDP because it is not a good measure of how the general population are feeling.  We need to address that.</p><p> On the biodiversity officers, we recognised the need for biodiversity officers to be in all local authorities and that programme is being rolled out over the next couple of years.  The Heritage Council is spearheading that development.  I hope that once we get a large number of them in place and they are working effectively with the heritage officers, it will have a snowball effect and we can get more funding, possibly through the local area groups under LEADER and under Agenda 21, which perhaps has been renamed.  We also have funding for that level, from which teams can be built up.  That is what we did in the NPWS.  There could be one scientist who was the expert in an area and that person would have to go out and survey that area throughout the whole country.  In such cases, the work would be commissioned and the person would use the expertise of consultants but would still go out and do the work.  I hope that when teams build up, they will be in a position to engage in a lot of action on the ground and bring on board more expertise.</p></speech>

On the general approach, and again this relates to agri-environment schemes, some of the bespoke schemes for many wading species were successful, certainly at the beginning.  It is to be hoped the curlew project will have some success.  As part of the new agri-environment schemes, we will see more wading species included in the bespoke schemes.  We have seen the success of the hen harrier project and the corncrake project is having success.  Certain species of birds that sometimes go under the radar are disappearing in front of our eyes.  If Dr. Lynn is unable to answer this, perhaps she could feed it back to the Department.  I am thinking of farmland passerines, which include the linnet and buntings such as the yellowhammer.  The yellowhammer in particular is a bird that is pretty much disappearing in front of our eyes.  Unless we intervene, it will meet the same fate as the corn bunting, which is extinct in Ireland.  Is there a plan in the NPWS or the Department to go further than the current schemes for wading species and raptors, which are easier to create, and consider schemes for smaller passerines which are declining at an alarming rate?</p></speech>

We seldom have sessions where we have just one guest before us.  I admire Dr. Lynn for withstanding two hours of varied and intense questioning.  We certainly appreciate her time and expertise.  This has been a thorough and useful session.  We had some sessions last year and decided to hold off on publishing our report until we had an extra session, which is what today was about.  In the next few weeks, the committee hopes to finalise its report on biodiversity.  It should be interesting.  Members are very engaged in the issue and want to see the biodiversity crisis addressed with the same vigour with which the climate crisis is being addressed.  I thank Dr. Lynn again.</p></speech>

The section is unconstitutional since the repeal of the eighth amendment.  I am surprised to see this is still here following previous commitments from the Minister about it.  When the 2015 Act was passed, section 85(6) provided that an advance healthcare directive would be valid or applicable insofar as it contained the refusal of treatment that would have a deleterious effect on the unborn.  The 2022 Bill, as it stands, does not remove this language despite the subsequent repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution and the enactment of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.  I propose the deletion of section 85(6) to ensure that all pregnant people can avail of advance healthcare directives.  The report on the pre-legislative scrutiny also recommended this, in recommendation 54.</p><p>Amendment No. 2 is a red line for me.  I have mentioned it to the Minister a number of times.  It relates to people detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  This section relates to the removal of section 85(7) to allow advance healthcare directives to be extended to those involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act.  Leaving this section in is discriminatory to those with mental health difficulties and does not allow for parity of treatment for all Irish citizens.  Every citizen of this country must be afforded an equal right to exercise their will and preference.  This must apply to mental health as well as physical health.  We could be waiting for years for the update of the Mental Health Act.  I am on the Sub-Committee on Mental Health, which is addressing that Act at the moment.  This is my second committee meeting today.  I have no recollection of a discussion about assisted decision-making capacity when we were getting the report on the Mental Health Act ready.  I do not know how we are going to review or amend the Act when we have not even discussed it at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.</p><p>The Mental Health Commission and the Decision Support Service support the extension of this right to people under the Mental Health Act.  I have discussed the dangers of not extending this right under Part 4 to people with the Minister previously.  In 2020, 2,463 people were involuntarily admitted under the Act.  That means that an average of 2,500 people a year could be subjected to forced psychiatric treatment, the forced administration of medication and forced electroconvulsive therapy without the protection of a legally binding advance healthcare directive.  People's mental health difficulties are often episodic.  The do not happen all the time.  They have an idea of what their treatment should be and what worked for them in the past.  If they make an advance healthcare directive, it is informed.  People who provide an advance healthcare directive relating to physical care would not have the same experience as somebody who has mental health difficulties and episodic issues.  I do not know how my physical health will be in five years, but people with a history of mental health difficulties know what treatment works for them and they should be able to have an advance healthcare directive.</p><p>Amendment No. 17 addresses 16- and 17-year-olds.  Currently, they can consent to or refuse physical healthcare decisions, but this does not apply to mental health care decisions.  They do not have any right to consent to or refuse mental health treatment.  I hope that will change in the review of the Mental Health Act.  At the moment, they cannot refuse hospital admission.  Guardians can decide to admit them without their consent and 16- and 17-year-olds cannot refuse a particular course of treatment, such as electroconvulsive therapy, or even conversion therapy, which came up the last time we discussed this.  The review of the Mental Health Act might bring those issues into line but we do not know how far away that is.  There is no national advocacy service for people under the age of 18 who are accessing mental health services.  Young people are not having their voices heard about mental health care and treatment.</p><p>Amendment No. 19 seeks to remove section 85(7) to allow advance healthcare directives to be extended to those involuntarily detained under the Mental Health Act.  As I said, leaving this section in is discriminatory to those with mental health difficulties and does not allow for parity of treatment for all Irish citizens.  I will not repeat that argument.</p><p>Amendment No. 27 is also about people detained under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act.  They are the only cohort excluded from access to the protections of this Bill.  It is discriminatory and exclusionary.  They should not be omitted.  It needs to be deleted in line with the upcoming mental health legislation.  There are two Department of Health amendments, which require the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill to include mental health and to which we would like to bring the Minister's attention.  They are on page 165 of the draft heads of Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001, contained in the explanatory notes.  This amendment introduces designated healthcare representatives as per sections 88(1) and 136 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  An amendment is required to ensure these provisions can operate and ensure parity of treatment for those with mental health issues.  Subsection 2 reflects recommendations 126 to 131, which recommend that the advance healthcare directives should apply to persons receiving treatment under this Act.</p></speech>

This amendment addresses concerns about respecting advance healthcare directives for individuals engaging with mental health.  Under section 85(7) of the 2015 Act, an advance healthcare directive will not be complied with as it relates to the refusal of mental health treatment is the directive maker is detained under the Mental Health Act.</p><p>Mental Health Reform pointed out the seriousness of this issue in its submission on pre-legislative scrutiny, stating that the individuals affected "have no legal right to have their advance wishes respected, even though they had capacity to make decisions about their healthcare and treatment at the time of making their advance healthcare directive".  The representative of the organisation went on to say: "There is no other group of individuals that is specifically excluded from this legal right."</p><p> Moreover, several stakeholders pointed out that this does not take account of parity between physical and mental health.  Apparently, departmental officials had indicated that this matter could be addressed on Committee Stage.  What is the Minister's current position on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.99" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022061400002#D00200"><p>The Deputies referenced three separate areas in their contribution and I will look to address each of them.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to repeal section 85(6) of the 2015 Act.  Section 85(6) was originally included to qualify and limit the application of advance healthcare directives in the context of pregnancy.  As Deputies will be aware, the provisions regarding advance healthcare directives set out in Part 8 of the Act of 2015 are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  My Department has been in contact with the Department of Health in the preparation of the Bill, including on this proposed amendment.  Section 85(6) was inserted into the original 2015 Act to take account of the previous constitutional position regarding the unborn.  Following the repeal of the eighth amendment, that position has changed.  As was said during the Second Stage debate, I am happy to agree to the deletion of section 85(6) and I have issued instructions to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to draft the required provisions.  That will allow for formal drafting.  I do not propose to accept Deputy Ward's amendment specifically but I will be bringing forward a Government amendment on Report Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that will fully delete section 85(6).</p> <p>  I will turn to amendments Nos. 2, 19 and 27.  There is no disagreement between us on the importance of parity in the operation of advance healthcare directives to physical and other types of healthcare and to mental healthcare.  However, this is a technically complex issue.  We are looking at it in light of the ongoing work with regard to the entire revision of the Mental Health Act 2001.  It is important to look at what is being done here in that context.  For that reason, I am not in a position to accept these two amendments that would impact section 85(7) and section 136.</p> <p>  The application of the 2015 Act to persons whose treatment is regulated under Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 is currently being considered by the Department of Health.  It is appropriate that full and proper consideration would be given to this within the context of the ongoing reform of the 2001 Act.  In particular, that consideration needs to benefit from the policy and clinical expertise on the issue of mental health that exists within the Department of Health.</p> <p>  The Minister for Health and I are in full agreement with Deputies that there is a need for parity of care.  I want to be clear that there is no question of the issue not being addressed.  The Government will address the gap here but there is a risk of moving too hastily in making the changes and not properly sequencing what we are doing with this legislation and the Mental Health Act.  That 2001 Act is going to be radically changed, if not entirely replaced, by the new mental health reform Bill.  I note there have been calls for the outright deletion of these provisions.  I cannot commit to doing that in what we are addressing today.  However, this issue will be addressed within the context of the reform of the 2001 Act.</p> <p>  Deputy Ward asked where we are with respect to the reform of the 2001 Act.  My understanding is that work is under way.  A general scheme was approved by the Government and published in July 2021.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is currently working with the Attorney General's office to progress the completion of the Bill in a timely manner.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is being undertaken by the Sub-Committee on Mental Health and it is a priority for the Minister for Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to get that legislation passed.  Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I met with representatives of Mental Health Reform.  They clearly articulated the concerns that Deputies Ward and Whitmore have also articulated.  We responded with our concerns about acting without the overall understanding of the change that is going to be made to the mental health legislation.  The real concern relates to people who are involuntarily detained where there is a risk of them doing harm to somebody else.  We must consider to what extent a decision by such people to refuse certain treatments on the basis of an advance healthcare directive will then prevent a clinician undertaking a treatment that lessens the risk of harm to somebody else.  That is the central issue.  There is a complicated balance of constitutional rights involved.  The issue must be addressed but there is a tricky balance to strike.  That is why we feel that the analysis and balancing required is best undertaken through the wider understanding of the mental health reforms.  Whatever is decided in terms of that balance can then be used to amend the 2015 Act.</p> <p>  We committed to the representatives of Mental Health Reform, and I am happy to commit again, that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I will write to the Minister for Health and seek an on-the-record commitment from the Government to address this particular issue and also to seek an update on the timeline for the delivery of a completed Bill on mental health reform, which I know is very much desired in response to this issue and a whole range of other issues.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 17 addresses an issue that must be looked at in the context of wider reform.  The issue here is slightly narrower.  While I cannot accept amendment No. 17 today, I will continue to engage with the Departments of Health and Justice on the issue of the application of the Bill to 16- and 17-year-olds.  This amendment would allow minors who have reached the age of 16 to make an advance healthcare directive.  It would, in effect, allow minors to make decisions regarding their own treatment.  The 2015 Act was designed for adults because it related to decisions about property, banking and the like; 16- and 17-year-olds were not considered because they are thought not to have capacity in respect of the commercial issues that much of the Act addresses.  It was never envisaged that the 2015 Act would apply to those under the age of 15, having regard to their legal status as minors.  That remains the position in most cases.  However, I am aware in the context of healthcare that 16- and 17-year-olds have the legal capacity to consent to medical, surgical and dental treatment.  Persons under the age of 18 have agency but there is a body of case law that is not entirely clear about the capacity of a 16- or 17-year-old to refuse consent to a treatment if their parent or guardian wishes them to take that treatment.  That is another example of the balancing issues involved.</p> <p>  I am wary not to overpromise.  The issue here may be a little less broad than the issue we were speaking about in respect of the previous set of amendments.  We will go back to the Departments of Health and Justice and see if there is anything that could be brought forward on Committee Stage.  I cannot make an absolute commitment at this point.  I see the need but a balancing is required.  Those 16- and 17-year-olds can consent but there remains a question mark over their capacity to refuse consent, particularly when there is a clash in views between them and their parents.</p></speech>

That section will have been done through the Parliamentary Counsel.  That is why it is important that we make sure every element of this legislation is drafted in a way that is fully compatible with the rest of it.  There is no disagreement between the Deputy and me.  This section will be removed.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the sequences within the Act and the review of that Act.  I do not know how long that will take and I am on the relevant committee.  We undertook pre-legislative scrutiny and had discussions but we did not have any stand-alone discussion, debate or testimony from witnesses or experts on the impact the legislation we are talking about here will have on people with mental health issues.  It did not come up.  What conversations has the Minister had with the Department of Health?  Why was this issue not flagged with that Department to make sure it would form part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill?  There is a report coming out very soon.  I am not sure what is in it because I have not seen it but, when we do see it, I imagine there will be very little mention of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act within.  I am still a little bit unsure about how this is going to work.</p> <p>  I will ask the Minister to clarify another matter.  If we amend the Mental Health Act 2001 to allow those detained under that Act the same rights as everybody else, will we then have to come back at another stage to amend this legislation?</p></speech>

It is better that it be done that way because the work the Deputy, the committee and the Department are doing on that mental health reform Bill will provide an opportunity to tease out the difficult constitutional balance that has to be achieved in terms of the right of people who are involuntarily detained to refuse certain treatments even where that refusal will result in a risk to the safety of somebody else.  That is the key issue.  We do not have an answer to that question and that issue of balance as of yet.  We spoke previously about the need and desire to get this Bill passed and to abolish the wards of court system.  As I understand the situation, I cannot see us being in a position to fully clarify that issue within a timeline that would allow for all of the other very important provisions of this legislation to be delivered.  However, I will be very clear that there is no disagreement on that need for parity and this is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It is just a matter of listening to the experts and of the need to give that very difficult legal balance the requisite time and consideration.  I do not believe we have that time in the context of the amendments we are bringing forward at the moment.</p> <p>  I have one final point.  The Deputy said that he did not know when the Bill is to come forward.  One of the reasons I have made a commitment to engage with the Minister for Health on a public and written basis is to allow me to understand the timelines we are looking at with regard to delivering the mental health reform Bill, which we all agree is very important.</p></speech>

We are amending the 2015 Act and, therefore, we have had seven years to make sure that everybody was included in this and that nobody was left behind.  There was plenty of time for that in the past seven years.  I will get into a debate about the timelines in this legislation and how it seems to be rushed when we are discussing a later amendment.</p></speech>

Disabled persons organisations, DPOs, and disabled people themselves have repeatedly been left out of the narrative on decisions that affect their lives.  The State has a requirement under the UNCRPD to engage directly with disabled people on legislation that affects them.  They must be given their voice.  This is not being done sufficiently, though, and we need to legislate for it.  The Decision Support Service, DSS, is doing good work, but there needs to be legislation to allow it to apply for the resources it needs to facilitate this engagement.  As I mentioned on Second Stage, we were told on pre-legislative scrutiny stage that it should be a case of nothing about us without us where disabled people were concerned.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 7 inserts two further guiding principles.  Regarding the first of those, the amendment reads: "The guiding principles contained in subsections (1) to (10) above shall be interpreted consistently with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular, Article 12, and General Comment 1 of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."  Now that Ireland has ratified the UNCRPD, embedding an explicit reference in guiding principles strengthens the potential for the Act to be interpreted in a manner compatible with the human rights obligations under the convention.  The Act was continually referred to by successive Ministers during its development as being an essential part of Ireland&rsquo;s preparations for ratifying the UNCRPD.  Agreeing this amendment recognises that best practice in this field is continually evolving and reaffirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to refining and reinterpreting our law in a manner consistent with our human rights obligations.  Agreeing this amendment signals Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to a progressive and evolving interpretation of this law in light of the emerging understanding of human rights law.</p> <p>  Regarding the second guiding principle, the amendment reads: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as imposing any civil or criminal liability on an intervenor, who, in exercising his or her relevant powers, acted in good faith and in accordance with what, at the time in question, he or she reasonably believed to be the will and preferences of the relevant person.&rdquo;.&rdquo;."  This provision is designed to counteract the criminal offences in decision supports under the principal Act and the 2022 Bill and to remove the emphasis on punishment for getting it wrong where the intervenor has, in good faith, done his or her utmost to assert the relevant person&rsquo;s will and preference and acted accordingly.  This will give much-needed reassurance to individuals considering taking on these roles that they will not be penalised for doing so.  It should also ensure that relevant persons can call upon a wider range of potential supporters.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 16 reads: "adhere to the obligations set out in Article 4.3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.&rdquo;.&rdquo;."</p> <p>  Regarding amendment No. 44, the Disability Act 2005 takes an overly medical model approach to the definition of a disability compared with the conceptualisation of disability under Article 1 of the UNCRPD.  The UN&rsquo;s understanding of disability is broader than that covered under the Disability Act and is more inclusive and reflective of different experiences, for example, people who have experience of mental health services but do not identify with any label or diagnosis and people who have experienced disability-based discrimination even though they do not themselves identify as disabled people.  Given that the function of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, disability advisory group is to support IHREC&rsquo;s work on the UNCRPD, it would be more appropriate to take the convention&rsquo;s approach to disability rather than the narrow definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Disability Act. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022061400002#G00800"><p>Ireland ratified the UNCRPD in 2018.  As such, the country is bound by that Government decision to the obligations contained within the convention.  However, to do what Deputy Sherlock is proposing would be unusual, and possibly even inappropriate, in that it would require the courts under an individual Act to have regard to all the provisions of the convention when the State has already ratified that convention.  When we interact with international law, if we want to bring the text of a convention into domestic law, we do so by an Act of the Oireachtas.  For example, we signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, and subsequently incorporated it into domestic law.  We put the entire text of the convention into a Bill, which became the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  We can debate whether we want to make every piece of the UNCRPD directly applicable, which is what the Deputy is attempting to do through a one-provision line.  To be constitutionally appropriate, though, we would need the full substantive text of the convention to be incorporated into a Bill if we were looking to make the courts directly bound by every provision of that convention.  As such, I am not comfortable with what the Deputy is proposing.  Perhaps there is room to discuss whether something like it could be done in future, but it would have to follow the model we adopted with the ECHR, where every provision of that convention was put into a Bill and the Oireachtas had the ability to understand the implications of deciding the question.</p> <p>  I referenced another matter on Second Stage, namely, that section 8 of the 2015 Act set out strong guiding principles that showed what we were about.  I will probably speak to them in the context of some of the later amendments.  We are not just dealing with the Bill that is before us, which is an amending Bill and is quite dry in its sections.  A comprehensive Act was passed in 2015.  Unfortunately, it has not been implemented yet, but it has a clear, principles-centred approach to the change that it represents in moving away from the status approach to wardship towards considering people&rsquo;s individual capacities in the context of their particular situations.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 5, 8 and 16 call for a regulation-making power for the Minister in terms of consultation.  We are concerned about placing this consultation obligation in legislation.  We signed up to the convention in 2018 and one of the obligations flowing from it is that we engage in consultation with DPOs.</p><p>If we start to feel that we have to put that in legislation every time, does it suggest that, where we do not have a consultation obligation, the Government, the Minister, the Department or the agency does not have to consult?  One of the ideas behind signing up to the UNCRPD was that there would be a general obligation to consult with DPOs.  If we start specifying this here, then it will look like we have to specify it in primary legislation every time.  Otherwise, the argument can grow that, because we have not specified that the Minister must consult a DPO, the obligation does not apply.  There is a risk in enumerating in legislation every time we have to do something if there is a wider obligation that already sets out that we are to engage in that type of consultation.</p><p> Amendment No. 7 would introduce two new subsections on guiding principles and the UNCRPD into section 8 of the 2015 Act.  I have a similar concern to the one I had about Deputy Sherlock's proposal in amendment No. 3.  Deputy Ward is looking to use the general comment of the UNCRPD as a reference source, but the general comment is not drafted as a legislative document or a treaty.  It is a discursive interpretative piece and probably does not have the degree of specificity necessary to be used as the source of strict legislative approaches.</p><p> On changing the criminal law element, the Deputy is moving to a subjective basis for how the court would determine whether a criminal offence had been committed.  There is a concern over this.  On the one hand, we want to encourage people to take on the role of intervenor but, on the other, there are certain standards that intervenors have to meet in the care that they show in exercising that role.  I would be concerned if this were decided on a purely subjective basis - the person thought that what he or she was doing was okay and, therefore, he or she was not guilty of an offence - and the court was directed to rule on that element.  It creates a threshold that is arguably too low.</p><p> Amendment No. 44 seeks to assign an alternative meaning to "disability" that is different from the one set out in statute under the Disability Act 2005.  I understand that the intention is to insert a social model definition in the 2015 Act, but the definition in the convention is not tight enough to function as a legal definition for the Statute Book.  It is important that the definition we use be consistent and well aligned across this Bill, the 2015 Act, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 and the Disability Act.  The 2005 Act is well known and well used, so I would be worried if we started creating inconsistencies in our definition of "disability" across a range of Acts that were meant to work together.</p></speech>

My rationale for proposing it is that the opening line in the Bill's explanatory memorandum reads: "The Bill gives further effect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)."  I would have thought that it was entirely appropriate for us to give effect to that in an explicit way so as to ensure that the courts "shall construe this Act" in a manner that gives effect to the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  Human rights law is constantly evolving.  By adding the amendment, there would be recognition of what was best practice within the field and a reaffirmation of Ireland's commitment to refining and interpreting the law in a manner consistent with our human rights obligations.  While the Minister and I will not depart from the necessity of ensuring that we promulgate in a way that is consistent with our human rights obligations, I remain hopeful that he will revert to this matter on Report Stage.  If he is determined not to accept the amendment, is there a wording that the Government side could come up with for a specific provision in the legislation to ensure that the courts "shall construe this Act" in a manner that gives effect to the UNCRPD?  It is important to bolt this provision into the legislation in a way that it has not been heretofore.</p></speech>

The first part of the amendment would ensure that the person with disabilities was included in the guiding principles.  The second has to do with making the law looser, for want of a better word.  This legislation could prohibit someone from becoming an intervenor if the emphasis was on punishment for getting something wrong that was being done for the right reason.  There are laws in place dealing with any criminal act, whatever it may be, and these protect people.  This Bill could prohibit someone from becoming an intervenor, which is a difficult role.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022061400002#H00600"><p>I will address that point.  I take what Deputy Ward is saying on board.  We have the DSS to support people, engage with those who are becoming intervenors and provide them with guidance and reassurance about how they can do their job well.  However, the UNCRPD also requires safeguards in respect of those who have the role of supporting people who have some restriction on their capacity.  Notwithstanding the Deputy's point about there already being rules, some of the positions that we are creating are positions of significant trust and it is important that the law signifies that abuse of that trust is a major issue.  The DSS and this Bill can only work with the engagement of intervenors and with people being comfortable with that, and I believe that the DSS will be able to provide that support.  I take on board the Deputy's point, but we all know of instances where people have taken advantage of others and, therefore, we are not discussing situations that are outside the realm of possibility.  It is important that the legislation set out a clear criminal prohibition in that respect.</p><p>On the point made by Deputy Sherlock on bolting the UNCRPD into this legislation, my concern is that if we want to make every provision of the UNCRPD directly applicable in our courts, there is a mechanism set out in the Constitution in respect of how to do that.  There are two steps: we sign up to an international law and then we incorporate it by a full Act of the Oireachtas.  Respectfully, the Deputy may be taking a shortcut in that regard.  I can see what he is seeking to do but the significance of giving every provision of the convention direct application in our courts is big.  That is why it took us a long time to make that call in terms of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We did it.  A step of that magnitude requires the parliamentary scrutiny that such a step would bring.  Obviously, the courts can, do and will make reference to the provisions of the convention when they are dealing with issues in this area.  We are already seeing the influence of the convention in terms of the courts' jurisprudence in certain cases relating to deprivation of liberty.  That is a positive thing.  It is probably what the Deputy is seeking to achieve.</p></speech>

There must be no ambiguity on this issue.  Unfortunately, there will be such ambiguity unless a specific amendment is added to copper-fasten the right of presumption of capacity and the importance of will and preference.  Independent Living Movement Ireland was clear on the need for the Bill to provide for the presumption of capacity and the protection and promotion of a person's will and preferences.  It called for specific reference in the legislation in respect of the aim of legislation to ensure the autonomy of disabled people to live the lives of their choosing.  The issue is that, under the current legislation, the decision support services were able to draw up draft codes of practices that allowed a wide range of actors, including legal practitioners, financial professionals and healthcare professionals, to carry out assessments of capacity as they see fit.  Those individuals can then make decisions regarding whether to respect the decision of the relevant person based on their assessments and without any recourse to or oversight by the courts.</p><p>The draft codes are a separate but related matter.  Numerous stakeholders raised concerns in this regard.  The key, however, is that the codes and their implications for the rights of disabled people and others were possible under the 2015 Act.  Without amendment, there is the potential for a large number of unqualified people to make assessments based on an individual's capacity.  The Minister may disagree with that interpretation.  Even if he does, however, the key point remains that there is scope for interpretation of what needs to be a cast iron right.  The law should operate from the position that all individuals have capacity unless it is proven otherwise, in a manner similar to the presumption of innocence in the legal system.  The amendment is designed to guarantee the recognition of capacity and proportionate protection of that capacity.  The Minister is aware of the shortcomings of the 2015 Act in respect of presumption and the protection of capacity.  The amendment addresses that issue.</p></speech>

Section 8 contains the guiding principles.  Section 8(1) provides: "The principles set out in subsections (2) to (10) shall apply for the purposes of an intervention in respect of a relevant person, and the intervener shall give effect to those principles accordingly."  Section 8(2) provides: "It shall be presumed that a relevant person who falls within paragraph (a) of the definition of &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; in section 2(1) has capacity in respect of the matter concerned unless the contrary is shown in accordance with the provisions of this Act."  It is important that the 2015 Act that we are amending does contain a presumption of capacity.  That is set out in the legislation at the moment.  As all present are aware, that does not currently apply because that legislation has not been initiated, but that is our starting point.  When the Bill is passed, that will be the starting point.</p> <p>  I am not in a position to accept the amendment because, as drafted, it does not align with the overall architecture of either the 2015 Act or the Bill.  It would require significant policy and drafting work to give it effect because the functional model that we are seeking to create through both the 2015 Act and to initiate through the Bill is central to the fabric of the 2015 Act.  The fundamental restructuring this amendment represents would make the Bill basically unworkable and that would prolong the abolition of wardship.  I think all present agree that wardship needs to be removed.</p> <p>  Beyond that technical element, I do not see the need for the amendment at a policy level.  It appears to be based on an assumption that the functional model is not compliant with the UNCRPD on the basis that section 3 does not specifically identify the right to hold and exercise legal rights and obligations.  I know that argument has been summarised in the past as the idea that the 2015 Act equates mental capacity with legal capacity, but I do not think this is the real implication or action of the 2015 Act.  Taken as a whole, the Act and the Bill provide for the component parts of legal capacity in a way that is compliant with the UNCRPD and has significant and robust safeguards taken on board.  The place of the functional capacity model in the Act is designed to maximise a person's decision-making capacity in a manner that explicitly privileges and provides a framework to enforce and safeguard the person's explicit will and preference.   This is contrary to the prevailing system of wardship.  Assisted decision-making will allow a person to hold and exercise legal rights and obligations.  I appreciate the intent of the amendment.  I do not think examining section 3 in isolation is helpful in assessing the Act's overall compliance with the UNCRPD.  The manner in which the Act as a whole operationalises the functional model is CRPD-compliant and meets the requirement of both Article 12 of the CRPD and general comment No. 1.</p> <p>  On a final point, the term "best interpretation" that is used in the amendment is not a term that is used elsewhere in the 2015 Act and it is unnecessary, given the application of the will and preference that is set out in the guiding principles of the Act.  We think that approach gives better legal clarity on the issue as is currently set out in the section.  For that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

They all relate to costs.  Enormous extra expenses are faced by people with disabilities that are not covered by social welfare programmes.  Not all people with disabilities are on social welfare.  Many people with disabilities are working.  People with disabilities are at a higher risk of poverty.  It is important to minimise the costs of the decision-making supports in the Bill, so as not to risk further impoverishment of people with disabilities.</p><p>Amendment No. 15 is along the same lines.  The donor is a person who makes an enduring power of attorney.  This section relates to regulations that the Minister could make, including setting the fees that should be charged.  Similar to the thrust of other amendments, I ask that the means of the person are considered when setting fees.  The person should always be at the centre of the legislation and the Minister should not be allowed to make regulations on fees without taking a person's means into account.  The proposed subsection (e) allows for circumstances in which fees can be waived.  Therefore, I recommend that the amendment would be accepted to ensure that this is taken into consideration.  Subsection (3) states that the Minister should take into account the need to ensure protection of the assets and funds of the donor.  I ask that we would take this a step further and explicitly state that the person's means would also be taken into account.</p></speech>

I assure Members that a thorough process was undertaken in regard to the setting of fees and charges under the Act to ensure that the costs would not be prohibitive to persons accessing provisions of the Act.  It is not intended that any additional financial burden is placed on the user of the Act's provisions.  The various fees and charges under the Act were established in line with international standards.</p> <p>  I think Deputy Ward alluded to the fact that it is not necessary to means-test in this way as the director does have discretion to entirely waive fees.  That will be set out in the regulations that will be brought forward under this Act.  All fees are subject to consultation and approval with the Minister in my Department or are prescribed directly by the Minister.  I am very conscious that cost should not act as a barrier to accessing the provisions of the Act.  Because we have the provision there already to allow for the waiving of the fees, we have the mechanisms in place to ensure that fees do not become a burden.</p></speech>

While it is vital to ensure the will, preferences and privacy of individuals are respected, it is also crucial that the public is aware of how this monumental change to Ireland's capacity laws is operating in practice.</p><p>This amendment allows for judicial discretion and draws on existing legislation to ensure representatives of bona fide press, researchers and legal professionals can still attend and report on cases, subject to reasonable restrictions.  The language of the amendment mirrors that which enabled Carol Coulter and her team on the childcare law reporting project to attend and report anonymously on cases regarding child protection in the Family Courts, a project which has been widely praised by the Judiciary and legal practitioners, ourselves in these two Houses as well as social services, for increasing transparency of judicial decision making.  We could call it the Carol Coulter amendment.  We would all agree that her work and that of her team has been phenomenal.</p><p>I suggest setting up a similar type of infrastructure around this Bill, especially for academic researchers.  I am mindful of academic researchers in all of this.  Such access is important in order that we can generate research papers around this and generate best practice into the future.  That is the justification for the amendment.</p></speech>

I know that was subject to quite significant criticism in terms of its implications for privacy and the extremely delicate nature of much of the material that will be discussed in these cases in terms of assessment of people's capacity.  We changed this in the Bill as published and we have gone back to the use of the <i>in camera</i>rule.  We take a position that is similar and treats this similar to family law, where the <i>in camera</i>rule applies.</p><p>I take Deputy Sherlock's point about and view on the research element.  I do not necessarily agree with regard to the press.  Those are two very different elements.  I am trying to think of the rules for press reporting of family law disputes.  I do not think there are any.  I think there is a complete ban.  As I understand it, the exception for the family law reporting project that Dr. Coulter undertakes was a legislative exception that had to be legislated for.</p><p>We will have a look at that text in terms of the research point.  We will have to speak to the Department of Justice about that.  This is not just a call for us; it is a call for the Department of Justice.  I do not propose to do it in terms of journalists who are reporting.  I do not think that is necessarily appropriate but I take Deputy Sherlock's view.  I have launched some of the reports of the child law reporting project.  It is very important.  There may be a call to do something similar in the context of the implementation of the decision support services and this legislation.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 seek to reduce the period in which a review of a ward's capacity is undertaken.  The review periods currently set for capacity review are 12 months and three years, respectively; the latter being where the ward is unlikely to regain capacity.  The amendments seek three-month and 18-month periods, respectively.  The purpose of the inclusion of section 43 of the Bill is to ensure that a ward who is covered under Part 6 of the Act is entitled to a review of his or her capacity in the same way that a relevant person is entitled under Part 5.</p> <p>  In this regard, the review periods of 12 months and three years replicate those set out in Part 5 of the Act.  Under the Act as it is currently drafted, the ward has the same periods as a relevant person.  It is important, insofar as possible, that both wards and relevant persons under this Act are treated in the same manner and that the level of burden, stress and administrative procedures is no more than is necessary.

This means that individuals who wish to confer powers to consent to or refuse health treatment to a trusted supporter, at a time when they are no longer able to communicate their wishes, will have to complete a separate advanced healthcare directive, even if they are also making an enduring power of attorney.  This places an additional bureaucratic burden on the relevant person, if that person is required to draft two separate instruments with different requirements for supporting evidence, witnessing, etc.</p><p>It is especially burdensome if the relevant person wishes to authorise the same person who holds the enduring power of attorney as his or her designated healthcare representative to consent to or refuse treatment on his or her behalf, in accordance with his or her will and preference.  It would also be inconsistent with the approach in the rest of the Act to exclude healthcare treatment from enduring powers of attorney, when decisions about healthcare treatment can be included in any other decision support arrangement under the Act, including decision-making assistance agreements and co-decision-making agreements.  It is also inconsistent with the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which recommends that health and medical treatment decisions should be retained in the scope of an enduring power of attorney.  That was pre-legislative recommendation No. 52.</p><p>The amendment would also restore the original power which the present Bill proposes to remove from individuals making enduring powers of attorney.  We argue that the removal of this power is unnecessary for the Minister's stated purpose of giving clarity to healthcare professionals who have the authority to make a healthcare decision where a person lacks capacity.  Sections 12 and 20 of the principal Act clarify that when a person makes a decision-making assistance agreement or a co-decision-making agreement that relates to healthcare, such agreement will be null and void, as respects decisions also covered in an advanced healthcare directive, if that directive enters into force because the person has lost capacity.</p><p>Therefore, it is already foreseen in the principal Act that in situations where one or more decision-makers may have authority in respect of powers, for example, to consent or refuse health treatment, the advance healthcare directive and designated healthcare representative take precedence over other instruments.  This provides the necessary certainty to healthcare professionals on what instrument to follow in this situation.  Therefore, there is no need to remove the option of individual choice from donors of enduring power of attorney, who should be able to continue to confer these powers in their enduring powers of attorney, should they wish to do so, rather than imposing a bureaucratic burden or creating a separate legal instrument with separate witnessing and notification requirements to give effect to their choice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYS2022061400002#N00200"><p>This amendment deletes the Minister's proposal to remove treatment decisions from enduring power of attorneys, EPAs.  Separating decisions about healthcare treatment and enduring powers of attorney will create additional complications for individuals.  In essence, if someone wants to plan his or her healthcare decisions in advance, he or she would have to create not one but two instruments, which are an enduring power of attorney and an advance healthcare directive.  These would then necessitate two separate requirements for supporting evidence, witnesses for each instrument and separate assessments of capacity to make both instruments, since capacity is to be assessed in a decision-specific manner under the legislation.</p><p>It was pointed out to us that these types on instruments would need to be put in place soon after a life-changing diagnosis of dementia, for example.  Now, the Government is forcing people to go through two processes.  It is useful to quote from the pre-legislative scrutiny report on this issue:</p> <blockquote> 	The most widely opposed measure in relation to Enduring Power of Attorneys was the proposed removal of treatment decisions. This proposal received widespread criticism.  DPOs, legal experts, advocacy organisations and others argued that this would be less accessible, more complex and inefficient.  It was put that it will discourage people from using EPAs and increase costs, as those who wish to have the full range of their advance wishes protected will have to make two arrangements: an EPA and an AHD. </blockquote> <p>Why is the Minister complicating the issue?  People directly affected and advocates have highlighted this move as creating obstacles for people.  Some people may want to create separate enduring power of attorneys and advance healthcare directives and the law should allow that, but it should not force everyone down a more complicated route against their will.  If this Bill is serious about respecting people's preferences, it needs to empower people and not force them to jump through additional hoops.</p></speech>

The reason for this is that it is considered necessary to give clarity on medical legal decision-making.  Amendment No. 14, which is being spoken about here, proposes to re-include treatment decisions as part of the role of enduring power of attorney.</p> <p>  We consulted significantly with the Department of Health on this and the view is that the appropriate place for medical treatment decisions lies with advance healthcare directives, AHDs, and designated healthcare representatives.  While I accept that in some cases this will require some additional administration by the relevant person and the decision supporter, the importance of the clarity here should not be underestimated.  The removal of treatment decisions from EPAs ensures that there can be no ambiguity between decisions included in EPAs and those included in advance healthcare directives.  This clarity is really important to medical professionals treating relevant persons with a registered advance healthcare directive, particularly in cases where either urgent or even life-or-death decisions are required.  The supporting statements of an AHD alongside the explicitly health-focused role makes a designated healthcare representative the appropriate decision supporter in such a situation.  The DSS can and will work to reduce any administration from this process.  It is important to state that it is possible for the same person to act as an attorney and as a designated healthcare representative.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy Whitmore's question, the reason for the change is to give absolute clarity in some of these life-or-death situations where the potential of two documents saying different things could cause real confusion to a medical practitioner having to make a determination.</p></speech>

For example, British Columbia allows an individual to create both a representation agreement conferring health and other decision-making powers and an enduring power of attorney conferring powers to make legal decisions, including provision of consent.  Queensland also allows an individual to create both an enduring power of attorney conferring health and decision-making powers and an advance healthcare directive conferring health and decision-making powers.  It has, therefore, been done in other jurisdictions.</p></speech>

In terms of our system and what we are trying to create, however, as I said, the Department of Health expressed real concern in terms of the potential.  I am talking about potential here; I understand that.  However, it is those situations we are talking about where we want no ambiguity or uncertainty.</p> <p>  If views are expressed in two processes that may potentially have some element of conflict, that is really problematic in those situations.  It is for that reason we are seeking to adopt this approach.  Again, it is important that the same person can be both in terms of the healthcare approach and enduring power of attorney.  That goes some distance to addressing issues about additional administrative burdens.</p></speech>

Given the nature of the sector, many of the relevant organisations work with disadvantaged or otherwise vulnerable or marginalised communities and groups.  Experience during the pandemic showed that the digital divide presented very real barriers to access in the context of online service delivery modes.  Aspects of this include low levels of digital literacy, lack of access to the necessary end-user equipment and connectivity and affordability of usage costs.  Many organisations feel that this is a crucial area for attention to ensure equal opportunities and choice in access to mental health services and supports in the &quot;new normal&quot; after the pandemic.  There is a need to legislate to provide options outside of a digital pathway in order that marginalised groups are not excluded.  </p></speech>

A key design principle adopted by the DSS is to offer an accessible, person-centred and digital-first service, in line with wider Government policy.  In the majority of cases this enables the design of a flexible system to effectively manage increases in demand in the coming years and ensures the privacy and integrity of service user data.  While the DSS has adopted a digital-first approach, the service will not be digital only.  It will include a range of options and supports for people interacting with the service.  The DSS and I are very conscious that given the range of persons with varying capacity who will seek to rely on the supports of the new legislation, digital literacy cannot be assumed and neither can universal access to IT infrastructure.  However, we believe it is unnecessary to make provision in primary legislation for paper or offline forms as the relevant powers will rest with the Director already.</p> <p>  The DSS will provide a range of options and supports for users including paper-based alternatives for those who require them and multiple communication channels including online, phone, e-mail and paper post.  Communication will be person-centred and led by the preference of the user.  A dedicated information service team will provide support and information.  Trained DSS staff will walk users through, or directly assist in the completion of, arrangement applications and other processes, where required.  Detailed guidance and information will be provided in accessible forms.  There will be direct links to relevant guidance and information in online forms, as well as signposting to appropriate external supports and resources.  Those processes will be undertaken by the 20 direct staff of the DSS.</p></speech>

The existing provision already includes that the director may serve a copy of the order on another identified person, with the approval of the court, which may, and in the vast majority of cases will, include the relevant person.  However, the power has been left discretionary to provide leeway for unforeseen operational circumstances during the operation of the Act.  I take it that Deputy Sherlock is not satisfied with that in terms of protecting the rights of the relevant person.</p></speech>

The change to three months will ensure the commission's reporting arrangements align with its overall obligations and reporting requirements to its parent Department, which is the Department of Health.  The commission will now also be required to provide a copy of the annual report to my Department.  We are trying to align the two reporting requirements.

That list would now include disabled persons, disabled persons organisations, experts by experience and independent advocacy organisations.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, we heard that disabled persons were excluded from much of what is provided for in the Bill, especially in the context of the seemingly rushed process of bringing forward the legislation and the time restraints that apply.  On Second Stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, made a 20-minute contribution during which there was no mention of the experience of disabled people.  I and other Opposition Members brought our voices to the argument for the inclusion of disabled people and the organisations representing them in any future consultations.</p><p>Amendment No. 41 provides for an obligation on IHREC to engage meaningfully and directly with disabled people in order to obtain information and advice on how their rights are being impacted at grassroots level.  IHREC has already taken steps to achieve this, including through the creation of a disability advisory committee, but the amendment would ensure further direct engagement with individual disabled persons can occur in line with the mandate set out in the Convention on the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

She has demonstrated that over the two years in which she has been in office.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 41 seeks to place specific obligations on IHREC regarding its engagement with persons with disabilities.  While I understand the intent behind the proposal, the wording is not really feasible or practical in terms of what it encompasses.  In addition, it is not necessary in primary legislation to specify with whom IHREC must consult.  The commission is already bound by its role as a human rights monitoring body and that role is further expanded upon in the Bill.  It already has a disability advisory committee composed of people with experience of living with disability.  It has discretion in this regard and it has a strong record of engagement with all necessary persons and organisations in the conduct of its functions, including engagement with persons with disabilities.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 26 seeks to include disabled persons, disabled persons organisations, experts by experience and independent advocacy organisations as bodies and persons with whom the director of the decision support service must consult in the development of codes of practice to support the 2015 Act.  I recognise the value of this amendment and I agree that the persons and organisations specified should be consulted on matters affecting them.  That is an obligation under the UNCRPD and it is of huge practical benefit and value to hear the experience of both individuals and groups.  While I cannot accept the amendment in its current wording, I will consult with my officials and the Attorney General on the possibility of bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to address the issue of engagement by the director of the decision support service with disabled persons organisations and others on the development of the service.</p></speech>

This amendment would ensure the legislation is reviewed regularly and can be amended in light of the fast-paced rate of worldwide legislative change on legal capacity law.  The amendment also clarifies the central role disabled people and the organisations led and governed by them should play in every review of the legislation.</p></speech>

Even though Part 8 is under the remit of the Minister of Health, the requirement in the provision is for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to consult with the former in commencing the review process.  It would be more appropriate to review the functioning of the Act as a whole.</p><p>Regarding amendment No. 31, as Deputy Sherlock noted, those who campaigned for the legislation argued specifically that a comprehensive review clause was necessary to ensure it would remain under ongoing review at regular intervals, given the pace of change in this area globally and advances in practice.  Therefore, I recommend adding further provisions to ensure the Act is reviewed at least every three years.</p><p>Amendment No. 32 is interlinked with amendment No. 31.  It would make more sense to align the reviews of this legislation with those of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Mental Health Reform's human rights analysis of the draft heads of this Bill, which we received last October, states:</p> <blockquote> 	Persons subject to the 2001 Act, NGOs, mental health professionals and a range of other stakeholders have been frustrated with the delays in reviewing and subsequent implementation of proposed reforms to the legislation.  The delays are regrettable given the need to urgently address the serious deficits in safeguarding the human rights of persons subject to the legislation.  The authors note that in 2011, the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, and the then Minister of State with responsibility for Mental Health, Kathleen Lynch, established a Steering Group on the Review of the 2001 Act.  This was to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to review the 2001 Act.  The ERG was subsequently appointed to make final recommendations on the reform of the 2001 Act.  The work of the ERG published in 2015 was informed by the recommendations from the Steering Group, which published its report in 2012.  It is disappointing that it took 6 years before the Heads of Bill were published earlier this year (July 2021).  S.75 in the Heads of Bill provides that the Minister for Health will undertake a review of the amending mental health legislation not later than 5 years after its commencement.  S.75 provides that the review will assess the effectiveness of the changes introduced and the Minister is required to make a report to each House of the Oireachtas of their findings and conclusions resulting from the review.  The authors are similarly concerned with the delays in the commencement of the 2015 Act.  S.93 of the 2015 Act commits to a review of Part 8 on AHDs before the 5th anniversary of its commencement, while s.146 provides that the Minister for Justice in consultation with the Minister for Health will review the functioning of the 2015 Act (other than Part 8) before the 5th anniversary of the date of enactment of this Act. </blockquote> <p>I could go on, but I will leave it at that.</p><p>I will deal with those separately.  Amendments Nos. 31 and 33 cannot be accepted.  While I understand their intention is to be inclusive provisions and to ensure a robust review, they would actually have the unintended consequence of restricting the review to only those matters stated.  The review provisions must be broad enough to address whatever issues may come up at that point in terms of the operation of the Act.</p><p> Likewise, amendment No. 32 cannot be accepted.  I cannot guarantee that we would be able to undertake a review of the two Acts at the same time.  It is an issue that came up earlier.  I am seeking clarity as to when the Bill on the 2001 reform Act will be passed and will become an Act.  I cannot commit that the reviews of two pieces of law, one that has not been drafted yet, will be undertaken at the same time in a three, four or five-year review.  What we can do is to ensure that whatever review of this legislation takes place, if there are recommendations that are relevant to other pieces of legislation, they can be implemented at that time.</p><p> Amendment No. 29 seeks to include subsequent reviews after the initial five-year period.  Most pieces of legislation have a review period but I am not sure how appropriate it is to have a rolling review.  At that stage, we might be looking at entire amending legislation or something like that, and stakeholders can identify whether there is a need for review.  Particularly in the context of this legislation, we have to remember that IHREC has a specific monitoring role, so that gives some security.  There will be a review after what is now a period of five years but IHREC will be undertaking regular monitoring.  That may indicate problems and some issues may come up even before the first review, given IHREC&rsquo;s monitoring role.  I do not think the rolling provision is necessary.</p><p> Amendment No. 30 seeks to include Part 8 in the review.  I can confirm to members that I will be bringing a Government amendment forward to address this matter to ensure the review of Part 8 will be included in the overall review of the legislation.  I agree that a coherent and comprehensive review is desirable and we have agreement from the Department of Health on that point.  We are not able to accept this particular wording but we will see that Part 8 is reviewed as part of the overall Act, which is an important step forward.</p></speech>

I have an impression that when we legislate, we create obligations on institutions and agencies like IHREC.  My concern is that we have another piece of legislation here and the Minister is saying IHREC will have a key role in monitoring the working of that legislation.  What we do not have sight of is whether the Decision Support Service or IHREC will see a comparative increase in resources to enable it to carry out the work.  We all acknowledge it is an increasing workload.  We need to receive some comfort that the Minister, in his engagement with IHREC in respect of this legislation and the legislation that is coming down the track, would give some signal of additional capacity by way of whole-time equivalents for those organisations to meet their increasing demands in terms of monitoring legislation.  I would welcome some favourable comment from the Minister in that regard if he is in a position to give that now.</p></speech>

It is creating that gap in services where people who are detained under the Mental Health Act will not get the same services and the same rights as other people with disability in regard to this Bill.

We recognise the need, particularly in the context of the DSS, to upscale what is a new organisation, and significant financial resources have been provided over the last number of years.

My understanding is that section 82 amends the First Schedule of the Juries Act by inserting what is clearly, in our interpretation, a mistaken provision that a person is ineligible to serve as a juror if he or she does not, in the opinion of the court, have sufficient mental or intellectual &ldquo;incapacity&rdquo;.

That is an extremely broad definition that excludes a large number of citizens with mental health difficulties.  Under that definition the person could be in recovery or be seeing his or her medical practitioner regularly in order to stay in recovery yet the person is still deemed prohibited from or not eligible for jury duty.  The Act on one hand extends the right to sit for jury duty to a cohort of people with one type of disability - for example, blind people will be included in this - while, on the other, denying the rights of another cohort of people with disabilities, once again pitting physical and mental health against each other rather than ensuring parity.</p><p>I know people who are long term under the care of a medical practitioner for mental ill health, who are in recovery and who are well able to sit for jury duty.  This section prohibits them from doing so.</p></speech>

While updating of the Juries Act 1976 is welcome, the current wording needs to be improved.  It needs to be amended.  We presume when the Bill refers to mental or intellectual incapacity rather than capacity that that is a typo, as Deputy Sherlock mentioned.  However, even the language "mental or intellectual capacity" is inconsistent with the 2015 Act, which deliberately does not include any reference to specific cognitive impairments.  Disabled Women Ireland has pointed out that this type of language focuses on the person's impairment and how it may be difficult for them to participate.  It does not recognise or place any onus on the State or the Courts Service to reasonably accommodate them to participate.  Similarly, Joe McGrath, committee member of the National Platform of Self Advocates, summed it up so well when he said people with intellectual disabilities should not be ruled out of being on a jury just because someone thinks they cannot understand what is happening in court.  The Bill presents a paternalistic and medicalised model of disability.  It focuses on incapacities rather than putting forward progressive laws and associated supports to assist disabled people to participate in juries.  This amendment replicates the approach proposed in the Law Reform Commission's 2013 report and was suggested by the Centre for Disability Law and Policy, NUI Galway, during pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

It is worth stating that the policy of and legislative responsibility for the Juries Act 1976 rests with the Minister for Justice, and the relevant section of the amended Bill has been brought forward jointly by me and the Minister for Justice.  Section 82 of the Bill was introduced to remove the prohibition on persons serving on a jury who, in the problematic word of the then section, has or had a mental illness or disability and is receiving medical treatment or is a resident in a hospital or similar institution.  The intention of the Bill is that capacity to sit on a jury be assessed on a functional capacity basis.  The proposed amendment No. 34 seeks to replace the wording introduced in this Bill.  The amendment proposes to make a person ineligible for jury duty if he or she meets the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 2001 and is resident in an approved centre.  Amendment No. 35 proposes to make all persons in hospitals or similar institutions by reason of ill health ineligible for jury service, where additional supports will be inadequate to facilitate the role of juror.  While I recognise the goal of the amendments, I do not believe they are practicable in the context of the Juries Act and I think their wording is problematic.  Amendment No. 34 runs contrary to the operation of the functional capacity test, whereby the ability to sit on a jury, even for someone receiving treatment under Part 4 of the 2001 Act, should be assessed in a manner presuming capacity and that is time-bound and context-bound.  Similarly, the supports alluded to in amendment No. 35 are part of the broader operation of the functional test, whereby people's decision-making capacity will be facilitated and supported to the greatest extent possible.  In fact, amendment No. 35 could have the unintended consequence of potentially disqualifying a person on grounds of physical health where no such provision currently exists or is desired.  All persons should be eligible for jury service where the court is satisfied that they have capacity to fulfil the duties of a juror, which warrants the use of the functional capacity test to allow the court to assess their eligibility at the time of service.  For those reasons I cannot accept this pair of amendments.</p></speech>

Section 84 amends the National Disability Authority Act 1999 to add specific recognition of the NDA in supporting IHREC to perform its functions as proposed in this section.  This is unnecessary as the NDA's existing legislative functions already allow for the sharing of information, including statistical data, with public bodies such as IHREC.  It would be more appropriate to amend the IHREC Act to create an obligation on IHREC to engage meaningfully with disabled people directly rather than the NDA as a public body in order to obtain information and advice as to how the rights of disabled people are being impacted as grassroots level.  IHREC has already taken steps to achieve this, including through the creation of its disability advisory committee, but further direct engagement with disabled people would be more appropriate in this context than providing legal recognition for the role of the NDA.  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has also called for such an amendment to ensure wide consultation with the disability community.  That was pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation No. 64.</p></speech>

These are being discussed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the moment.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 36 proposes to delete section 84 of the Bill in its entirety.  This section makes amendments to the National Disability Authority Act 1999.  I wish to split this up into two elements.  The first element results in maybe a misinterpretation of what is being attempted here, and this came up in quite a few of the Second Stage speeches.  Section 84(1)(a) a provides that the NDA will be obliged to provide advice and statistical information to IHREC in the conduct of IHREC's role as the national monitoring body for the CRPD.  A decision has been made that IHREC will be the monitoring body.  All this section seeks to do is to facilitate the disability support service, DSS, to be able to give them information.  There was some suggestion that the provision obliges IHREC to engage in consultation with the NDA at the expense of persons with disabilities or disabled persons' organisations.  That is an incorrect interpretation of this provision.  The actual effect is to oblige the NDA to assist IHREC with the provision of expert advice and statistical data.</p><p>It is not a consultation provision and it certainly does not imply any exclusivity in terms of consultation.  Both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and the National Disability Authority, NDA, can, should and do engage in extensive consultation with persons with disabilities.  We have discussed some of that issue with the NDA's disability support service, DSS, already.  I propose to bring forward a provision to offer greater guidelines there.  However, I want to stress that a change to the scenario is neither the intention nor the legal effect of this provision.  The deletion of this provision is undesirable, because this provision, as drafted, will assist IHREC in performing that body's functions.  It will allow the NDA to do that.</p><p> In addition, amendment No. 36 proposes to delete the remainder of section 84 of the Bill.  It is not clear to me what is objectionable in the remainder of section 84.  This section provides that the staff of the National Disability Authority will become civil servants of the State.  It sets out the necessary technical amendments for that to occur.  Staff of the NDA are currently public servants, so the proposed change is a largely administrative one.  It will introduce administrative efficiencies and savings from a HR perspective.  I do not see what is objectionable about that.   I hope I have clarified this about the first part of section 84.  As well as this, if I were to delete the rest of section 84 on the NDA, there would be an impact on NDA employees.  Therefore I cannot support this amendment.  </p></speech>

The targets that I have set out are still low.  I admit that they are still low, although they are a bit more ambitious.  I deliberately set them low in the hopes that the Minister might move on these.  It is important to raise the bar on employment targets for people with disabilities.  The targets that I set out here are tangible and achievable.  I am not looking to reinvent the wheel in this amendment.  Disabled people deserve better.  For example, a move from 3% to 5% is not a big move.  It is still low, but it is a target that could be moved on.  </p><p>This is the same issue that arises in amendments Nos. 39 and 40, which include a small percentage move.  </p></speech>

Right now, the target is 3%.  We are meeting that target.  We are at 3.1% across the public sector.  These numbers will get us to 6% by 1 January 2025.  They have not been pulled out of the air.  They have been set out in the comprehensive employment strategy, CES.  I think that the CES document was introduced in 2015.  The State has been working to this document's policies to increase the number of people with a disability who are in employment generally, and not just in the public service.  One of the elements of the CES was to take the existing statutory requirement of 3% and to increase that to 6%.  The CES sets out steps to achieve that.  The percentages that Deputy Ward has set out do not have the strategy and the plan set out in the CES to achieve them.  I do not think that we could achieve them.  We will be pressed to get to the 6% by the start of 2025 as it is.  While ambition is important, I do not believe in setting unachievable numbers just for the sake of doing so.   If we get to 6% by the start of 2025 we will have doubled the percentage of people who are employed in the public sector.  That will be a positive development.  We can look to grow it further, as I think we should.  Whoever is in this role at that stage will hopefully do so.  The figures that are in the Bill are figures that are based on the comprehensive employment strategy.  That is the strategy everyone is working towards.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been very engaged in it.  She and I met with the chair of the comprehensive employment strategy, Fergus Finlay, just last week.  We discussed the sustained efforts that need to be made to increase the employment rates of persons with disabilities generally, as well as in the public service.  I think that it is going to be tough to get the figures that are set out in this Bill.  I will be working very hard towards them, as will my Department.  I want to see the entire public infrastructure do so.  However, we will be pushed to get to 6%.  I do not believe that setting a higher target will change that fact.</p></speech>

They will struggle to reach 6% by 2025.  It is my understanding that designated public officials, DPOs, and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, are not happy with the percentage of the targets.  They are happy with the percentage targets that I have put forward in my amendments.  As I said, I did not try to reinvent the wheel.  I did not try to go very far.  These are small percentages.  I know that the Minister is struggling, as he said, to reach the 6% figure.  To me, that says that the strategy itself is not working, if they will struggle to get to the figure of 6% by 2025.  I will move and press all of these amendments.</p></speech>

This Bill provides clarity on the role of IHREC's disability advisory committee.  Given Ireland's obligation under articles 4.3 and 33 of the CRPD, it would be more appropriate to increase the required proportion of disabled people on the committee from half, as is currently in the Bill to two thirds of its membership.  This still allows for members of other interested stakeholders and allies, including family members of disabled people, while ensuring that disabled people remain in the clear majority on the committee.  </p></speech>

The role of this committee is to assist IHREC as part of its function in the monitoring of the implementation of the UNCRPD in the State.</p><p>Section 86 of the Bill currently requires that at least half of the persons appointed to the committee must be persons with disabilities.  Noting that current provision already ensures significant representation of disabled persons on the committee, it is important to allow the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, a measure of flexibility in identifying members with a full range of skills and expertise to support it in its functions.  It is intended that the expertise available would come from a range of sources and that the current provisions of the Bill will already ensure that the majority of that expertise comes from experts by experience.  I am not proposing to make a change on this provision.</p></speech>

It is necessary to clarify the relationship between a care representatives and a decision supporter.  My officials are liaising with counterparts in the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General on that.  This is in response to a number of amendments that were ruled out of order.  Following agreement between the Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, and me, I will bring forward an amendment to the issue of the provision of legal aid under Part 6 for this and other relevant sectors to ensure that legal aid is available for wards exiting wardship under Part 6 of the Act.  This will give existing wards the same supports as persons making new decision support applications.</p> <p>  The Department of Health has advised my Department that amendments may be necessary to assist with the creation of a register for advanced healthcare directives.  If this proves necessary I will move the required amendments.</p> <p>  With regard to transitional arrangements for ongoing wardship applications, I intend to amend section 56 of the 2015 Act to provide for transitional arrangements.  In the run-up to the commencement of 2015 Act, concerns have been brought to my attention from practitioner organisations and the HSE that provisions for persons who have been subject of wardship applications that have not completed prior to the commencement of the Act are desirable.  These would ensure continuity of care and avoid additional expense.  I will bring amendments to address these cases, and ensure that these applications can be processed to completion after the commencement of the Act, and that as part of these proceedings an exit date from wardship is also set up for such persons.</p> <p>  I will bring additional amendments to section 4 of the 2015 Act following preparation for commencement.  I have been advised by the Courts Service that it would be desirable to clarify the operation of the Circuit Court in the context of geographical location and emergency applications.</p> <p>  I will also bring an amendment to clarify the operation of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to the Act.</p></speech>

Dr. Caroline Heary, researcher at the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, declined the invitation to attend as the subject matter of the meeting is outside her area of expertise.</p> <p>  The witnesses are here to discuss the educational supports provision for displaced Ukrainian students.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite each of the witnesses to make a brief five-minute opening statement.  Members will then each have an eight-minute slot to ask questions and receive responses from the witnesses.  I ask the witnesses to keep an eye on the time during their five-minute opening statements.  This is because there are several of them present and we wish to give the members an opportunity to come in.  I also ask the members to keep an eye on the time during their slots.</p> <p>  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that one should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in a speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statement is potentially defamatory with regard to an identified person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Ryan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the lead caseworker on the migration services team of the Irish Red Cross.  To give some context to my role on the team, the Irish Red Cross is tasked under its mandate as an auxiliary to the Government to co-ordinate offers of support from the public, to support the placement of refugees into accommodation and to support the social integration of refugees at community level.</p> <p>  The strategic goal of the programme is to enable refugees in Ireland to integrate into Irish society and achieve their potential.  The Irish Red Cross has been providing support in this regard to the Government since 2015 to assist in the fulfilment of its EU commitment to promote the resettlement and integration of refugees under the Irish refugee protection programme.  In addition to the cohort of Ukrainian people with whom we are currently working, the migration services team also works with numerous people from Syria and Afghanistan and supports community sponsorship programmes.</p> <p>  The migration services team has been working in co-ordination with the Government and partner organisations to assist in the Irish nation&rsquo;s response to the war in Ukraine.  The caseworker team provides active casework support to Ukrainians in Ireland through the matching of suitable accommodation and providing support to essential needs, such as access to medical support, social welfare and education, where required, in association with relevant Departments.</p><p>Regarding the purpose of today&rsquo;s meeting, when discussing education and supports provision for displaced Ukrainian students, my main questions will be raised from a caseworker perspective, and will be influenced by the experiences I have witnessed with my clients.  The main struggle I have seen evidenced among parents in Ireland is finding suitable access to school places in Ireland.  With many schools already at capacity and with waiting lists, not all Ukrainian children have easy access to Irish education.</p><p> Access to additional language support and English lessons will ease much of the tension felt by students who have been thrown into a new learning environment in a foreign language but it would be my</p><p>recommendation to extend these supports within schools to include parents also.  The provision of psychological supports for Ukrainian students in Ireland requires either appropriate language support for translation or a system whereby Ukrainian health care professionals in Ireland are given the means to practise in the State.  </p><p> I look forward to today's discussion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Nuala Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022061400002#C00300"><p>I thank the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science for the invitation to appear today to discuss the provision of education and associated supports for displaced Ukrainian students.  As members of the committee are aware, the Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office, OCO, is an independent statutory body.  It was established in 2004 under the Ombudsman for Children Act with two core statutory functions.  One is to promote the rights and welfare of children up to 18 years of age, and the other is to examine and investigate complaints made by or for children about the administrative actions of public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals that have, or may have, adversely affected a child.</p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children&rsquo;s Office notes figures published by the Department of Education on 6 June which indicate almost 7,000 Ukrainian children have been enrolled into the Irish education system.  We welcome the action by the State in providing supports for children and families under the temporary protection directive.  We also welcome work by school communities, NGOs and community organisations in supporting the inclusion and integration of children who have fled Ukraine into our communities and education system.  We especially welcome efforts to support unaccompanied minors who have arrived into Ireland from Ukraine without a parent or guardian, which we understand totalled 146 children at the start of June.  </p> <p>  We want to talk briefly about curriculum provision.  We note exemptions from studying the Irish language are being issued in line with existing Department of Education guidance in Circulars 0052/2019 and 0053/2019, which we understand are currently under review.  This means that children arriving from Ukraine under the age of 12, who do not have significant learning difficulties as detailed in the circulars, may not qualify for exemptions.  We suggest that children may benefit from a more flexible approach to Irish language exemptions, and we have recently engaged with the Department in this regard.  We have been assured that any changes to this circular would include consideration of the best interest of the child and we hope that will be reflected in practice.  As we know, children under the age of 12, for example, may benefit from additional time in their school day to adapt to studying English as an additional language, or for work in supporting their movement to a different national curriculum.  </p> <p>  On language provision, we welcome the commitments relating to language supports for Ukrainian children in Irish schools, including through the establishment of regional education and language teams, REALT.  We note from the meeting of this committee on 1 June that 724 primary schools and 194 post-primary schools now have English as an additional language, EA, teaching resources, with additional EA support hours allocated based on numbers of Ukrainian children enrolled.  These supports are key to ensuring children who do not have fluency in English can fully enjoy their right to education and they need to be adequately resourced and funded.  </p> <p>  We also welcome the publication of information by the Department in Ukrainian.  Going forward, it is important there is not a reliance on children to support communication between schools and their parents or guardians.  We would urge that all efforts are made to help parents and guardians to integrate into school communities, and to help them make informed decisions.  Interpretation and translation services, therefore, should also be provided to schools.  </p> <p>  We also welcome the announcement of the summer inclusion programme.  Culturally responsive education supports are important tools in ensuring integration and inclusion.  The use of intercultural workers in schools &ndash; as in Northern Ireland through the intercultural education service &ndash; is an example of good practice in promoting integration of children into schools.  Due consideration should be given by the Department of Education, school boards, REALT and schools to providing culturally responsive supports to children as they transition into the Irish school system.  </p> <p>  In relation to psychological supports, I reiterate the OCO&rsquo;s existing position as a strong proponent of the inclusion of therapeutic mental health support and services within all schools.  Under Article 39 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child "State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of...armed conflicts". Thousands of children are entering the Irish education system who may have experienced significant trauma, and extensive consideration needs to be given to facilitating psychological recovery.  Children with family in Ukraine and Russia may also be experiencing significant distress relating to the ongoing conflict.  We welcome work by NEPS to support schools, including developing guidance.  However, the complex needs of these children are unlikely to be met by existing staff and resources.  Guidance should be supported by therapeutic mental health support and services within schools. </p> <p>  In relation to other issues, we believe there are some matters that require further consideration.  On special educational needs, we welcome comments in this committee by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Josepha Madigan, regarding students entering schools with special educational needs, SEN.  This includes the involvement of the NCSE in REALT, and work by the Department of Education with the HSE to ensure a joined-up approach.  </p> <p>  It is important that language and educational attainment are assessed separately, and schools have adequate resources to support children in both regards in order that children who have special educational needs can be identified and supported.  The provision of special educational needs school places cannot keep up with current demand.  We are concerned that, with significant numbers of children from Ukraine entering Irish schools, there will be an increasing gap between available provision and provision needed.  </p> <p>  Finally on school transport, it is important to note that Ukrainian children may, in some cases, be housed in accommodation from which it is difficult to access the nearest school or local community.  This potentially creates a barrier to accessing education.  We would like to understand the status of the grant scheme proposed by the Department of Education to cover school transport costs for children in these circumstances.  </p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to meet today and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I am the assistant director of children's services in Barnardos in the north of Dublin.  I am delighted to be here today.  Barnardos provides front-line services to children and their families.  We work with children and families who have been affected by traumatic life situations such as poverty, abuse, mental health challenges, neglect, separation, bereavement and parental addiction.  We offer a range of early intervention and targeted services in our 45 locations across the country and we work in homes, family homes, schools, early learning and care settings and in the wider community.</p> <p>  Since the first Ukrainian families began arriving into Ireland, Barnardos has been identifying opportunities to provide support and lend expertise wherever it is likely to be of direct benefit to these families or to the agencies working directly with them.  This has included proactively exploring how best to respond to the immediate and longer term needs of Ukrainian children and parents arriving into Ireland by liaising with colleagues in Tusla and those within the children and young people's services committee.  We also reach out to hotels and other facilities where large numbers of Ukrainian refugees are being housed to offer our Breath Body Mind programme.  This programme has been shown to be particularly helpful for those who have experienced trauma.  The programme specialises in releasing the impact of trauma from the body.  We also advise schools on how to support the well-being of children by supporting them to feel they are in a place of safety which will allow children to regulate their emotions, learn, and make friends.  It is only when children have a balanced nervous system that they are able to engage positively, learn, and make friends with their peers.  </p> <p>  There is a focus on the importance of minimising sensory triggers in schools, supporting a predictable routine, and supporting children with language barriers.  Working with Ukrainian refugees in Dublin Airport and City West assessment centres, Barnardos is developing training with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Our bereavement service is providing training to hotel staff housing Ukrainian families who have been bereaved.  We also hold webinars with guidance for early years educators to support children from Ukraine, and provide resources for there early years educators. </p> <p>  Focusing on psychological supports, many Ukrainians who have come to Ireland over the past few months have faced considerable trauma.  This trauma includes fleeing war; death of a family member or parent; being forced to leave their homes and their families homes suddenly; enduring a challenging journey; and entering a new country without speaking the language.  It is important that agencies working with these children, be it for housing, health or education, take into account the trauma they have been through and consider this when designing the help they intend to provide.  As children and families settle in Ireland and the immediate requirements such as housing are met, adequate attention should be given to wider needs, such as psychological well-being.  Schools should adopt a strengths-based approach to Ukrainian children, with a trauma-informed lens.  The children have experienced huge disruption to their lives.  They may be more sensitive and alert to their surroundings and less tolerant to sudden changes.  From our experience, children who have gone through considerable disruption and have been without a routine for some time can find it difficult to adapt to new rules and regulations. Where schools identify children who are particularly struggling, they should be able to refer them to family support agencies, such as Barnardos.</p><p>We can work with families and schools to provide them with the support needed to address school refusal or behavioural problems and build structure and routines again, helping children to find it easier to integrate into schools and to adapt to their rules and systems.</p><p> Schools should consider what it is like for Ukrainian children from the moment they connect with the school, including when they are in class, and think about how they can make it easier for them to adjust and how the schools can make it a more straightforward process for getting into school, getting through the process and getting used to a new routine and being made feel welcome.  This extends to the school environment &ndash; the layout of the classroom and school, where is the child going to sit and who will sit beside the child - and helping children to be aware of this information before they get there.  We urge the Government to help schools provide a strengths-based approach and that training be provided for schools so that all services working with these families can provide compassionate and considered supports that take into account all the trauma they have experienced.</p></speech>

I will speak on the further and higher education element of the committee's remit.  I will begin with a little information on what the Irish Refugee Council does.  Removing barriers to access to further and higher education is one of our key pillars.  In recent years, there has been considerable impact and success and State-driven changes to broaden access to further and higher education, which we strongly welcome.  We also administer an education fund each year, which is just about to open.  Ukrainian refugees will be eligible to apply to it.  That is supported by independent donations and in the last year we supported more than 500 people - refugees, protection applicants and Ukrainian refugees - who had inquiries about further and higher education.<br/><br/>I take this opportunity to emphasise to the committee that we believe that in addressing the needs of people from Ukraine in accessing education, be they children or adults, the State has a unique opportunity to remove barriers facing all refugees and international protection applicants.  Maintaining a focus on equality of access will be crucial to ensuring we do not, either intentionally or unintentionally, create a tiered system of education access.  In the context of children, we reiterate that we must cherish all children equally.<br/><br/>Our recommendations are broken down into three categories.  I will begin by speaking about education for children and make one point on that.  It is to draw attention again to the necessity for equal allocation of resources.  I refer to the report yesterday by Emma O'Kelly of RT&Eacute; and primary school teachers flagging the issue of English language supports being given to Ukrainian children and not to other children from a protection-seeking background.  We must level up, not level down.<br/><br/>In terms of our recommendations regarding Ukrainian refugees and all refugees, the first category is the administration of support schemes.  <i>The Irish Times</i>reported in mid-May that Ukrainian college students were to get grants and free education.  We strongly recommend that all refugees and protection applicants would be eligible for this.  This is something we have advocated frequently to the Department and to other stakeholders.  That would require a change to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, scheme, the free fees initiative and the student support scheme whereby refugees and all people seeking protection would be eligible.<br/><br/>The second recommendation relates to the timing of various supports.  This includes, for example, the Central Applications Office, CAO.  I understand the opportunity to apply has passed.  If students are going to access further and higher education in September 2022, there might have to be a mechanism that allows people to apply to get into university at that date.  In addition, both the back to education allowance, BTEA, and the voluntary training opportunity scheme, VTOS, require a period of receiving social welfare.  For the BTEA it is three to nine months and for VTOS it is six months.  We recommend that if people on temporary protection are going to be eligible to receive those supports, the three-month and six-month requirements be waived.<br/><br/>We also have recommendations on ensuring that third country nationals who have fled Ukraine would be eligible for education opportunities.  This is a much smaller proportion of the total number of Ukrainian refugees in Ireland, but they cannot be forgotten.  Work will also have to be done on the recognition of prior learning - we have a report on this - and particularly the recognition of healthcare qualifications.  Our report will be launched later in July.  Work will have to be done on ensuring that adults have access to English language supports.  Education and training boards are doing strong work there, but there will need to be a recognition of proper resourcing, particularly in areas where many refugees are living.<br/><br/>To conclude, we believe this is a great opportunity to support not only refugees from Ukraine but also all refugees and people seeking protection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.373" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022061400002#D00300"><p>The Library Association of Ireland school libraries group thanks the committee for inviting us to this discussion on educational supports provision for displaced Ukrainian students.  As outlined in our original submission to the committee last month, we believe school libraries have an integral role to play in providing a wide range of curriculum, language, emotional, well-being, psychological and other supports to Ukrainian and other displaced students.</p> <p>  A school library is a dedicated space in a school managed by a professional school librarian where all students can feel welcome, learn and grow.  Libraries give students access to supports and resources they otherwise would not have in school and they offer a sanctuary to all students, especially those who may be living in cramped or overcrowded conditions.  Students can gather within the library space both within and beyond the school day not only to learn and cultivate their ideas but also to relax, re-gather their emotions and connect with each other.  School librarians are not constrained by the demands of the curriculum and are therefore perfectly placed to quickly transition their supports and services to meet the particular needs of any student cohort at any point in time.</p> <p>  However, only 30 schools in Ireland have publicly-funded school libraries stocked by professional librarians.  These are all part of the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, Demonstration Library Project and all operate in second level delivering equality of education in schools, DEIS, schools.  Several hundred Ukrainian students have joined these 30 schools over the past few months and our JCSP librarians have already introduced a wide range of tailored literacy, reading and well-being support programmes, including multilingual welcome packs, books, dictionaries and other resources in students' own languages, support materials across all subject areas and much more.  Many of our librarians are opening their libraries in the early morning to facilitate students to attend early morning online Ukrainian school classes using library devices and computers, a very important support for the many students wishing to continue their Ukrainian education.  Ukrainian students have been integrated into the wide range of extra-curricular library clubs and societies, and our librarians have organised a range of arts and cultural trips for these students to help them to integrate into Irish society.</p> <p>  Supports to wider family members include parents book clubs, facilitating loans, both physical and virtual, to parents and younger siblings, block loans of book collections at local accommodation hubs and so forth.  These supports will continue over the summer months in the form of library summer camps, ongoing library book club meetings, ongoing access to the JCSP libraries' digital library service and introducing students to local youth groups to ensure their continued engagement and entertainment over the summer months.  Plans are already in place for a number of cross-school JCSP library events and initiatives to support Ukrainian students in the coming year, including themed cross-school Narrative 4 story exchange sessions.  All our JCSP librarians are trained Narrative 4 empathy education facilitators.  Cross-school chess tournaments, bilingual creative writing, book clubs, pen pals and other initiatives are also planned.</p> <p>  The JCSP digital library service currently provides access to over 42,000 e-books and e-audio books to all students and staff in second level DEIS schools.  The collection includes over 600 titles across 26 different languages, including Ukrainian and Russian.  We are currently working with our platform providers and with Post-Primary Languages Ireland, PPLI, to increase significantly the number of Ukrainian, Russian and bilingual titles available to students.  A collection of over 400 digital magazine titles has also been added which will be available for simultaneous borrowing by all students.  Access to this digital collection is of immense value to our Ukrainian students and we strongly believe that all second level schools and Youthreach centres should be provided with immediate access for all their students.</p><p>The school libraries group acknowledges the committee's recognition of the vital importance of school libraries and school librarians in its recent report on leaving certificate reform and we thank the committee for it.  The committee's recommendations in that report are equally, if not more, applicable to the subject of supports for Ukrainian and other displaced students.  We firmly believe that all students, not just those in 30 schools, should have access to a bright, vibrant, well-stocked school library space and to the knowledge and skills of a professional school librarian and that all should have access to a bespoke, professionally curated school digital library service.  We recommend that a national advisory group on school library provision be set up immediately with the key aim of planning for the implementation of this committee's recent recommendation that there be a school library, a school librarian and fully access to a digital library service in all primary and post-primary schools in Ireland.  As an immediate measure, the further expansion of the junior certificate school programme, JCSP, demonstration library project to further DEIS schools and the extension of access to the JCSP digital library service to all second level schools and Youthreach centres should be in place for the start of the 2022-2023 school year.  This could be achieved quite easily and it would be of immense value to Ukrainian and, indeed, all students.  Now is the time to act on putting these provisions in place.  The members of the school libraries group and the JCSP library project will gladly make ourselves available over the summer months to assist with their implementation.  I thank the committee for listening to my statement.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I was reading their statements last night and this morning and it is worth noting the invaluable work they do all year round and the invaluable service they provide for children and for those on the margins.  It should not be just in times of crisis that we acknowledge their work.  The Ministers came before the committee two weeks ago, when we held two 45-minute sessions.  I will make some comments with regard to what we raised with the Ministers.  If any particular person wants to respond, that is fine.  I do not want to put anybody on the spot.</p> <p>  There were three main issues.  One was the issue of displacement.  Teething problems have come to my notice.  Of course, there will be such problems in light of the number of Ukrainian refugees and families who have arrived in Ireland but we have seen situations in which children have settled into a school environment and the uniform has been bought.  These children may have seen and heard very traumatic things, they may be worried about family members and, of course, they face the language issue.  I am given to understand that they can then, with very little notice, be moved from point A to point B, with point B being in a very rural setting.  I do not know if the witnesses wish to comment on how that is being managed and communicated to the education system.</p> <p>  On a second issue, children with special educational needs may be more integrated or knitted into a school setting because their needs are being met in that school.  Is the system too rigid to accommodate that?  The Minister recognised what I was saying about that having an even bigger impact on a family but I was not convinced that there was sufficient fluidity in the system to allow for that level of education for such young people to be maintained, notwithstanding the difficulties with accommodation.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to the last point I wish to make.  A situation like this is going to expose some of the frailties and fault lines in provision for children.  That is good.  We should never waste a good crisis.  If this exposes existing problems within the system as regards education provision and the supports we provide for children, we should rise to that challenge.  However, it has been said and is demonstrably true that there is a dichotomy between what is now being afforded to Ukrainian children and what is being afforded to children already within the protection system.  I agree with Mr. Henderson's point that it should not be the case that we treat Ukrainian children in the way children already in the system are being treated.  If we can provide a greater level of language support for Ukrainian children, then all children should benefit from that higher level of support.  I would not want it to be said of the Irish system that is has one attitude towards - let us be blunt - white Christians on the edge of Europe and another towards those who are not white Christians and not from the edge of Europe.  That is an uncomfortable sentence to have to utter but if that is the underlying suspicion within the Irish education system and among practitioners, it is a very troubling one.  I have experience of being a Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality and I must say that I did not come away feeling that the Department was fit to deal with this entire area.  I was extremely welcoming of the move by the current Government to take a lot of this responsibility away from that Department and to give it to the new Department under the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  That was a very positive move showing a much more humane mindset.  </p> <p>  Those are my points.  I mentioned the continuum of education for all children, how it can be managed and the displacement element.  I also mentioned children with special educational needs and how that issue needs to be properly recognised.  My third point was on the exposure of the dichotomy or split in the system between what Ukrainian children and young people are being afforded with regard to language supports and what is being afforded to those already in the system.  I would like to hear the witnesses' comments on that and on how it should be addressed.  I am interested in what any of the witnesses have to say.</p></speech>

In our field, anything that is introduced to benefit a particular group benefits everybody in that all services provided through a school library are provided for the whole school.  There may be a focus on a particular group at a particular point in time.  We have put in particular supports for Ukrainian students but those supports, whether investment in resources or anything else, are there for the benefit of everybody in the school.  They can be targeted but whatever is introduced benefits everybody.</p></speech>

It is something that can have a significant impact on children, especially children who have experienced trauma.  I refer to a sudden change without information, without choice and without control.  The impact of trauma we see children experiencing is such that they are constantly scanning their environment for threats, constantly uncertain as to what is going to happen next and constantly in a state of high arousal, which has an impact on their physical well-being, their behaviour, their interaction with peers and their relationships with others.  They will also bounce off of their parents' high arousal when they also are not aware of what is happening next.</p> <p>  I can refer to a situation in Dublin.  We were reaching out to a group that was housed in one of our regions.  We were trying to provide our Breath Body Mind programme.  We had developed this programme but up to 150 people were then moved quite suddenly within a day or two.  We see the impact of that.  Children who have experienced trauma need safety, security, certainty and stability.  They need to know what is happening next and they need to be made aware of it before it happens.  When you are in a traumatic situation, control and choice are very important to you.  They help you to overcome the sense of powerlessness that comes with trauma.  From the point of view of Barnardos, early information, certainty, security, safety, knowing what is going to happen next and being made aware at the first point of contact what is happening today and what is likely to happen next week and in a few weeks is an absolutely necessity for these children.  Sudden changes, such as being taken out of a school before being taken to another centre and going to another school, retraumatise and retrigger children.</p></speech>

This is an opportunity to level up for all and, if we are going to make changes, to make them for everyone who is seeking protection.  I have been clear on this point and do not want to labour it too much.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's first point, and as my colleague stated, good communication can mitigate some of the anguish that a short notice removal can create.  If children and their parents who are in a temporary accommodation space will be moving to medium or longer term accommodation at a future date, and if the children are in school and will have to leave that school and go to a different one in future, telling them may mitigate some of the anguish that this will create.</p> <p>  I will make two additional points.  I hate to say it, but this phenomenon is not new to us as an organisation in the context of direct provision.  It happens frequently.  It will always exist, particularly if we are not getting on top of accommodation issues.  As has been evident over recent days, there are real and challenging issues with the provision of accommodation.  Short notice movements are a symptom of the State always looking for accommodation because there is a shortage.</p></speech>

I am concerned about an issue that I have raised directly with the Minister, namely, the carrying out of an assessment of the impact that the large number of students entering our education system will have.  Some assessment should have been done in order to plan adequately and be prepared for the unprecedented situation we are now facing.  An assessment would have been key.  What are the witnesses&rsquo; thoughts on this point?</p> <p>  I have been contacted by many schools that have not been consulted or collaborated with by the Department of Education.  It appears that there are gaps that need to be addressed and that there should be more collaboration.  Have the witnesses discovered the same?  I am sure they have.</p> <p>  There are already large gaps in special education provision.  In County Offaly where I am from, we have no special educational needs organiser, SENO.  For the Ukrainian children who have come to County Offaly, there is no SENO.  The gaps need to be addressed.  Are the witnesses&rsquo; organisations also encountering this issue of there being no one in place to deal with a situation or allocate the resources that children fleeing war need?  I imagine that it is an issue across the country and not just in my county.</p> <p>  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; thoughts on the need for an assessment.  It is not too late to carry one out.  We should be conducting one.  The wait-and-see approach could cause problems and we do not want one crisis unintentionally creating another.</p></speech>

Among my clients, I have parents who have approached multiple schools &ndash; sometimes upwards of 15 &ndash; seeking spaces for their children in secondary education but who have been told that they have to adapt within, that is, the children will either have to repeat a year or go into a year with a different age group that is inappropriate for them.  My clients are experiencing significant issues with certain years, in particular first year.  No provision is being made to adapt to this situation.  There are children of this age who need to be placed in schools, but there are schools that are restricted in how many students they can have in a class.</p> <p>  Now that we are in the summer period, something could be introduced.  For example, exceptions could be implemented that would allow schools to expand their class sizes to accommodate these children.  The summer period is a time when actions should be put in place.  It is a pause during which case workers, supporters and parents of Ukrainian children can get a chance to find appropriate school placements and a guarantee, which would remove the sense of insecurity for the parents and the children.  The same applies to special education access.  We are in a window in which the holes can be filled. </p></speech>

From a trauma-informed care perspective, that starts from the second you have your first contact with that child.  It is about understanding what has happened to the child, what the child has been through or may be about to go through, and what the child may be experiencing at home.  It is a question of training in and understanding trauma behaviours and what they look like.  It will not be the same for every child.  Some will look like perfectionists and seem to be doing fine but will be withdrawn, frozen and shut down.  Others will be aggressive, volatile and easily triggered.  It is about helping schools to understand that they might get any number of children at any point on the continuum of trauma.  It is about providing training for schools, building capacity, upskilling and supporting them in terms of knowing what to expect and how to support these children when there may be upwards of 30 other children in the class to look after.  It is also about training schools in how to talk to children about their experiences and showing the importance of being able to do that.  As such, an assessment to see what supports are needed or an understanding that supports in terms of training and upskilling are likely to be necessary would be helpful.</p></speech>

Our office has been vocal about this matter in recent weeks.  Indeed, we will be publishing a report on forward planning in the coming weeks.  We know the needs of these children from when they are born and grow into early childhood.  We can identify them, so why we cannot plan in advance to meet the needs of children with special education needs is questionable.</p> <p>  It is a fundamental right that children have access to education, so not having school places is of deep concern, especially for children arriving from Ukraine.  Education is where they will make their friends, get to know about this new country that they have arrived in and learn the language.  It is critical for their recovery that they have school places.</p> <p>  I agree with my colleague that this is a pause.  There is a crisis, but this is a time to gather information on what has worked and what has not worked and to implement a new process for the new academic year in September.</p></speech>

We have said that there needs to be a greater focus on planning, logistics, co-ordination and medium- and long-term preparation of accommodation and education.  This could entail a director of Ukraine response, given that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is under significant strain and the Department of Education has a wide and busy brief.  A director of Ukraine response would not mitigate all of these issues but could help to co-ordinate, plan, ensure better national to local co-ordination and bring together central government.</p> <p>  What we are discussing at this meeting is symptomatic of the fact that Ireland has given a strong welcome to refugees from Ukraine, for which we commend it strongly.</p><p>It is exceptional in many ways.  A short-term humanitarian emergency response must be matched with a long-term planning methodology, however, which is probably missing at the moment.</p></speech>

I thank them very much for their comprehensive overviews.  I listened very attentively and a large part of what they are talking about is access to more therapeutic mental health services, more urgent assessments and English language supports.  We would expect many of those services in schools in any case but that all needs to be stepped up.  Obviously, it is a job for the Department of Education to quantify that.  Do the witnesses have an idea of the quantities we might be missing at the moment to support the numbers of children that are coming in?</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in mentioned that he felt it was correct for this to fall under the remit of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I certainly think that is true.  I take the point Mr. Henderson mentioned, however, which is that we now require long-term planning and it falls to other Departments to do that.  Part of that is accommodation.  Nobody wants to move children from one place to another but we need to ensure that parents have access to jobs and accommodation.  That is the reason it is done.  It is weighing up what is in the best interest of the children overall and putting in the supports.  The witnesses might comment on what might be needed in a long-term plan from other Departments outside of that integration piece.</p> <p>  It is also important to recognise the really positive contribution Ukrainian people are making in the lives of Irish people.  My daughter and her best friend, who is Moldovan, were asked to do a passion project in their school and their passion project was Ukraine.  It really has captured children's imaginations.  That is also a really unique opportunity for us that will have long-term benefits if we all get this right and live in harmony with each other.</p></speech>

It allows the relationship to level back so that the parent is not dependent on the child to provide translation for things that are beyond his or her responsibility.  It is, therefore, about extending these supports and recognising that supporting children often needs to extend to supporting their extended family as well, particularly around help for integration and access to work and jobs.  Expanding that access is important.</p></speech>

I cannot give information on the size of the gaps, if you like, in terms of the specifics.  However, I would say that it is really important to think about service provision or support provision in terms of both a micro and macro perspective.  Teachers in a school who notice that a child is struggling should be able to have a service to which they can refer that child directly for his or her own bespoke support.</p> <p>  Additionally, in terms of scope from the macro perspective, teachers should be able to assume there will be support for them in terms of upskilling and learning to provide to the whole classroom and whole group of potentially Ukrainian children who may in turn require support.  Then, in individual schools, there will be an element of support that is necessary, like my colleague, Ms Ward, spoke about, in terms of therapeutic support within the school with which children can be supported.  There are layers of support and meeting all those layers would be a very helpful process with which to start.</p> <p>  In terms of the movement of children, I completely agree that nobody intends to suddenly move children.  There is always a reason for it; there is a purpose.  As my colleague, Mr. Henderson, and I said, the important thing here is the "How".  It is the time to plan.  There should be an understanding that this is not the place a child will be forever; it is a place where he or she will be for now.  Then, when it comes time to be in the next place, this is what that will look like.  It is setting the path and the journey for children in a way they understand it so they know what they are doing and that while they are in one place, they have what they need at that time.  They have the stimulation support and all their basic needs while they are there, as do their families, but they know what is coming next.</p></speech>

I completely agree.  We believe that we need to stop viewing this in terms of the pathway to protection.  This is a human rights and children's rights approach.  We have international obligations in that regard and, therefore, one Department cannot fix everything.  It must be an all-of-government response.  We all spoke about the pressures with regard to accommodation.  Children need a secure home to start to recover, go to school, have a base and feel secure.  Of course, that cannot be fixed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That needs to have the local authorities and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage sitting at the table.  It is the same with the Department of Education and Department of Health.  It has to be an all-of-government response to meet the needs of these children.  It cannot be left with one person; it just will not work.</p></speech>

Do we have the data yet as to where people are?  Do we have a mapping of the services?  Do we know what existing services need in addition to what they are already doing, bearing in mind that many servicers are already quite exhausted?  Are we able to do needs assessments for the children themselves?  I do not think we are at that stage.  As colleagues said, with two and a half months to go until the start of the new school term, there is an opportunity to try to put those things in place but it would be quite a substantial piece of work.  It is essential, however, if we are going to start September with a more organised system in place.</p></speech>

One of the things we have seen is that many of those who have come in have been placed in transition year if they are aged 15 or more.  Some would be more advanced than that.  Our librarians have often reported that students have particular aspirations for their careers.  They may want to be an engineer, architect or whatever and they are planning they subjects they will need when they move into fifth or sixth year next year.  However, the sudden movement of a student then to another school where those subjects may not be available does not seem to be taken into account in terms of their individual needs.  It is accommodation over everything else.  It is extremely traumatic for those students that they are not necessarily assessed for where they see themselves progressing in the education system and their careers in the future.  Many of them are very focused on where they want to be.  It needs to be taken into account that we are putting them somewhere and then taking the ground from under them again when we move them to somewhere those aspirations cannot be met.</p></speech>

It is important at the outset to acknowledge the generous response of the Government and, more importantly, the generous response of the Irish public.</p> <p>  My assessment is that this generosity is due to the fact that this is a unique event, certainly in this century.  It has resulted in the invocation of the Temporary Protection Directive that was introduced in 2001, something that has not happened before.  At the outset, I want to say I think that is the reason why there has been such a response to this event.</p> <p>  I will start by asking Ms Ryan about the role that is played by the Irish Red Cross.  I know it is slightly off the topic but it does relate to a point Ms Ward mentioned earlier about secure accommodation for children.</p><p>I have met people recently who have registered with the Red Cross; they filled out the application forms but have not heard anything back.  Is there a reason for the delay in terms of getting Ukrainian families fixed up with Irish homes that want to take them?</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy that in regard to the role of the caseworker in matching and placing families in accommodation, our priority from the outset of this war has been to place families with high needs, be it medical needs, risk of retraumatisation or an additional reason, perhaps due to highly unsuitable accommodation options or to the nature of the families we have been assigned.  Our priority has been focused on vacant properties where a family has their own door, their own kitchen, their own space, their own areas and their own time to breathe and to settle in.  Our priority, working in collaboration with other organisations and other partners, has been placing families into vacant accommodation while working in the background on shared accommodation options.  There may be issues around vetting and processes that simply take time, but they are necessary processes to ensure the safety of the individuals being placed.</p></speech>

Also, when we are talking about these offerings, quite often a pledge of a vacant property is an offer of a minimum of one year and most of the shared accommodation offers begin at six months.  Again, it is about trying to prioritise sustainability for families with high needs but we have been placing people into shared accommodation as well.</p></speech>

Is she satisfied they are being cared for adequately?  Can she give us an update as to how that is progressing for those unaccompanied minors?</p></speech>

We have written to and are due to meet Tusla - the Child and Family Agency, which has responsibility for these children.  We had flagged in recent years that we had concerns in regard to unaccompanied minors arriving into Ireland.  In particular, as members may be aware, they come into State care but when they turn 18 and if they are not still in education, the vast majority transfer into the direct provision system.  We had very serious concerns about that.  We also had concerns about vulnerability assessments which are required to be done for unaccompanied minors under the recast directive, and we had raised that with Tusla previously in recent years.</p> <p>  Our meeting on Thursday is about a range of issues, including the issue raised by the Deputy.  We want to be assured.  We want to know we are meeting all of our international obligations towards these children.  We also want to be assured they are safe, that they are being looked after and that they are being accommodated in places that are subject to inspection and regulation, like any other child arriving into Ireland without a guardian or parent, or, indeed, children coming into State care.  That is what we are meeting about on Thursday.  We are looking forward to the meeting and we are hoping that, afterwards, we will be able to answer very comprehensively that we are meeting our obligations and looking after these children appropriately.</p></speech>

Is that a much more difficult task in terms of the language difficulties that exist, with children coming here who may not have the capacity speak English?</p></speech>

It is very important, when we consider meeting the educational needs of children, that we assess not only their academic abilities but also their fluency in English.  There are two separate processes and there is a very real risk they may become overlapped, and that if children do not have fluency in English, that may be seen within the context of their academic ability.  We are very clear that these are two separate processes so children get both of their needs met.</p></speech>

Our webinars and supports are around the trauma-informed care perspective, what to expect, how to set up an environment that can work towards balancing children's nervous systems, how to approach children who may respond differently, and how to recognise different behaviours that may indicate there are additional needs for that child or may indicate there is trauma behaviour.  It may be parental support that is required for these children or it may be about supporting early years settings, in particular, in these webinars, to help to communicate with parents about how to support their children with the needs they have, whatever they may be presenting with.  It is also about looking at availability of services in the area and how they can understand what is happening for that child in order to integrate that child into their service and provide support for that child and their parent.</p></speech>

I am conscious that the European Commission back in March or April made a recommendation about the recognition of professional and academic qualifications.  Is enough being done in Ireland to facilitate Ukrainian people who have come with qualifications so those qualifications can be recognised?  I am conscious that Ms Ryan mentioned something about that in terms of healthcare workers.</p></speech>

We are producing a report in July, not just on Ukrainian refugees, but on access to all persons from outside the European Union having their healthcare qualifications recognised.  It may be that the nursing profession is putting in place some changes in that regard but I do not have a significant read on it.  It is something we will be publishing on in July.</p></speech>

At some stage, is that going to have to terminate?  I can understand the benefit of it but, as time goes on, could it become confusing for children?</p></speech>

Integration into the Irish education system is hugely important but the hope on arrival is that they will be returning home.  Certainly, for those who are at a later stage in their education and who would be leading up to exams equivalent to our leaving certificate, Ukrainian teachers are providing online education to their students.  Sometimes the teachers are still in Ukraine or they may be in another country, but the students dial in and follow that.  It is very difficult for them because they start at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. and that is followed by a full day in the Irish education system and then back to a sports hall or wherever they may be living oftentimes.  It is very traumatic for them and we have to acknowledge and respect them for the efforts they are putting in.  If the situation of living in Ireland becomes long term, I would say that will probably phase out for those children or there will be the introduction within Ireland of specific supports in the education system for them.</p></speech>

I apologise that I had to leave after the opening statements for a media event.  I agree with Deputy Jim O'Callaghan that the response of the Irish people has been remarkable.  The response from school communities and the schools involved has also been very significant and, by and large, the effort from the education and training boards, ETBs, and the REALTs has been significant.</p> <p>  My first question is addressed to Ms Ryan and I raised a similar point with the Minister, Deputy Harris, a fortnight ago.  The point is in regard to non-Ukrainian refugees.  Of course, we need to be doing everything we can to support Ukrainian refugees, but I am concerned.  I instanced an example which provoked me to think about this a bit more myself.  I was visiting Mount Sion school in Waterford and I happened to ask if any Ukrainians had arrived there.</p><p>The principal explained to me that he had been ten minutes late because he was introducing two Afghani children to the school.  The challenges and trauma that those children face are not in the slightest bit lesser than those of Ukrainian children.  I was asking about access to SUSI in that context.  I am concerned about supports needed, such as for English as an additional language.</p><p> I will put these questions to everyone.  We have heard occasional and, I hope, isolated stories of children settling in a school and then being moved on to another area.  There was one example of a child from somewhere in Dublin being moved to Youghal in County Cork.  Is that still happening?  Is it still the case?  Is that widespread?  First, it is very disruptive and second, it calls for schools to show leniency when it comes to uniforms, books and such, if there will be volatility in terms of placements and so on.</p><p> My sense of the REALT teams, at least in terms of my own area, is that they are doing, by and large, reasonably well and that they are working hard.  Obviously, it is a very fluid situation but they are trying to manage as well as they can.  I ask everyone what their experience is of the REALT teams.  Are they satisfied the teams are working efficiently?  What else do they need?</p><p> I am especially concerned about a few categories in terms of Ukrainian children and refugee children generally.  One of my concerns is for those who have suffered severe trauma and another is for those with special educational needs.  Another category of children about which I am concerned is that of children who are midway through, or towards the end of, post-primary school and are landing with more or less no English.  They may have time to catch up at an earlier stage in the school system, but if children are in third, fourth, fifth or sixth year and are landing into a school with pretty much no English, they could find themselves very isolated and in a very difficult situation.  I know there are efforts to try to align some of the children with the Ukrainian education system, but it is potentially a very challenging scenario.  I ask Mr. Henderson to start.</p></speech>

We warmly welcomed this, but in a follow-up letter to the Minister on 23 May, we said it should be considered for all people.  The Minister's assistant came back to us to say our letter was under consideration.  We asked to meet with the Minister.  We hope that will happen in due course because this is an opportunity to make wider changes.  It is a matter of equality and it is something for which we have advocated for many years.  I do not think the numbers are that large, which should be borne in mind.  That relates to SUSI, in particular.</p></speech>

Whether the child or family is being supported by a Department or an NGO, the nature of the accommodation options and the fact that many of the hubs are focused in specific areas where accommodation options are limited means that quite a large volume of children are being moved.  I can speak from the caseworker perspective in that when we are moving a family from temporary international protection accommodation services, IPAS, accommodation, such as Citywest Hotel, we engage with the parents about the area to which they are moving.  We engage with them about what kind of house or property they will be moving to and the school options available within the area.  We then work with the parents to make sure that the child has access and that the correct connections are being made but it most certainly is happening that children are settling and then moving.  We are finding issues with our clients, whereby children have uniforms for a school into which they have settled for one or two months and they are now faced with finding school supplies, new books and curriculum activities and a new path to school and uniform.  Provision of supports is needed to help people with these integrations and transitions to make them as smooth as possible.</p></speech>

I mentioned it in our statement.  At present, all students and staff in DEIS schools have access.  We have recommended and the committee has supported the extension of that service to at least all second level schools and Youthreach centres.  There has been considerable demand for that, especially during Covid when people could not access physical materials.  We see that students in our schools, including Ukrainian students, use the facilities and the resources in the digital library for language development that we provide.  We are adding significantly, with the help of Post-Primary Languages Ireland, to the collection that is available in that library.  Again, if students are moved from one of our DEIS schools into a non-DEIS school, suddenly their access is cut and they no longer have access to that resource.  We very much encourage the committee to support the extension.  It could be quite easily done and it would not cost much to give access to that resource to all schools in the country.  It could be done for September quite easily.</p></speech>

There has to be additional support for parents to learn English.  I know the ETBs, as Mr. Henderson referenced, are doing considerable work in regional areas.  However, that should be supplemented with interpreter services in order that parents can make informed decisions and choices about their children's education.  A couple of years ago, we did a consultation with children living in direct provision.  While I know we are speaking about Ukrainian children, the children living in direct provision spoke to us about their experiences of our education system in schools.  What they told us was that they would like for there to be greater intercultural awareness and training for teachers in order that teachers have a greater insight into where children are coming from.  That would help them to integrate into the school community.  It would be very helpful if that could be brought beyond English-language support even though, of course, that support is of critical importance for communication.</p></speech>

For that reason, I will give Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh an extra minute.</p></speech>

I will endeavour to fill that minute well.  This is the central challenge facing our education system at present.  We are talking about 6,000 children arriving and presenting with a very specific, but complex, set of needs.  In trying to get my head around it, I was trying to tease through what my central concerns were in terms of providing the most appropriate education that is cognisant of those specific needs.  I was trying to think my way through the headings.  We have to have an understanding of the children's previous learning.  I am not sure that we are doing so but that question is probably more important to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  The maths curriculum jumps out at me.  If a Ukrainian child arrives into third class in an Irish-context school, does that third-class teacher have an understanding of the similar curriculum in Ukraine and of whether the child will have hit long multiplication or decimals at this stage?</p><p>Certainly, as a teacher, I would very much like to have that information at my fingertips.</p><p> We have spoken about the inherent trauma of dislocation and about NEPS psychologists.  However, we must acknowledge that we were at and beyond capacity of provision before there was a Ukrainian crisis.  There are specific language needs in the provision of English.  I was in the same school on Monday and was talking to Michael Walsh.  We must acknowledge that Ukrainian students are getting the support where the Afghan or Syrian students who sit beside them are not.  That has to be addressed. </p><p> There must be an understanding of the specific context of the Ukrainians who are arriving.  We have spoken a lot about mobility.  They will first arrive into Citywest and then move to somewhere like Gracedieu in Waterford.  As they find their feet in a few months, they will start to make decisions themselves about where in Ireland they want to live.  Therefore we must look at three locations where there are immediate, medium-term and long-term solutions.</p><p> As far as I can see, there is an absence of a Europe-wide approach.  If a child first lands in Poland for a couple of weeks - I will ask Ms Ryan to give a Red Cross, international overview in a second - is there any sort of coherence in the provision in Poland or Moldova by the time they arrive in Ireland? </p><p> Mr. Henderson and Ms Moran spoke of the medium-term hope that the conflict will cease and these people will return to where they want to be.  The Gaeilge exemption kind of goes to the heart of the matter on this.  Are we considering this medium-term to long-term approach?  I am very much an advocate of teaching the Irish language within our primary and secondary schools but is it a good use of these children's time?  If my child was dislocated and arrived somewhere I would hope that they would have English language and Irish language provision where they arrived.  Are we providing Ukrainian language classes for them?  Are we providing Russian language classes for those from the east of Ukraine who are most affected by the conflict and comprise a proportionately higher number of Russian speakers?</p><p> I am wasting the extra minute that the Chair gave me.  </p><p> Ms Ryan is a case worker in the Red Cross.  We are more than 100 days into the conflict.  Have we any sense of the actual population flows in Europe?  What pattern is emerging?  When these people arrive in Ireland, as I said, there are likely to be immediate, medium-term and long-term responses.  Are we beginning to see a pattern where Ukrainian refugees find their feet and self-sort themselves to get where they want to go?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Meg Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022061400002#K00200"><p>I will respond in reverse.  I will speak of my experience and the clients I have interacted with.  The system has been put in place in a way that has enabled them to find their feet, having streamlined options for things like medical card support that gives access to healthcare and social welfare, and immediate provision of a PPS number.  These are barriers that we find hugely limiting for the other cohorts of refugees for whom we are working who do not have the same access.  I understand this meeting is to focus on Ukrainian refugees in Ireland but we cannot ignore the fact that the system to support a Ukrainian refugee is set up in a way that has been streamlined, which is not the experience of people from Afghanistan or Syria who the Red Cross supports through active case work and community sponsorship.  It is a very different system and process.  We find that our clients from Ukraine are hitting the ground running because options are available, including around language with translation of documents and so on being available, and the willingness to help is there.  That is an incredible thing and something the Irish people should be very proud of but it is an example of a model that could be adapted to support everyone.  It shows that the system can work and that it can be expanded.</p> <p>  On the long-term question, I find the parents I engage with, once they are in accommodation and their children are in school, are looking for work.  They want to actively contribute, settle in and have a normal life.  While it is disruptive and the situation is very difficult and unique, the Ukrainian cohort that we work with are hitting the ground running and settling in at a good pace because of the supports that we can now bolster and strengthen.  I cannot speak on the figures or numbers relating to support in Poland.  The International Committee of the Red Cross provides shelter, medical care, food, hygiene products, water, clothes, and essential humanitarian support.  I cannot speak about the volume that will filter through Europe.</p></speech>

One might be unfair because it is probably the NCCA which would have to be here to answer this.  Is Ms Ward aware of any comparison in curriculums in order that we might identify gaps?  Take the example I gave of the maths curriculum.  </p> <p>  She said a report from the ombudsman will be forthcoming on forward planning.  The NEPs provision was not where it needed to be beforehand.  Is there any sort of snapshot of where we need to be to meet the current demand?</p></speech>

We are constantly scanning what is going on.  My understanding is that the Department of Education has produced a guidance note for teachers on the Ukrainian curriculum but I do not know about comparisons.  Internationally there are some excellent resources led by the UN but I do not know how much that has filtered down.  I imagine if you spoke to teachers they would say there is very little out there but I cannot speak for the teachers.  It is really important for outcomes and the children's educational achievements in a few years that we can answer what we have done for them.  The Deputy's point about Ukrainian language is really good.  I am curious now and I will ask because it is very important.  If Irish children were going to another country we would want English and Irish language as well, if possible.</p> <p>  The Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon has been before the committee to discuss bullying and mental health and this committee made a strong recommendation on expanding the NEPS service to be able to provide therapeutic services to children in schools.  I do not know where we are yet.  It is a really critical point.  Barnardos shares our view.  We are passionate on this.  We spoke to children in inpatient units around the country some years ago for the report "Take My Hand".  All the children said it would be so beneficial if they had counsellors in their schools in a place where they are comfortable and they know they can talk.  That is what they want.  We have a long way to go to achieve that but we must get there.  The report we will publish in a couple of weeks is about forward planning for special educational places for children with special educational needs. </p></speech>

The summer inclusion programme is a huge opportunity to get six weeks or so of very high quality education to a cohort which particularly needs it.  I am thinking of English language.  It is an opportunity to give a breathing space to parents who will need to find their feet as Ms Ryan outlined.  What would the representatives here ideally like to see included in the programme as a specific response to the needs of Ukrainian children?</p></speech>

The whole expansion of the summer programme or July provision in recent years to broaden it beyond children with special educational needs is very much to be welcomed.  We hear from parents that there is a bit of fun in the programmes and it is not all about education but also a lot of getting to know peers and time spent just enjoying themselves.</p><p>I would like to think that would be a core part of it for these children and that as many schools as possible will take it up and provide that programme to all children who fall within the remit of the summer programme.</p></speech>

It is a bit of side topic - and Ms Ryan touched on it - but from a summer perspective, it is really a time to pause and prepare for September as well.  It is just an important time.</p></speech>

Libraries facilitate activities during the summer for everybody who might be interested.  There are lots of fun activities but also learning, reading clubs and chess clubs and so on.</p> <p>  For Ukrainian students who have come in, a number will be specifically opening over the summer to facilitate those students to continue their involvement in existing clubs and activities.  They are often living in not very suitable accommodation and they do not have access to general things the youth would have during the summer and often they have not developed relationships.  It just provides them with a place to be, which is hugely important, and to meet each other.  Families are welcomed in, parents are welcomed in and so on.  For the school to continue, through its library, to provide a space for students and their families over the summer months is hugely important.  We certainly facilitate that.</p></speech>

That is releasing trauma from the body through breathing, sensory input and also outdoor activities.  Allowing children to engage in physical activities in order to reduce the impact of trauma and release trauma from their bodies is an important perspective.</p></speech>

A tutor said to me one time that the best learning you will ever do when you are on placement is the learning you have over a cup of tea.  That was 100% right, so I would not say the summer programmes are not learning, because they are.</p> <p>  On the Irish language, it should be a choice for all refugees if they want to take it as a subject.  They may not.  People from other countries being left out of that is inequality.  We have seen it happen to Travellers time and again.  You do not do Irish because you are a Traveller and that can put you at a disadvantage.  I wanted to highlight that.  Before I forget, I would love a copy of the report Ms Ward mentioned, if that is possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, was here two weeks ago.  We asked questions and I was told not many people from Ukraine in our schools have disabilities.  I would love a copy of the report in order to be able to do some work around access for children with disabilities.</p> <p>  A few years ago, there was a quote that asked who are we to say that a child matters more or less because of the community that child is from.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what the Irish State is doing.  As a member of the Traveller community, I have seen  how Travellers are treated as less and how that can really impact on your life and on the whole community.  I welcome the Ukrainian refugees.  It is important and very positive going forward.</p> <p>  I genuinely believe we should treat all refugees who enter the country with the same dignity and respect.  I worked with the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and did some voluntary work throughout my ten years of activism.  I was also involved with the Irish Refugee Council.  I think of the amount of lobbying and campaigning for simple things like the PPS numbers.  I can understand how much anger is out there among the refugees.  What we are doing is dividing to conquer, whereas what we should be doing as a society is bringing people together.  I do not see that in sight for us yet, as a country.  Going forward it is about the learning we can implement and what we can do in our country.  While it looks like we are really supporting people from Ukraine - that is damn right, and we should be doing it - people are staying in one bedroom or in hotels.  They have no access.  Again, being a member of the Traveller community, I know how accommodation can have a dramatic impact on your education and your well-being.  You are fleeing a war situation and then you end up in a small room and your freedom is genuinely gone.  We see that with direct provision as well.  We need to tackle accommodation for refugees here.  I have not got the answer as to how we are going to do that.  Of course, this was not planned, and we will do what we can in order for people to be safe.  Nobody is saying otherwise, but earlier I wrote to the Leader of the Seanad to ask when the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, will come to the House for a debate around ending direct provision because it is a year since the White Paper was launched.  I am aware that a crisis has come upon us and how we deal with it I do not know; I do not have the answers to that.  However, I would like to see us end direct provision for people who are fleeing war in Afghanistan and access to education for people fleeing all wars.</p> <p>  I have questions.  I apologise to the Chairman; I will ask them very fast.  On trauma and psychological supports, are those supports extended to all refugees?  I have spoken many times in this committee and in the Seanad around the digital divide.  Have we seen that happening with Ukrainian refugees?  Are people getting equal access to digital devices?  What kind of software needs to be downloaded for people so they can access education, be it in Ireland or Ukraine?</p> <p>  The most burning issue for me right now is ending direct provision and trying to get people out of hotels as fast as we can and get appropriate accommodation for people.  How do we do that?</p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Henderson, it must be very tough for the Irish Refugee Council and the members it works with when they are seeing how one group of people is treated here and how another group is treated.  How is the council dealing with that in terms of access as well?  As Mr. Henderson said earlier, can we spread that out?  Again, we welcome it and it is something I welcome with open arms but how do we spread it out for all people who are fleeing war zones?</p> <p>  I thank everyone so much for coming in.  They do brilliant work with all refugees.  I really need to credit them all for that.</p></speech>

To respond to a few or her points, on psychological supports, for protection applicants a person, under EU law now transposed into Irish law, should receive a vulnerability assessment as to their reception needs.  There is a vulnerability assessment in place.  We have just produced a report on it that we have sent to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There is a pilot that has been under way for more than a year now.  Our report makes reference to it.  A Ukrainian refugee, because they are entitled to temporary protection, does not have a legal right to a vulnerability assessment.  However, the toolbox, if you like, of the vulnerability assessment could be applied to Ukrainian refugees though, unfortunately, I do not think there is capacity in the existing State services to do that.</p><p>We have commented that the vulnerability assessment delivered by the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, in some circumstances can be an empty device, in that the determination given by the assessment does not necessarily have a follow on because of a lack of capacity, resources and so on.</p><p> In regard to hotel accommodation, which is an important point, we are here today to talk about education, but where somebody lives is crucial to education.  The Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman have criticised long-term hotel accommodation for children growing up in homeless accommodation.  That has a detrimental effect on children.  We know that direct provision has a detrimental effect on children.  The Ombudsman's report on direct provision speaks to that so clearly.  There are now more than 20,000 Ukrainian refugees in State-provided accommodation, the majority of whom are in hotels.  The State's welcome to Ukrainian refugees has been extremely commendable, but I fear that without the implementation of medium- to long-term accommodation considerations, we will be talking in the autumn about them living in hotels for long periods and all the issues that brings.  That will be a ball and chain and will hinder children's development in education.  Unfortunately, much of it flows back to accommodation.  The State's response to Ukrainian refugees compared with people seeking protection is very problematic. That is particularly the case at the beginning, in terms of supports being quickly delivered to one group and not to another group.  The long-term accommodation problems will begin to hinder all refugees unless we take quick action.</p></speech>

Barnardos works with all children who have experienced trauma.  We work closely with the Department to provide trauma-informed training and support for those working with children and families in direct provision.  We think the same should happen for schools.  The challenges for parents, children and families living in hotel accommodation are under-estimated.  I have seen families who have been in a hotel room day after day, with the sun splitting the sky, who are not able to spend time in the foyer of the hotel.  The hotels are often remote so there is no access to get anywhere else.  That impacts on the ability of parents with two, three or four small children to parent and the child's ability to develop is significantly affected.  In all cases, what needs to be considered is choice, control, opportunity and hope for such families.</p> <p>  The sudden movement is a challenge for Ukrainian refugees.  There are families who are not from Ukraine who may stay in that situation for a very long time.  That issue must be considered.</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions.  I spent 15 years as a teacher and I am still in touch with quite a few of my former colleagues.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties schools are having in terms of resourcing capacity to accommodate refugees.  All schools, to be fair, are putting their shoulder to the wheel, and they are getting on with it and making it work as best they can.</p> <p>  I wish to focus on education provision and capacity issues in particular.  I am from an area on the north side of Cork city, which heads east towards towns like Carrigtwohill, Midleton and on to Youghal.  The vast majority of secondary schools in those areas were already over-subscribed even before Ukrainian refugees became an issue.  Are there any other pinch-points across the country where there are significant shortfalls in capacity that the witnesses could identify, be it parts of Dublin or other large urban centres?  Where in particular are we struggling to accommodate students?</p> <p>  To be fair to Senator Flynn, she mentioned the special education provision.  We are all acutely aware of the issues in that regard.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and I spent three hours at a briefing with the HSE yesterday.  A good chunk of that time was spent dealing with issues related to disability provision and therapies, or the lack of them.  Even if the refugees have an identified need for speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy or whatever the case may be, what is the likelihood that they will get to avail of the support, given the pressures we already have?</p> <p>  My third point relates to the Ombudsman's office.  Have there been any complaints and, if so, what is the nature of the complaints?  What are people saying about the educational provision that is being provided so far?  Do the witnesses have any idea how many complaints have been made?</p> <p>  If time allows, I will ask one last question about a student's ability to learn.  Ms Ward touched on the impact in terms of students who come from direct provision or emergency accommodation.  If she has time, she could elaborate on that as well.</p></speech>

We have translated our complaints form into Ukrainian.  We are going to engage with the NGO sector.  We will have a webinar in the coming weeks to promote our office's redress mechanism for people who may have a complaint about any public service or school on the education they receive in Ireland.  We hope that will help raise awareness of our office and how we can help.</p> <p>  The only issue that has recently arisen is exactly what has been spoken about earlier, namely, schools being able to access English language supports for children that are not from Ukraine.  There are two different systems in place at the moment.  That is obviously a serious concern for our office.  If a direct provision centre has opened in an area or there has been an increase in the number of children coming from different countries, it is important for schools to be supported.  It is not about the pathway to protection.  That cannot be the consideration.  It must be about the needs of the children.  If children need support to develop fluency in English, there can be no discrimination about that.  It must be a children's rights issue and assessing the needs of children.  Is Deputy O'Sullivan asking about children in direct provision and their access to education?</p></speech>

Could Ms Ward please elaborate on that?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, we consult with children living in direct provision and they told us very powerful stories.  One of their key asks is that teachers are trained in intercultural awareness and are provided with guidance and supports to understand the different countries and ethnicities the children come from and how they can help them integrate further into the community.  That was really powerful.</p> <p>  We also did an investigation, coming up to 12 months ago, where we raised concerns about the safety and welfare of children in direct provision centres.  We are pursuing it now with the Department and Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to see how much progress has been made in that regard.  We will publish our update on the investigation and we hope that will shine a light on exactly what the impact has been on all children seeking international protection in Ireland, arising from the Ukraine crisis.  I hope we will touch on the education sector as well.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, something that I am finding with the Ukrainians the Irish Red Cross is supporting, is that a number of students have no access to a school in their area.  Parents have contacted upwards of 15 schools looking for places.  Certain years, in particular first year, are completely over-subscribed and the waiting list is prioritised for Irish students with legacies or other situations.  We must have a system that would allow access to secondary education for children, in particular for first year and fifth year.  Children entering into fifth year are trying to think of their future careers and to continue the momentum and the goals they would have had in Ukraine.  We must ensure that access is being provided to the Irish education system and that it becomes more robust to allow them to access schools.</p><p>On the Deputy's question on the likelihood of getting access to additional support in cases where a need has been identified, it very much depends on the area in which the child has been placed.  The caseworkers for the Irish Red Cross are trying to gain access to additional supports for a number of children.  It is very much dependent on where the child is placed and the level of advocating that is possible.  When another organisation, such as Enable Ireland, is included, sometimes it can create a pathway.  However, the likelihood is not a guarantee.</p></speech>

We transition to support those who are in front of us.  The Deputy mentioned accommodation issues and access to study space and so on.  We do whatever we can to make available what the individual students in front of us need, whether it is opening in the morning for their Ukrainian classes, or staying open in the evening to provide study space for them because they do not have suitable study spaces in their accommodation.  Going back to Senator Flynn's comment on the digital divide, we provide students with digital devices to access their Ukrainian classes.  As we did right throughout Covid, we loan digital devices to students who do not have access to them.  The value of a school library is that it can provide whatever is required.  That can differ from school to school, depending on the cohort that is presented to us.</p></speech>

There is huge pressure on school buildings, school places and teachers.  Teachers cannot be educated over a two-month period.  We cannot build and create school places that we do not have over a two-month period.  What is the alternative?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clodagh Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022061400002#N01300"><p>I completely agree with the Chairman.  A long-term plan is required in respect of training, the provision of support for teachers and the delivery of buildings.  However, I think the knuckling-down that is required to prepare over the summer months is about the integration of Departments and different levels of supports so that it does not all come down to having to be done in one place, as we said earlier.  Everything working as well it can in schools will also be impacted by how it works in the community and voluntary sector, the statutory sector, housing and health.  All of those areas are tied together for many of the Ukrainian people coming to Ireland.  Integration is key.  We must ensure that each piece of the pie, as it were, is supported at this time.</p></speech>

These people are in dire need.  However, refugees are currently having to sleep in the Red Cow Moran Hotel.  The Irish Refugee Council has raised concerns about the accommodation issue, as was reported on the news yesterday.  That aside, there will be a similar situation in our schools in September, October and November.  I have engaged with schools in my own constituency and they have reported that they do not have the places to take more Ukrainian refugees.  They do not have the space in the classrooms or the teacher allocation required to do so.  The other children, including the Ukrainian children who are already there, are falling behind because more is expected of the staff.  Do we call a halt to it and admit that we have to take a breather for a period of six or seven months because we cannot take any more refugees, and then re-evaluate the situation before taking in more refugees, or do we just continue to take in refugees and give them an education that is not up to standard?  Do we just put the children into a classroom so we can say that they are being educated, when they are not being educated to standard?  The Government has some very difficult questions to ask itself.  The agencies also have to answer some very difficult questions.  Do we just continue to take people in and not educate them to a standard, whether in Irish, English or other subjects?  The system is creaking at its foundations.  We have to ask ourselves some very difficult questions and make some difficult choices.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' perspectives on that.</p></speech>

I think there is a critical problem in that the Government's humanitarian response was very commendable at the beginning, but it has not been matched with a medium- to long-term plan.  We have twice recommended to the Taoiseach and various Government Departments directly that the post of Ukraine response director should be created, and that there should be a national action plan on Ukraine containing various pillars, including education.  We produced a policy paper on 7 April 2022 that discussed medium- and long-term housing options.  Nearly two months have passed since the publication of that paper and only one action is being implemented, namely, the &euro;400 payment for hosting refugees.  In fact, it has not yet been implemented.  From what I have heard from my colleagues today, a lot of good work is being done for children from Ukraine in schools.  It is not as if we are saying it is all bad.  I believe that we have an opportunity to prepare in the coming months.</p> <p>   On the Chairman's suggestion that we pause the programme, I think it would be completely unethical.  It would bring us into line with that the UK is doing.  The Taoiseach's leadership, compared to that in the UK, has been exemplary.  Fundamentally, I think it would be a breach of EU law to pause the programme.  We opted in to the directive.  I do not believe we can necessarily opt out.  Let us take stock.  It is a very challenging period.  I was at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday to watch a football match.  There were way more people in that stadium than we have welcomed in the last two months.  It is a manageable problem if we have resources and a plan in place.  I fear that the absence of a plan will hinder us.  I think there will be significant challenges ahead without it.  </p></speech>

It is about the co-ordination of an action plan that contains clear pillars and outcomes.  We must also look at the issue of resources, how they are used and where they are directed.  I know, from working in the community and voluntary sector, that the organisation that I work for and all of our colleagues in the community have come together to see how we, as a community, can provide support for children in their education, environment, development and other areas.  We are doing that on a shoestring and in the absence of additional resources to do the work.  Consideration must be given to the overall action plan, its pillars and the outcomes that need to be achieved.  We must look at how all the aspects come together, how they are communicated effectively and how they are resourced to enable us to provide additional support to that which is already being provided, and to do that well and effectively.</p></speech>

I reinforce the point that the aim of today's committee meeting is to identify cracks and the needs.  Therefore, we are not recounting the litany of positive stories and successes of the programme and the response.  The pressure is being felt in our infrastructure, including in the areas of accommodation, schooling and access to supports.</p><p>However, we have time to create a plan.  As has been said, it is about having collaboration and co-ordination and ensuring a plan is in place in response to the needs that have been identified.</p></speech>

In my constituency, school staff are coming to me saying they cannot take any more people.  The schools are bursting at the seams.  Children who should be getting additional resources are not receiving them.  There are children, including Irish and Ukrainian children, being totally left behind.  They are pushed into schools and that is it; the box is ticked.  I spoke last weekend to a teacher from County Wexford who works in a primary school in Dublin that has DEIS status.  She said she regrets going into teaching because of the pressures.  She was under severe pressure at the start of the year and the situation is much worse now.  She has six Ukrainian children who do not speak English in her class.  Many pupils in this DEIS school have it tough and do not have supports at home.  All of a sudden, there are six or seven Ukrainian children in the class who have no English.</p> <p>  The Government and the agencies must look at the reality of where we are today.  There is no use giving the agencies additional resources next November, December, January or February.  The current situation is totally unacceptable and should not be happening.  Children are being pushed into classes that are full.  It is all very well to take everybody and just throw them into classrooms but, in practice, it is not acceptable in my book.  Can the witnesses tell us how Ireland compares with our European counterparts in this regard?</p></speech>

I see that happening in my constituency.  Wexford County Council is shaking every tree in every townland, village, parish and town right across the county looking for accommodation.  The management of one school has said it cannot take any more people.  My point is that there is no use in the council securing accommodation in an area where there is no provision for school places and backup services.  In the Dublin area, in which most of the accommodation will be located in hotels, etc., there is no matching up of services in terms of schools, healthcare and every other provision.  A reality check needs to be taken and we may need to stall the whole process.  We need everybody's co-operation.  The situation yesterday evening was infuriating.  No one should be sleeping on a floor.  I am hearing what is happening and it is clear we are already, in June, at a crisis point.</p></speech>

I do not follow this particular issue closely on account of our various other responsibilities.  I do not know whether the Department of Education has a plan and resourcing in place for September.  That is a critical question because if it does not, it should have.  That scenario is coming down the tracks.</p></speech>

If a teacher is absent today and the school has to get a substitute, it will take 20 or 30 telephone calls to find one.  There are not sufficient numbers of teachers at this time.  That is the way it is.  However, I have taken up way too much time.  The next speaker is Senator Dolan.</p></speech>

It has been a really good discussion.  As noted, it is about identifying elements that are working well and also areas on which we need to work and focus.  We are looking at a situation in which at least 8 million Ukrainian people have fled their country.  According to a recent report from the UN, nearly 14 million people have been displaced out of a country of 40 million, the second largest by size in Europe.  Ukraine is part of Europe, as are we.  Our response has to meet the demand that is there.  That demand is right now, not in a few months, and the Government is meeting it.</p> <p>  There is a whole-of-government approach but there also needs to be an all-agency approach and a whole-of-country approach.  There is a demand on everyone here to step up and see how we can best support the families coming to Ireland.  The question was put as to how other countries are faring.  We know nearly 3.8 million Ukrainians fled to Poland.  I understand some 2 million remain there, with more than 1.6 million having returned to Ukraine.  Tens of thousands of Ukrainians are returning home every day.  However, there remains a huge demand among families who have nowhere to go.  Their homes, towns and cities have been destroyed.</p> <p>  The best thing we can do for the Ukrainian children in our education system is, number one, to provide safety.  They need a place that is safe, gets them back into a routine and reduces the trauma they have endured over the past number of months.  We can do the same for the parents and grandparents who are coming here as well, but the number one focus must be on looking after the children.  That is really why the witnesses are here to speak with us today.</p> <p>  I am familiar with the great work that is done by each of the agencies represented.  Barnardos staff see the children that are affected on the front line.  They have been tackling the problems that disadvantage children throughout this period.  The organisation has more than 45 service locations.  I welcome that, among all the other things it does, it is providing training to hotel staff who are dealing with Ukrainian families who have been bereaved.  I really like that as it shows evidence of thinking and forecasting far ahead.  There will be a lot to do in getting children back into a routine.  Will the witnesses comment on the importance of establishing routine for children who arrive here?</p> <p>  I am aware that the Irish Red Cross's migration services are also working with many other populations besides Ukrainians, including refugees from Syria and Afghanistan.  Will Ms Ryan comment on the importance of the active case work support her organisation is providing to Ukrainians?  Apart from educational support, this will include looking at medical support and social welfare, which requires a cross-departmental engagement with the Government.  Agencies and Departments are working together to ensure we are providing the utmost support to the people who are arriving here.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Henderson give some detail on the Irish Refugee Council's education fund?</p><p> I also thank Ms Ward for her contribution.  I welcome that she mentioned the NCSE is part of the regional education and language teams in each of our counties.  Each county is working with the education and training boards and, again, the HSE, which I believe has really come to the fore in many of these areas to support children in finding places and in respect of school capacity.  How important is it that the NCSE is in those regional education and language, REAL, teams?  I ask Ms Carroll to respond first. </p></speech>

I will talk about what she mentioned regarding the importance of routine, which ties into everything we have talked about, including safety and security.  When children are traumatised, they need to know what is happening next, and they need to know what part of that is in their day and what their day will look like.  They are always scanning their environment for threats.  Any sense of uncertainty, sudden change or things being different each time can be very retriggering for a child who has experienced trauma, especially a child who has fled a war and left his or her home suddenly.  A sudden movement, a sudden change or any sense of uncertainty can retrigger that, make children believe it will happen constantly and make it very difficult for them to regulate their nervous systems.  Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan asked about when children are able to learn.  It is when their nervous systems are regulated and balanced.  When they are in balance, children can learn, engage and interact with their peers.  Certainty, routine and security are all about achieving that safety the Senator mentioned.</p> <p>  An important part of that are the other elements that then come to the forefront, including choice, control, coming back to accommodation, how and where children live and how going to school works.  Being considerate of all those things will be very important in the long term.  </p></speech>

It gives service users access to healthcare treatment and there is less fear about the financial implications of seeking medical support.  It is very successful and useful to have systems like that in place.  It shows that language access is key in supporting people who have been relocated.</p></speech>

It has also been shortened.  Instead of a five- or six-page application, it is two pages.  It contains very basic information and does not require some of the additional things needed for an Irish medical card applicant.  That has been very useful for people in getting access to healthcare.  It is the same for social welfare, where people have quick access to a personal public service number and social welfare payments, which has been very useful and very successful.</p></speech>

It is open for one month a year in July to international protection applicants and refugees and it gives grants.  Our average grant is approximately &euro;350.  This is a grant for a course itself and travel or resources to allow somebody to study.  We are grateful to the donors for it.  The fund has grown in size and we now have two people on our education team; our education officer, Ms Charlotte Byrne, and our education assistant, Ms Rosemary Kunene.  It is a very useful tool.</p> <p>  On what Ms Ryan just spoke to, we also have a helpline staffed by five Ukrainian speakers.  We have received more than 850 calls so far.  We have answered calls from people in Ireland and elsewhere about anything and everything regarding their situation.  </p></speech>

That joined-up thinking will benefit children.  The involvement of the NCSE is critically important because some of these children are very young.  Their needs will only gradually emerge over the next few years from teachers and parents.  It is very important the NCSE is in there at an early stage to support schools and to give them resources they need through special needs assistants, SNAs, or whatever other means.  By having them there at an early stage, it is to be hoped we will try to get ahead of the problem, which is a critical theme we all see from today's discussion.</p></speech>

We have had a fundamentally important debate.  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh for making the earlier proposal.  I commend everybody on their efforts right across the board in giving a safe haven to the Ukrainian families who have come to Ireland and sought refuge with us over the past number of months.  I believe this situation will get a lot worse rather than better, unfortunately, when we see what is happening in Ukraine and what the Russian Government is signalling.  That loss of life is very sad.  What the Russian people are doing to a very peaceful country is really unfortunate.  I thank members of the public who have put their shoulder to the wheel over the past number of months in taking in displaced families.  Many people have gone above and beyond the call of duty to help all these people, specifically those in the voluntary sector.  I again thank them very much for that.</p></speech>

Our engagement today is with representatives from the United Nations Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund to discuss their work in response to the situation in Ukraine.  I am particularly pleased to welcome Ms Ghita El Khyari, the head of secretariat, who is joining us via MS teams and Ms Breifn&iacute; Flanagan, who is with in person and who is a policy consultant with the fund, together with their partner, Ms Olena Stryzhak from the Ukrainian civil society organisation, Positive Women, who is joining us from Ukraine via MS teams.  They will be discussing with us their experience of working in response to the situation in Ukraine and are all very welcome.</p> <p>  I also want to mention welcome students from the Sam Nunn School of International Affairs in the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.  I understand that they are engaged in summer studies abroad in UCD.  I dare say that this is the first time that students from Georgia Tech have had the opportunity of attending this committee and they are also very welcome.  We are more used to watching Georgia Tech on the American football fields, particularly the very exciting challenge matches we have experienced here in Dublin over the years against such luminaries as  Pennsylvania State University and Boston College footballers.  We hope that they have an opportunity during the their busy study schedule to take some time off to see a game of Gaelic football in Croke Park while they are here. </p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we are still operating under a quasi-restrictive regime insofar as some of our members are operating from their offices through MS Teams and, as we have already adverted to, our guest witnesses, with the exception of Ms Flanagan, are also join the meeting via MS Teams.  The format of the meeting then is in the usual manner.  We will hear the opening statements which our witnesses wish to make followed by a discussion with questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members, as always, to be concise in their questions to allow all members the opportunity to participate.  Hopefully, we can then have a second round of questions, should members so desire and if time allows.</p> <p>  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are in any way potentially defamatory in respect to any entity or person, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction be complied with.  </p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of our Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present might.  Members are also reminded that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex, that is, in offices or here in the committee chamber.  </p> <p>  I am very pleased, therefore, to commence our proceedings by calling Ms El Khyari to make her opening statement.  She will be followed by Ms Stryzhak and then we will give the floor to Ms Flanagan.  I thank our witnesses.</p></speech>

Good morning everybody and it is a great honour for me to speak here today.  It is a great honour also to have this opportunity to share with all present the response of the United Nations Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund, alongside its civil society partners obviously, to the ongoing, devastating war in Ukraine.</p><p>The Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund, as the committee might already know, is a United Nations multi-partner trust fund which supports women-led and women's rights civil society organisations in conflict- and crisis-affected countries, with a strong and specific focus on local and grassroots civil society organisations.</p><p> I acknowledge Ireland&rsquo;s continual commitment not only to the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund but, more importantly, to our mandate in support of the women's organisations in crises that we serve.  Ireland was a founding member of the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund.  Ireland was behind the creation and establishment by the United Nations of the fund and has been a consistent supporter since our launch in 2016, stepping forward once again in solidarity with women's civil society organisations in response to the escalating humanitarian crises in Ukraine and Moldova.</p><p> As the Chair said, I am joined by our partner, Ms Olena Stryzhak, from the Ukrainian civil society organisation Positive Women.  She is the expert in the room and the witness to whom the committee should be listening.  I will soon pass the floor to her to speak more about her organisation's work in Ukraine.  I am also joined by Mr. Breifni Flanagan, my colleague at the United Nations Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund.  He happens also to be a proud Irish national.</p><p> As the committee knows, the world watched on as Russia launched its unjustifiable war on Ukraine on 24 February this year.  More than 100 days later, we continue to witness the devastating effects on the lives of many.  As we sit here today, more than 6.5 million people have fled Ukraine and a further 8 million are internally displaced.  This war, like many others, is forcing people to flee their homes to seek safety, protection and humanitarian assistance.  However, the conflict in Ukraine, as has been the case in many other conflicts, is having a disproportionate effect on women and girls.  Because of the nature of the war, women and girls constitute approximately 90% of all those displaced from Ukraine.  They are exposed to gender-specific risks such as trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence and denial of access to essential services.  We are seeing increasing numbers of reported cases of conflict-related sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian armed forced as part of its war tactics.</p><p> A recent report by UN Women and CARE International also reveals that with schools closed, high demand for volunteer work and the absence of men who are called on to fight, women&rsquo;s unpaid care burden has increased significantly.  Women and girls have poor access to healthcare services, especially for survivors of gender-based violence.  Many respondents spoke of the challenges and barriers they face in accessing humanitarian aid and services.  In a matter that is of increasing concern to all of us, approximately 50% of women and men indicated that mental health was the main area of life impacted by the war.  That is no surprise.  As we have learned from other conflicts, backtracking on gender equality often happens during and after a conflict.  It is already evident in the ongoing crisis.  The war is increasing unemployment among the entire population and will likely push women into the unprotected informal sectors of the economy and increase poverty.</p><p> Women are being pushed into new roles and multiple jobs to make up for the lost family income.  They are also performing vital roles in the humanitarian response in local communities.  However, despite taking on increasing leadership roles in their families and communities, women are largely excluded from formal political and administrative decision-making processes.  This is something we see again and again during conflicts.  It is, therefore, critical that the humanitarian response in Ukraine takes into account and addresses the different needs of women and girls.  Women must be meaningfully involved in the planning and decision-making processes to make sure that their specific needs are met and that they participate as experts and key actors across the response.</p><p> As we will hear from Ms Stryzhak, women&rsquo;s organisations play a critical role both during and after conflict.  Positive Women is facing specific challenges in funding and recognition but remain operational nonetheless.  The members of the organisation serve their communities on a daily basis.  Women&rsquo;s organisations lie at the heart of the response in Ukraine and supporting those organisations must be a priority.  That is why the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund is investing in the work of women civil society leaders who are yielding remarkable dividends towards a more peaceful, inclusive and gender equal societies throughout the world.  As part of its emergency regional response efforts to the war in Ukraine, the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund is ensuring vital financing and co-ordination support to local women's organisations in Ukraine and Moldova by providing core institutional funding to allow those organisations to sustain themselves and maintain their systems and operations.  We also finance their programmatic activities and actions.</p><p> Through the support of donors such as Ireland and the Irish stability fund, the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund launched a series of emergency calls for proposals to identify partners in March and April.  A total of 14 civil society organisations, eight from Ukraine, including Ms Stryzhak's organisation, and six from Moldova, have been supported thus far.  Through this support, women&rsquo;s organisations in Ukraine and in Moldova are responding to the immediate needs of their communities by providing essential humanitarian and protection assistance to displaced women and girls, including shelter, medication and food, as well as vital psychosocial support.  They are also training smaller women's groups and organisations in gender-responsive humanitarian planning and explaining how to address sexual and gender-based violence and the conflict-related sexual violence that women and girls are facing.  Examples of activities include the launching of an online platform through which civil society organisations are providing psychological and legal services on conflict-related sexual violence, among other types of violence, while also raising awareness and sharing information on the issue.</p><p> I again extend our heartfelt thanks to the committee, Ireland and the Irish Government for their thought leadership in this response and for providing funding to the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund for its response to Ukraine in a rapid and efficient way.  I look forward to Ms Stryzhak's briefing and to the questions from the committee.</p></speech>

The goal of our organisation is to create a space for the development and self-realisation of women especially vulnerable to HIV, to unite women's initiatives, to support leadership and to promote gender equality. </p> <p>  On February 24, with the beginning of the Russian military invasion in Ukraine, we were faced with issues about how to provide services, how to help the women who were under the bombs and provide them with first aid.  The conflict in Ukraine is disproportionately affecting women and girls, especially women from marginalised groups.</p><p>The gendered impact of the conflict in Ukraine is influenced by the unique demographic profile of the country, which includes large numbers of older women, women and girls with disabilities, internally displaced women and girls, women-headed households, stateless women and girls, and women living with HIV.</p><p> There were approximately 250,000 people living with HIV in Ukraine prior to the war, which is one of the world&rsquo;s highest HIV incidence rates. Nearly 1% of Ukraine&rsquo;s population lives with HIV making it one of the largest epidemics in the region; nearly half of adults living with HIV are women, with sex workers, LGBTIQ+ individuals and women who inject drugs being particularly vulnerable.  Transgender women, who face obstacles in accessing healthcare and legal documentation, are marginalised based on their gender identity.</p><p> From the first days we continue to check in with our network members every day to respond to urgent needs.  We have now reorganised our activities and moved from advocacy work to providing direct services for women and girls, helping in crisis with items such as food, water, formula milk, hygienic products, medicine and antiretroviral therapy.  In addition, women have access to legal and psychological services. </p><p> Women and girls living with ongoing medical conditions, such as HIV, have reported to us about losing access to lifesaving services and antiretroviral therapy, which for the majority of individuals living with HIV in Ukraine, needs to be taken daily.  That is why sometimes our representatives deliver the HIV-treatment inside the occupied territory with the support of drivers in bakery vans. </p><p> Support for our project was rapidly received through the United Nations Women&rsquo;s Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund, WPHF.  This emergency funding has helped us plan our activities and we are grateful for the urgent support.  We were able to launch and organise temporary shelters in four regions of Ukraine that are safer today than in the regions from which women and children were evacuated.  They are in Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytsky, Cherkasy and Chernivtsi regions.  This was an urgent need at the time and remains important today.  We were able to provide access to safe spaces and to cover basic needs for food, water, clothing, hygiene products, medicines and more for women living with HIV, women from key groups vulnerable to HIV, women who use drugs, sex workers, internally displaced persons and their children.</p><p> The Women&rsquo;s Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund has provided financial support to reorganise women's organisations and community-based organisations that provide assistance to women in the war in Ukraine, and to provide services to meet those needs in a crisis situation.  Replenishment of this fund is very important for further financing of civil society organisations.  Helping women who have suffered from the war and are moving from the occupied territories, territories with active bombing in particular in the east and south of the country, is support for Ukraine as a whole.  Creating safe space for them and cover of vital needs will allow women and their children to stay in the country and not to go abroad.  This is very important for our organisation and for local women&rsquo;s organisations who are on the front lines of the response.</p><p>I hope for Ukraine's victory over the evil that hangs over the whole world.</p></speech>

It is a real pleasure to speak after them but as Ms El Khyari said, it is a proud moment for me to be in the Oireachtas as an Irish person.  I want to re-emphasise Ms El Khyari's point that women in civil society are the ones we should be listening to.  Ireland is really committed to hearing civil society voices.  We heard that at the Security Council and the WPHF wants to build on that.  Today is a really good opportunity to listen to Ms Stryzhak on the Ukrainian women's needs and on what we should be supporting.</p></speech>

It has been rather difficult to sit and listen to them outline the crisis facing women in Ukraine and, in fact, in all areas of conflict but it is absolutely necessary that we have these conversations and that they continue outside this forum.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with Ms Flanagan that women's voices in civil society need to be heard but they need to be heard in other places too, namely, in the planning and decision-making process which Ms El Khyari mentioned.  They need to be heard not only during conflict but after it.  When conflict moves on to the period of rebuilding, women's voices need to be at the decision-making tables.  We cannot condone any backtracking on gender equality in any shape or form.  Lord knows, those we have made were hard won and they should not be rowed back on either through conflict or through Covid.</p> <p>  I will start with an issue raised by Ms El Khyari around trafficking and sexual and gender-based violence.  In respect of those who are leaving Ukraine, what feedback has Ms El Khyari received on their experience of those with whom they first interact and to whom they make a disclosure of sexual violence as a weapon of war?  It is an issue I am quite concerned about.  We have very talented and dedicated people who work with victims of sexual abuse and violence here.  However, there is another aspect to that when that sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war.  It creates an additional layer of trauma that needs to be addressed with very specific and professional care to enable that person to heal fully. Then there is the question of capacity, whereby those services would be capable of taking on and meeting the very high-level needs of those who have experienced that. </p> <p>   On those who are internally displaced within Ukraine, Ms El Khyari spoke of the training up of smaller groups.  It is a fantastic idea and something I very much welcome.  It is something we need to see more of.  She also mentioned the online platform for psychological and legal aspects.  There is psychological support and legal support but how is the conflict impacting on those people's ability to access medical care?  </p> <p>  Specifically on trafficking, looking into the future and family reunification for those who have been trafficked, what must be put in place now for that to be as successful as possible?</p></speech>

The illegal war in Ukraine has impacted particularly strongly on women and children.  It is obviously also impacting on the men who have remained in Ukraine to fight but among the more than six million who have been displaced, many are women and children.  That is a particular form of barbarism and is tragedy.  The committee is very much supportive of what our guests have come to promulgate.</p> <p>  I am happy to learn that Ireland and Australia were to the front of organising and supporting the UN Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund from the outset.  Deputy Clarke's question around trafficking that could take place or may be taking place is of interest to all of us.  To what extent is this happening?  The question of vaccination also arises.  People who are displaced may not be getting their proper sets of vaccinations against various illnesses and diseases such as the MMR vaccine.  Treatment for HIV is obviously critical.</p><p>I ask the witnesses to comment further on the vaccination situation among displaced persons, the risk of trafficking and, specifically, the issues around the treatment of HIV, to which they referred.  Are the funds adequate?  Is this being dealt with or is there more they would suggest needs to be done now?</p><p> The witnesses can take it we in Ireland are strongly in support of a response to the displaced persons who have come to this country.  We are very proud of that and it should not be otherwise.  I would be interested to hear general comments on those points.  It is as much a comment as questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022061400002#E00200"><p>I thank our guests for coming before the committee with their presentations, which were very informative but very harrowing.  Unfortunately, in all conflicts, it is the innocent who are always the real victims.  In this case, everyone in Ukraine is a victim but particularly women and children, when we see that 90% of displaced people are women and children.  We also see this in Ireland, where the vast majority of the 35,000 refugees who have ended up here are women and children.  I know the impact that has on people in terms of trauma and separation.  In these Houses, we were some of the first, if not the only ones, to recognise that genocide is taking place in Ukraine in terms of the forced separation of families, women and children from fathers back at home, trying to defend the homeland against a brutal and illegal invasion.</p> <p>  We know from other conflicts right across the world how instrumental women are in bringing positive benefits to conflict resolution.  Unfortunately, we saw during Covid that many women were forced to pull back from those central, key positions in conflict resolution and go back into the household to deal with the impact of Covid.  On top of that, we have the horrific, barbaric assault on Ukraine.</p> <p>  A number of points struck me.  One concerns HIV, which is not an area I had given much focus to, but I really appreciate the information on the unfortunate reality of HIV in Ukraine when coupled with the invasion.  One line in the presentation that struck me is that HIV treatment inside the occupied territory is taking place with the support of drivers in bakery vans.  It is very stark that people who need to access HIV drugs are reliant on bakery vans to distribute something as critical and essential.  I thank the witnesses for pointing that out as it is very stark.</p> <p>  A question stems from that.  We know the number of people who have been internally and externally displaced here in Ireland and right across Europe, for example, in Romania, Moldova and Poland.  I want to ask about the difficulties, particularly for women, in having their medical records transferred when they are displaced internally but particularly externally in other countries.  How much of a challenge is it to get the medical reports that are needed to ensure continuity of medical care, whether it is maternity care, HIV treatment or access to drugs in other countries?  I want to see how much of a problem that is or whether mechanisms have been put in place.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, in all wars, we also see the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war.  The human rights monitoring group stated in early June that there were 124 cases of alleged acts of conflict-related sexual violence across Ukraine, which is probably a low estimate, unfortunately.  It is appalling.  I met a number of Ukrainian Members of Parliament who are in Leinster House today and I posed a question to them on the 16,000 investigations now being looked into by the prosecutor general, of which many are acts of violence towards women.  They said that one thing they need more of is female investigators to carry out the investigations into these acts of sexual violence and other acts of violence against women in Ukraine.  Is that very prevalent?  It was a specific need that was identified and put to us when we met the Ukrainian MPs earlier today.</p> <p>  Obviously, trauma is a huge issue.  It was pointed out again today that refugees come in waves.  The first wave of refugees to land in Ireland and other countries were those who got out of Ukraine very early, before some of the more barbaric, genocidal acts had taken place.  We see subsequent waves of refugees now being displaced from southern Ukraine and eastern Ukraine who have had to endure 115 or 116 days of barbaric onslaught.  I want to ask about psychological supports, on which there was a specific request.  More psychological supports are needed in Ukraine to help women and children in particular.  What supports are there and what additional supports are needed?  What role do the witnesses see countries such as Ireland playing?  While we are militarily neutral, when it comes to the political level, we are not neutral in terms of support for trauma and psychological supports.  These are real tangible actions we can take to help.  I would like to get a view on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ghita El Khyari" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022061400002#E00400"><p>I thank the members.  I have identified questions about the health needs, conflict-based sexual violence and sexual and gender-based violence, and the fact we are funding smaller organisations.  I would also like to touch on conflict resolution.  I want to start by saying with a lot of humanity that I personally do not have an answer to all of the great questions the members have raised.  I will allow Ms Stryzhak and Ms Flanagan to respond to the some of the issues.  I will deal in particular with the health issue and the issue of sexual and gender-based violence.  If there is anything else the members wish to address, they can jump in after that.</p> <p>  I will start with sexual and gender-based violence, and conflict-based sexual violence more specifically.  When we announced the call for proposals for the Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund, it was centred around a few areas of work.  The first was humanitarian response and the second was the issue of protection in regard to sexual and gender-based violence, conflict-related sexual violence and psychological support.  The third area of work that we have been initiating and asking organisations to apply for is longer term social and economic recovery and political participation of women and girls.  We have seen pretty much an equal interest in all of these areas.  However, I want to flag that the issue of sexual and gender-based violence in all of these dimensions &ndash; because it has multiple dimensions in war in general and in Ukraine in particular - has been at the heart of the response of all of the partners that have applied for funding under our emergency support.</p><p>When it comes to violence against women and girls and sexual and gender-based violence, in the beginning, the issue of conflict relating to sexual violence and sexual violence abuse as a weapon of war, as mentioned by a couple of members, was not intentionally captured.  As we started the implementation, we have increasingly seen this issue coming up.  As members all know, this takes a long time to capture, because the stigma is doubled.  Not only has the victim been a survivor sexual violence, but this been done by the opponents or enemy forces.  We have seen, as members have pointed out, more and more women and girls coming out to talk about this.  Yet, the phenomenon is still very much underestimated and under-documented.  We need much more work on this.  A few partner organisations have increasingly started investing in that issue.  Other organisations have indicated that they want to contribute to the documentation of this phenomenon.  This will be increasingly addressed in the future.  Now, when we talk about conflict-related sexual violence, as well as the services that are provided for survivors, this has to be within the framework of larger, wider services for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence in general, including within those that are not conflict-related and to which women and girls who are forcibly displaced are exposed.  This is because displacement increases the threat.  With that comes an aggravation of sexual violence, conflict-related sexual violence and violence used as a weapon of war.  This is something that we have seen across all our partners.  It is an increasing issue, and it is being addressed.  </p><p> I have mentioned the online platform that one of our partners has started.  Through this platform, it has started to document more and more of this.  I also wanted to add that this is the case for organisations in Ukraine, as well as for organisations that we support in the neighbouring country of Moldova, which has been providing services for the incoming refugees from Ukraine, have expressed the same needs and issues around implementation.  </p><p> I will let Ms Stryzhak speak about the health issues.  She has expertise in that area, and I do not have anything else to add to that.  I will comment very quickly on the decision-making part.  For us, at the UN Women&rsquo;s Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund, we support and focus on local women&rsquo;s organisations not only because we think it is fair, because they deserve the money and because women need to be supported, but also because those organisations have the outreach.  They know the communities, they know their constituencies, they know where the needs are and they have the capacity to quickly react to and intervene in emergency settings.  This is something we have seen in this particular crisis.  The board of the fund approved the response in March.  We already have 14 partners and they have been doing a lot of great work on the ground.  That is because of their unique positioning in knowing the needs and having access to the communities.  That also goes with a lack of implication in and involvement in decision-making.  That is the case in the humanitarian response in general.  We, therefore, also need to see women as decision makers in the humanitarian response and not only as the beneficiaries of the humanitarian response.  That shift needs to be made.  More globally, if and when there is any kind of political process in terms of conflict resolution made at community level or at the more national and formal level, there will be a need at any point to be able to support women&rsquo;s participation in those processes.  Whatever they are, and this is not to pre-empt any kind of political solution to this, wherever the discussions are, women need to be at the table.  This is also something that the fund is very much involved in.  </p><p> There was also a question on the funding.  The capitalisation level of the fund overall, and this figure is beyond Ukraine and Moldova, is now at $100 million.  That figure is since we started in 2015.  For the response in Ukraine right now, with the support of the donors, of which Ireland is one, and Canada and Germany are the others, we have reached around $10 million that we are still in the process of distributing to local women&rsquo;s organisations.  I will hand over to Ms Stryzhak for her insights.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olena Stryzhak" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022061400002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chair for giving me the floor.  To be honest, I heard many questions, but I will address the ones that I can answer and that I can respond to.  First, I agree with what was said about how now in Ukraine all people are under violence.  This is true even for those who can apply to get help.  They are also in violence.  For example, there are women, girls and people who are HIV positive and who are going abroad as refugees.  We can help these women who apply to us from other countries.  It is true that they are afraid to go to doctors and medical centres.  They are scared that people will discriminate against them.  They may not have the power and energy to apply to doctors.  When they come from Ukraine, they do not feel so good and are upset.  We, therefore, use our consultants who also go abroad or those who can give them support and consultation.  It works in different countries.  Community organisations that work in your country give you the information about how you can make appointments with doctors, and information on where there are centres and places where people help women first of all.  This is because in the main, 90% of refugees are women.  They can go there to get help and treatment.</p> <p>  On the issue of sexual violence, I now see cases of families.  This is fresh information from last week.  Someone applied to me and asked about giving interviews to women or girls who were raped by Russian troops.  They said they need interviews so that they can know some information of these cases.  No one agreed to even do an interview.  We are talking about helping, but this is a hard situation.  Girls from families are closed off and do not want to be in touch.  It might be the case that this happens the first time, and maybe in the future we can give them support, psychological support and consultation.  However, now, this is so fresh.  It is so tragic and causes so much trauma.</p><p>That is why we are helping.  We are responsible for the supply we have for girls and women.  When they came into shelters from this region, as I mentioned, from eastern and southern parts to western parts of Ukraine and the centre, they started to talk after some time, and even to get support from our side.</p><p> Within the country, we continue to deliver our services and to organise places where women can get medical care or even support for pregnancy, but it is changing.  We have an even bigger level of stigma and discrimination in the western part of Ukraine.  People are moving from the eastern part, where stigma and discrimination is at a lower level.  When they move to the western part, we work with medical staff and personnel to explain to them and to support them.  We provide social supports.  We go to the medical centres and to the places where they live to deliver medicine and other basic needs.  We are dealing with urgent needs, but in future we will have audits.  We need to be ready to do them and to prevent cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.  That is why it is really a big issue, which we continue to resolve, but sometimes we cannot help in time because women are not ready to get help because there are so many trauma cases.</p></speech>

When it comes to conflict-related sexual violence, the fund also leverages the global nature of our interventions.  We all know that conflict-related sexual violence is something that is, unfortunately, used in many war and conflict contexts.  As the fund is present in more than 26 countries, we are also trying to draw experiences from other settings.  I am thinking of the obvious one, which is the Democratic Republic of Congo and the foundation of Dr. Mukwege, but there are also other contexts where this kind of support has been provided.  As Ms Stryzhak mentioned, it is hard for the survivors, but even for the people who are trying to extend the help in terms of being able to provide the adequate response when these are cases that they have never been confronted with in the past.  The fund, from that perspective, has the expertise and the kind of leverage due to its global nature to allow those type of exchanges as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022061400002#G00500"><p>On that point, could I ask Ms El Khyari to elaborate and concentrate on the criminal justice aspect of matters?  We all know, for example, that it is many years since United Nations Resolution 1820 was passed, which specifically categorises sexual violence and rape as war crimes - crimes against humanity.  Acknowledging what Ms Stryzhak has said, in so far as the strength and organisation of many of the women's groups in Ukraine seem to be substantially advanced in comparison with, perhaps, other parts of the world that are embroiled in conflict - I think in particular of Syria, parts of Africa and Afghanistan.  Could Ms Stryzhak elaborate on the situation in Ukraine in respect of sexual violence at the hands of Russian forces?  It seems that prosecutions are few and far between and that convictions are even more rare in terms of process.  Deputy Brady quite rightly adverted to the need for psychological support for victims, but from our engagement with Ukrainian MPs, there seem to be some gaps in the system, for example, expertise in the matter of evidence taking.  The police service in Ukraine must be somewhat overwhelmed in terms of its role, function and duty.  I wonder about the possibility of international expertise in evidence taking to assist in prosecution to ensure there is perhaps an element of legal expertise present?  Could countries such as Ireland assist?  From what has been said, it seems that it is a matter of funding.  It appears that there is more than just funding involved, however, because there is also the question of expertise and the extent to which the international community might assist in the matter of prosecution and the investigation or characterisation and determination of war crimes.  Has there been any call from the prosecution services for international assistance to provide the expertise, and could a country such as Ireland assist in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ghita El Khyari" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022061400002#G00600"><p>This goes a little bit beyond the mandate of the Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund, which is to support women's organisations in crisis settings.  From our angle, what we do is to support the women's organisations that want to engage in supporting the overall process of documenting the conflict-related sexual violence and sexual violence as a weapon of war and, in addition, we link service providers to the global processes of prosecution, as the Chairman mentioned.</p> <p>  What we focus on - I can get back to others later - is supporting the grassroots efforts from the civil society organisations and the women's organisations that are providing support to the survivors, first, to identify those cases as what they are and qualified as such, not regular sexual or gender-based violence, document that and then link it to another process that is supported by the United Nations but also member states.  There is definitely space for Ireland to provide support in that respect.</p> <p>  UN Women, which is the UN entity for gender, equality and the empowerment of women, has also deployed an expert on conflict-related sexual violence to join the fact-finding mission with the UNCHR to start that process of documentation.  There are also some bilateral efforts from some member states to send experts on war crimes in general on site, in this case on conflict-related sexual violence but also other types of war crimes.  I agree that it is not only a matter of funding, it is a matter of accountability and expertise but, from our perspective, our role in this big picture is to connect those dots and to support local efforts in terms of how the service providers and the women's organisations identify the cases and feed them into the global justice process that follows in terms of accountability and prosecution.</p><p>I hope this answers the question.</p></speech>

My organisation is also involved in all of these processes.  Every day we are in touch with women who apply to us.  Not all fully disclose what happened in the places they come from.  After a time they are ready to share this information with us.  Our mandate is to support them and give them full information about where and how they can have an opportunity to talk and to get support, medical and psychological care.  We pay attention to these cases.  For me they are very important because I understand how traumatic they are.  I want those who did what was done to take responsibility.  We should do this slowly and softly because the situations are tragic and traumatic.  We have information on how to do this from the UN but we cannot give clear instructions.  In Ukraine the governance structures of many cities and places have been destroyed and are not working as they did.  Some government organisations and clinics have difficulties.  We do not have normal lives now.  We had been developing as a country but structures and places have now been destroyed and we are trying to reorganise our lives.  I agree with what has been said.  It is very important to have help and the benefit of experience.  We are building the structures for this support.</p></speech>

It is not only about funding but also about advocacy.  Ireland is in many places where it can speak and have its voice heard to advocate for the support of local women's civil society organisations which, as we have seen, garner long-term results.  They know best the needs of their communities.  It is best for Ireland to make these connections and showcase the importance of supporting organisations such as the UN Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the active contribution of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Irish stability fund and other groups in ensuring Ireland continues to make its mark on the support of international donors.  Unfortunately, as we all know, war impacts in an horrific and disproportionate way on women and girls.  This is why the engagement this afternoon is important for us as we prepare our reports for the Department of Foreign Affairs in respect of our national spending Estimates for next year.

I want to reinforce what Ms Flanagan has just said.  Ireland's support has been instrumental and not only in terms of funding.  The funding has also been important because it has been catalytic.  Ireland has always invested in this funding in a catalytic manner.  By this I mean that the investment we have received from the Irish stability fund has allowed us to start the work and then attract additional resources from other donors.  This is very important for us because it has opened doors and allowed us to be very quick and rapid in our response.</p> <p>  Ireland has been a champion of bringing the voices of women into many fora.  This goes beyond funding.  It is about amplifying the voices of women's organisations in conflict crisis settings.  This has been particularly the case when Ireland serves as a member of the Security Council.  It has been a champion of bringing civil society people to brief the Security Council chamber.  It has set a strong precedent for all members of the Security Council.  We hope it will serve as an example for other presidencies of the Security Council to include women as civil society briefers in the Security Council chamber and shift the paradigm away from women being victims of war towards being peacemakers, peace builders and humanitarian responders, which is what we try to do with the UN Women's Peace &amp;amp; Humanitarian Fund.

We are delighted to attend the meeting.</p> <p>  A number of reports have identified the impact of substance misuse on families.  These include worry and psychological distress, leading to physical and mental ill-health; exposure to threats and violence associated with drug debts, involvement of a drug-using family member in the illicit market; the financial burden of directly and indirectly supporting the drug user; the impact on employment of stress and caring responsibilities; strain on family relationships; harm from domestic violence and isolation and loss of social life.  The FASN is a dedicated support service for family members or concerned persons who are impacted by loved ones' substance misuse.</p> <p>  I refer to the reason for our formation.  The FASN is a voluntary organisation covering the four counties of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath and Louth.  It grew organically from the needs of family members who were impacted by loved ones' addiction and behaviour.  In the north east of Ireland families with a loved one who is addicted to drugs or alcohol do not have resources available to help them understand the impact of addiction or to help them improve their current living situation and coping skills.</p><p>Family members are involved at the core of development, management and servicing of the project.  Recognising the importance of the needs of families, the founders of FASN set up peer support groups in the area. The people involved found great strength in the union of their voices.  These groups led to a formal organisation and a network, which today is known as the Family Addiction Support Network.</p><p> FASN is led and run by adult family members and volunteer facilitators who have lived experience of addiction.  This peer element is fundamental to FASN as is the training and support provided to facilitators.  The mission of FASN is to assist families in the north east to achieve a greater understanding of addiction, empower them to improve their quality of life and to fulfil a positive role in the recovery of their loved one, should they choose to take it.  FASN has recruited, trained, supported and retained a group of volunteer peers, both men and women, who facilitate peer-led family support groups.  These facilitators meet a trained psychotherapist on a monthly basis for professional support and supervision.  The accredited training, and professional support and supervision provided, are important and valued aspects of the model of peer-led services that FASN has developed.</p><p> FASN is guided in its work by the National Drug Strategy 2017 to 2025, particularly by goal 4 which is to support participation of individuals, families and communities; to strengthen the resilience of communities and build their capacity to respond through supported, and promoted structures, at local, regional and national level, and measure the impact of drug-related crime on communities; and to enable participation by both service users and their families through building capacity within the problem substance use sector to develop a patient safety approach, and involve service users and families in decision-making structures.</p><p> The FASN service straddles tier 1, which is primary, and tier 2, which is secondary, of the rehabilitation pathway of the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee, NDRIC.  The network is fundamentally based on the principles of partnership, community development, inclusion, participation and the empowerment of families who have been impacted by loved ones with substance misuse.  It supports the goals of the national drugs strategy called Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025 and implements goal 3 of the UN sustainable development goals, which is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</p><p> While FASN is about developing services that are based on the knowledge and expertise of the people who are most affected, such as families and communities, they have built strong inter-agency </p><p>alliances with other services such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Extern, the HSE, county councils, the Irish Bishops' Drug Initiative and the Family Support National Steering Committee.  In particular, they have developed formal links with other projects in the addiction area, including Turas and the RISE Foundation.</p><p> The relationship with the RISE Foundation has enabled our service users to access a ten-week educational and therapeutic programme that supports and encourages them to move towards their own recovery of resilience, and good mental health.  The programme is delivered by experienced and accredited psychotherapists.  The RISE Foundation also delivers one-to-one counselling for family members and-or concerned friends impacted through addiction and runs aftercare.</p><p> FASN truly believes that by supporting families to have their needs met they are then able to change the outcomes for themselves.  To do this we create an environment where people can learn for themselves and are supported in the choices that they make.  Of significance, while family members may initially be defined as service users, they often become trained facilitators working with other family members.  This means that families directly have a voice in how services are delivered and managed in a strategic way.  In this way community activism is nurtured and proactive in terms of needs on the ground.  The service implements the goals of the new strategy.</p><p> To date, FASN provides the following services: a 24-7 out-of-hours telephone helpline; one-to-one crisis support; a 5-step brief intervention; peer supported groups; access to one-to-one counselling; access to respite care; and an educational programme that is delivered by the RISE Foundation; it also led the way in the north east with the drugs intimidation reporting programme.</p><p> The Family Addiction Support Network commissioned its own research and presented findings from a study on how families are impacted by substance misuse in the north-east region of Ireland.  The research was funded by the HSE's community healthcare organisation, CHO8 region, to look at the impact that substance misuse has on families.  On 14 May 2019, the report was launched by the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Catherine Byrne, who had special responsibility for communities and the national drugs strategy.  A key backdrop to the study was the national drug strategy entitled Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, which for the first time included families as service users in their own right.  The study acknowledged the interface between changes in social policy and families.</p><p>This study was the first to look at that interface in the context of adult family members affected by substance misuse in the north-east region of Ireland.  The report was largely driven by the narrative of families being valued as experts by virtue of their experience.  It gives voice to the chaos, trauma and distress visited on families impacted by the addiction of a family member.  We had hoped that the key findings of this study would help formulate changes in service provision and practice and would improve the opportunities for families to engage meaningfully in their own recovery and well-being.  <br/><br/>With regard to the findings of the report, within the report, families spoke about the psychological and physical ways they had been impacted by substance misuse.  Participants discussed stress, anxiety, fear, not sleeping, feeling sick, not being able to eat, wanting to run away, anger, resentment, frustration, blaming themselves, a feeling of failure, guilt and shame.  Participants were not aware of or able to give voice to their feelings at first.  It was not until they found support, such as contact with the Family Addiction Support Network, FASN, that they began to understand and allow themselves to see what was going on.  Families also spoke about exposure to criminal activity and its impact.  They expressed fear and intimidation and spoke about having to take out loans, getting into debt, being threatened by drug dealers, not being able to sleep in their own houses because of threats, having pipe bombs put under their cars, being threatened with petrol bombs, threats by their loved one who would put massive pressure on the family, having to take out protection and barring orders to have them excluded from the home, the impact on siblings and other family members and on neighbours, villages and local communities, and the link to shame, guilt and stigma.  <br/><br/>However, there was considerable frustration at what was seen as sensationalist media reporting on drug gangs and gangland feuds, notwithstanding that this phenomenon is part of the issue.  Participants were keen to correct this balance by reporting their experience of intimidation perpetrated by local drug dealers, who may be drug users themselves and trying to get money to buy their own drugs.  It should be acknowledged that the participants were aware of and had experience of using the drug-related intimidation reporting programme.  This programme is seen as very helpful and its confidential nature is trusted and valued.  The flexibility around the venue and time of meetings was appreciated.  The limits to the programme and the reality of what could and could not be provided was well understood.  <br/><br/>With regard to mental health, a variety of studies across Europe have estimated that between a third and half of patients being treated for substance abuse have an independent concurring psychiatric illness.  These findings have been replicated in studies that have focused on cohorts of Irish patients.  Psychiatric illnesses found to concur with substance abuse problems range from anxiety and depressive disorders to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, paranoia, schizophrenia and other mood or personality disorders.  It is possible that a variety of issues lead to comorbidity as described.  Drug use may cause users to experience symptoms of psychiatric illness or may lead to the triggering of an underlying psychiatric illness, sufferers of psychiatric illnesses may use drugs to alleviate the symptoms of those illnesses and both problem substance use and psychiatric illness may be triggered by common factors such as environmental stress or genetic predisposition.<br/><br/>I will now move onto substance use and family members.  When responsibility for addiction moved to social inclusion services from mental health services, it was seen as a significant acknowledgment of the many and complex issues involved that required a multi-agency and multidisciplinary co-ordinated response.  However, the mental health expertise required to manage the complexity of dual diagnosis is currently lacking.  When those in addiction experience a psychotic episode while using illicit substances, the mental health services cannot assess their mental health due to the impact of the substances.  Individuals may be referred to an accident and emergency department.  A busy accident and emergency department is not the place to manage a deeply distressed and often fairly aggressive individual.  While there is talk of a national programme and the HSE developing and rolling out a dual-diagnosis programme, we in the north east have not seen this development as yet.  This has implications for a concerned parent or family member bringing an individual for help.  Such people will already be distressed and feeling powerless.  In short, accessing appropriate addiction services in a timely manner causes a great deal of distress and anxiety for family members.  The literature does not recognise the difficulties for families seeking to access comprehensive specialist treatment services.  It should also be acknowledged that there are too few addiction services offering information or support and that those working in these services may have limited training and knowledge to work with family members.<br/><br/>On living with addiction in the family, one of the key recommendations in Advancing the Shared Care Approach between Primary Care and Specialist Mental Health Services, a guidance paper prepared for the HSE national A Vision for Change working group, had regard to care and treatment in addiction services.  It stated:</p><blockquote>	i. The effect and impact of alcohol and drug misuse on a person&rsquo;s mental health needs to be highlighted.  The preventive role of the Primary Care Team in this area needs to be supported by training and resources from Specialist Services.<br /><br />ii. Clarity needs to be provided on the organisation, delivery and alignment of substance misuse services to Primary Care and a national standardised model of service agreed and implemented.<br /><br />iii. Strong links should be established with local addiction services as well as links with local addiction support groups such as AA &amp;amp; Narcotics Anonymous etc. </blockquote><p>We would include family support groups in that latter point.</p><p>The preventative role of the primary team in this area needs to be supported by training and resources from specialist services.  Clarity needs to be provided on the organisation, delivery and alignment of substance misuse services to primary care, and a national standardised model of services must be agreed and implemented.  Strong links should also be established with local addiction services, as well as links with local addiction support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and family support groups.</p><p> With the onset of Covid-19, the additional pressures of lockdown had a really negative of families living with addiction.  Families often found themselves in lockdown with the individual in addiction and homes became a pressure cooker.  The families were unable to utilise or have access to other interests and outside distractions which may have helped them keep their mental health stable.  However, FASN did not stop its work, and adapted appropriate general data protection regulation, GDPR, guidelines to establish an online platform to support the service users, whose needs were greater than ever.  FASN secured training to work an online Alcatel-Lucent Rainbow platform to deliver its supports.  One of the most remarkable achievements of 2021 was that the level of service provision was maintained and, in some services, increased, and that no family or family member who contacted services for support was turned away.  This was down to the incredible dedication of the volunteer staff facilitators, who believe that the service they provide is essential for the emotional, psychological and physical well-being of families impacted by addiction.</p><p> On funding, the network receives funding from the northwest regional drug and alcohol task force and the HSE of &euro;7,500 per annum and some small once-off funding from statutory services to run particular aspects of the service.  However, no core funding is received to ensure the continuance and expansion of the service.  This funding was secured nearly 18 years ago, when FASN was in its infancy.  The network has grown exponentially since then.  FASN was very dissatisfied to receive confirmation, in January 2022, that it was not successful in the tendering process with the HSE to provide supports to families in counties Louth and Meath.  This is despite a long history of providing cost-effective, evidence-based supports using a peer-led approach and utilising accredited counsellors to provide one-to-one support.  In partnership with the Rise Foundation, we also deliver a ten-week family education and recovery programme twice yearly.  FASN is ultimately about empowering families by providing opportunities to move out of the chaos of addiction into their own recovery, positive well-being and good mental health.  This is consistent with the vision set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025.  In keeping with this strategy, family members are not only involved in service provision but are involved deeply in service development.  We believe a vital opportunity to continue to implement best practice while proactively responding to needs has been severely impaired because of the ongoing lack of core funding.  Organisations such as FASN and the Rise Foundation have invaluable experience and expertise in working with families and require appropriate funding to maintain this life-transforming work. </p></speech>

Since 1989, Tabor Group has been providing support and care to hundreds of people from all backgrounds and circumstances.  We welcome people from all over Ireland.  We are based in Cork.  We offer residential treatment services and community-based addiction treatment programmes to men and women over the age of 18 who are struggling with addiction to alcohol, drugs and gambling.  We have two residential addiction treatment centres.  Tabor Lodge is situated in Belgooly, close to Kinsale.  We offer a primary residential treatment programme there.  At Tabor Fellowship treatment centre in Cork city, we offer a new programme, the integrated recovery treatment programme, which I will expand on later.</p> <p>  Providing practical support to families and loved ones of clients who are in treatment is a cornerstone of Tabor Group&rsquo;s approach.  We provide this through our dedicated family support service.  We have a continuing care programme for people who have been discharged from residential programmes that provides ongoing treatment and support to clients that have completed treatment programmes and are learning to cope with the demands of day-to-day living and the management of their addiction.</p><p>In addition to this we are also developing community-based treatment programmes.  That is a relatively new initiative intended to reach out to people whose need for treatment is not sufficiently severe or demanding to require access to the programmes offered in the residential settings.</p><p> Treatment programmes at Tabor Group all have the following features: they are all client focused and trauma informed, and they adhere to national protocols, including the HSE national protocols for drug and alcohol services.  We have a variety of treatment approaches, all of which are person centred and include person-centred counselling, 12-step facilitation, motivational enhancement therapy, cognitive behaviour counselling and mindfulness-based practices.  The treatment programmes are supported by the HSE with an annual service level agreement and by all the major health insurers.  Tabor Group is accredited by CHKS and has achieved ISO 9001 certification.</p><p> In 2021, we received more than 1,000 calls from people seeking support.  We completed more than 300 initial assessments and admitted more than 200 people to our two treatment service centres.  On average, we get five calls a week from family members and loved ones who are seeking support.  In 2021, 16 people attended our new community-based programme and four of them went on to attend residential programmes.</p><p> Alcohol continues to be the main challenge for those seeking help from Tabor Group.  In 2021, 49% of the people who were admitted to our programme cited alcohol as the main substance of addiction.  We are seeing continued growth in the numbers presenting with poly-addiction, which involves addiction to many substances.  Alcohol is usually central but illicit substances are part of the addiction profile of more people attending for treatment, especially those aged between 18 and 35.  Last year, 32% of those who accessed treatment at Tabor Group said alcohol and other substances comprised the profile of their addictions.  Many of our people also have mental health challenges.  We talk about dual diagnosis programmes.  Tabor Group will be a part of the roll-out of dual diagnosis programmes which are rolling out in community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 this year.</p><p> Tabor Group has shown great resilience over the past two years in coping with the global pandemic.  With commitment and resolve, we continue to serve our clients.  We did more than just weather the storm.  As for others, Covid-19 presented significant challenges for the organisation but thanks to the staff, volunteers and funders of Tabor Group, including the HSE, Pobal, the Probation Service, Cork City Council and others, we rose to the challenges.  Working together and with support from the Mercy Hospital in Cork, we were able to keep our residential treatment services open and Covid-free.</p><p> Over the years, Tabor has continued to evolve and develop its services to meet the changing needs of people.  Following extensive research, planning and preparation, and under the leadership of our senior counsellor, Mr. Con Cremin, in 2021 we introduced and completed the first full year of our integrated recovery programme at Tabor Fellowship.  This is a milestone for the Tabor Group.  It involves us offering a 12-week residential programme that is open to both men and women who have complex needs, including mental health challenges, poly-addiction, cross-addiction and a history of previous treatment and relapse, as well as challenges relating to coping and living skills.  A younger profile of people are accessing this treatment programme.  Accommodation needs are also a strong feature of people requesting help from this programme.</p><p> We have developed a treatment manual which outlines every aspect of the service we deliver in our programmes.  We are also developing new policies in response to emerging client needs.</p><p>In the last couple of years, we have forged a partnership with the adult continuing education department at University College Cork, UCC, to deliver a certificate in continuing professional development, CPD, in responding to problem gambling.  We have also partnered with other UCC departments, namely, the department of applied psychology, department of public health and epidemiology, and department of adult continuing education, as well as Munster Technological University's department of social science, to provide teaching inputs on their programmes and joint research projects.  We are in the process of developing a Tabor Group research agenda at the moment in partnership with these institutions and others.</p><p> Tabor Group is embedded in the local community in Cork and in the HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 area.  We enjoy excellent working relations with the HSE drug and alcohol services under the leadership of Mr. David Lane.  An annual section 39 service level agreement has been in place for several years.  Tabor Group is an active member of the Cork local and southern regional drug and alcohol task forces.  We work closely in partnership with community-based hubs, which refer clients to our services for treatment.  We work together with other agencies for effective case management so that people do not fall through the cracks, particularly when they have completed their residential treatment episode.</p><p> Nationally, Tabor Group is committed to playing its part in achieving the strategic priorities of the national drug and alcohol strategy entitled Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025.  We contribute to the objectives of enhancing access to services, developing integrated care pathways and responding to the needs of disadvantaged communities and those with drug-related offences.  We are also committed to evidence-informed and outcome-focused practice.</p><p> Tabor Group seeks to be at the forefront in the development of effective drug and alcohol services to meet the emerging and complex needs of clients and their families.  Central to this is the development of evidence-based, trauma-informed addiction treatment addressing the complex needs of those struggling with addiction in a safe, residential and community environment through programmes delivered by trained and registered counsellors and psychotherapists.  Tabor Group seeks to be a learning community where research and training for the next generation of practitioners in the field of drug and alcohol services goes hand in hand with offering excellent and effective treatment support for a growing number of people and their families.  I thank members for their time.  We look forward to hearing from members of the committee and responding to any questions they have.</p></speech>

The issue around addiction and the particular challenges of co-occurring needs is an area in which I am particularly interested.  I have formed the impression in my short time in the Oireachtas that we are not doing a very good job in allowing people proper access where there are co-occurring issues.  I might direct some of my questions to a particular group but if anyone wants to come in, they should please do so.</p> <p>  I would like to start with that point of access when people look for services and seek help.  Both groups talked about working with other institutions or service providers.  I am interested in the level of communication, particularly between the groups and institutions like the Garda.  Perhaps we could start with the Garda but I also want to move on to the accident and emergency services issue.  I do not know who wants to take that.  I am interested in the level of communication and information sharing between the groups and the Garda.</p></speech>

Our facilitators on the ground work with family members who have been impacted by drug debt intimidation of their loved one or themselves.</p><p>Although the national family support network closed its doors last year, through our network and contacts with people on the ground and our involvement with the national steering group of the Family Addiction Support Network, family support groups on the ground came together.  We let the Government know that family support is still working on the ground right across Ireland, and that it is only the legal entity that is gone.  Our contacts within that group allowed us to assess drug-related intimidation and we were able to work with the Garda and the Drogheda Implementation Board to put together a proposal to deal with drug-related intimidation.  I am not sure if this is feeding into the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

I am trying to get a sense from both groups how much of their interaction with people is based on the extent to which they are in contact with the Garda.  Someone said to me recently, when talking about addiction and addiction services, that one of the issues around diversion programmes is that often the point when one interacts with the Garda is when one gets diverted to services.  I am interested in that aspect.  Is the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na actively putting people in contact with services and in that way acting as a conduit to access services, both for families and for the users themselves?</p></speech>

We were members of the drugs task force and the Garda are important active members.  The different agencies involved are working in concert and each knows what the other is doing.</p> <p>  In terms of hospitalisation and the links with the health system, as part of what is happening in Cork, there is a new programme based on in-reach into hospitals, not just at the point of accident and emergency departments but also for people who are frequent visitors to hospitals with addiction issues at the root of their need to be hospitalised.  A new integrated programme is being rolled out.  One of the issues on which the HSE wants to work with us is on the provision of a door-to-door approach whereby a person would leave the hospital and come to treatment.  We are delighted with that.  The system is in the process of being rolled out.  It is a very important initiative.  It is part of the reason that the Tabor Group was started in the first place.  Sr. Margaret from the Mercy Hospital noticed 30 years ago that there were an awful lot of repeat visits.  Many people were frequently in hospital but the underlying issue that was bringing them there was not being addressed.  In a way, it is going back to Tabor's roots.  We are delighted to be working with the HSE on the initiative.  Mr. Devine will speak about the Garda.</p></speech>

The stress levels of family members attending our family programmes are through the roof because of drug-related intimidation.  Our family counsellor and a representative of the Cork drugs task force are part of a working group to see what can be done.  We do not have much direct contact with the Garda, but we do have a service level agreement with the Probation Service.  The Probation Service might refer a young offender to us for a residential treatment episode as an alternative to prison, hoping to interrupt the cycle of offending.</p></speech>

Mention was made of the pilot project in Cork.  I am very aware that we do tend to think of it as crisis moments when people go to accident and emergency departments, but, obviously, addiction damages one's health and there are many people who are on wards because they have addiction issues.  It was stated earlier that accident and emergency departments are not a great place in that respect.</p><p>I ask Mr. Devine to elaborate on what he would like to see happen.</p></speech>

Rather than simply discharging people so that there is a kind of revolving door, they try to interrupt the cycle by recommending that they attend treatment with Tabor Group.  That is a pretty well-worn referral route to Tabor Group.  It could be used considerably more but when somebody is in hospital an opportunity opens up to take further action rather than just address the presenting crisis.  Some people will take that opportunity and other people will not take that opportunity.  They then contact us when there is an opportunity for a successful intervention.</p></speech>

There should be no wrong door.  If a person shows up in an accident and emergency department, if a person is a long stayer in hospital or wherever the person in trouble is and in, they are open to going for treatment whether it is in our tier-four services or with the kind of services that our colleagues present provide, that the pathway is straight forward and easy.  For too long that-----</p></speech>

They are a really important player in bringing a co-ordinated approach for the person.  Ultimately, a person will not mind whether it is Tabor Group - we would be delighted to welcome them - or whether it is a different group or family support services so long as they are getting what they need.  That is why we need to work together.  The policy has been good in the sense that it regards addiction as a health issue and not a criminal issue.  We are still catching up.  The country spends about &euro;3 billion on health services relating to drug and alcohol addiction.  We spend millions on the kinds of supports that we provide.  There needs to be a shift in emphasis from spending on harm to spending on recovery and prevention.</p></speech>

I return to the issue of drugs and intimidation.  I know this from my own community in the centre of Dublin and from where I grew up in Limerick.  One of the points in the opening statement about the local nature of the issue is very interesting.  Sometimes we tend to think of it as very gang-driven but often the actors on the ground, while they may not be our immediate neighbours, they are local people and we may know their families know them and they would know the families.  It is very hard to extricate oneself from that when intimidation is happening.  I have two questions on that.  I will stick to my two questions.  I have another one about data that I would like to ask very quickly.  Is there an issue with minors being engaged in that intimidation?  Does that make it particularly difficult to police?  Is it possible for peer support within those communities to deal with issues like that where minors are involved?</p></speech>

There have been seismic changes in the Garda's approach over the past ten or 15 years in that many of the young recruits coming in do the 20-week community drug programme the education programme.  They are all encouraged to take part in that.  We operated a drugs course with the Probation Service as well.  The approach has been to nip it in the bud especially with young people.  It is not a legal issue in that case.  It is about families and communities and supporting the young people.  Young people in their early teens as young as 12 or 14 can be targeted by major gangs to start off a career that goes into that.</p><p>Recently I worked with someone and it was apparent that there was a lack of awareness about the necessity for a multi-agency engagement.  There are child protection issues and the social services are involved as well.  There are also the Garda and family support.  There needs to be a full, systemic approach to how to work with a young person.  Often what happens is that they become very involved in drugs themselves.  The dealers know that.  That is a policy that they use.  It is a practice that is there.  I suppose it is a business method they use to get young people, and it is the families then that are left with the debts, which are never paid off because they can say it is &euro;8,000 or &euro;10,000.  The agencies need to be more fully engaged in that regard.  We could talk about Drogheda and how it took a multi-agency approach recently.</p></speech>

They do not know what to do and they do not have a path.  I was glad to hear a representative of the Tabor Group say that we need a roadmap for families that is easy to negotiate because they are completely stressed out.  One can imagine what it is like when they see their children with known drug dealers and they do not know what to look for or what way to go.  We parent the best way that we can, but without information or education we do not know for sure what we are doing and so it comes back in on top of us.  We do not have the strength, energy or anything else to be able to go and deal with it.  When families come through the door to us, they are broken.  The ones that can make it through the door are magnificent.  We hold them, support them and listen to what is happening for them.  We are experts through experience and we can hear where they are coming from.  They begin to build up strength and courage within themselves and they become a resource in their community for themselves.</p></speech>

We recently teamed up with Extern in Dundalk to develop an intensive family support package that will help to break the cycle of criminality.  It is about involving the people who are the most impacted in the solutions.  It has to be voluntary.  That is what we are working on.</p> <p>  It is the same with the drug debt and intimidation reporting programme.  It is about building up the trust within communities because they are gripped by fear.  There is an opportunity to build trust between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the people on the ground because, as has been said, policing it is very difficult because there are Snapchat accounts for dealers and it is all anonymised.  It is very hard to crack down that way, but if we all work together and have joined-up thinking then we can make progress.</p> <p>  I agree with the point that was made about the recent cocaine report.  One good thing that I got from it is that for the first time ever there was a decrease in smoking.  It just goes to show that if the Government and all the Departments work together, they could turn things around with addiction, the same as they did with the smoking revolution, and make it a priority in a health-led approach instead of a criminal one.  Who would ever have thought that the smoking campaign would be successful, yet here is proof of it?  I feel we should be concentrating on it.</p></speech>

While we have tried and tested programmes such as the 12-step programme, which works very well, we are now enriching that with trauma-informed processes.  We are constantly evolving.  Human beings do not stay put and neither does the sum of knowledge.  We are constantly evolving in how we respond to individuals and our integrated programme is an example of that.  It is quite innovative, lasting 12 weeks, and it involves a very different profile from that which we might have worked with previously.  There are now greater complexities.  I would say every human being is complex, but we need to address people holistically, as our colleagues in the Family Addiction Support Network talked about.  There is greater scope for more research and more research funding, and we would be grateful for anything the committee could do to support that.</p></speech>

The same questions about types of drugs and so on are asked.  The fields include ones relating to demographics, substance use, the treatment programme and the person's history of engaging with services.  They are very detailed, but some of these families have very little knowledge about primary drug issues, secondary drugs and so on, and it is totally inappropriate to ask so many detailed questions of families regarding the person in addiction and his or her use.  It should be geared more towards what is going on within the family, the siblings that may be involved and the mental health concerns of the family members.  As Ms McKenna said, they need to have a roadmap detailing how to access services.  Historically, families would have left the person at the door and they would not be included in the service provision at any level, the discussion of it or the care plan.</p> <p>  There was a pilot scheme in Dundalk when Turas developed the community-based alcohol detoxification programme.  Because it was community based, it involved a family member or other support person being given access, or being recommended to be given access, to the Family Addiction Support Network.  Very interesting things could have happened there, if money had been available, regarding the parallel journey when parents and other family members go into their own recovery, learn more about addiction and realise how, in many ways, they may have enabled the person in addiction.</p> <p>  The ten-week educational programme the Rise Foundation runs is very good.  It will be interesting to see the impact that has in working with the person who has gone into some kind of recovery programme himself or herself.  What happens is - I have personal experience of working with people in this regard - the families will be more in tune with what is going on.  Perhaps they have enabled the person, not deliberately but because they do not know how to manage this issue that has come into their lives.</p><p>It definitely impacts on the person in addiction because they realise they cannot go back and feed into the family.  The lies are perpetuated.  They are experts in avoiding the truth for lots of reasons to keep their secret a secret within the family but when the truth is worked together, amazing results can happen and families are transformed.</p></speech>

The family needs as much recovery as the person in addiction and that is what Ms Sloan is saying.  It is a parallel process and the person in addiction steps into recovery but even if the person in addiction does not step into recovery the family member needs his or her own separate recovery because of the mental health impacts, including stress, anxiety and all the other things the Family Addiction Support Network talked about are off the Richter scale.  It is beyond belief when you look at the impact addiction has on family members.</p></speech>

There was great feedback that families, usually families involved in the person's care plan, discussed issues around consent and informed consent and what could and could not be shared.  As part of that process, they developed protocols and parameters around what could and would not be shared in order that the person going through it felt safe.  The families felt they had much more knowledge about what the process was, what their expectations could be and how they could manage that recovery process for themselves and see the signs much more quickly when the person's recovery talk had gone and they were back into that use of hiding and secretiveness.  That worked really well using the framework we already have for interagency work.  It is a far-sighted framework.</p></speech>

We have one family counsellor and 12 counsellors working with clients.  If there comes a point where the family realises it does not have to be tied to the person's addiction, they can get free and have some semblance of family life independent of what the addicted person decides to do.  That can be great-----</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their contributions and opening statements, which were well worth listening to, and the debate with Deputy Hourigan there was brilliant to hear as well.  My background is that I have worked for years in addiction services as a key worker.  I managed services and worked as an addiction counsellor for numerous years and I was the director of the Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force, so I have a lot of experience in this and a lot of passion about addiction among people with mental health issues and about dual diagnosis in particular.</p> <p>  I will start with a dual diagnosis question.  What comes first; the chicken or the egg?  Does the addiction come first or does the mental health issue?  Drugs can often give calm and a sense of peace to an anxious person.  They work for a certain time until they become a problem as well.  People call it getting out of their heads because people want to get away from the reality they are living in and self-medication is one of the ways that people will do that, unfortunately.  What supports does the Tabor Group offer to people with dual diagnosis?</p><p>The witnesses from FASN mentioned accident and emergency departments.  I agree 100% that accident and emergency is not the place for anybody with mental health or addiction issues.  The hospital closest to me is Tallaght Hospital, where there is a 20-hour wait for accident and emergency.  If someone has a physical issue that is fine but if someone has a mental health issue or addiction issues, the wait of 20 hours for treatment is barbaric.  What would the witnesses like to see instead of that kind of system for people with mental health and addiction issues?  What would work for out-of-hours?  As we know, mental health and addiction issues do not just happen between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  They can happen any time of the week.</p></speech>

We see the person has a complexity of need and so we do not compartmentalise different parts of the person's life.  We work with the whole person.  Once a person crosses the threshold, we work with that person.  Where there are mental health issues, we work in partnership with mental health services.  We adhere to HSE national protocols of case management and shared care planning and involves the case manager orchestrating the different parties that need to be involved in delivering care to the client.  We are developing assessment tools to look at the childhood adversity our clients have had to encounter and survive and the resulting mental health challenges from that.  Our services are now more trauma-informed.  We are not simply treating an addiction; we take the whole person into account and tailor our treatment services to address the very acute sensitivities clients are sometimes coping with.  We are becoming much better at providing the holding that allows a client to look at a complexity of issues.  We also provide ongoing support.  Part of the reason we developed a 12-week residential programme was that we realised a four-week residential programme does not really address the needs of people who might have mental health challenges too.  The whole treatment process, including developing trusting and caring alliances with staff, happens much slower with people who also have mental health challenges.</p></speech>

My biggest wish is to take people with addictions out of the hospital setting and put them into a unit dedicated to them.  That way, families would not have to go into the waiting area and be stressed out and hurt by the reception they get.  If families cannot control the person who is with them, they get the flak.  The whole thing is just chaos.  Our wish list is for a unit for people who are very badly affected by these issues, so they can be brought into another unit dealing with both the medical and mental part of it and separated altogether from people who have other issues.</p></speech>

When they are in that space and looking around them, they can see people with physical illnesses, or accidents coming in, and they do not feel they belong there.  The staff are very under pressure but some of them can be dismissive sometimes because the issue is not physical and you cannot see the pain the person is in.  That does not mean it is not real.</p></speech>

If somebody presents with a psychotic episode in accident and emergency and is passed to the psychiatric services, that service will say it is not psychiatric but medical.</p><p>As a result, the family is shunted from one to the other.  If a loved one is going through a psychotic episode and is a danger to themselves or to other family members, may be suicidal or may have a family member who is suicidal, it is horrendous for them to be left in isolation with no services or support.</p></speech>

There was not the oversight that there should have been from the clinicians and psychiatrists.  They may have been quite happy when that happened at that stage.  We need to review how young doctors are trained.  In the North they had to do a six-month rotation and also come into the addiction services meaning they are familiar with those presentations.  Those presentations are quite unique and are not easily medicated.  The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of the psychiatric services is to try to diagnose and alleviate symptoms, and prepare some kind of care plan for the person's mental health.  They need to have greater insight of comorbidities.  Like the Deputy, I have brought people to accident and emergency departments only to discover that they were so distressed that one would nearly have to sit on top of them to keep them sitting there.  One is nearly like a garda.  Garda&iacute; are often called in those cases.<br/><br/>The mental health teams need to take responsibility and perhaps have a dual diagnosis unit to support the person.  We thought when the new unit was established in Drogheda it would help to alleviate the situation, but while under the influence of substances, they cannot move across from the accident and emergency department to be assessed by that psychiatric service.  It is not that people do not want to help.  It is the fact that it is outside their competencies.  There should be a greater sense of training.  This is how we live in real time.  I am sure it will be there for some years to come.  It is about how they garner the experience and expertise so that families are not left behind.  As Ms McKenna said, we may need a small unit with those trained experts in psychiatric and comorbidity in having dual diagnosis as well.  In the north east we do not have-----</p></speech>

People with dual diagnosis have the safety of knowing they have a place to be where the stresses and strains of daily life will not confront them in the way they do outside the treatment.  We can then build on that safety and the person gradually learns to engage with a treatment process that will be helpful to them.</p></speech>

Sometimes we screen for that and at other times we do not.  We can refer people to centres nearby for detoxification.  The HSE is planning on opening a residential detoxification centre in Cork.</p><p>We do not see it as essential, it is not a strict criteria of ours, that people are drug and alcohol free on admission.  It is almost to be expected, if someone is serious about treatment, that they will go for one last fling before they come in.  We then take care of their safe detoxification.</p></speech>

The witness gave a really graphic view of the reality of what is happening out there.  I am from an area where it happens on a regular basis.  I have a Bill before the Oireachtas on the coercion of a minor into drug use.  As mentioned, that seems to be happening fairly regularly.  I am interested in that drug related intimidation reporting programme that was mentioned.  Who is that led by?  Is it led by the Garda and who is it funded by?

We have been doing this for a number of years.  There are policies and procedures around it.  We work with family members who come in to our peer support groups, or who ring us up and say they are being intimidated.  We bring them in and work with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There is a designated Garda inspector for each area, so they come in and will work in the centre or in a neutral venue.  We are always holding the family member.  We do not deal with people who are caught up in addiction at all.  That is where we are at.

There is an awful lot of fear out there about how to respond to drug-related intimidation.  Organisations are not inclined to approach the subject or cannot speak to family members or the individuals who are being intimidated.  A drug-related intimidation reporting programme gives people knowledge and information.  It goes through the options available to people if they need to report intimidation, whether they want to report if formally or informally.  It also provides policy around keeping the staff in the organisation safe as well as the family members.  That is what it is all about.  It is building up that resilience in the communities and is breaking down that fear in order to be able to work together.</p></speech>

We can do any amount of work.  We have built up that relationship with the Garda and because it is a community-level intervention and we have access to families across four counties, it makes sense that we can lead out on that, along with the Garda.  As a result of the Vivian Geiran report, we have linked in with the Drogheda implementation board.  One of those actions was to work inter-agency to roll out this drug-related intimidation reporting programme.  We have made an application for a small amount of money to roll out training workshops and an awareness event in the autumn.  On the basis of that, and because of the proceeds of crime fund, we hope to develop that over the next two years, through the Department of Justice.</p></speech>

That has not been changed in years.</p><p>Has that been updated recently?  Have there been any changes?  One of the reasons I am asking and why I put in a parliamentary question is that a number of people in my community are affected by addiction to codeine, an over-the-counter medication.  I was looking for data on that but there is none.  It was falling under the category of other opiates so I was not getting clear information.  Have the HRB forms been updated recently?  When was the last time they were updated?  What needs to be included in them?  The witnesses mentioned research on the family side, which would be a brilliant initiative if it happened, but do they have any comments with regard to drug use?</p></speech>

It was computerised in drugs services.  The task force ran with an eCAAS system while the HSE ran with a different system.  There was a project to link the two systems so that the data could be recorded.  When it was updated, it was changed to include the care planning process and assessments.  There has not been much change since then.  There is no input at all regarding what is appropriate for families themselves.  One person in addiction affects six people.  If you think of families, there may be four or five other children.  We can work with them but other services, such as social services, child services and all of the other supports, also need that information.  They need to know the hidden harm and how many children are at risk in this country because of addiction in the family.</p></speech>

It needs to include families and the impact on children.  It also needs to reflect people's real lives.  The HRB does a good job but it could do an even better job if we had greater access to real-time information about what is going on in people's lives.  The research that FASN undertook was about the lived experience.  There is not enough about the qualitative side in the data.  There is not enough about the lived experience and how families are completely devastated by the impact of addiction.  The stigma attached to that is absolutely massive for families.  There is this thing around the secrecy of it all.  If it was put on the same footing as other services, even other services within the mental health area-----</p></speech>

I particularly welcome Ms Kelleher back.  It is good to see her.  I commend her on the work she is constantly doing in this area.  One of the areas I was going to concentrate on was that of crime and intimidation and its effect on families but, thankfully, Deputy Ward did it for me.</p><p>I also focus on the effects of this that families suffer.  On a number of occasions I have been to funerals of people who died from addiction problems and the family, apart from the grief at all, have been devastated for years prior to the death.  That is something that has not been focused upon at all by any policy.  On the way up on the train this morning I read about the Family Addiction Support Network and the work it does is of great importance.  Are there are family support structures in other parts of the country as opposed to the east or north east?  Is there the potential for this to be a national response and that there might be a co-ordinated policy between various groups?  Is the network just focusing on that geographical area or is there a potential to make this into a national organisation?</p></speech>

The model is there and it grew organically from the needs of families who had no access to services whatsoever.  We responded by developing the appropriate or relevant services which were needed.  It is very much from the ground up all of the time.</p> <p>  What makes us unique and wonderful is that our family members are involved in the development, the management and the servicing of it.  We have developed this continuum of care where family members who have come through their own self-development and the seven stages of addiction behaviour want to give something back to their community because of the help they have received.  People want to give back through fundraising or more of them want to give back by becoming a facilitator with their own lived experience to help other people.  We have developed a peer-led family support model of working.</p></speech>

The South East Regional Family Support Network would work along the same peer-led family support basis.  What makes us different is that our family facilitators need to be accredited in level 6 in conflict management and in group facilitation skills.  They must also have external support and supervision every month.  Some of them have also been accredited in 5-Step training.  They are part of a professional body of people.</p></speech>

This is a very important group that we focus on and indeed what the Rise Foundation focuses upon.  It has always been centre stage and has always been a cornerstone in what we have done.  There is definitely more scope for this, particularly at the early stages.</p><p>The national strategy acknowledges in one of its objectives the importance of family involvement in services so there is scope there for a national response.</p></speech>

As we have said, and as the Chairman has said, on numerous occasions, addiction has a devastating effect on family members.  Last Friday, I met the family member of a person who had passed away due to addiction.  I was told that at one stage that person went on holiday with their children, who literally spent two weeks just pacing up and down the floor of the apartment.  It was a complete waste of a holiday and the memory of it had a terrible effect on the children as they grew up because they remembered that their only family holiday had literally been dominated by alcohol.</p> <p>  The system notes and ticks the box when it comes to families but all of the focus, which I can understand, is on the person with the addiction problem to get him or her on to recovery.  However, there is another side and one cannot just tick the box.</p></speech>

The family lives with that grief and carries it the whole time.  Sometimes it is a relief when the person is gone because there is closure and the family can work from there.</p></speech>

I said that this is not prescriptive because they have access to psychotherapists who work in counselling.  They offer a range of supports that work on a skills base and builds resilience.  Some of the families are deeply impacted by addiction and do need the expertise of psychotherapists.  In fairness, it is good to have access to the RISE programme where there is that educational and therapeutic blend.  It is important that services have inter-agency engagement so that one builds a wealth of services like in Tabor House where there are many facets to treatment, and multiple levels.  The only way that that can happen is if nationally there is the commitment and drive to see families literally as service users in their own right and respect that they have complex needs.  Again, no one agency can support them fully.  They need inter-agency multidisciplinary supports to be put in place for them.</p></speech>

It is not just one person and the person in addiction.  Up to six people in a family will need access to counselling, 5-step programmes, brief interventions or whatever because of the trauma they live with.</p> <p>  Families are at the core of every community in Ireland so it makes sense that families are supported and given the skills that they need.  Of course when families are supported and given skills they will be far more effective in the rehabilitation process but they will also help to build resourceful and resilient communities.</p></speech>

Most people who recover from addiction are private citizens and they do not necessarily want to share their story.  What has been the Tabor Group's experience?

It is important that as well as focusing on the outcomes for the person, it is also looking at the outcomes for family members.  That is something that, as I said, is a cornerstone of what we do - it is very much everything that FASN does - because we need to measure impact in terms of the families as well as the individuals who are directly engaged in addictions.</p></speech>

This has been massive for us and really brilliant.  Even though the Senator Black is in the Chair, this is not personal or anything.  For us, it is about the knock-on effect for family members coming in and having access to this ten-week programme.  They learn all about boundaries, addiction, themselves and how to change the drug dynamic within the home so the person with the addiction takes the consequences and takes responsibility for the choices he or she makes.  The families still maintain a relationship with the person but they take care of themselves and come back to the focus of it.  It struck me earlier how much chaos a person in addiction can cause.  It the same with all the agencies around it.</p><p>The focus is still all on the person with the addiction and does not seem to be on recovery, resilience, inter-agency work and so on.

Drugs have evolved and there have been geographic changes also.  The delegates will have seen the recent report on cocaine use in Ireland.  Cocaine had a particular demographic but that is now completely changed.  You can now probably get cocaine in most villages in Ireland.  It is that prevalent and it is extremely addictive.  This has consequences not only for addicted persons but also for their families and communities.  The trend seems strange.</p> <p>  I do not know whether the witnesses can answer my last question but I am going to ask it anyway.  I do not know whether Deputy Hourigan mentioned decriminalisation.  The idea is to have a policy of decriminalising the person and focusing on the substance.  That is the policy we should be working towards.  I would argue we should even go beyond that.  This policy been talked about for decades.  It is extremely frustrating that the current Government and its predecessors have not introduced it.  I do not believe the current Government has the stomach to do so.  In Portugal, the outcomes for people and societies are much better.  I want to hear the delegates' personal views, rather than their organisations&rsquo;, on the ongoing debate on decriminalisation.</p></speech>

We feel that what we do is part and parcel of the health system, whether it involves someone in an accident and emergency department or someone in a hospital for a long time, including as part of the mental health system.  We fully support and endorse a health-led approach.</p> <p>  Jails do not seem to work for people with addictions, irrespective of whether they develop an addiction in prison or go to prison for an addiction-related offence.  There should be an emphasis on a health-led approach.  Portugal, as the Deputy mentioned, is a shining example of where the emphasis is being put firmly and squarely on health and support.  That is where we see ourselves as an organisation.  We do not see ourselves as part of the criminal justice system but as part of the health system.

It is more acceptable in society to have mental health challenges and to be suicidal.  We have managed to change that perception, but work needs to be done in the area of addiction so that people know it is acceptable to be addicted and there is help for people.</p></speech>

I do not want to be cynical, but there is a lot of lip service paid to all of this, to be honest.  When we scratch the surface, we find people are being criminalised for personal drug use.  That is not only a waste of time, but bringing people through the courts system is criminal in itself.  If somebody has a problem with alcohol, why would we want to criminalise that person?  I do not understand why for the past 25 years Governments keep criminalising people, because it is a perpetual cycle and it does not work.  This debate will probably be outside the remit of this committee, but we need to go beyond-----</p></speech>

We had a focus group that took part in it and, without a shadow of a doubt, there was agreement on decriminalisation.  A recent report found most people who use drugs are aged between 15 and 24 years.  We all do stupid things in our teenage years.  That can affect a person's employment and travel, and all other areas of their lives.  Why would we do that?  If a survey or debate was done on a national level, there would be outcomes and data.  Why can we not work on that again?</p></speech>

It is nice, because this conversation had to be had.  By putting their own thoughts on record, the witnesses have made a difference.  It is ironic we have two groups, one looking after the individual who is suffering and the other looking after the knock-on effects.</p> <p>  I boxed off four issues.  The witnesses are all in agreement that addiction is a health issue, whereas we have normalised it as a criminal activity.  There is nothing worse than being in addiction.  I say this because those people who are in it have no control.  Without help they will never move forward.  There are also the pushers on the other side who are digging the hole for those people and throwing them into it.</p> <p>  I loved the line, which is true, about being experts in experience, as in nobody sells experience and you cannot buy it.  I know where the families are coming from when it comes to passion because they have lived those life experiences.  They spoke about helping people, which brings me onto my final point, where again we were all in agreement, that the trick here is education.  It is getting it to the people outside.  We have all come across it in our own daily lives, never mind in our political lives, where people find it extremely difficult to access services and information.  This is no poke on the HSE, but everybody has been in agreement that the accident and emergency departments are not the place for this.  I was very surprised when Ms Sloan said that the police in the Six Counties got training, but we do not get training down here.</p></speech>

It was a community addiction studies course.  The new recruits are encouraged to do it.  It is a 20-week programme done by the community and voluntary sector.

They would be encouraged to do a rotation within a six-month period-----</p></speech>

Deputy Kenny mentioned that the perception is that decriminialising drugs would give drug dealers a free run, but it is not about that.  The witnesses are right, and I have looked a lot at the Portuguese model.  When you go over there, you will not be walking into a betting office, as it were.  Other preventative measures are put in place to access what is actually addictive without being totalitarian about it.</p> <p>  For us as legislators, in an ideal world, what would the witnesses view as the first move we should take to facilitate them and make it easier for them to do their jobs, thereby benefiting the people we are supposed to help, instead of us just sitting here, talking about it and saying that was a bad idea and they did not do it well?  There is no point in us blaming people in that situation.  If we are the legislators, we should be in a position to do something right.</p></speech>

That means a shift in funding from being spent on places like jails and prisons and towards the health response.  It is about us being seen as being an equal footing to, for example, cardiac services and maternity services, and everybody would say we need more than we have in those areas as well, so that we are not a Cinderella and we are on an equal footing.  That should be the message from the subcommittee to the system, as it were.  That would be a strong message.</p><p>Whether it is funding the kind of work that the FASN does in the north east or, for example, for us to be able to pay our energy bills, for the people who are coming to us, it is crucial that the HSE is given enough means to be able to deliver that policy to the extent it wants to.  It would have a benefit for the health system as well.  Nobody wants people who are addicted in the emergency department on a Saturday night.  It is not the right place for them.  Nobody wants people to be constantly coming back into hospital because of drug- and alcohol-related issues.  It would be a win-win for the health system.  It is to really put addiction supports, which include mental health supports, on a firm and equal footing with other types of health supports and interventions.  The FASN will keep going and we will keep going in Cork.  That parity of esteem really is very important.</p></speech>

We are the voice of families in the north east.  Families are not able to speak for themselves or come out because of stigma and because of their own shame, guilt and judgments on themselves, never mind outside of their communities.  We are that voice for them in that community.  We have done this work for 20 years and it has been such a privilege to do this, meeting with all of the agencies and groups and being in contact with Tabor House as well for family members.  We are going to lose all of that if we do not get core funding.  All of that work for the past 20 years is going to go.  We were affiliated to the National Family Support Network, which closed its doors last year.  We are keeping going, and we will keep going and support the families regardless.</p></speech>

When the Government establishes the priorities for the year, they should make sure they are actually costed out.  The strategy we have currently is wonderful.  It is very innovative but they do not cost it out.  It is the same with alcohol moving in under the drugs rubric.  That is important and where substances should all be.  There is nowhere where they have costed additional funding for family support services yet under this new drugs strategy they are charging families as being the main gateway to people's recovery.  They are the leading source of support identified in the strategy.  That should be costed out.  The Government has dangled the carrot in front of families and pulled it away again.  They thought that for the first time they were recognised as service users in their own right.  Without funding for those priorities and recommendations, they are just that.  They are on paper and look good but they are not effective.</p> <p>  It is also really important to see that we have a drugs strategy, an implementation committee and the coalface workers.  There has to be a massive educational piece with middle management around how they look at implementing that strategy.  There should be a national directive about how it is to be implemented and that it cannot just be in one area.  It is nearly an Eircode postcode lottery here for services.</p></speech>

A growing number of people are presenting with gambling problems but such problems are often part of an alcohol- or drug-related profile.

I suspect it can be quite stressful.  It is hard work.  I ask our witnesses to address the supports that are needed.  Do they get enough support in that area?</p></speech>

The Chairman is correct.  The work is challenging.  It is full-on in terms of the issues with which the staff of our organisation are presented.  In the past couple of years, the Covid situation brought an extra level of stress with which staff had to deal.  We have structures in place to support staff.  We offer them monthly supervision, through which they connect with a supervisor externally.  We also operate an employment assistance programme with which staff can connect.  We would love to be in a position to offer more services but we would need access to funding to do so.</p></speech>

There is much more demand for the integrated recovery programme.  The bottleneck is in getting a person assessed.  Once the assessment is complete, the person can be in the facility within a fortnight.  An important part of the answer to the Chairman's question relates to the process being counsellor-led.</p><p>There should be well-trained and registered counsellors.  These are people with built-in self-care mechanisms and that is very important.  Staff should not get swamped by client needs and should be able to look after themselves.  We are good at looking after staff too.  There should also be performance management processes and professional development of staff.  We are good at looking after staff.</p></speech>

What would be on the wish list that would make things perfect and where the witnesses would not have to wake up to any kind of anxiety around funding?  What would make things great for the organisation?  Is it about expanding services or ensuring there is enough funding for the heating bill?  What would be the perfect scenario?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Colette Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022061400002#AA00300"><p>We would like to put what we do on a firm and sustainable footing.  Relative to the other group we are well funded with the service level agreement we have with the Probation Service and the city council, as well as the funding we receive from private insurers.  It is always a concern and a worry, and it affects our ability to travel in confidence.  We have been here and we will be here a long time.  It is about having resources comparable to what we are doing.</p> <p>  As I said, people are providing services in the health system around cardiology or stroke care and those services can be relied on because they are properly funded.  They can retain the best people possible.  We do that but it is not something of which are fully confident because of the vagaries of the way public funding goes.  We would like that process to be on a more sustainable footing, although we are grateful for what we have relative to what others have.  We work really well with our partners, who are also subject to the variations in public funding.</p> <p>  The Government should prioritise this as a firm part of the health service and have a funding line commensurate with the need that exists and the work that needs to be done in order for people to be able to access services at the point they need them.  We must be able to support them and their families inside and outside of treatment and beyond.  It should be sustainable and it is probably the most important aspect of this.  As I said, we are not complaining because we know that relative to others we are publicly funded but it would be great not to worry about the money for the energy bills.  We know we will manage and we always do but it would be good if that was not a worry.  We would prefer our worries to be simply about the people in the treatment programme and their families.  We would like to put our energy into that.  I am not sure doctors in Cork University Hospital worry about the electricity bills; they worry about doing a good piece of surgery, which is correct.  We would like to be in the same position.</p></speech>

What would be the perfect scenario for it?  I ask that question and I mean a couple of things.  I am referring to specifically within its area of the north east but I am also talking about the position nationally and in general around families.  What would the group like to see if it had a magic wand?</p></speech>

There are volunteers at the top and the management level providing services and it should be safe to move over and let new people come into funded positions.  They would still be part of the organisation and driving it.  It is specifically for families.  We should be able to keep that suite of services that we have for families the whole time.</p><p>I would want us to have the same programme, support and supervision and the facilitation of our continuum of care.  The Chairman spoke about burnout.  All our fundraisers who did Trojan work last year are burned out this year and we have no fundraisers left for this year.  I would like our services to be embedded in the community and to be funded properly in order that we can do this work.  Our programme can be rolled out nationally.  I think it will take on a life of its own.  It will move along in that way.</p></speech>

Within the communities we serve, we are all vying for funding.  We are all minding our own little projects and there is a sense other providers should not be looking at our projects or they would not be getting ours.  I have enjoyed and learned a great deal from the place-based leadership programme that has been run through the Drogheda implementation plan.  It builds leaders through a more inter-agency, collaboration and shared learning approach.  That has been terrific in building trust and openness between groups on the ground.  That is something I would like to see rolled out nationally.  I would love there to be a regional unit for each region in Ireland because it is very hard for family members and people in addiction to travel with all the expense that would involve.  Ms McKenna spoke about our support network being embedded in the community.  If we knew it would be sustained into the future, we could relax and let it take its natural course.  If it is not, as she said, that is 21 years of infrastructural relationships, trust built up within the community, and the Chairman will know how long it takes to build that up within the community, and training wiped out in a heartbeat, along with our relations with the families.  It is very important to have an inter-agency approach where we all support each other.  This engagement has been beautiful today and I have learned a great deal from it.</p></speech>

That is a model I would love to see rolled out throughout the Thirty-Two Counties.  It is a very powerful one.  When I visited our guests, I met Mr. David Lane.  It is a powerful model and it would be fantastic if we could roll out an inter-agency model of work throughout the country.</p> <p>  I thank all our guests for coming in and for their comprehensive discussion with the subcommittee today.

We recommence our oversight of the review of the planning system.  We are joined again by Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, Ms Mary Jones, principal officer, Mr. Colin Ryan, senior planning adviser and Mr. Eugene Waters, assistant principal officer, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The opening statement and briefing material have been circulated to members.</p> <p>  I must read a quick note on privilege before we begin.   I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to today's meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  We are going to discuss themes 2, 3 and 4, which are consents, enforcement and planning bodies.  Briefing material on that has been circulated.  I invite Ms Graham to make the opening statement on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.781" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022061400002#B00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and members for the invitation to continue the discussion on the planning review.  As the Cathaoirleach mentioned, I am joined again by Ms Jones, Mr. Waters and Mr. Ryan.  The last time we discussed plan making with the committee.  Today we would like to primarily discuss the consent process and enforcement and the corporate provisions of both the Office of the Planning Regulator and An Bord Plean&aacute;la that are provided for in the legislation.  As the Cathaoirleach mentioned, we circulated discussion papers on the topic to the committee and welcome its views on the issues.  These papers have been provided to and discussed with the planning advisory forum.</p> <p>  The development consent process is a cornerstone of our planning system.  Local authorities deal with more than 30,000 planning applications each year, of which, approximately 10% are appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and a very small, but impactful, portion are subject to judicial review.  However, the legislative provisions can be difficult to follow and interpret, particularly given the number of amendments to the planning Bill since it was first enacted.</p><p> One of the principles of the review we discussed on the previous occasion is to bring clarity to the legislation and to have a chronological format for processes.  The work done to date on development consents has being framed in this context.  It is not proposed to make any significant changes to the consents process, but we are seeking to bring greater clarity to the different categories of consents and to make the provisions easier to follow for those involved in planning as well as for the wider public.  The paper circulated to the committee on this topic sets out that we are considering classifying all consents into four main categories: consents that are approved, in the first instance, by a local authority, such as standard developments and, now, large-scale residential developments, LSRDs; consents that are approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, such as strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs; specific consents concerning local authority and State development, such as Part 8 developments; and retrospective consents, including retention permission and retrospective consents.  The provisions related to the last aspect are going through the Oireachtas now, in respect of substitute consent.  Those elements will be amalgamated.  The timelines for all consenting processes, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la processes, are also being examined as part of the review.  When looking at the timelines for these processes, it is important we balance public participation with robust but timely decision-making.  We would welcome the views of the committee on this issue.</p><p> Local authorities play a key role in enforcement relating to breaches of planning legislation and taking action on unauthorised developments.  Carrying out unauthorised development is an offence, and anyone who has undertaken unauthorised development may be subject to enforcement proceedings by a local authority.  It is not proposed to remove any of the methods of enforcement, but we are looking at having a more streamlined process for the two main methods, the enforcement notice and planning injunction.  Additionally, the Department has been examining the distinction between enforcement of development and enforcement of activities such as quarries.  Enforcement of activities is a specialised area and the question arises as to whether there is merit in having specialist teams dealing with it at a regional level across several local authorities rather than an individual local authority dealing with it as part of its wider planning role.  This approach would also allow local authorities to continue to deal directly with traditional development-related enforcement cases.</p><p> The final paper concerned planning bodies.  We circulated a paper to the committee on the corporate provisions of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR.  These provisions are being examined as part of the review, and while some changes to the legislative provisions will be made, it is not proposed to make any changes to the independent nature of both bodies.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible for the determination of appeals on planning as well as direct applications for strategic infrastructure development, including major road and railway cases.  The board was established in 1977, and as there have not been significant changes made to its corporate provisions since then, these will be updated to reflect current best practice for State bodies.  In particular, consideration is being given to revising the appointment process for board members to provide for such appointments to be made following an open competition operated by the Public Appointments Service.  This will bring the process in line with that for other State bodies.</p><p> Regarding the OPR, its establishment stems directly from the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal and adds to the range of reform measures in respect of planning, local government and ethics legislation to address the tribunal's findings.  The appointment of an independent planning regulator, empowered to oversee the planning system, was one of the key recommendations of the tribunal.  While it is not a policymaking body, its role is to ensure the implementation of planning policy and legislation by planning authorities supports Government policy and statutory requirements.  It also ensures effective programmes of research, training and public awareness in planning are in place to strengthen the planning process and that members of the wider public are effectively engaged in the planning process.</p><p> While it is not proposed to make significant changes to the OPR's corporate provisions, the review should ensure clarity and consistency between the respective roles of the Minister and the OPR in the planning system.  In particular, as discussed on the previous occasion, there is a need to clarify policies and objectives that are mandatory and must be given effect, on the one hand, and guidelines that are advisory and to which regard must be had, on the other.  While this will be covered under plans and guidelines, it will have significant implications for the OPR's plan evaluation function.</p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss further the planning review and we are happy to answer any questions the members may have on the processes or on the corporate provisions and these views.</p></speech>

I apologise for not being able to remain for whole session last week, but I have read back over it.  Therefore, a few of my questions may refer to the some of the subsequent comments made in response to other members.</p> <p>  Starting with Ms Graham, I have some initial thoughts or feedback on the questions, because, in some sense, that is what these sessions are for.  I will take them in order, in respect of consent enforcements and bodies.  The biggest criticisms we hear from a range of statutory bodies, private developers and private individuals is that the consent process just takes too long, especially concerning large infrastructure projects.  Even if something is not subject to a judicial review but is an SID or it requires an appeal to the board, the average time being looked at for planning for big projects can be 12 months.  Irish Water, especially, will complain that planning accounts for many of the big delays with the urgent wastewater treatment plants required to tackle the agglomerations currently subject to European Commission enforcement.  I am not saying Irish Water is always right in that.</p> <p>  We must therefore be in a situation where all the timelines for the different periods of consent and consenting processes are clear, rigid and adhered to.  Before we had the LSRDs, for example, the only clear, rigid statutory timeline was that of the local authorities, where they were making the initial decisions.  That approach works, subject to some resourcing challenges etc.  Therefore, it would be a positive development if this review came out the other side with the result that everybody knew how long each bit of the consenting process took, because that would give us the clarity everybody is seeking.</p> <p>  This leads us to the question of resources.  Even in the LSRD scheme, the 18 weeks taken by the board to make a decision is too long.  I also live in the real world, however, and part of the reason this process takes so long is that there are resource challenges.  Likewise, if we are going to pile LSRD development applications on top of the board's existing work as well as applications for offshore wind planning projects, it will be a big challenge for the board, even with the promised staff.  This review will therefore have to address the issue of resources, even in respect of recommendations, or perhaps not recommendations but by setting out that if a specific timeline is desired, then achieving it will require the following resources.  This would allow for an informed discussion, whether in Government or here in the committee, to consider how such aspects can be managed.  I say that because if one good thing were to emerge from this process, it would be not just a consolidated and clarified Planning and Development Act, which would be welcome, but that we fix the significant weakness in the current system.</p> <p>  Moving to enforcement, part of the problem is the enforcement powers in many instances do not work or are too slow.  Larkfield House in my constituency is a case in point.  It has been well documented, so I am not saying anything in the committee that is not in the public arena.  A developer fitted out a building with 48 apartments with no planning permission and no building control certification.  That building is still fully occupied.  The developer has used the antiquated nature of the enforcement processes by submitting subsequent retention applications and new applications to string this matter out.  This has been going on since late 2018.  Today, I have a building in my constituency that houses 48 families, half of whom came from emergency accommodation and two thirds of whom are receiving housing assistance payment, HAP, or homeless HAP at enormous cost to the State and themselves.  This building has no planning permission and is subject to ongoing enforcement action by the hard-working officials in South Dublin County Council.</p> <p>  This is an extreme example but it shows us the challenges that can result when we have these big developments.  Therefore, while I am not necessarily proposing the core elements of enforcement change, if the Larkfield House situation is allowed to continue as it is and the individual concerned is making enormous profits in a building that is not fit for purpose, then we have a problem.  We need to think this aspect through.  The problem here again is resources.  The enforcement process is incredibly laborious for local authorities and incredibly high risk if they have to take it all the way to initiating court action.  One of the reasons, and it is not the only one, the regulations initiated by the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, former Deputy Eoghan Murphy, concerning short-term letting, which were based on a unanimous report of this committee, have proved so ineffectual is not because the regulations were weak, because I think there were correct, broadly speaking, but because the enforcement process is cumbersome.</p><p>Local authorities either find it difficult to enforce and it causes them difficulties, or a manager might say "Why use all that time and energy for such a poor return?" and use those resources elsewhere because of the resource challenges.  Enforcement is about how we speed the process up and make it much easier.  I am aware of the Minister's response when I proposed the idea of on-the-spot fines for certain categories of planning breaches for short-term letting.  The great thing about on-the-spot fines is that they are quick.  Of course, they are at a lower level - they cannot be at the very high level of fines - but we need to find some way of loosening that process.</p><p> On the planning bodies - I refer to the OPR - it is too early to make any substantive changes.  Just a review of OPR is a good idea.  I am sure the witnesses know what I am going to say.  It is not aligned with what the Mahon tribunal recommended, as it should have been in my view.  That should be included in the review.  There was a reluctance to have a fully independent regulator as opposed to a regulator who makes recommendations on courses of actions to the Minister.  So long as there is a clear delineation of responsibilities, that the Government and the Oireachtas make policy and pass laws and the regulator's job is to independently implement and ensure enforcement of those, I think we are okay.  Some of the key deviations from the Mahon tribunal should be looked at, not necessarily to make changes now but to assess whether they were as problematic as some people thought.</p><p> In terms of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, obviously, we cannot stray into the wider difficulties that institution is having but I would say that given so many of the key recommendations of the 2016 review, particularly those pertaining to the Department and Government policy and legislation, have not been implemented the Department and the Government should take the opportunity, considering what will come out of the reviews by Remy Farrell, the OPR, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the board's internal review - there are four reviews happening now - to completely modernise that institution as part of the overall review.  Therefore, I welcome some of the comments made in terms of appointments etc. but are there concerns around the recommendation of the 2016 review, for example, just using the Public Appointments Service for appointments to the board?  I know that some planning professionals do not like the current system and would like a hybrid system or another mechanism of having a small number of nominated bodies as well as an open competition and a public appointments process.  If the Government justifies why it is deviating from the recommendations but does something else to modernise the body, that would be very welcome.  It would be a wasted opportunity if we do not come out of this with something to assist the board to overcome the difficulties that we all know will come out when the four reviews are made public.</p><p> Finally, there is one issue I did not get the chance to raise last week.  The expert group on Traveller accommodation made a number of recommendations and there is an implementation group working on those.  However, a small number of recommendations of the working group that pertain specifically to planning, planning reform, section 183, land disposals in Part 8, and planning approvals etc., are not in the work programme of the implementation group because they cannot be as they are matters for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  This is the opportunity to make those legislative requirements.  Ms Graham will be aware that we struggled in the previous Oireachtas around those recommendations but collectively we unanimously came to a cross-party view that because there were no better proposals on the table that Part 8 and section 183 recommendations should be implemented.  This is the Bill within which to do it.  I know it does not specifically fit within these three areas but it would be a huge missed opportunity if we did not do it in this Bill.  In some respect, it makes sense because it would not be a subsequent addition to the new planning and development Act, it would be integrated in the new Act and that would be much cleaner for everybody.  I will ask some questions in the second round.</p></speech>

I think we will hear similar comments to those made by the Deputy around the importance of certainty in respect of timelines.  These are important issues for us to look at in the context of this review.</p> <p>  We are looking at resources, which are also associated with the efficiency and modernisation agenda as well.  There are two pieces of resourcing that we are looking at.  We are looking at the resourcing of the board and there is a significant project under way with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, with local authorities which looks at all the different functions, including enforcement.  How many people are involved and what does it need to address any gaps, and what will it likely need for the future?  In terms of planning reform, we see the resourcing question as being very much tied with learning and development and with the digital agenda to the planning reform.  There may be four legs to a chair but they have to travel in tandem.</p> <p>  I refer to the point raised around Traveller accommodation recommendations.  Basically, in any area where work has been done, including in the architectural side where there have been reviews, we are looking at that in the context of this planning review.</p></speech>

These engagements have been meaningful.  Most of what I say will reinforce what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  Ms Graham spoke first on the issues of clarity and consistency, which are two keywords.  This is about communication and about people understanding the various players in the planning process and the clarity and consistency of approach.</p> <p>  I know we cannot talk too much about An Bord Plean&aacute;la today, but it would be remiss of me not to mention that last night a local authority passed a vote of no confidence in the board.  I understand similar motions will be voted on across all the local authorities in the coming weeks and that is an unprecedented situation.  It does not instil confidence when 31 local authorities, that are at the front line of planning, are questioning the confidence in the planning system.  However, we have to go through the processes in place and that will eventually come to an end.</p> <p>  I refer next to the OPR, which Ms Graham referred to.  We have learned a lot about the OPR, I am personally a supporter of it and its work, but it is evolving and learning.  There certainly are big issues and vexed questions about the OPR regarding the understanding of county development plans.  Indeed, I was reading a report in recent days about the role and possible role of the OPR in another planning authority, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, although it is at a different level.  We need greater clarity on its functions.  Planning is a small area.  Ireland is a small place.  The players involved know of each other but greater clarity is needed as well as distance between the OPR and the Department, which Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned earlier.  It is a question of tweaking the communication aspect and the clarification of the role, such as that when someone wants to make a complaint, it would be reasonable to request that it would go through the various stages and processes first at a local level.  We need to be absolutely clear on what the OPR's role is in the elevation of a complaint against a planning authority.  I believe there is a lack of clarity around that.  There is also a lack of clarity about the role of the OPR in reviewing city and county development plans, which creates tension.  This is not to say it is right or wrong; I am just saying there needs to be greater clarity.  Ms Graham raised the training remit of the OPR, and I understand that as does Ms. Graham, but more work needs to be done there in terms of how the officials and elected members understand that role.  Of course, there must be a tier of planning and we have to comply with national guidelines etc.</p> <p>  The other matter is the resourcing issue.  Clearly, there needs to be a forensic and detailed audit of the resources to the 31 local authorities.  Perhaps not all the skill sets are there.  We talk about ecologists, conservationists, architects, and planners.  There is synergy between architecture and planning.  Some local authorities have a greater synergy between the two areas.  Some local authorities run two different departments.  It seems to be the case that there are different issues in different local authorities.  A lot of the resourcing issues could be addressed if we embraced digital technology.  By way of an example, I spoke to someone in one of the planning bodies in which, up to recently, applicants in respect of a protected structure had to provide up to ten copies of the application, coloured pictures and coloured sets of maps, and send them all over the place.</p><p>Now some of the local authorities are saying "No".  They are telling people, as an initial alert, that they can access these documents online in the first instance and if they want more details, they will facilitate them.  If we embrace technology, we can do so much more with our planning systems.  I really think we could be at the cutting edge in that regard if we were to take that on.  Again, we hear constantly that the board is trialling and reviewing systems and that local authorities are doing different systems.  Covid-19 taught us one thing - when we were forced to embrace technology, even here in the Parliament, we suddenly realised we could do it.  There is the potential to develop all of that.</p><p> There are two or three key issues with regard to the OPR and resources.  It is also about the deploying of resources.  There will be greater demands on a planning authority during the preparation of a county development plan than at other times.  There must, therefore, be flexibility in the deployment of resources.  There has to be potentially greater synergies between clusters of local authorities in the planning function.  That is a real opportunity for the clustering of skill sets, resources and expertise.  I am not saying that there must be outsourcing, but the potential can be there at times and not at other times.  We need to look more imaginatively at how we can cluster planning within the regions in terms of personnel.</p><p> Those are just some thoughts.  I thank the witnesses for their time.  It is a really positive engagement.  It is very helpful for the committee that the witnesses are here and that we are having this engagement.</p></speech>

From Senator Boyhan's contribution and that of Deputy &Oacute; Broin, the sense is that it is an evolving organisation.  Clarity is important, however.  The function of systemic review, which the board has in done four local authorities and will move to do in more authorities, is increasingly important in informing the process and identifying inconsistencies and operational issues.  It has identified resourcing issues.  In terms of learning and seeing what is good in some areas and best practice being looked at, we absolutely get the resourcing and clarity issue.</p> <p>  Again, I agree with the Senator on technology.  I think we provided papers or have papers ready on e-planning.</p></speech>

The Department is looking at that under our chief information officer to see the wider processes because some of that is at the front end.  When we mentioned enforcement, for example, that is where we thought shared resources for local authorities in clusters might work, as the Senator said.  Similar arrangements have been put in place in the waste and waste enforcement areas, for example, and have proved to be very useful in terms of having a number of authorities working together with one taking the lead.  Obviously, there are a number of areas where that works.  That can certainly work for the local authority system so we are interested in doing that.</p> <p>  Increasingly, more expertise is required in the area of coastal local authorities that will be moving into that area and sharing ecologists-----</p></speech>

Our roster has gone a little askew because people are coming from the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  I want to talk about consenting for the moment, which is mentioned in discussion paper 2.  Part of the consent process is the site notice whereby a person must erect a notice at the start of his or her application.  I am of the view that we need to tighten up on that a little bit.  I have seen situations where multiple site notices have been left up on the same building.  It is specified that a notice must be removed after a decision has been made.  It is often not followed up on and we end up with multiple site notices.  People actually get confused or do not notice a new site notice has gone up and think it is an old one.  That is an area I would like to see addressed.</p> <p>  I also think the site notice could be modernised.  I suggest it should probably have a picture or outline or suggestion of what the development will be; not the choicest picture but one from the angle where the site notice has been erected.  A scale picture of what one is likely to see would help many people.  Site notices can have very technical jargon with a small amount of description, which can be quite difficult for people to follow.  I think a picture would be very helpful in that regard.  I ask the Department to consider that as part of the consenting process.</p> <p>  One of the other issues on the consenting process, which has really damaged it in my view, is that local authority planners are bound closely to the objectives in the development plans.  The specific planning policy requirements, SPPR, under section 28 completely skewed that as well.  I seriously think we need to address the SPPRs.  They have damaged a lot of confidence in the planning system.  Essentially, the public is involved in planning by electing their councillors, abiding by the development plan process and submitting an application at the planning application stage, which then ends up at An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is not as tightly bound by that plan.  They get developments that are totally out of character and not what was expected for the area.  I really think that needs to be addressed.  I understand the need for the Minister to have the scope to issue ministerial guidelines but I think those specific ones have done a huge amount of damage.</p> <p>  Enforcement is referenced in discussion paper 2.  Enforcement has always been weak but I wonder whether it has always been weak because of the amount of time that is required to be put into it by local authority planners who get caught up in court cases that can go on for a huge amount of time.  Such cases are very resource intensive, and the penalties at the end are often very minor.  One can understand why planners or planning departments may not be willing to put that money in at the time.  They ask what the return on that is when people get fines or penalties regarding unauthorised developments or non-compliance with planning conditions.  I know that is beyond the scope of our planning Act because they are court judgments.  That needs to be accounted for as well.</p> <p>   It is proposed that the serving of a warning letter will be a mandatory first step in enforcement, except in urgent cases.  Can the witnesses tell me what they think an urgent case might be?  There is provision to be made here for the staying or withdrawal of a warning letter in certain situations.  If the warning letter is stayed, does that mean if somebody fails in a section 5 application, it commences in that time period again?  The warning letter is just to say to somebody that the Department thinks something is unauthorised or that there is a non-compliance.  It is just to serve notice on somebody.  I do not see why it would be withdrawn because if it runs out, it does not make any difference.  To keep the continuity of that timeline, it would be better not to withdraw warning letters.  Let them just fade out if there is no reason for them to have been issued, if the application is found to be authorised or if a section 5 declaration is given.  Those are my questions on enforcement and the consenting process if the witnesses wish to respond.</p></speech>

I understand what the Chairman is saying on the point around the SPPRs and development plans.  Part of what we discussed last week on the development plan is the process of getting more into the development plan.  I mentioned on that occasion that I believe there is a bit of friction in the system now because the development plans have not all been through the OPR process, which seeks to determine whether they are aligned with national policy.  In some ways, the work we are trying to do is a process of clarifying what is national policy and what is mandatory and operational.  As the development plans have gone through that process, there should be less reason to shift from them, unless policy has shifted.</p><p>For example, when An Bord Plean&aacute;la is looking at something, it may be looking at a development plan that has not been looked at from the perspective of compliance with the national planning framework.  There might be that misalignment but once we have gone through the first cycle of development plans, that alignment should be in place.  There should be less material contravention of a development plan then and the only issue should then be if a new guidance has come out, if it is mandatory or operational; and if it has an impact.  Those distinctions between the national, regional and local levels are the kind of issues we need to clarify as part of this review.</p></speech>

That would be my view.  It does not matter if it is the local authority or the next stage in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have seen a divergence there and that has created a lot of damage in communities that contributed to development plan processes.  Those communities had an understanding of what was likely to come in and of what the zoning and site objectives were and then suddenly something way out of scale came along and An Bord Plean&aacute;la was able to rule on that.</p></speech>

If there is an offence with a criminal conviction then that is matter for the courts.  If you are bringing forward a case you have to be capable of making a good one for the courts to make their decision on.  The courts decide on what penalties can be applied.  We are looking at the application and review of penalties to make them more fit for purpose and possibly more pointed.  That is something we are working on with the Attorney General's review group because we are aware of that issue.</p> <p>  On urgent cases, the capability at present to seek a section 160 planning injunction for an urgent case issue, in which case no warning letter is needed.  A warning letter is optional and it is being suggested that it become more mandatory in the sense that it allows for complaints to be parsed and clarified before committing to a full investigation.  An urgent case would be the construction or demolition of a house, for example, and there are other examples.  That is how it works currently and that is the capability that is there.</p> <p>  The staying and withdrawing of warning letters are there as options.  The staying of warning letters is there to facilitate somebody who says they are going to do something or to clarify some matter.  In such cases, it allows the planning authority the capability to stay something and then it re-emerges again soon afterwards.  That reflects the fact that it is mandatory and not optional.  On withdrawing letters, I hear where the Chairman is coming from on letting them run out but there are issues when members of the public who have done nothing wrong get a warning letter, they clarify that matter to the planning authority and they would like it to be withdrawn.  It provides an element of security to members of the public in those scenarios to clarify that there is nothing more and that the case is closed.</p></speech>

We are working with the Department of Justice, which is leading on that planning and environmental court.  One of the issues will be what cases it will be looking at.  We are looking at it from the point of view of the directives.  It may be worthwhile looking at the scale of the issue that may go to a planning and environmental court rather than the other courts from an enforcement perspective.  One of the things that might be important in a planning and environmental court may be the opportunity, if all the cases are going to the same court, to start to see a consistency and clarity of approach on that.  That is not to suggest there is not a consistency of approach but that dedicated court may provide an opportunity, along with reforms in the legislation, to look at this.  We are conscious that a functioning planning system has to have enforcement as a key part of it and from working with local authorities they would have the same view.  That is particularly true with unauthorised developments.  It may be a question of trying to get the scale right.  There are different bits of enforcement but it is not tenable that 30,000 people get planning permission for something and that other people carry out unauthorised developments.</p></speech>

The opening statement's section on enforcement notes that it is a specialist area.  I agree with that and with looking at the merit of having specialist teams on a regional basis to try to build that expertise in the area.  Is consideration being given to having some sort of national office that could resource that?  That could be the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office or something like that.  If not that, one of the key issues that others have touched on is that local authorities sometimes lack staff resources and expertise, as well as sometimes lacking the wherewithal to take court cases.  If some of that could be resourced nationally or on a regional basis, it would strengthen this.  Is that under consideration?</p></speech>

We have a sense, coming from the local authorities, that the remove to a national level may not be merited.  That is why the regional perspective was being looked at.  We are looking at resourcing.  We have not been thinking from a national perspective; it has been more about how we enhance and support the local.</p></speech>

People who work in local authorities will often tell you that because the court cases can be so complex and costly, there can be a reluctance to even take them or go down that route.  This applies to everything around planning enforcement.  If there was some national resource to be able to help them with that, like there is with the Food Safety Authority, which does that with more complex cases when it steps in and helps locally.  I am not arguing for it to be taken away from local authorities and for it not to be done at a local level but we should see how that can be supported and beefed up properly.</p> <p>  My second question touches on a point that also been made already.  On the appointments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the review of same, is it possible that a hybrid system would be looked at?  Is that under consideration?  Under that system some appointments would come from nominated bodies.  If that is under consideration could that be done through the Public Appointments Service, PAS?  When does the Department expect to have conclusions on this?</p></speech>

We are probably veering more towards that, without coming to a final conclusion.  One would not leave it completely open.  We have to be conscious that the concept of the board is that there is broad expertise and a mix of expertise, so it is looking at those elements.  As the Deputy knows from the State boards process, they go through the process and the suggested names come forward to the Minister.  The concept is that we will have this resolved by September, but, equally, we are interested in views.  We have discussed it at the planning advisory forum but there was nothing distinct.</p></speech>

There was a range of views on the matter among the members of the advisory board when we discussed it.  Some people were of the view that it should be straight to PAS and an open competition, but acknowledging as well whether the nominating bodies still have a vote.  When we raised the issue of identifying skills and identifying them in the primary legislation, there was a view that it may work and then one could tweak that as needs be to ensure we have the broad mix we are looking for on the board.</p></speech>

I have just come from the D&aacute;il; I thought it would be quicker to get to my office than across to the committee rooms.  I thank the witnesses for attending.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in what was said regarding the streamlining of planning enforcement, both from an enforcement notices perspective and also from a planning injunctions point of view.  I hear repeatedly from my local authority that resourcing is a very big issue when it comes to planning enforcement.  I am also told that the lengthy legal process is a very serious hurdle for councils to overcome.</p> <p>  To pick up on one thing in the opening statement, the witness referred to quarries.  I love the idea of a specialist national team being charged with enforcement for quarries.  When new laws came in a number of years ago on the basis of an EU directive to regulate quarries, all the quarries had to reapply for substitute consent in order to make sure they were adhering to current regulations.  However, that was a very lengthy process.  When one allows for appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well, it got even longer.  While consent issues were tied up in boards and sometimes in courts as well when one considers further appeals, local authorities effectively ended up with their hands tied on all other enforcement issues with quarries.  Operations could continue as normal while those cases were being heard in court.  That is the experience of some of my constituents who live near quarries.  I would be interested to learn more about how we could utilise the specialist skills set that is available when it comes to quarry enforcement to see if we could put together a team that would have a nationwide jurisdiction.  I would like to hear a little more about that in particular.</p> <p>  There is also the streamlining of enforcement notices.  Are there any resource implications for that?</p></speech>

There is a recognition that enforcement is probably the area in respect of which resources need to be pulled from other areas.  It is quite intensive.  From our experience and certainly from the experience of colleagues in the waste area where shared services have been put in, we see advantages to that type of approach.  When we started looking at enforcement as part of this exercise, we looked at the distinction between development and activities.  If something is built that should not have been built, it is very clear that it is there.  Some of the activities are more difficult and need more intensive investigation to see what activity is taking place and who the owners are.  There is a range of complex issues, and that is where we believe there are benefits to that type of regional team approach because they may not arise on a consistent basis.  That is where we are certainly interested.  From a legal perspective, it may just be that the legislation needs to enable this approach for activities.  It is probably something where one could start with certain levels of activity and build on that because there is no doubt that we will have to grow the resources in this area.</p> <p>  Mr. Ryan might wish to comment on the enforcement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.822" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colin Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022061400002#G00600"><p>The issue is that it is labour intensive, difficult and complex.  In particular, there is a need for the establishment of particular skills sets because in certain local authorities there might only be a number of particular activities arising once every so often.  People move on and do different things, so it is to keep these at a regional level to allow for rapid and more cogent responses to these difficult and complex cases, which can take a number of years just for the assembling of evidence and going through the process.  It can take a while.</p> <p>  With regard to streamlining the process, what we are looking at are timing issues and issues around the content capability for moving up to court, moving on in the court and what the court can do in terms with compliance with enforcement notices.  At present, there is only a black-and-white situation.  Either one has complied with it or one has not complied with it.  There might be the capability for allowing from a proof point of view that one has done one's best and that allows the court to make a decision around that.  Broadly speaking, however, it is about the technical issues surrounding the compliance with enforcement notices, timing the period, the capability of going to court and what court one goes to.  Ultimately, the enforcement notice is a very serious issue.  It is a legal matter and a matter that can end up in court.  It is a matter that needs to be very clearly enunciated.  That is broadly the issue with regard to the technicalities of enforcement.</p></speech>

Clearly, there are two types of enforcement.  One is where there is a serious egregious breach, where somebody has done something that the person clearly should not have done and the person knew he or she should not have done it.  Then there are much more minor breaches or breaches which, strictly speaking, are technical breaches that are not really of a substantive nature.  There will then be grey areas continuing between them.  We have to make sure that whatever we do takes a very hard position on those people who make egregious breaches.  Deputy Higgins is right.  Part of our constituency has a rural hinterland.  We have experience of small quarries or other industrial type activities that are in flagrant breach of planning.  They are subject to enforcement, including notices to cease their activities, but because it is commercially viable for them to continue right up to the point of whether the council decides to take court action, they continue to do them.</p> <p>  I heard what the Mr. Ryan said in terms of somebody who had done his or her best, particularly if it is one of those minor, less substantive issues.  However, I have a concern, and perhaps I am reading too much into his remarks, that we do not get much tougher on those egregious breaches.  One of the weaknesses in the system is not that people are being blas&eacute; about it but that the system allows people to make significant and continual breaches of planning.  We need to get very tough with that.  There is an additional point, and it is slightly tangential.  We also must make sure that building control enforcement and planning enforcement properly co-operate and collaborate.  I have seen some instances in other local authorities where a decision was made by a planning authority which is not consistent with best practice in terms of building control.  That only becomes apparent when something is built with regard to locations and materials that are conditions of planning.  Then there is a problem.  There is a planning authority that has given a permission, but then the building control officers in that planning authority, who are sometimes juniors in the power hierarchy in the department, are now in conflict with their own senior planning officials and the director of planning and development.</p><p>While it is not directly related to the review because building control is a separate enforcement regime, consideration needs to be given to make sure some of those inconsistencies in the system can be resolved.</p><p> Ms Graham mentioned the environmental court.  Similar to the points I made about the board, and I appreciate it will come under another Department which makes me nervous because it is such a crucial part of fixing our planning system, I am not sure it should have any enforcement role, certainly initially, because I would have thought most immediate need would be with respect to judicial reviews of planning decisions.  The court would need to have a level of planning and environmental expertise, not only judges but significant resourcing of staff members who can deal with those matters.  If we start lobbing on all the enforcements, or even enforcements above a certain level, would we be burdening what will be a very important new institution, if and when we get it, with too much, or should we make it the appeal body for large enforcement cases that have been taken elsewhere?  The real value the environmental court is how we protect people&rsquo;s access to justice under the Aarhus Convention while being able to provide for that in a speedy and timelined fashion without in any way compromising those issues.  That is a consideration.  </p><p> In its submission to the committee, the Irish Planning Institute raised an issue, which I want to raise by way of a question.  It stated one provision that does not seem to be included in the issues under consideration is sectoral referrals to the board in the absence of public participation.  I would be interested to hear that is now under consideration or a reason for its exclusion.</p><p> Climate must become a bigger part of everything we do at this committee, in the Department and in the construction sector.  We are about to get our sectoral emissions targets.  They will all be at the top end from what we read in the newspapers and I believe that to be a good thing.  There is not an element of any aspect of the construction process, including planning, that can be immune to change in that respect.  There might be a need, in a revised and update planning and development Act, for a module on a section on the interaction of climate emissions reduction and planning specifically on how we will deal with the embodied carbon reductions that will be a legal requirement.  There are a few practical suggestions, which we have discussed at the committee previously.  One relates to demolition audits.  When somebody puts in a planning application to demolish a building there should be an audit on whether that is appropriate, the implications of that and whether that is what is best required.  Local authorities should be able to refuse applications on the basis of a negative demolition order where the applicant has not made sufficient case.  There are cases where a demolition is fine but rather than using the demolished structure for landfill, it could be reused and recycled into the built environment.  We could have reuse orders that could be conditions of grants of permission, which would be important.  </p><p> While Ms Graham's colleagues on the building control side will examine what are the standardised matrixes for determining what the embodied carbon is of new buildings and new building products, it would be a mistake for us not to then apply some of that to planning.  It could be a feature of the planning system whereby there are requirements or where it is possible for a local authority to ensure that as part of that stated jurisdiction, it meets its emissions reduction target under the sectoral emissions reduction legislation.  Certain categories of building could be refused on the basis that carbon content is too high at a particular given time.  I know these are big new ideas, or they are not part of a previous conversation, but it would be a shame for us to do this major review and streamline this Act into a good item of legislation and afterwards for someone to ask about these carbon budgets and the fines we would fines from the European Commission if we do not meet those in each sector?  Climate and how it interacts with planning will be key.  I would be interested to hear whether that has been part of the discussion so far.</p></speech>

We have an interdepartmental group on which the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is represented from the perspective of our understanding its role, consent and interest in this area and across the renewable agenda and climate change agenda.  Obviously, colleagues are dealing with embodied carbon.  Part of this is about future proofing the legislation and much of it relates to this processes.  How do we reflect that and how policy is taken into account in the process in the knowledge that those policies may evolve?  We certainly can reflect on those issues but there is piece at the start of the new planning Act that sets out what planning is about, what sustainable development means and the interaction with the environment to the degree that can be described that in a legislative form because it evolves over time.  We mentioned a number of issues on the last occasion from a policy perspective that are important and the way we have moved to set that up in items of legislation.  For example, the Land Development Agency Act sets out a good deal at the beginning of the legislation on why we need it.  Some of this legislation may not be as well articulated on some of these issues.  That would provide an important frame for the development plan process, how difficult balancing of planning decisions come about and some of the items the Deputy mentioned.  We are conscious a range of measures are coming on stream which, as the Deputy said, will evolve, and perhaps the legislation, without prescription, will be able to take that on board.</p></speech>

Some of these things may be part of the review but a decision may be taken that it is too early to put it in the legislation   There is a value in at least having those under consideration.  Unlike the Land Development Agency or other areas, this is an area where we have legally binding reduction targets.  Embodied carbon is responsible for 10% of current emissions and that will grow as the national development plan expands.  Embodied carbon relates to what we do with the existing built environment in terms of what we reuse or recycle and what new elements we put into it.  We had this conversation with the witnesses' counterparts who are working at EU level on having a certification system for embodied carbon in different products.  What I got from that conversation, and I say this respectfully, is there did not seem to be a sense of urgency that we need.  We are already two years into the Paris Agreement and we are meant to have emissions reductions out to 2030.  We were meant to have a 4.8% emissions reduction in the past year but we had a 6% increase in emissions.  Unfortunately, with this one, we do not necessarily have the same kind of space as we might have in other legislation.   I am not asking Ms Graham to add anything else to it other than I am stating there is a sense of urgency with this.  With regard to the experience of the body,  particularly with respect to the weather review group, if with respect to the review we were able to ask what is happening in other jurisdictions, particularly in European jurisdictions where there they are ahead of us on some of these issues, and if they have started making changes to their planning process, that could inform subsequent revisions.  All of us, including those of us on this committee, are very behind the curve in thinking our way through what a post-carbon budget planning system, building control system and construction industry looks like and we do not have much time to catch up.</p></speech>

There are clear national targets around some of these issues and one issue, including for the planning process, is that we need to reflect on how and where they are translated down.  That is an important component.</p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Ryan to elaborate on the enforcement aspect.  We completely share the Deputy's view that the serious components of unauthorised developments, as well as other serious matters, are what we want to tackle.</p><p>Mr. Ryan may want to add to that.</p></speech>

The only issue is what is an egregious breach.  If someone builds a big factory somewhere that is unauthorised, that is clearly an egregious breach, but it could be an issue at a local level where there could be an egregious breach for certain people, so it is that definition issue.  At the end of the day, it is an offence.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point around the issue of the spectrum of breaches.  What we are aiming to do is look at the series of very egregious breaches and then try to look at the smaller, more minor breaches in some other way.  There is a continuum to this that has to be reflected on.  If it is an offence, it is an offence.  It is an issue that we are exploring, it is fair to say.</p> <p>  I want to stress that any streamlining or movement is not to weaken the system or look for some way out.  It is just to look at it operationally from the point of view that when the facts are put to the court, there is some position that can be arrived at that meets the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.  That is what the point is in regard to the enforcement issue.</p></speech>

I fully accept Mr. Ryan's point that it is very difficult to define.  Sometimes it is very obvious what an egregious breach is but it is different when we start looking for details.  I accept the difficulty.  However, sometimes the speed of the response is a barometer of how we react to it.  Certainly, from the perspective of many public representatives, when a planning enforcement issue is reported at local authority level, there is often not a speedy response.</p> <p>  I have two questions, first, on the area of resources and how those planning enforcement operations are enforced and, second, the long lead-in times that often result from the enforcement process itself.  I believe it dilutes the confidence people have in the planning process if they see what they believe to be a very significant breach either of a new planning permission that has been granted which, during the construction phase, is deviating from what is permitted, or, second, where something begins trading or operating that does not have any planning.  This relates to that commercial calculation Deputy &Oacute; Broin raised, whereby people trade it out and they make their money while they are operating in the gap.  The speed of the response has to be addressed by the review as well.</p> <p>  Let us say there is a significant breach of either a new planning application or a new activity that is taking place on a site.  An immediate response often assures residents that the matter is being taken seriously, whereas the failure to have an immediate response leads them to believe that nobody cares and, therefore, the matter will not be dealt with seriously.  We need to have timelines around the initial reaction to complaints.  I accept we also get complaints that are not genuine or that are erroneous and so on.  However, if local authorities were able to react more quickly, if they had the resources and if there were tighter timelines on how they should respond, it would give people more confidence in the overall enforcement process.  A quicker initial inspection and acknowledgement of a complaint would give people confidence that a process had started, as opposed to nobody listening.  I ask that those points be taken on board in the review.</p> <p>  If the Department has any issues around the allocation of resources to those enforcement activities, I would be interested to hear if there is consideration of that.  I imagine the Department is undertaking a legal process but enforcement is very important.  There are a lot of Dublin City Council by-laws in my area that are never adhered to because we do not have enough enforcement officers, which is something to think about.</p> <p>  The second area in discussion paper 4 is the planning bodies.  I note the first discussion point concerns the corporate challenges facing An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR.  I think we could have a full session on that but I do not want to drift into existing inquiries.  I will ask a broader question.  Is the Department looking ahead at issues that might come out of any investigation to try to ensure the public has confidence in the planning bodies?  For example, the strategic housing development, SHD, process really rocked people&rsquo;s confidence in the planning system.  They felt like something was being taken away from them and their local representatives in order to make more speedy decisions, and all that happened was that we pushed all of the objections into the more expensive and difficult area of the courts instead of being able to resolve things or give people their say at an earlier stage.  My question concerns the corporate challenges for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I note the Department is not recommending significant changes to the OPR or An Bord Plean&aacute;la but I have concerns that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is sometimes seen to be too removed, or too independent is perhaps the term.</p> <p>  I will cite the example of the local area plans.  Local authorities put a huge amount of money into these plans and some local area plans cost the best part of &euro;250,000, with consultation and so on, yet very little reference seems to be made to them by An Bord Plean&aacute;la when decisions are being made, and very little reference seems to be made to the clustering of decisions that An Bord Plean&aacute;la makes.   When local authorities make decisions, they regularly say, for example, &ldquo;There has been significant development in this area and we are referencing the local area plan&rdquo;.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la tends not to take that kind of holistic view and &ndash; again, this is my own experience of it - it tends to examine the case in front of it without examining the impact on the community, which local authorities are very good at.</p> <p>  My second question concerns that whole area of giving assurances to people that they have some ownership of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that An Bord Plean&aacute;la in some way references back to the structure of the council and the elected members.  One of the problems An Bord Plean&aacute;la has is that people do not have faith in it because they do not believe they have any stake in it.  I do not know how we get around that and whether there should be some community voice within An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but it is very much seen as a structure that is independent and separate.  That is for all of the right reasons that we need, but it does not do anything to give confidence to the community that they have at stake in it.  I have covered a few areas there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.842" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022061400002#J01200"><p>I take on board that there has been a strong number of contributions around planning enforcement and the speed and resourcing issue.  That is something we are very alive to and it is very useful to get engagement on that.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman specifically asked about resources.  We are working with the CCMA on local authority resources.  Enforcement is one of the areas where we are looking to see the level of resources that are there, what might be required for future need and what we can do around shared resources in that area.  It is a platform that will be important, whatever comes from the review, to make sure there is an alignment in terms of looking to the future, as well as the gap that might be there at the moment.</p> <p>  In terms of the generality, I obviously cannot comment on the particular review that is under way at the moment in the board.  In the broader context, we are at a point where we have had the national planning framework and the regional strategies, and all of the local development plans are now going through that.  For the first time, we have a national planning framework that really sets a context to planning and sets that hierarchy.  By the end of next year, broadly, all of the development plans will have been through the process and the OPR will have looked at them.</p><p>We will then be in a different era.  We will have development plans with which people will have engaged that are compliant with the national planning framework.  That should limit or set the context for the board when it looks at things.  There should not be that misalignment or rift leading to the potential to have material contraventions on the grounds of national policy.  In that broad sense, if we move on to the future in terms of this planning legislation, I envisage that people would be able to have confidence that, once the development plan has been through the cycle and has been through the OPR, there is a development plan that has been agreed and sets the context for what is going to happen.  Over time, we want those development plans to get clearer and clearer to people and for there to be more engagement with people at the development plan stage so that they know what is going to happen in their area.</p><p> The large-scale residential developments going back to local authorities is also part of that piece.  It must be in the context of the housing supply targets that are set for the area, the need to deliver on them, and the need to build for the future communities.  That will be an important piece in building confidence in the planning system.  From the system&rsquo;s perspective, it is important that the impartiality and the independence of the board, as well as the independence of the OPR, are maintained.  There are legislative proposals in the context of the organisational review.  We are looking at them in that context.  If anything else emerges, we will have an opportunity to take it on board.</p></speech>

I am thinking, for instance, of a worker representative being on a board.  I appreciate I am throwing a random idea at Ms Graham.  There needs to be some sort of community voice at the heart of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  How it will be done will be complex.  It is important and not just for the current period, because there has been an issue there in recent years.</p></speech>

That is an area that could be looked at in the sense that the board needs to have a range of skills that are not just professional skills - it has professional planners and other professions - but also people who are the educated person in the street or the person who has that link to communities, both urban and rural.  That is probably something we can reflect in that way.</p></speech>

On the idea of border areas where two development plans come together, the one with which I am most familiar is the north fringe, which everything from Finglas right across the north of Dublin city.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin would have it in the south city.  Not enough work is done by local authorities to ensure key parts of the city have an integrated approach to planning.  I constantly cite the example of Meakstown and Charlestown in my area where Fingal County Council effectively zoned huge swathes of land, allowed a significant shopping centre to be built right on the edge of Finglas, did not put in any community services and so on to support it, benefited from the rates and the development fees as result of that, and it took the best part of ten or 15 years for it to catch up and try to put in some of the community infrastructure.  We are still working on that and we still have a lot of challenges.  Even in this round of the development plan, there are examples of sites I would have said had the potential to deliver some housing on them whereas Fingal County Council is taking a more enterprise or commercial development approach to it.  I am not a party to that plan, so I cannot influence it, but I still think not enough work is being done on the fringes of cities, where development plans work together.  It is a structural problem.  There is a border there.  The OPR needs to examine that area, where two development plans come together, to ensure we do not inadvertently set up a system where centres become important and everything on the fringe becomes unimportant, with the fringe areas losing out as a result.</p></speech>

The housing and residential aspect is important.  It is also a feature when it comes to renewable energy where one authority abuts another, one has designated the area for wind energy, the other has not, but it is the same effective landscape and topography.  This is probably something a piece of the OPR can look at, but the OPR has to be working within a statute and a policy.  On wind energy, it would be talking to Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications about how regional strategies might be put in place to bring the national targets down to regional so that the local development plans have to fit within that.  However, it is a fair point around those issues.  We would have looked at some of the provisions, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said, to see where there can be interventions, to look at where they may have been subject to some legal cases, but it is just to look at that.</p></speech>

Well done.  There are pros and cons regarding the Office of the Planning Regulator, and when it comes to the big cities and the big developments in particular, there is much merit in it.  Ms Graham will be aware, however, that it is not universally welcome in rural Ireland and in rural counties.  I will cite a specific example.  In the development plans in rural counties, the OPR has been very regulated and has given prescriptive details in terms of the amount of land that is to be zoned, specifically relating to residential reserves, with large tracts of that removed.  The problem in rural Ireland is always that land still carries a premium, whether it is zoned residential or for agriculture.  If Johnny Murphy owns that land, he is determined he is going to farm it for the next 200 years, no matter what zoning is on it.  There will be instances where land surrounding many provincial towns is zoned for commercial or residential that in all likelihood will never be developed in our lifetime.  There is a concern that the diktats coming from the OPR are too restrictive, for example, for local councillors, who have the local knowledge and insight, who know very well that Johnny Murphy has no intention of ever selling that land, and who would have the wherewithal and foresight to say we should zone with Tommy Rooney, who would be much more disposed to selling his land.  I can see obvious issues with politicising zoning issues.  Within what the Office of the Attorney General is looking at, is there going to be any reshaping of the Office of the Planning Regulator or is that office sacrosanct and will it remain untouched by what is coming in the review and in the future legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-14a.858" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maria Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022061400002#L00100"><p>As a number of previous speakers indicated , the office is relatively new.  As I said earlier, it emanated from the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal.  It is a very important part of the planning system and confidence in that system.  There is no intention to significantly change any of the roles or functions of the OPR.  Tweaking that might be required to clarify provisions is what is intended.</p> <p>  I understand precisely what the Deputy is saying regarding the point he mentioned.  There will be some clarification due to the fact a residential zoned land tax will be coming into place.  If people have no intention that land zoned for residential purposes will ever come into use, then they will have the opportunity to seek to have that land dezoned and there can be a greater focus on land that is zoned.</p> <p>  On the function of planning, if land is zoned, there is a presumption that it will come into use for residential purposes.  There is an obligation on the State to prepare that land, put in services and do all the planning we have talked about, whether it is for an urban or rural area.  Over time, that tension will reduce because land that is not going to come into use for residential purposes and that will be used for another purpose simply should not be zoned.  The focus should be on the servicing of land that can come into residential use.  That is the direction of travel  To some extent, it is probably a difficult first trawl through and a learning process for everyone through the OPR cycle, but that will get easier over time.</p></speech>

It is that of the owner of a house who is given planning permission where one of the conditions of planning is the house has to be built, developed and retained in that ownership.  At present, if someone has secured that planning permission, he or she can write to the planning office to ask for that condition to be removed.  That document is not made public at present.  My neighbours have no way of seeing whether I applied for the removal of that condition and there is no record, or no way of publicly tracking, if that has happened.  Is that something this review will capture?</p></speech>

The only rationale for its removal is that the banks or a mortgage holder could come in.  If someone is looking to change a condition of permission, it is a requirement that it must be applied for.  We will look at that.  If a condition is being changed, that is a public act.  It is a condition of a permission.  It is the same if someone wants to change the number of bedrooms or whatever it might be in that situation.</p></speech>

It was to give some flexibility around that.</p></speech>

As Ms Graham will know, I was very critical of the weakness of the legislation.  There is a lot of confusion in the debates.  This is not just a rural battle because the good people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have been in battle with the regulator on a not dissimilar point.  However, the regulator does not make those policies.  Whether one agrees with the policies or not, the challenge is with the national planning framework, the housing need and demand assessment, HNDA, and the outworking of Government policy.  This is not in any way a comment on Deputy Flaherty's remarks, but it is very unfortunate that the planning regulator has become a whipping boy for Government policies on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  That is not to say I agree or disagree with the individual policies.  If people do not like those policies, they should focus on who made the policies and not the individual officeholder or the office.  Some of the language used in the House with respect to the individual who holds that office is not only unfair but misunderstands the fact it is the policies that are the cause of those contentions.  If we want to change the policies, we should focus on that.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Ms Graham.  Zoning is an enormous gift from the elected officials of a local authority to an owner of land.  It gives the owner an enormous increase to the value of that land.  If somebody is not using it, that zoning should be taken away.  Separate to the national planning framework, housing need and demand assessments, rural planning guidelines and zoning guidelines, I will go a step further and say that if the owner of zoned land - my preference would be over the course of one development plan cycle but somebody else might be a little more generous and say over two - especially residential zoned land, has not used it, he or she should have to justify the retention of that zoning.  There is just a presumption that zoning moves from one development plan to another.</p> <p>  We have a big challenge in the Vice Chairman's constituency, my constituency and elsewhere as regards land that will never be used residentially because it is not serviced or due to the intent of the owner, but is zoned.  Somebody who has land that is potentially serviced, and could and would develop it in this development plan process, applies for zoning but because of the HNDA, and I support it and the way it is operated, certainly in the Dublin local authorities - I do not follow the details of authorities outside Dublin - we end up with this bizarre situation where we retain zoning for somebody who has not developed land for ten years and is probably not likely to develop it, and deny zoning to somebody in a contiguous piece of land that could be developed.  The development plan process should be much tougher.  I do not mean we would take everybody's zoning away but if somebody has not reasonably attempted to initiate development or to develop, in the context of this review, we should get tough on that.</p> <p>  My questions are as follows.  Ms Graham and Mr. Paul Hogan made two interesting comments during their responses at the last meeting.  I will not ask Ms Graham to comment on the first but I will say it in response to her because I said it at that meeting.  She specifically reminded us that the Government makes policy and the Attorney General provides legal advice.  That is strictly true and that is the position, but where an Attorney General is quite activist and takes quite an activist role, and this Attorney General has done that in a number of areas, which could be a good or bad thing, the dividing line between policy and legislation becomes very blurred.  I am not saying that is a bad thing, especially when planning, law and environment are so inextricably linked.  The point I made, and Ms Graham reassured me at the last meeting, is that the maximum transparency we have in respect of the work and output of the Attorney General's work is very important because that then allows us to make a decision on where those lines blur and that informs the debate.  I just wanted to say that.</p> <p>  There was another very interesting comment.  Mr. Hogan used a great phrase when he indicated that we had "backed off" on the SPPR approach.  That was a phrase he used and that was the happiest moment I had when I read through the transcript.  I hoped Mr. Hogan would be here so I could ask him to elaborate on it but I am sure Ms Graham can do so.  It is an important point because, again, she has heard many concerns from this committee and its predecessor either about the SPPRs or how they manifest.  I hope Ms Graham might talk a little to that.  I presume it is also in the context of the clarification of things that are mandatory and things that are discretionary.  If Ms Graham fleshes that out a little for us, that could be helpful to us in understanding the plan.</p></speech>

I will make one suggestion - in order to save it being made when it comes to introducing amendments - regarding to the issue of notification of those on adjoining sites.  We have lots of complicated streetscapes in many of our cities.  People could have a planning application with a notice in their garden, but the neighbours who live behind them and who are immediately impacted may never pass up and down their street.  An obligation on people who are lodging applications to inform the adjoining site owners would be a very simple amendment to the planning legislation.  This would save a lot of heartache because if people have an opportunity to participate, they feel far less aggrieved.  They might not get their desired outcome but it is only when they find about a planning application once construction starts, when they never had an opportunity to contribute, that they feel very isolated from the process.  It is a very reasonable suggestion that owners of immediately adjoining sites be informed.</p><p>There might be two or three owners and it can be delivered by hand or registered letter.  It is a small suggestion and I intend to table an amendment on it.</p></speech>

One then comes to the issue of what is mandatory and what is discretionary.  The language of the Act changes, with phrases such as "have regard to" and "take into consideration".  The specific planning policy requirements were a way to deal with that.  We ask if this flows from national policy, if it needs to be observed, and whether it is discretionary or best practice.  If discretion is allowed in a plan, application or consent regime, clear reasons need to be given for diverging from the policy.  Making those links would provide transparency.  That is our thinking on the matter.</p></speech>
