We are here to consider the motion on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2019.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Michael Creed, and his officials.  The motion to approve the level of funding for the horse and greyhound industry for 2020 has been referred to the committee by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Under the terms of the order of both Houses, the committee must consider the matter and having done so report to the D&aacute;il and Seanad not later than 3 December 2019.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call the Minister to make his opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019112600002#E00300"><p>The horse and greyhound racing industries occupy a special place in the Irish psyche and a key position in the rich tapestry of Irish sport.  They are valuable to our economy, central to our identity and cornerstones of our social and cultural heritage.  There is an indisputable passion and commitment to these sports across this island.</p> <p>  An important pillar of Government policy is to ensure these industries achieve their maximum potential and in so doing contribute to economic and social development across a wide geographic swathe of the country.  Time and again through the years, Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and have supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing, greyhound racing and breeding.  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, HGRF, has been front and centre in providing this investment and has played a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of these industries.  These industries receive financial support from the State through the fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and to Bord na gCon.</p> <p>  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.28 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant regulations, has, therefore, been reached.  Exchequer funding provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the industries.  This cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation to give effect to the provisions of budget 2020.</p> <p>  The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2020, include an allocation of &euro;84 million for the HGRF.  This will be distributed in accordance with Section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80% going to HRI, &euro;67.2 million, and 20% to Bord na gCon, &euro;16.8 million.  It is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the fund by &euro;84 million, to some &euro;1.36 billion, to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2020.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to this committee.  The aggregate limit on the HGRF has been increased in this manner in 2004 and in 2009 to 2019 inclusive.</p> <p>  The 2017 Deloitte report on the economic impact of Irish breeding and racing, commissioned by HRI, indicates that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the breeding and racing industry is estimated at &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  In addition, it is estimated that there are 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.  Horse racing generates a significant return to the rural economy and a positive international profile for our country.  Behind all the facts and figures are the thousands of men and women who, directly and indirectly, make the racing and breeding industry what it is today.  According to HRI's annual report for 2018, there was a sharp increase in the number of new owners engaging in racing last year.  An increase of almost 800 new owners, up 16.2% year on year, was a significant factor in the growth in horses in training numbers throughout the country.</p> <p>  Retaining existing owners and increasing the number of new owners has been a priority for HRI in recent years.  The knock-on effect is an increase in horses in training up 2.4% in 2018.  The HRI capital development fund, covering the period 2015 to 2019, enabled projects to be completed at nine racecourses across last year with works at six further tracks continuing in 2019.  As proven in 2019, Irish owners, trainers, jockeys and horses are setting standards globally and their stellar achievements and enduring influence underscore Ireland's international prominence.  The Irish equine breeding and racing industry is competitive at a global level, despite other major racing nations having much larger populations and economies.  Despite our size, we are the third largest producer of thoroughbred foals in the world and estimates place Ireland only behind the US as the biggest seller of bloodstock by public auction globally.  However, the significant threat posed by Brexit to the current ease of movement of horses between Britain and France, in addition to the global nature of major breeding operations, illustrates that while Ireland arguably now has leadership position within Europe, its pre-eminence is not guaranteed.  Government funding, in addition to supporting this key industry, also presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment leading to a flow of income right through the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society as well as for our economy.</p> <p>  According to the 2017 Power report, the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly throughout the economy.  It is estimated that, in 2016, the industry supported 5,058 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371.  The industry is deeply ingrained in the social and cultural networks of rural Ireland.  The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare founded on a strong regulatory system.  I am confident that provisions in the new Greyhound Racing Act 2019, which came into effect on 28 May last, will make a difference.  This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability.</p><p>The new Act will improve the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity within the sector.  It provides the industry with tools with which it can effect fundamental change and reform. </p><p> Traceability has been a priority action for Bord na gCon following legislative provision in the new Greyhound Racing Act and a formal tendering process has commenced to establish such a traceability system for the racing greyhound.  Bord na gCon has also created a new position of director of greyhound care and welfare and the person appointed will have responsibility for the development of programmes and initiatives that exceed industry standards of care and welfare and foster a culture of continuous improvement and excellence. </p><p> Bord na gCon has introduced a range of care and welfare initiatives, which include the following measures: the introduction of a greyhound injury support scheme; financially incentivising the rehoming of greyhounds in Ireland through additional supports through the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, IRGT, which is operated by Bord na gCon; the establishment of a confidential freephone line to enable the reporting of welfare breaches; and a revision, in conjunction with the International Greyhound Welfare Forum, of the code of practice and the care and welfare of greyhounds to address retirement and transportation of greyhounds. </p><p> The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net.  The measures introduced in the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 had a positive effect on revenue streams with significant increases being realised.  Betting tax was increased from 1% to 2% in last year&rsquo;s budget and contributed &euro;62 million to the Exchequer in the period from January to August 2019.  </p><p> Given the wide geographic distribution of these two industries, they are fundamental to the achievement of more balanced regional economic growth.  Relieving the burden on our major urban centres and nurturing rural economies is a key priority for Government.  In this context, these industries should be given recognition for the considerable contribution that they make to rural economic activity and employment, although I acknowledge that there is a long-standing urban tradition of greyhound ownership and interest in greyhound racing.  Brexit poses an array of substantial threats to the Irish economy and coupled with the fact that we are a small and open economy naturally prone to volatility, it is difficult to predict what the future holds.  It is, therefore, more important than ever that we support these important industries to help maintain sustainable growth in these sectors.  The welfare of horses and greyhounds is a cornerstone of both industries and I am assured that HRI and Bord na gCon are striving to ensure the highest standards for the sport and its participants on and away from the race course.  Accordingly, I ask the committee for its support to ensure that HRI and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2020 and that the important role played by these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I commend this regulation to the committee, and I look forward to discussing any matters arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019112600002#F00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for his statement.  As a small country, there are very few things we can claim to be the best in the world at but we can justifiably claim to be the best in these two sports.  We produce the best and can compete with, and beat, the best, which is a significant achievement for a country of our size.  The chairman of HRI and the chief executive and chairman of Bord na gCon have made presentations to us in the past few weeks regarding where their respective industries are going, their need for funding and their plans for the future of both industries.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the HGRF.</p> <p>  The points made by the Minister about standards in welfare and governance are well made.  A highly publicised television programme on the greyhound industry did a lot of reputational damage to it.  The industry's response to that programme was swift and a great deal of action has been taken.  The enactment of the Greyhound Racing Bill will permit much more enforcement, which is needed.  There were many high-profile cases over a number of years in which the public did not feel enforcement was carried out by the industry.  We had high-profile cases of classic-winning greyhounds being found with prohibited substances, which did a lot of reputational damage to the industry.  Hopefully, under the new Act, anyone who transgresses will face the full rigours of the law.  Figures were given regarding the extensive testing being conducted.  The figure that stuck in my head was that only 0.25% of samples were found to contain prohibited substances.  Anyone found with prohibited substances must be clearly and strongly dealt with.  In respect of Bord na gCon's argument for funding, it has put its shoulder to the wheel.  A total of 50% of sponsorship is now devoted to welfare issues along with 10% of admission and restaurant receipts and 5% of Tote profits.  Bord na gCon has, therefore, shown significant willingness to put its shoulder to the wheel in providing finance for ongoing welfare issues.  The post-career life of a racing greyhound is paramount to the public.  We must ensure that when greyhounds retire from racing, they are properly cared for.  I was happy with the presentation made to us by the chairman and chief executive of Bord na gCon three weeks ago.  They told us that the board is increasing its standards all the time.  It is also important to stress that its welfare standards were in place before this programme was broadcast.  Additional funding is being put in, which will bear fruit going forward.  Over time, public confidence in the industry will be restored.  </p> <p>  Brexit will be a challenge, as it will be for all industries.  The movement of animals is paramount for both industries.  It concerns the financial viability of both industries - breeding, racing or the export and sale of horses and greyhounds.  Brexit is probably one of the major clouds hanging over both industries.  Hopefully, there will be a conclusion when the UK general election is over and a common sense deal can be put in place in order that the free movement of animals can continue to allow these industries to maintain their eminent position.  A major concern involves French bloodstock or brood mares coming here to our top stallions.  It is important that they still have ease of passage to this country because if this was disrupted, those mares would stay in France and, over time, stallions would be relocated to France, which could have ongoing implications for the bloodstock industry.  This is something about which the industry is worried.  Hopefully, it will not come to pass.  </p> <p>  I have been asked by Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who represents Dublin Fingal, to raise the issue of funding for the Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, an issue that has arisen on a number of occasions.  The industry believes it has jumped through all the necessary hoops to get access to funding and has published a five-year strategy plan, which was launched in October.  It has been given access to a 70-acre site.  Fingal County Council and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have been involved in that.  The association plans to build a national trotting stadium on the site.  It feels aggrieved.  It has put forward proposals.  The French authorities have contributed in excess of &euro;1 million to the association in prize money over the past six years.  The association feels that if it is unable to progress its industry and put it on to a solid footing, much of the progress it has made will be lost.</p><p>The association has strict legislation on doping and has adopted many of the French protocols in that regard.  It feels the protocols it has in place would stand up to scrutiny as regards the integrity of its racing.  It sent 16 drivers to France in the recent past to compete in international races.  The association feels it has done everything that was asked of it.  It was promised on a number of occasions that if it did A, B and C, funding would come its way.  At this stage, the IHRA is at a crossroads.  It has asked us to support its cause.  The association has done everything it has been asked to do and I ask the Minister to find funding for the association to allow it to proceed with its ambitious plans.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019112600002#G00300"><p>I thank Deputy Cahill for his observations and questions.  He began by commenting on the greyhound industry.  It has been a challenging period for the industry.  The industry and Bord na gCon are well aware that their viability into the future, both economically and in terms of the support not just of those who attend but the public generally, which is critical, is contingent on them embracing the integrity, welfare and governance issues.  To be fair to them, they were proactive in the debate that took place prior to the passing of the legislation.  They were asking, in effect, for the toolbox to enable them to meet these challenges.  I thank the committee for its support with the legislation.  There is a changed environment with that legislation passed and we are in a position to deal with those issues.  I am glad to see the response of the board since then, particularly with respect to the welfare of greyhounds.  It is something the legislation provides for, but the board has responded to it as well.  The Deputy referred to the financial support and so forth through the IRGT and apportioning a proportion of the gate and restaurant receipts and so forth.  There will also be greater conditionality in our funding to ensure that these important issues are addressed.</p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about freedom of movement and the UK leaving the EU.  That is a significant challenge.  The equine sector is governed by a tripartite arrangement, which predates our entry into the European Union, on the movement of high value bloodstock in the equine industry between France, the UK and Ireland.  To have a relationship that is as seamless as possible post Brexit, we have had to examine how we can facilitate the continuation of this industry, for which the interaction between the three jurisdictions is very important.  While the system will not be as we know it today, we are doing everything we can to ensure continued movement through border inspection posts.  Most of that high value bloodstock is either flown or goes through approved border inspection posts, be they at Shannon Airport, Dublin Airport, Dublin Port or Rosslare.  This is in the context of new investments in infrastructure being made for the post-Brexit period.  It is also contingent on the UK being listed as an approved third country for equine movements after its departure.  I expect that will be the case.  The UK will be required to have health certification, conditionality regarding residence periods and so forth, but I am satisfied that everything that can be done is being done to ensure the industry continues in the best way possible, while acknowledging it will not be same as it is now.</p> <p>  Irish harness racing is a long-standing issue and there has been a great deal of engagement.  As a consequence of that engagement, considerable funds have been spent by the Department in receipted expenditure on the commissioning of plans, the Indecon report and so forth on the industry.  We have spent in excess of &euro;100,000.  We recognise that there is potential in this regard.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien and some of my party colleagues have been in contact with me about it.  There are pockets of interest in this issue.  There is an interest in north County Dublin and there is an interest in my area of west Cork.  There is an interest in other pockets around the country.  There is potential in the sector.</p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked whether it was all-island in nature.  It is an interesting question.  The Indecon report, if I recall it correctly, made an observation on the desirability of having an all-island, uniform approach to it.  I am not aware of any jurisdictional support from outside this State, but I am subject to correspondence from the industry in Northern Ireland to say it is not part of the IHRA.  Be that as it may, I acknowledge the association has an issue with its access to the track it currently uses.  It is in ongoing engagement with Fingal County Council on the possibility of alternative track provision.  There was engagement in the past week or ten days with officials in the Department and we are awaiting further submissions from the association regarding its ambition.  Details must be worked out as to where that ambition can be delivered in respect of a site.  The tenure it has where it currently races is not secure so that must be resolved.  We have supported it in terms of standards in the sector.  That is important and, to be fair, the association has delivered on its side of that support.  However, there is another question.  We would like the industry to survive and prosper and will do what we can in that context, but there is the question of what Department should fund sporting investment, stadia and so forth, which is where the next phase of this development should be.  It is not a core function of my Department to provide funding for stadium development.  The responsibility is elsewhere in that regard.</p> <p>  What generates the interest in the context of this annual event for the HGRF is that people look at it and say these are horses and that they would like a piece of the action HRI gets.  However, what we are delivering here is in compliance with the legislation.  The fund is available not to the sport horse sector, for example, Horse Sport Ireland.  This is for the HRI thoroughbred sector.  The funding the Department gives to Horse Sport Ireland, which received an increase significantly above what anybody else got this year in a very difficult budgetary situation, reflects the fact that there are many constituent members in Horse Sport Ireland.  This is another sport horse in many ways.  I am not sure what relationship the IHRA has with Horse Sport Ireland but the latter works with various disciplines in the equine sector outside of the thoroughbred sector.</p> <p>  That is to give the context in terms of the HGRF.  Under the current law, it is not at our discretion to give some of the fund to, for example, Horse Sport Ireland or the IHRA.  We are constrained by what the law provides in respect of the fund.</p><p>The association is probably agnostic about how it should be funded as long as it is funded, be it through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in terms of sport infrastructure and stadium development, or another body.  This is, in effect, what its engagement with us is about now.  I hope there will be circumstances in which the organisation migrates successfully to a site provided by Fingal County Council, if that is possible, and that the provision of the infrastructure, in terms of the stadium, can be achieved through the sports capital section of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We continue to engage with the Department on how we might be of assistance.  It is not a core function of my Department.  HRI invests the money it receives from the HGRF as it sees fit to develop the thoroughbred sector.  It is not for us, through the fund, to say some of it should go to harness racing.  It is not provided for by the law at present.  I hope that provides some clarity on the issue.</p></speech>

It achieves quite extraordinary feats on the international stage in terms of flying the flag at the highest level for sport horses.  I would like to be in a position to provide more funding.  There is no shortage of asks.  We will continue to engage with the IHRA to see how we might chart a way forward for it given its ambition.</p></speech>

I draw the Deputy's attention to the international debate on Tote betting, not just to the debate in Ireland; he may have seen coverage of this in recent days.  Internationally, Tote betting, as a vehicle for wagering on horse and greyhound racing, is declining substantially because most people are betting by other means.  I am not sure the issue raised is of the greatest concern but I appreciate the point the Deputy makes.  It is ultimately an issue for the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

It has been significant over a number of years.  The sport is very significant in France, as it is elsewhere, including in Scandinavia.  It is much more popular there than it is here.  There is an interest here, however, and there is potential.  It is important to ask how we might find synergies making use of the infrastructure we have in the sector generally, not just the equine sector.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, we might consider this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019112600002#H00800"><p>I thank the Minister and his officials for the presentation.  The Labour Party is acutely aware of the undeniable importance of these industries to rural Ireland and the significant contributions made to rural economies in indirect and direct employment and through exports, especially in the horse racing area.</p> <p>  Our support for the fund, however, is very much conditional.  Five months ago, the Minister would not have had Labour Party support.  It is the first time to receive such support in two decades.  I was present for the introduction of the 2001 Act.  Everybody has to get his act cleaned up.  There are valuable funds being invested.  The beneficiaries of all State funding have to get their house in order, and rightly so because the funding is significant.  A sum of &euro;84 million is significant  Many other areas could benefit from it.  Organisations must keep their houses in order, including by ensuring the welfare of horses and greyhounds.  The greyhound industry, in particular, was the subject of a documentary in this regard some months ago, as Deputy Cahill stated.  The highest welfare standards must apply and animals should be treated with compassion and respect from birth right until their final days.  Mr. Nyhan and others reassured the committee in this regard.  Deputy Cahill stated Mr. Nyhan and Mr. Dollard were very reassuring in their recent appearance before the committee, especially in respect of retirement, rehoming and trust homes.  It is about time.</p> <p>  In fairness to everybody involved in the industry, all of this work starts with the animal owner.  If I have an animal, I should look after it.  It should be part of my remit to do so and I should not transfer responsibility to somebody else, unless there is a great number involved or some such reason.  Bord na gCon has got a handle on this.  That is why we will support this measure today.  It is only in the past couple of months that I have been able to say this.  The chairman, who is now more than a year in his position, has certainly a handle on it and reassures one and gives one confidence.  It is vital and paramount that all industries receiving State subventions act with absolute integrity and probity in their governance, in running their affairs and in respect of the welfare of the animals under their supervision.   Traceability is important, especially in the greyhound industry.  I saw an advertisement recently for welfare officers and senior executive officers.  That is another very positive development.  Those concerned need not think we are taking our eye off the ball.  We are all watching.  We do not need any programmes to tell us when something is wrong.  Our constituents also tell us.</p> <p>  Over the years, Mr. Kavanagh always stated - I did not always agree with him - that he would like the horseracing industry to reach a point where it would be self-financing and would not depend on State funding.  It is an objective.  It is one of the objectives that I hope will be achieved.</p> <p>  Some &euro;60 million was obtained from increasing the betting tax.  That was for two thirds of the year.  That would equate to approximately &euro;90 million for a full year.  The &euro;84 million provided by the HGRF is, therefore, covered by the betting tax.  I could say the money should be used for orthodontic treatment and everything else but the funding is coming from within the industry.  It is important that this message goes out.  It must be stated straightaway, however, that the football clubs and other clubs are saying that they also bet.  This is the argument they make but, nevertheless, it is worthwhile saying the money is coming from within the betting industry.  The way to make the industry fully self-financing is to make sure all areas are levied appropriately.</p> <p>  Some of the money goes towards prize funds, particularly in horseracing.  There is no problem with prize funds in horseracing but I would like more money going towards prize funds at a lower level.  It is great having the big races in the Curragh and elsewhere but tracks in places such as Kilbeggan, Roscommon, Sligo and Ballinrobe need to be given more help.  If I disagree with HRI over anything, it is on this.  There is an old expression in Ballinacarrigy that the fat goose always gets fatter and that if enough grease is rubbed to its posterior, it will get fatter still.  That is how I feel about this.</p><p>The thoroughbred industry is well able to cater for itself.  It has a lot of advocates.  There are only four or five, but Senator Daly is chairperson of the racecourse and doing a great job in Kilbeggan with more expansions and everything else.  They are fighting there every day trying to get a bit of sponsorship and make races attractive.  Sometimes HRI is not as generous as it should be in the allocations and attaches lots of conditions.  Sometimes there might be only six or seven horses competing in the big races with four or five out of the one stable.  It is a little bit of an irritation with me that the &euro;68 million is almost going into a fund that provides significant prize money that the ordinary Joe that I meet at the race meeting and people who own shares on horses and stuff like that never have an opportunity of being on that pitch, whereas at jumps meetings small owners can compete with Michael O'Leary even if they have a horse born somewhere down a back lane.  That is what I like about that, and that is the difference.  That is why I am supportive of the jumps industry in that regard.<br/><br/>I knew the IHRA issue would come up, and in fairness there are plenty of people nudging along the harness racing submissions and everything else.  They seem to be a very reputable group.  Any time they have come before the committee, they have made very strong, impressive presentations.  The 2001 Act underpinning the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund can be amended to provide a dedicated sum.  Allocating &euro;500,000 to the IHRA is the similar to some other body getting &euro;10 million.  The fund amounts to &euro;84 million next year but &euro;1 million would go a long way, and if we had to, we could amend the legislation to ensure that.  There is a new body, which has developed in the past few years.  There is an international aspect to harness racing and the IHRA does its business in a very professional way, and I concur with Deputy Cahill that we should divert money to it in some shape or form by amending the legislation.  I know the Minister would act <i>ultra vires</i>the legislation if he carried on like that now, and he has tried to give them some money without trespassing into this area, but it is a new body in a new area that could become self-financing much quicker than the others with a little boast.  That is an important area.<br/><br/>Every time Brian Kavanagh appeared over the past 18 months, he wanted to talk about Brexit.  We are all acutely aware of the trilateral relationship and the way that could be significantly affected.  I am glad there is an all-Ireland dimension now to integrity and probity in the greyhound industry.  The Bord na gCon staff are working with their British colleagues, and that is important to root out anybody who has misbehaved.  There should be no tolerance, whatever the status of the individuals, whether they are the top trainer or whatever else.  There should be no one smiling out of the television getting top awards where they have transgressed.  The good example is that of the ordinary people who try to mind their greyhounds or run their greyhounds with limited resources and do the best they can to provide top-class welfare.  We have reached that stage now that the bigger the transgressors are, the harder they should fall.  </p></speech>

As Deputy Cahill said, Fianna F&aacute;il will support the motion.  The Minister's statement gives all the figures and there is no need to rehash them.  Deputy Penrose mentioned that the fund is probably cost neutral because of the revenue from the betting tax.  However, betting tax aside, the fund is not only cost neutral; it is a good investment when one takes into consideration the employment it creates in rural Ireland in areas where there are not many jobs available.  With the tax returns and the tourism returns and, indeed, the exports of our thoroughbreds, it is like the old say, "You have to speculate to accumulate", and from the Government's perspective this is one of the better speculations.  It is a very worthwhile investment.  I have an interest as chairman of Kilbeggan racecourse, and while I appreciate that we had  Brexit budget and somewhat neutral, I was disappointed that the HGRF was not increased at a time Bord na gCon has made Trojan efforts to get its house in order.  That comes with added expense for next year to get the greyhound industry to where everybody wants it to be.  We all appreciate, as Deputy Penrose said, that 99% of the people in both horse racing and greyhound racing are horse owners or dog owners and they are good, genuine people.  Their hearts and souls are in the industry.  There are a few rogues who bring everything down, and they need to be weeded out but that results in added expense.  Through the implementation of the recent Greyhound Racing Act, this is probably a year where Bord na gCon could have done with a little bit more.  While I accept and appreciate that it was a Brexit budget, it is unfortunate that there could not have been a few more bob put aside.</p> <p> We had HRI officials before us last week, and they pointed out that the National Equine Centre in Johnstown is not fit for purpose and there is need for a major overhaul and major investment.  It is in their plans to do that along with examining the viability of a second all-weather track.  I hope the fund can be increased with a view to enhancing both industries.</p> <p>  I do not want to play politics on this but while I welcome the support for both industries through the fund, it is unfortunate that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in a knee-jerk reaction turned around and asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to take greyhound racing off its recommended list of activities.  If the Government is supporting the industry, it should support it.  One does not kick somebody when he or she is down.  As the Minister responsible for both industries, it might not be any harm if someone could have a word with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and get that reversed because the money being provided through the HGRF is only a portion of their income.  The industry bodies have to more than match that funding through their own income, and tourist attendance is a big one for the greyhound business.  If Government is giving a handout on the one hand and then discouraging people from attending on the other, it is a bit of a contradiction.  The Minister could take this up with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and try to have this change reversed in the interest of the greyhound industry.  </p> <p>  Finally, has the Minister any contingency for a hard Brexit?  Brian Kavanagh told us last week that the British Horseracing Authority, BHA, is actively promoting the development of breeding with a view to moving away from, or not being as dependent on, the Irish thoroughbred national hunt horse.  BHA is thinking ahead of Brexit.  We are dependent on the British market at our sales.  If the BHA was to fulfil what it is promoting, it would be a big knock-back for the industry, and that would be directly Brexit-related.  If the tripartite agreement was to go wrong, considering the logistics of getting horses to England or through England to France or whatever, is there a contingency plan in place because more support would be needed in a bad Brexit scenario?</p></speech>

It is good to have the midlands voice on the committee.  Regarding the Deputy's observation on welfare and where we are at with new legislation, even outside of the equine and greyhound sectors, welfare is a crucial issue for our international reputation, full stop.  That is why whether it is calf welfare, live exports or everything else that the Department touches, we are acutely conscious that this an area where there is a lot of public interest, and that we have to abide by and comply with the law.  Very often our own regulations are of a higher standard because that is what the market in respect of the agrifood sector, for example, demands and the public asks for nothing less than that these industries are highly regulated from a welfare compliance point of view.</p><p>Bord na gCon was in the vanguard of looking for change in order that it would have the toolbox to deliver on higher standards of welfare and integrity in the industry, which is important.  Members will acknowledge that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, is driving that change.  Given that we now have the legal framework, I hope the industry can proceed from what has been a challenging time for it.  Whereas it has been challenging for the greyhound sector, there is no room for complacency in any sector.  In the equine and bovines sector, we need to remain continuously engaged on the issue of welfare.</p><p> I take Deputy Penrose's point about the betting tax.  Following the increase from 1% to 2% in the tax, 2020 will be the first year when receipts will exceed the level of State funding in the horse and greyhound racing sectors.  Of course, the Department of Finance is broadly hostile to the idea of ring-fencing a tax stream for a particular purpose.  It is not that it does not happen, but broadly speaking, the Department is not supportive of it.  Not all the funding from betting tax comes from horse or greyhound racing.  People can have a punt on anything.  Whether it is Premier League football or horse racing, the fund is the fund.  For the first time it will exceed the amount available in the HGRF.</p><p> Regarding all the funding that HRI gets, Senator Paul Daly made a point about the equine centre, which is one of its concerns  That is a valuable asset to the industry.  It is not just for the thoroughbred industry; it is an asset that delivers in many other respects also.  We are acutely aware of that and we will commence working with HRI and the equine centre, looking at how we can make progress on the investment that is necessary, perhaps along a model similar to that used in the Curragh, using outside investment, etc.  We are anxious to proceed with that.</p><p> Deputy Penrose rightly made the point that it is not just about all the big days out, the big race prizes and the big trainers.  The entire edifice is built on a foundation that is much more grounded.  I do not use that term in any pejorative way in respect of the excellence we achieve and the people who achieve it for us.  Small breeders who might own a couple of mares are also important.  In my engagement with HRI in recent years I have made a request for it to put more money into point-to-point racing outside the rails, and it has.  That is important because that sector was feeling the financial challenges of continuing to run what I regard as important events, as well as the capital investment programme HRI has had.  I have not visited Senator Daly's operation in Kilbeggan yet, but that investment has delivered specific projects at Mallow, Listowel and Killarney that have been beneficial to the enjoyment of the punter very often as much as the infrastructure for horses and jockeys and facilities, all of which needs an upgrade.  It is important to maintain that ongoing investment.</p><p> I appreciate the Senator's point about budget 2020.  It was framed in a particular context.  We can look back and say with the benefit of with hindsight it could have been done differently.  However, we were faced with the very live possibility of a no-deal Brexit.  It was broadly introduced on the basis of no change, which is effectively what has happened with HRI and Bord na gCon funding where there is no change year on year.  In a different environment whoever might be doing this job or the budget this time next year, that can be looked at.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019112600002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for accommodating this meeting.  I know the committee has had a long day.  This is essentially a token Supplementary Estimate to create a new subhead, F12 just transition, under which the &euro;6 million allocated in the budget for the just transition fund will be paid.  The early establishment of the subhead will facilitate expenditure from the just transition fund to commence in early 2020.</p> <p>  Everyone knows the background to this, which is the recognition that just transition is a core part of the climate action plan.  This has been brought into very sharp relief by the much-accelerated rundown of peat in electricity generation, which members know all about.  As a result and as part of the budget, the decision was made by the Minister for Finance that a substantial part of the moneys raised from the carbon pricing would be ring-fenced this year for just transition with a particular focus on the midlands.  Three immediate measures were contained in the budget, namely, the just transition fund, the provision of &euro;5 million extra to allow extra bog rehabilitation work to be done on non-Bord na M&oacute;na bogs and to provide &euro;20 million to run a special programme in the midlands which would seek to build out retrofitting on an aggregated scale on an area basis.  This is something we need to do anyhow to increase our capacity to deliver.  This is being developed.  At its core, there will be social houses in the region but the key to it will be to build wider participation than simply retrofitting social housing and to build momentum and aggregation and scaling up on a significant level, and doing this in the midlands where there is a particular need.</p> <p>  If the committee is interested I could go through some of the other work we are doing on just transition in the midlands but it is not directly associated with this because it has to do with repurposing the public service obligation, PSO, to allow additional bog restoration to a higher level on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs and other measures, such as the coal provisions under the EU treaties.  We are seeking a token Estimate here to allow us to spend from this fund and to underpin the work Kieran Mulvey is starting as the just transition commissioner.</p></speech>

We have had a number of discussions with the Department and the trade unions in regard to just transition.  What we are creating is this new subhead to allow for what the Minister called a token allocation of &euro;1,000, which is essentially to allow for the establishment in order that the expenditure in the budget can be spent.  Is that not an acknowledgement that we are only starting this process?  One of the questions I asked the Department was, given we all knew just transition was coming at us for some time, why is it only now that the funding has been put in place and why was it not done earlier.  Why were the preparations for some of the budget allocations, such as the &euro;20 million for retrofitting and the special programme in the midlands, only being put in place now and not much earlier?</p></speech>

When I took on this post, I was very conscious that high ambition had been set in the past and it had not delivered, so we needed a different foundation.  That foundation was provided initially by the Citizens' Assembly and then by the work of the Oireachtas, in which I know the Chairman was intimately involved, as were many of the members of the committee.  On the basis of that foundation, we have developed the plan, which involves, as the Deputy knows, a range of measures right across every sector and it includes just transition.  In the immediate opportunity after the publication of the climate action plan, we see that just transition is embodied in the very first budget.</p> <p>  It is also significant that the commitment was made that in regard to carbon pricing, which is recognised by most parties as an inevitable part of making this transition, every cent of that is going to be ploughed back into helping communities to adapt.  A big part of that adaptation is around just transition for people who are particularly exposed, such as Bord na M&oacute;na workers, or particularly ill-equipped, such as poorer households.</p> <p>  That is not to say there have not been programmes of just transition in the past.  I know, from my own experience in the Department of Education and Skills, that every time there was a challenge, and there had been challenges in the past in Bord na M&oacute;na, there would have been a step-up by the education and training boards, the various education bodies and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but they had been running on conventional tracks.  What we are doing here is elevating this to a much higher level, recognising the scale of change that we have to deliver. </p></speech>

I want to follow up with a number of questions.  I will set out the problem.  Patricia King, the president of ICTU, was before the Joint Committee on Climate Action last week and we had trade union officials before the joint committee earlier today.  Essentially, they have stated that the infrastructure is woefully inadequate, that the just transition has not got off to a good start and two plants have closed prematurely, and that many of the solutions which the Minister says he is putting in place are not yet in place.</p> <p>  I want to raise two specific issues which are important in terms of the Minister's approach to this issue.  One of the questions the trade unions asked us to ask the Minister, as it was not clear from the departmental response, was why the just transition commissioner was not given responsibility or powers in respect of industrial relations.  That seems to be a sore point for the trade unions.  Second, in regard to one of the main solutions the Minister talked about, the special programme of &euro;20 million for the midlands, that is &euro;20 million for retrofit.  However, we do not know yet how that is going to work, how many homes will be retrofitted, what type of homes they will be, what will be the average cost per home or whether there will be a guarantee that people who are employed in any of these plants will get the jobs at the end of it.  These are questions we are being asked and we do not have the answers to them.  We put those questions to the Department officials both at the Committee of Public Accounts and at the joint committee but they do not have the responses because they are saying it is in the early stages and it is being worked on, which is part of the problem.  Does the Minister have those responses?</p> <p>  To  recap, why was the just transition commissioner not given any responsibility in regard to industrial relations, given the unions are quite upset about that?  Incidentally, they are also very upset with Bord na M&oacute;na, which they say is not engaging and is playing for time.  They have a fear that the strategy is to de-unionise that organisation.  In terms of the &euro;20 million for the retrofit programme, how is that going to work, how many homes will be retrofitted, what will be the average cost of a retrofit and will there be a guarantee that whoever gets the contract to do that will employ people who need to be employed, from these plants or elsewhere, as part of what is being described as a just transition?  There are a lot of questions so I will allow the Minister to come back in. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC12019112600002#B00500"><p>First, the Deputy should not have the impression that there was no anticipation.  For example, on the regional enterprise strategy, in my previous role I set up the concept of having regional enterprise plans and, at the heart of that, was the just transition.  That was in place long before this particular problem.  The regional skills forums are also established and they recognise this is a key challenge.  When I went to the area recently, I met both those who are driving the regional enterprise strategy and the regional skills strategy to make sure they would be capable of providing, for example, the upskilling that is needed for people to switch, if they are going to switch from work on the bogs to work in retrofitting.  Skills programmes will be put in place to ensure people can make that transition.</p> <p>  The Deputy asks why everything is not in place.  This decision was not expected.  The expectation had been that co-firing would continue but we have moved very swiftly to ensure there is money available and that we have a programme which is relevant and which requires a skill set or similar.  We have also received permission, which is at its final stages, to repurpose the PSO in order that many of the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na will be able to continue working on restoring bogs to a much higher level than would have occurred had Bord na M&oacute;na simply fulfilled its licence obligations.  It is part of a strategy to make sure that the asset of the bogs is fully exploited in terms of its capacity to absorb carbon.  A higher level of restoration is necessary to do that and we will be able to deliver that.</p> <p>  The reason responsibility for industrial relations has not been given to the just transition commissioner is that we have established models for dealing with industrial relations through joint industrial councils and referrals to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and to the Labour Court.  Those are tried and trusted methods.  The head of the WRC, Liam Kelly, is someone with immense experience.  We have those resources.  I know that because Kieran Mulvey had been in the WRC, some people would say that, naturally, he should be doing industrial relations.  However, the truth is he is retired from that and there is a new executive and a new WRC in place.  It would be not be right to seek to have a just transition commissioner, who is trying to deal with the new elements of this, usurping the role of a long-established body such as the WRC or the Labour Court, as appropriate.  That is why there is that approach.</p> <p>  The terms of reference are there.  I have met the unions and I have met the company.  I know there are difficulties and the company, the workers and the unions will have to work through those difficulties.  I also met Patricia King and I understand the frustrations and the concerns.  It is fair to say that having a just transition commissioner is something that is generally welcomed; the unions were pleased that I moved swiftly on that.  I believe they recognise this is a good step forward.  Of course, there are difficulties.  I am the first to recognise that many people felt they had a long transition of seven or eight years on which they could bank but that has now been disrupted and we are trying to manage it as best we can.</p></speech>

This is not solely about grant aid to local authorities to retrofit social housing.  It is expected that approximately 1,000 houses will be retrofitted but this is only the spine of what we are doing.  In conjunction with this, we are doubling the warmer homes budget to ensure that not only social housing but a mix of housing is upgraded, although not all of the latter will receive 100% State support to deliver the change.  We are working on an area basis to aggregate the contracting out of the work and the guarantee of the quality of the work and, hopefully, to make access to funds easier.</p></speech>

Some of the applicants might be social housing residents through local authorities but others will be people who will have to pay a level of capital upfront.  We need to monitor this area to ensure that the majority of applicants are not in the latter cohort because it, I imagine, will be people who will have the deepest pockets and benefit most from having their homes retrofitted.</p></speech>

There is no roll-over.  The &euro;20 million is allocated through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as opposed to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The Deputy will be aware that another element of the just transition is the doubling of the warmer homes allocation for poorer families.  That is a separate element.  The &euro;20 million, &euro;5 million and &euro;6 million are all net new money.</p></speech>

It is not the only area in which the SEAI is expanding in that we are also expanding the warmer homes scheme.  It is a challenge to design a new programme.  I recognise that and I have asked the Secretary General of my Department to chair the group that is seeking to design a model that will scale up delivery.  We have been working on the basis of largely individual applications for the warmer homes and better energy home schemes.  The better energy communities scheme has involved some aggregated work.  We have to move to a much more aggregated model if we are to hit the targets.  We need to design that model.  We are meeting the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, key local authorities and across the sectors of people we believe might assist, including the European Investment Bank, to design a model that will be robust, can be scaled up and will give people more confidence to take on the work that increasingly, people recognise they should be doing on their homes.  There is upfront cost and the savings accrue slowly and many people find it hard to get access to upfront capital so we need to design a model that is easy for them to lock into.</p></speech>

It has an established track record and an established administration.  It also has experience in dealing in innovative ways and providing guidance to not only Government but all of the partners on how to be innovative and respond to change.  I saw the NESC as a natural choice to do the type of work that we wanted done here.  It will carry out the review and make recommendations on the models we should have over the next decade.  It will be offering a significant policy guidance.  What we have in the just transition commissioner is a more immediate on-the-ground response in terms of meeting individual bodies, designing the models that can make a difference in the midlands, working with local authorities and community groups through the regional enterprise strategy on how we can mobilise the resources, both Government and wider funding in terms of the Project 2040 funds of &euro;4 billion.

The officials made clear that the backup secretariat for the new commissioner will be in the Department.  I expressed a fear that given the Department's massive challenges in so many areas, including broadcasting, communications, energy and climate change in its own right, even if it is a stopgap measure while the NESC report is awaited, the Department does not really have the necessary resources for the broad suite of work that will have to be done to get the just transition in the midlands right.

There is no doubt this is a challenge.  Developing a climate plan and working bilaterally with several Departments trying to get agreement throughout the public sector has put a big strain on the resources of the Department.  As the Deputy rightly demands, we are working on a climate Bill, which we hope to publish soon.  It is a challenge but I must say that people have stepped up to it.  There is a great sense of commitment in this area.  We will have to see more resources progressively allocated to the Department to conduct its responsibilities.  We have an additional &euro;2 million for new staff in the budget allocation for 2020.  I expect we will continually need additional capacity to do this.  We have a great team whose members are very committed and are delivering.</p></speech>

The plan for the midlands must be integrated.  It must look at a range of connected issues, including the ramping up of training, educational and skills development and the involvement of other landowners and other scientific and environmental actors.  As was said at our earlier hearing, this is our first go at this.  If, in the broadest sense, we do not get the partnership approach right with regard to bringing in all stakeholders, we will start on the wrong foot and it will become more difficult each time we come to a transition area where we need to get public, worker or stakeholder support.  Why would the Government not support the use of the Workplace Relations Commission in the absence of our Bill, which would provide such a mediation-type service?  How does the Minister intend to respond to the call from Patricia King for the use of the Workplace Relations Commission in this regard?</p></speech>

If they are not resolved they go to the Workplace Relations Commission, which is the experienced body in industrial relations.  The reality is that just transition goes much beyond industrial relations issues.  For example, we need to see quality education programmes, which would be delivered by institutes of technology and education and training boards.  We need to see the development of enterprise hubs, which fall to be delivered through bodies such as Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices.  We bring the various challenges to those who have the experience.  I do not think it would be appropriate to ask bodies with experience in industrial relations to become experts suddenly on how to develop an integrated plan on bog restoration, retrofitting, enterprise hubs, retraining and dealing with communities that have been disrupted.  This is a much broader agenda.  What we are doing is falling back on NESC, which is tried and tested in looking at where big social transitions have had to occur in the past.  It has that expert experience.  We are also putting in place someone who is recognised as having the capacity to help us design a model that is tailor made to the needs of the midlands.  We will use the resources of the State to support the type of recommendation that will come forward.  The response we have is the most appropriate one.  It uses people who have established skills in the areas where they are most likely to deliver results.</p></speech>

The joint industrial relations mechanisms may suffice for some of the particular industrial relations issues but, as the Minister says, it is much bigger and broader than this.  What we heard today from the union officials is they believe the Workplace Relations Commission is very keen and happy to take on such a role to act as an immediate facilitation point to bring in wider stakeholders.</p><p>I do not see what we have to lose from using that avenue to do what we have historically done in difficult circumstances like this, use a partnership approach. </p></speech>

That is what it has done.  It has advisory and mediation services.  Where there are unresolved issues, parties can go to the Labour Court for adjudication, where people agree.  We have a well-established industrial relations process.  That will be triggered by the parties as issues evolve.  The Deputy seems to be suggesting that the Workplace Relations Commission would become a very large tent for all sorts of governmental policy along the lines of his own Bill but that is not what the Workplace Relations Commission was designed to do.  Industrial disputes are referred to it every day of the week and it deals with those.  It has an expertise and will no doubt become involved in Bord na M&oacute;na on issues of difficulty as those issues are escalated through the industrial relations mechanism.  They are not a body such as the commission the Deputy proposed in his Bill with the sort of powers he envisaged for it, which he is examining.</p></speech>

I worked in a number of Departments, including over 15 years in the Department responsible for the energy sector.  My last role working in government was as Secretary General in the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  In that role, I oversaw the establishment of EirGrid and the creation of the all-island single energy market. <br/><br/>Since completing my role as Secretary General, I have been an independent non-executive director of a number of commercial companies.  I have also been involved in a number of non-profit bodies, including chairman of the National Longitudinal Study of Ageing, TILDA, and the Science Foundation Ireland MaREI Centre, which is responsible for marine, climate action and energy transition. <br/><br/>My appointment as chairman designate of EirGrid comes at a critical time for the group.  Last September, EirGrid unveiled its response to the Government's climate action plan with the launch of a new five-year strategy that will see it invest &euro;2 billion in helping to decarbonise Ireland's electricity system.  The strategy is a clear demonstration of the fact that EirGrid has a major role to play in making the climate action plan happen.<br/><br/>EirGrid is preparing the electricity system for a future based almost entirely on renewable energy.  The climate action plan states that 70% of electricity will be generated from renewable sources by 2030, mainly onshore and offshore wind energy plus solar power.  EirGrid currently operates the grid with approximately one third of generation coming from renewable sources.  This target will require EirGrid to break new ground in how it manages the electricity system. <b></b>In real terms, EirGrid will need to connect up to 10,000 MW of additional renewable generation to the electricity system.  To put that in perspective, the all-island demand for electricity this day last week peaked at just over 6,000 MW.<br/><br/>Integrating renewable energy on to an electricity system is technically challenging.  This is because renewable energy is intermittent, which causes challenges for maintaining the frequency of the electricity system, something that is absolutely critical for the system.  This will require EirGrid to operate the system in a more dynamic and responsive way.  In turn, this will require improvements to infrastructure to make the grid stronger and more flexible.  In tandem with these developments, much of heating and transport will switch from carbon-based fuels to electricity, which will increase demand for power.  We have also anticipated growth in demand due to the expansion of some key industries such as data centres which, of course, support not only the significant ICT sector in Ireland but most businesses as well as companies as they move their data storage to the cloud. <br/><br/>EirGrid forecasts that the demand for electricity in Ireland will increase by between 23% and 47% over the next ten years.  The expectation is that the electricity system will carry more power and that most of it will be generated from renewable sources.  This is a once-in-a-generation change that cannot happen unless the power system is transformed.  It is a daunting challenge but I am encouraged by the fact that there is growing support across the country for this transformation.<br/><br/>The report from the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly last year was striking.  The members voted by 80% or more in favour of the 13 recommendations on climate change put to them.  These included proposals to ensure climate change is at the centre of policy making through new governance architecture, as well as the potentially contentious questions of increasing carbon tax and taxing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. <br/><br/>Last week, we had our first ever Youth Assembly on Climate Change here in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and the assembly's ten recommendations are laudable.</p><p>We discussed the recommendations at our board meeting last week and in the new year we hope to outline some ideas on how we will respond to them.</p><p> I am also very encouraged by the growing consensus here in the Oireachtas.  This was demonstrated in March with the publication of the committee's groundbreaking report on climate change.  It is fair to say it is the envy of many countries that we have such a consensus across the Oireachtas.  It demonstrated that not only are members listening to our citizens but this committee is providing cross-party leadership in addressing what is one of the most significant challenges of our generation.  The Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, which is based on the committee's report, is again a very challenging plan.  I am confident that EirGrid can successfully meet its commitments in the plan but it cannot do so on its own.  There is a range of stakeholders whose support will underpin its success.  These include neighbouring transmission system operators with which it either has or will have interconnectors, as well as customers that generate or use large amounts of power.  The company needs partners to deal with the major changes caused by the switch to electric vehicles and electric heating in the home.  Perhaps most important, EirGrid also recognises that development of new grid infrastructure requires partnership with landowners and communities.  EirGrid alone cannot deliver the necessary infrastructure.  We can only do it working effectively with communities across the country.</p><p> Although advances in technology are increasingly helping us to find less intrusive ways to move large amounts of power, all electricity grids in any country, depend on a backbone of large-scale infrastructure.  This means we will continue to rely on pylons, substations and overhead wires.  Asking landowners and local communities to accept new infrastructure has never been an easy task.  EirGrid never takes these decisions lightly or without first investigating all alternative solutions but where new infrastructure is essential, we will work with the people and communities affected to endeavour to provide the necessary infrastructure to deliver our collective aspirations.  We hope to work with people and communities so that we all not only commit to the vision outlined in the climate action plan but we get a consensus on how this is to be delivered on the ground.</p><p> I ask the Members of the Oireachtas to support the critical work EirGrid will carry out over the coming years in addressing the significant energy transition that is required for the future.  For EirGrid, the next five years are critical.  If it is successful, we will have taken a significant step towards delivering on our long-term climate change goals.  We can only do it with the support of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

One of the challenges is the building out of the grid system and the large potential for offshore energy from wind, particularly off the west coast.  What is the timeline for that?  I know there is a focus on the east coast but what is EirGrid's vision in rolling out connectivity from the west and tapping into that fantastic resource of offshore wind potential there?</p></speech>

We and the Government have committed to a number of approximately 3.2 GW minimum over the next number of years as we look to the next ten years.  My feeling is that it will be more.  We are not going to meet the targets for 2030 unless we embrace offshore energy.  The power is still needed most around the east coast and Dublin and the challenges there are not as bad as they are off the west coast.  I am talking specifically about depth and the geology of the area.  The Chairman knows I also chair MaREI, and we have been working on the marine renewable side for a number of years.  The offshore energy production on the west coast will be much more challenging.  Tidal and wave is in the second phase and offshore floating wind energy production is likely to start on the east coast and come around.</p> <p>  We can take this up a level from Ireland and look across Europe.  In the future we may be able to connect grids across Europe and although I do not want to jump ahead, we are starting this with our interconnector of approximately 700 MW to France.  Over the next number of years we really would be looking at the idea of a grid to which we could connect.  In other words, we would not have to bring everything back to the country and we would be part of the European grid.</p></speech>

I have already flagged a second challenge somewhat.  Many of the new renewables will be offshore and bringing them to land is one thing, while getting them to where is energy demand is another.  We would have to traverse different communities, and that is why I put such a strong emphasis on the importance of infrastructure.  It is challenging for communities when they see infrastructure passing over them to somewhere else and it is very important to address the issues of the more peripheral and rural areas in the country.  They have to benefit as well from this.</p></speech>

He set out a good understanding of the challenges facing EirGrid and he is familiar with the fact that parts of the grid are creaking, particularly in a large urban area like Dublin.  He is aware that electricity is generated from gas on mobile generators in certain parts of the city in order to meet the demand of the growing population bases.  There are a few challenges ahead.  Perhaps he will relay a few thoughts on how this can be addressed.</p> <p>  Following the Chairman's point about the potential for wind energy collected at sea, when it is brought ashore it poses a significant challenge to get it to a point of usage.  Mr. Tuohy spoke about the immediate potential in shallower waters in the Irish Sea and there is quite a level of advancement there.  When we bring it ashore and especially when it is done over the ground with pylons, particular concern might be expressed.  The same applies on the west coast and how energy might be traversed across the country.  Does Mr. Tuohy have any views on underground versus overground?  We have had some of this debate at the committee before.</p> <p>  Mr. Tuohy correctly emphasised the engagement with community and the necessity community buy-in.  Over time communities have demonstrated a resilience if accepting something is necessary for the community but when they are part of a transit point, they have not demonstrated the same resilience in accepting what they might consider visual disruption in their community.  We speak about protecting the environment, which is very important, and that is why there is such a significant projected growth in the generation of electricity.  It will be needed to protect the environment by moving away from fossil fuel use in society.  How would Mr. Tuohy speak to the people concerned about the visual amenity of their environment with the potential for a greater number of pylons?  The same challenge is there with wind farms as with pylons.  Does Mr. Tuohy have any thoughts on how EirGrid might be able to lead in a different strategic direction in that respect?</p></speech>

I use "we" to refer to Ireland.  I will distinguish between them.  As a country we have grown and part of the challenge is to keep up the infrastructure.  Over the years one of our great selling points internationally was that we never lost a project because of a failure to deliver electricity.  It was a real selling point when in India and other places projects were lost because they could not deliver a secure and reliable system.  Gas power is approximately 50% of our generation network.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, it will be of that order.  It is simply the way that one needs stability on the network.  As I stated earlier, the renewables come in but one can never guarantee them.  They are so-called "non-dispatchable".  As for the meaning of "dispatchable", a gas or coal generator will turn on immediately whereas, if I am waiting for the wind, no matter how predictable it is,-----</p></speech>

That does not seem like a good overall plan.  It is something that needs to be addressed in the future.</p></speech>

As one must, we are responding.  The time lag from agreeing on infrastructure to delivering it can be quite horrendous for various reasons, including the judicial process and the planning process.  The demand is growing fairly quickly.  We can see the demand there.  What Deputy Dooley is talking about is a short-term solution.  Obviously, it is not the long-term solution.</p> <p>  More generally, technology is having a big impact.  One will see, although not today, on the system part of what we are trying to do.  One will see the impact that technology has and see the demand-side management as well.  Then one will see the challenges we must face, even for some of the new data centres or extensions to existing data centres where they will move from a so-called "firm connection" to a much weaker connection so that they will not be guaranteed the power at a certain time and will have to make their own arrangements.</p> <p>  The gas generator the Deputy talks about is not an ideal situation.  We want the grid to provide in the normal way but then we also, as I started out by saying, want to transfer up to 70% of that to renewables.  That will be challenging.</p></speech>

In summary, it stated that the overhead lines were still the most suitable approach.  I am not an expert in this area but I read the report; it was the top experts who said that.  On the underground versus overground, that is the latest one.  More generally, on the underground versus overground issue, overground is easier.  First, it is cheaper.  Second, it is easier to maintain.  Third, when one goes underground, if one has faults, one must dig them up, etc.  The advice from the experts refers not only to cost.  It is very much about its operation.  All we can do on this is bring in the best experts and see what they say.</p> <p>  Community engagement is a big element to which I am committed.  I have been involved in the Dingle Peninsula project for the past two years where we have tried to imagine what the Dingle Peninsula would look like in the future.  We have been working closely with ESB Networks, with the local community and with the local development agency, North, East and West Kerry Development, NEWKD.  What is interesting is the importance of community engagement.  For instance, ESB Networks is involved with five ambassadors, including individual houses.  Also, we have a project just starting with six ambassador farms to look at what farming needs to do to change - that is 35% of the problem.  On that, the idea of involving and engaging the community is not about visiting and telling them what we will do.  It is about visiting, listening and engaging.  There are 20 batteries installed in Ballyferriter.  With that, three have solar PV and others are purchasing their own solar PV.  What is happening there is changing the way we deal with energy.  When we talk about activating the energy citizen, people are basically smart if one gives them the opportunity.  On community engagement, I suppose my message is that we all must engage in a much more collective way.  I deal with some of the academics in Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, MaREI, and they would totally support the assertion that it is about community engagement.  I am an engineer by background.  Engineers have certain solutions but these are not always the best solutions.</p> <p>  On the visual amenity issue, when one is putting in any type of infrastructure there is a visual impact but we have the planning process to deal with these issues.  The original design of the national system with which the Deputy will be familiar was, out of Moneypoint, two big 400 kV lines coming up through the country serving north and south of Dublin, and then the ring around it.  These are the backbone of the network.  Now we are seeing the changes happening.  For example, Moneypoint will close, we are told, by 2025.  We saw the changes in the midlands recently as well.  This is really happening.  The challenge we have is whether we do something to the network.  However, we will still need poles and some sort of infrastructure but that must be done in as neat a way as possible with community engagement.</p> <p>  Finally, on providing people with an incentive, the Deputy talked about the transition.  I have an empathy with communities where the infrastructure is passing through to service something else.  That is different from where people embrace it and use it themselves.  Collectively, we must look at how we can make sure that we can support these communities so that they benefit from it, not in a one-off but in a long-term way.  In my experience, most communities want to be living communities.  They want people to come and live there.  I spoke of the Dingle Peninsula.  In 1840, there were 40,000 people on the Dingle Peninsula.  In 1850, there were 30,000 people.  Ten years ago, there were 16,000.  Today, there are 12,500.  It may be a bit more stark, but that is a reflection of the movement from the rural to the urban areas.  We will not stop that but what we need, what parents tell me they want for their children, and what the young people say, is that children will at least have the ability to come back and live there if they so choose.  They know all the children will not come back and live there, but they want the choice.</p></speech>

I wish him well.</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Tuohy referenced the climate action plan and the target of 70% of electricity being generated from renewables by 2030.  My first question is, will we reach that target by 2030?</p></speech>

To put the conditions on it, we must go offshore and we must be successful in the offshore.  I noted last week the publication of the new structure for marine offshore planning that will be critical for this to happen.  Certain targets were put in the climate action plan and so far they seem to have been met.  I refer to the delivery by the system of the various documents, regulations, etc.  However, we will not do it if we do not meet the offshore targets.</p></speech>

The one thing one does not want when doing this is for the system to collapse.  Nobody wants that.</p> <p>  We are out on what is called the system non-synchronous penetration rate in Ireland.  We are world leaders at 65%.  That is the instantaneous amount of non-synchronous, non-traditional wind, etc., on the system.  We are up, with Australia, at No. 1 on that.  There is no question that we will move that but one must distinguish between the instantaneous and the long term.  When one is building out a system like this one will have renewables on top of it but at present I cannot see a situation where one will have all renewables because one will not have the level of certainty in the system.</p></speech>

That was my question.  Mr. Tuohy is confident that we will reach the 70% target comfortably.

By 2050, we are talking about decarbonising the networks.  Then what one is talking about doing, as one puts on gas or one moves towards an unfossilled gas, in the sense that it could be other generation type; one could even have hydrogen or one could have a mixture of things such as carbon capture sequestration where even though one is producing fossil fuels one is treating them again.</p><p>The aspiration must be to have a decarbonised network by 2050.  That is what Britain and others have announced.  To get to the first stage of that, our challenges will be in the mid-2020s, as we see some of the traditional coal and other plants coming off stream and making sure that the new systems are in place to deal with that.  That is challenging.</p></speech>

We talked about the targets.  It is not as simple as that because there are other issues.  For example, we also want more electric cars on the road.  We want to decarbonise public transport and have electric buses and trains.  We also want people to retrofit their homes, which would mean more electric fuel pumps.  That would mean more people would be dependent on the grid.  What has been factored in, in terms of targets that are also being set for electric cars, fewer people heating their homes with oil and gas and more from electric, and public transport switching from carbon also?  What demand will that have on the grid and is it factored into EirGrid's view in terms of us not just reaching our targets but being in a position to exceed them?</p></speech>

It provides a ten-year look ahead.  This is a really good document and the people who have done it have put a lot of effort into it.  They are at the forefront of it.</p> <p>  To go back to the issues Deputy Cullinane raises, at the moment, if one takes the bigger issue of emissions, agriculture is at 33% to 34%, transport is about 22% and electricity is about 20%.  We are seeing a move towards heat pumps and the like and there will be a movement towards electric vehicles.  The numbers from the Government are factored into the documents, for obvious reasons.  That is the way it should be.  We will probably move up to 30% at that stage, but 70% of the 30% then will be renewables in terms of overall energy, which would mean we would be up at around 20%.  Any way one looks at them, these are really challenging targets.  That does not mean we should not have them.  I agree that we should have them, but the only way we will deliver on this is that as we move to electrification we must have, first, the infrastructure that I talked about.  The second thing is we need to have a public that understands what heat pumps are, what solar photovoltaics, PVs, are, and for that we need a big educational initiative, which the committee recommended.  I would not underestimate the importance of that because this is difficult stuff.  We are asking people to switch their cars and to put in heat pumps and other such infrastructure.  We can provide some grants but this is expensive for families and the just transition issue becomes really important in that regard.  What we do not want is that it is an elitist thing that one has solar PV.  I will build on the experience I have seen in Dingle.  I can see the interest from the local community and among all the different groupings such as schoolchildren and farmers.  They all want to change.</p></speech>

I hope he will not mind me reminding him that on my first day in office he handed me a box set of "Yes Minister" and recommended I watch it, which was very good advice.  I feel like giving him a box set of "The Sopranos" or "Game of Thrones".  I am not too sure which, because he is going into a critical and important job.</p> <p>  Almost ten years ago we started thinking about the French interconnector and it has taken ten years to get the contract.  I am really pleased it is going ahead.  I guess it will be another five years before it is built.  I will return to the question raised by the Chairman and by Deputy Dooley.  I think we need to start working now on our method of being part of the bigger, wider European grid network to ship power from the west of Ireland, not just within the country but to the rest of Europe.  That will require EirGrid to commission, build and own several new interconnectors with our nearest neighbours.  Does EirGrid have the resources to be able to take on that project now so that we are ready in ten, 12 or 15 years' time to turn it into reality, having developed the Irish Sea and learned from that experience?</p></speech>

On the wider grid, I have been hugely impressed by the calibre of people I have met in recent weeks since I came into EirGrid.  It is a very specific skill set or series of skill sets.  We have only one company of its type in the country and it has an all-island remit.  We have EirGrid and we have SONI in Northern Ireland, and we have the Single Market, with which Deputy Ryan is very familiar.  The skills base there is really interesting.  To be honest, such skills are very hard to get.  The other side of that is there is a tangible commitment to delivering the type of targets we are talking about.  The CEO, Mark Foley, who has been in before the committee, has presented to the staff and the board has fully bought into it.  There are certain skills we will need.  One never has them all in-house.  The Minister recently asked us to look at the future security of supply and other such issues.  A letter was sent to all the chairs of the ESB, ourselves, Ervia and others.  We are responding.  The Minister has commissioned a review.  On the wider grid issue, I will go back to the statement I made earlier, there is no way that we can stop at just the 3.5 GW that we are talking about, which is in the current plan.  I think the opportunities on the offshore are huge but it can only be done in conjunction with Europe.  In fairness, we have got fantastic support from Europe on the interconnector from France.  We recently got more than 50% support from Brussels of &euro;530 million to be signed off next week.  There are two issues at play: one is that we are connecting into Europe and if Brexit does happen it gives us direct access, but on the other side, Europe realises that the wind off the west coast of Ireland in particular is part of its resource as well.  The land mass of Ireland is 80,000 sq. km, but the Irish water that we own is about 840,000 sq. km.  That makes us the third largest country in Europe, if one looks at it that way.  In that sense, we have a fantastic opportunity in the long term but we must bring our colleagues in Brussels with us on this.</p></speech>

I worked in this area when I was not a Deputy and I know that Brussels is ready and waiting to do further funding, and it is our big project to add to a European climate response.  We have to work on the UK Government on it as well because it is critical.  We must work east-west as much as North-South.  When does Mr. Tuohy expect the North-South interconnector to proceed?  What is his assessment of the legal or other difficulties in Northern Ireland that are holding us back?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.174" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Tuohy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#E01000"><p>I was in Northern Ireland last week and I had a board meeting in Belfast with SONI.  A public consultation has concluded.  There was one objection and 11 comments and submissions, some from local authorities are very positive.  SONI must now decide whether to make a decision on that before 17 January when the broader decision has to be made about the future of the North in the sense of whether the power is taken back or if there is an election.  The feeling is that it is going very positively but when one is in a process like that, all one can do is hope for the best and respond to the things that should be done.  We are waiting for that to happen.  The backstop would be January.  The Secretary of State gave the power in order that the officials in the North could make decisions.  Previously, there was a planning permission issue and the application was withdrawn simply because of another court case.  We are very positive about the impact of the interconnector.  It connects the two networks, North and South, so that we would have a seamless North-South interconnector.  It is a 400 kV line.  It has a power capability of 1,500 MW, which is significant.  The benefit of having a single electricity market is the stability I talked about.  Everyone does not have to carry extra capacity.  We can do that on a national basis.  As we discovered, what interconnectors do is allow the electricity to flow depending on the prices, so that one gets reductions in prices.  We have seen that and the regulator has seen that.</p></speech>

My presumption is that EirGrid would own the interconnector and I presume it would own a half share with the French transmission operator of the interconnector with France.</p><p>Given those circumstances, where EirGrid's asset base is increasing, including ownership of the existing east-west interconnector, does Mr. Tuohy think it is time for the Government to again consider whether EirGrid should own all of the transmission assets, rather than the ESB, thus giving EirGrid greater flexibility, control and financing capability to expand the network? </p></speech>

By not owning the assets, the regulator or anybody cannot say that we are trying to enrich ourselves by doing whatever investments we are doing.  It is a complex system.  There is an infrastructural agreement.  Originally, when EirGrid was set up the asset ownership stayed with the ESB as a company.  EirGrid oversees the maintenance and specifies it but ESB Networks does a lot of the work.  The system is quite complex, as the Deputy has said.  From EirGrid's point of view, we own the east-west interconnector.  When one takes on board all of the borrowings and everything it is about &euro;400 million.  For the Celtic interconnector we have a 65% to a 35% arrangement and, again, that is going to be about &euro;1 billion and then one takes out about &euro;530 million so we are getting a very good deal.</p> <p>  As members will see when EirGrid's accounts are published, it is challenging when one has a very small asset base.  As for a lot of what EirGrid does, it is a regulated utility so we cannot pick a price and decide to charge it because everything is governed by the regulator.  Should a discussion take place?  A discussion should always take place on these issues in the sense that one must keep them under review.  Is it critical at the moment?  Are we in a position that we need more money?  I am only in my post a week and I have not done that analysis.  Will I keep an eye on the matter?  Absolutely.   </p></speech>

We have had investments in wind energy but data centres will still rely on the national grid that predominantly relies on fossil fuels.  Has EirGrid examined the risks posed by data centres in the context of the cost, the decarbonisation process and where the cost should fall?</p></speech>

A lot of work has been done on this matter.  The Government issued a statement last year and IDA Ireland has done a lot of work.  Let me put this in context.  While the energy requirements of data centres are dramatic, I note that as a country, we have a phenomenal ICT sector comprised of 130,000 people and exports worth &euro;65 billion per year, which makes it a huge sector.  What now happens when one puts data centres in, and I agree with the IDA on this, is that they bring a stickiness to the market so that the companies invest significant amounts of money here.  To date, &euro;7 billion or &euro;8 billion has gone into the data centres, which then spurs on other things.  Many of the data centres will in time become computational centres.  In other words, the running of algorithms and stuff like that will take place in the centres.  Will that be more energy intensive?  Yes.</p> <p>  There is another side to this issue.  Recently a significant company did a corporate purchase power agreement, which meant it was not relying on the grid, the network or the public service obligation, PSO.  In fairness, many of the data centre companies care about the environment, ask for the centres to be powered by green energy and many of the companies are prepared to put their hand in their own pocket to pay for such energy.  As I said before the Deputy arrived, using our median predictions for the future we predict that about 29% of energy usage by 2028 could be due to data centres, so by far and away the single biggest user.  One must then ask oneself the following.  If one takes that in the broader context of not just the ICT sector but everybody moving to the cloud, we must position ourselves, as a country, in that space.  </p></speech>

We have a very close relationship in the sense that these people come in and talk to us.  I said the following earlier but I am not sure that the Deputy was present.  For some of the new ones, and we will have a different arrangement with them in that they will not be guaranteed the type of power that they are guaranteed at the moment, if they decide to expand, which we want to see, there will be a different contractual arrangement with them.</p> <p>  The challenge we have is that most of these centres are around the M50 in Dublin.  The new Celtic interconnector is coming into Cork and will be accompanied by a fibre cable of 24 or 48 fibre pairs.  From day one, Deputy Eamon Ryan was very involved in specifying that this innovation should accompany the Celtic interconnector and EirGrid wants to build on the opportunity it presents.  For me, the ideal situation would be to see a greater regional distribution of data centres so one does not put all of the pressure on Dublin.  I believe one will see a lot of research happening over the next number of years on how best to handle data centres.  The positive side of data centres is that one has a static or flat prediction.  I mean one can predict when data centres will come on and how much energy they will use.  Their energy usage is not like normal daily domestic usage that fluctuates.  Can we handle it?  Yes.  Are we looking to the future?  We have been very open with what the numbers are into the future but for that, we will need to have an adequate infrastructure and generating capacity in place before that happens. </p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Cassells, has made me aware of procurement by a Turkish company despite the fact that planning permission has not been received in Northern Ireland, which I think Mr. Tuohy mentioned to Deputy Ryan.  Can Mr. Tuohy give a further update on the matter?  What discussions has EirGrid had on the requirement for planning permission for 35% access in three of the local authorities?  Has EirGrid improved its engagement with communities?  Local communities still have concerns.  What has EirGrid done to address their concerns?</p></speech>

As I explained earlier, ESB Networks has done a framework procurement but it has not purchased anything.  The Deputy knows how long public procurement takes.  So, one does a framework and then one draws down from the framework in time.  ESB Networks has not purchased anything but it has done the various frameworks, which is where we are at.  Nothing will happen until the relevant planning permission come through.</p></speech>

It has been a pleasure to listen to him.</p> <p>  I was going to ask about the interconnector but other members have already done so.  The Celtic interconnector is a major part of our infrastructure and the scheme will affect Ireland.  One wonders, particularly in my part of the world, where the interconnector will land but I shall not ask Mr. Tuohy about the location.</p> <p>  Mr. Tuohy spoke about going forward and how we will decarbonise the network from now until 2050.  I ask him to elaborate on the carbon capture proposals and on whether there are live proposals.  Has EirGrid a role to play, taking into consideration the Kinsale gas field?  I am from Kinsale and I note that the gas field will close in the middle of next year.  The platform has been taken down but the infrastructure has been kept.  Perhaps carbon capture could be considered for the depleted gas field in Kinsale.  Where does EirGrid fit into that model?  Is carbon capture part of EirGrid's remit?  </p></speech>

Therefore, I know exactly what the Senator is talking about.  The Kinsale gas field is more a matter for Ervia because we do not get involved in that side of things.</p> <p>   As I said earlier, as we move to decarbonisation and if one has gas, particularly fossil fuel gas but one can also have other biofuels and so on coming in, what will happen is that another sequence of things will happen.</p><p>That means it would be decarbonised.  I gather that discussions are taking place, but cannot give any details.  It is more about pumping the gas back out to Kinsale, where there are huge caverns and storage.  That was the idea behind the carbon sequestration.  The International Energy Agency is also doing some work on this and published a report over the summer on the future of hydrogen.  The Japanese and others are also moving in that direction.  Consequently, one is looking at other things such as electrolysis and so on.  When the wind is blowing at night and there is no draw on the electricity, hydrogen is being produced, which can be stored and used for something else, such as transport.  This is a huge space of which we certainly will be part.  Some of the issues the Senator raised are more under Ervia's remit.</p></speech>

I am one of the deputy commissioners at the Data Protection Commission, with responsibility for the consultation, supervision and guidance on policy functions of the office.  Also in attendance are Cathal Ryan, assistant commissioner, who has responsibility for supervision and engagement of technology multinationals, and Ultan O&rsquo;Carroll, assistant commissioner, who has responsibility for technology policy.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the Data Protection Commission, DPC, is the lead supervisory authority in the EU under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, for most of the world&rsquo;s largest technology, social media and Internet platform companies operating in the European market, given that their EU headquarters are based in this State.  This responsibility brings a central role for the DPC in overseeing the compliance of these companies&rsquo; services and products with EU data protection requirements.  The technology products and services of a number of these companies include digital or voice assistants.  Those are the terms commonly used to describe a consumer or in-home device that operates by listening for and interpreting human voice commands or instructions.  The more common examples are Google&rsquo;s Google Assistant, Apple&rsquo;s Siri, Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa and Microsoft&rsquo;s Cortana.  In recent months, a number of international media reports on human reviews of voice recordings collected by voice assistant products have brought into focus the question of how technology companies are using voice data gathered via voice assistant technology.  As the EU lead supervisory authority for a number of these companies, namely, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, the DPC is currently engaging with those organisations to establish the manner in which they are meeting their data protection requirements in this context.  The Luxembourg data protection authority acts as EU lead supervisory authority for Amazon Alexa. </p> <p>  Before turning to the data protection issues arising in the use of voice assistants, I will briefly describe how such devices function in practice, which is helpful for calling out the nexus with data protection requirements.  Voice assistants record user audio clips and convert those clips into a text form that acts as an input to online services such as search, weather, shopping, mapping and communications.  In some cases where the devices are home-based, the instructions may also be used to control smart home devices including those for lighting, TV and media, heating and security.  Devices listen continuously for instructions and may in some cases also be set up to recognise individual users' voices.  They listen for keywords such as &ldquo;Hey Google&rdquo; or &ldquo;Siri&rdquo;, which triggers recording of the user's voice.  Voice recordings can be stored alongside their converted text forms, either on the device or in the cloud.  Service providers may also record against a user&rsquo;s profile, preferences and choices that they derive from an analysis of the user&rsquo;s voice commands.  They may use that to serve back the information sought by a user or to add to their profile for the purposes of advertising.  Raw audio signals are converted into a recognisable human word.  Often, because of the variation in human voice, accent, tone or phrase, machine learning - in other words, artificial intelligence - is used with large volumes of sample voices to create a model of human speech.  Different models may be needed for different languages.  These models are updated over time to refine them and improve quality.  In some cases, quality control will require some human review of voice snippets, especially where words are being incorrectly recognised, where background noises are incorrectly identified as human speech or to help reduce misactivations of the device.  Human review of voice data collected and processed by automated means is a common method to review, improve and train the algorithms used in voice assistant technology.  While not inherently problematic or contentious from a data protection perspective, this kind of processing has many data protection elements, which must be carefully considered and assessed by the companies providing such services to ensure that the use of user data is legitimate and appropriately protected. </p> <p>  I will briefly mention some of the key elements arising in this context.  First is ensuring an appropriate lawful basis to process personal data.  Organisations need to identify a lawful basis under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, which will permit the processing of voice data in the manner proposed, such as consent or legitimate interest, which are the most commonly used legal bases.  Valid consent issues arise where it is not demonstrably active, informed, specific, freely given and withdrawable.  Likewise, a legitimate interests basis must clearly demonstrate that the legitimate interests of the company are not outweighed by the rights of users concerned.</p><p>The second element I would like to mention is the provision of adequate transparency to users where the type of processing taking place is concerned.  Information must be in an understandable format which allows individuals to make informed choices as to how their data are processed and which facilitates the exercise of their data protection rights.  With the potential for voice processing to be invisible, particularly further processing for purposes not readily obvious to users, transparency measures need to be in place when devices are being installed, when they are in use and where a user wants to review what processing their device has undertaken.</p><p> The third element is implementation of effective and integrated measures and safeguards to adhere to the principles of data protection.  This element of compliance requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to be put in place to confirm that only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are actually processed.  As I mentioned earlier, the human review of voice recordings is a common practice to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of algorithms designed to transcribe and translate voice data.  However user data must be adequately protected in this process, and indeed for all purposes for which voice recordings are used.  Such safeguards and protections can include designing the process of evaluation of audio snippets, by either contractors or employees of the company, with data protection in mind from the start; being clear on what volume and size of audio snippets are necessary for each processing purpose; identifying clear conditions where it is necessary to recognise the person whose voice is processed; clear and plain transparency and privacy notices; technical security safeguards such as pseudonymisation and anonymisation of data; organisational measures; and opt-in features.  There is a long list of safeguards which any company should take into account when processing such data. </p><p> The fourth and final element of compliance I wish to mention is the implementation of measures appropriate to the nature of the data being processed and the risks to users.  This is a very important element of compliance because sometimes digital assistants are activated incorrectly, with the risk that private or sensitive conversations in the home or workplace are inadvertently recorded.  While providers of voice assistant services have implemented preventative measures, organisations need to do more to reduce their incidence.  Implementing adequate safeguards can balance out or minimise the data protection risks arising in this way.</p><p> The DPC is continuing to examine these issues in our ongoing engagement with the companies for whom we are the EU lead supervisory authority.  We acknowledge and welcome the recent changes made by several companies to enhance transparency for users concerning the practice of human review of voice data to improve voice assistant technology, as well as the implementation of greater user choice on the use of data in such contexts.</p><p> As lead supervisory authority, the DPC also continues to co-operate with our EU data protection colleagues to identify common areas of concern and to identify what further steps, including guidance, may be necessary to bring additional clarity to the application of data protection requirements in the use of voice assistant technology.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here today.  My colleagues and I will be happy to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Benjamin Cowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chairman, members of the committee, parliamentarians and all who have been involved in convening this committee.  I feel honoured to be have been invited to give evidence.</p> <p>  I would like to give the committee an overview of the research I lead in digital assistants at UCD and at the ADAPT centre.  I lead research into the user experience and user behaviour with voice-based devices and technologies.  This includes looking at the barriers users see when interacting with these devices, as well as the opportunities to improve our experience with these devices.  Our recent focus in both UCD and the ADAPT centre is on the growing importance of user trust with these devices as well as other artificial intelligence technologies.  Colleagues such as Dr. Marguerite Barry also work specifically on the role of data ethics.  I would like to specifically thank Dr. Barry and her PhD student, Mr. Gianluigi Riva, who have contributed significantly to the evidence I am about to give.</p> <p>  I wish to put this into context.  It is hard to overestimate the prevalence and increasing reach of voice-based technologies.  Smart speakers have been a catalyst for huge growth in the popularity of voice as a way of interacting with our technology.  It is estimated that the number of smart speakers installed will grow to 207.9 million by the end of this year, with a lot of this growth taking place in China and the US.  Data estimates suggest that this will grow to 500 million units by the end of 2023.  For Ireland, just under 10% of households now own one of these devices and that figure is growing.  This is a major technology that is being placed in people's homes and a major way in which people interact with devices.  We also have these agents in our smartphones, so there is one in our pockets almost all the time.  The reach of this technology is huge.  Voice assistants are being used in cars, in healthcare contexts and in the home.</p> <p>Especially in the case of smart speakers, these devices are becoming social devices by default, placed in public spaces in the home with multiple people interacting with each device.  That includes friends, relatives, parents and children.  The devices gather data on people who live there, as well as people who visit.  They are the gateway to the Internet of things, whereby we use commands to control devices in our homes such as lights, alarms, doors and other devices.  This is the context within which these technologies are being used.</p> <p>  I will not outline how these devices work, as we have covered that already.  The data generally are used to improve the way the system operates.  The more data the organisations that develop these systems have, the better the system can be at matching what a user says and how it behaves.  The artificial intelligence techniques that are used, which were mentioned previously, benefit from large amounts of data.  That is why these data are incredibly valuable.  There is no two ways about it; these devices record our speech.  Voice recordings include the information a user sends to the device but they can also include other bits of information.  Paralinguistic cues such as intonation or prosody can be used to estimate age, sex and even native language.  These recordings can potentially be used to build a version of a user's voice for particular commands and to impersonate the user.  With the use of third-party applications, these data are also likely to be transmitted, shared or stored using other infrastructure.  We must consider that infrastructure's potential security flaws.  As we have mentioned previously, these devices can record users unintentionally, accidentally picking up and storing this audio.  It is clear that these issues need to be addressed, and I am glad that this committee has been called to discuss them. </p> <p>  What do we need to think about when it comes to digital assistants?  First,  we need to be clear about it means to say that these devices are technically "always on".  That means there is a microphone in every home and in every pocket.  It might be waiting for a particular word or utterance but it is listening.  At best, these can record accidentally.  At worst, this information could be intercepted and used to monitor users.  That may not be happening now, but it is a possibility.  This seems unnecessarily intrusive to me.  It may not be to others, but users have to be made aware of the fact that the microphones on these devices are always on.  </p> <p>  We must also be clear on why data are being stored, who accesses them and with what they are being combined.  Currently the reasons data are kept are opaque to the user.  The purpose is summarised as making improvements to the system.  Data gatherers must be more explicit about how these data are used in terms of tracking, profiling and sharing across an organisation, as well as what is being shared with third-party organisations.  This needs to be outlined explicitly to the user, along with how the data are paired with other streams to influence the experience.</p> <p>  Moreover, users currently have no control over what companies can access or use these data.  This means there is no opportunity for users to have an active ongoing voice in how the data are used.  It also bakes in the competitive advantage of big data players, who can use this ocean of speech-based data to improve their systems while competition is left with little data to play with.  This makes it hard for smaller startups, of which there is a thriving community in Dublin, who may change the way these systems operate to compete.  For example, startups could change the way the systems work from a privacy perspective if they had the chance to build them more effectively.  Giving users control of their data could also allow them to choose where their data recordings reside.  It could lead to a boom in research in the area, as users could potentially donate data to non-profit organisations or research if they so desire.</p> <p>  We must also consider consent mechanisms for users.  Currently these systems are used in public spaces by multiple users.  A smart speaker in a kitchen or a living room captures audio recordings of several users, including neighbours, visiting relatives and children.  None of these have consented to their data being recorded and stored but all are potentially being recorded.  We need to discuss what that means and consider new mechanisms by which consent can be given for these data to be used.</p> <p>  We must also discuss the principle of privacy by design.  We must consider how we can include privacy as a standard feature of the design of these devices.  Some smart speakers include the option to turn off the microphone so it is not always on.  "Push to interact" mechanisms would also reduce the likelihood of the accidental recording of data.  We must also be aware of what these decisions mean for the user.</p><p>This type of design decision has a trade-off for users as far as convenience is concerned, whereby they might want to use the voice to initiate the agent in hands-busy, eyes-busy situations in which these technologies are really useful.  We need to have a conversation about how we can bake in privacy by design.</p><p> Our work shows that privacy is a concern for users.  Although it might not seem that it is influencing their behaviours yet, it is in the companies' and governments' interests to address this head-on.  The data we are talking about are not a set of clicks, a search history or a set of cookies but rather our voices.  Users perceive the latter data as far more personal.  A hack or misuse of these data would be significant, and such a threat is potentially real.  As users, therefore, we should have our eyes open as to what it means when we invite digital assistants into our homes.</p></speech>

This issue of people's data came up when we held the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and 'Fake News' here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As Dr. Cowan said, children and visitors in a home could be profiled - are being profiled - and tracked and those data shared.  What are the witnesses' views on citizens or users having power over their own data?  I refer to the issue of consent and knowing how one has been profiled by these companies, whether Google, Facebook or any other company, and having access to that information such that there is transparency as to whom it is being shared with.  As Dr. Cowan said, this concerns whoever comes into the home.  They could be children or vulnerable people.  We are all vulnerable if we do not know what is happening with our data.  It is a matter of that access and transparency as to what data these companies have on us and having access to those data.  Does that need legislation?  What is the view at European level?  Does Mr. Sunderland wish to start with that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.202" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#J00300"><p>Yes, I will take that.  It is a very pertinent point.  In our view, the GDPR provides the tools and levers, and will increasingly do so, to enable us to ensure there is proper, safe and trustworthy use of data.  That is taking place now at a time when there is significant debate across not just industry but broader society, and among people who use these data and examine how they are used, about what constitutes ethical use of data in these contexts.  One point to make is that this is not the sole way in which large platforms that have such devices collect data.  I think this is the point the Chairman was bringing out, that is, that a profile is built from multiple data sources.  The GDPR requires that there be transparency, and we have seen significant improvements in the detail of information provided, but the question is still open as to whether that information is being provided to users in a meaningful, easily accessible way that does not lead to user fatigue.  These are key matters that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is examining and they form the context of some of these big inquiries.</p> <p>  We have seen since the introduction of the GDPR platforms beginning to introduce more granular controls for users as to how they can access the data that are being collected and delete them.  There are positives in that respect but there is still a way to go.  For the commission's part, we will start to drive the standards we think the GDPR requires through our regulatory work, whether through investigations or our ongoing weekly and daily engagement with these companies.  However, if we are seeking to build a digitally based society and economy, user trust is essential, and transparency for users, user control and just the proper safeguarding and protected use of data are absolutely essential for companies.  I think the big tech firms are getting that message and we see some change happening, but there is still a question to be answered.  To be clear, there is probably more that needs to be done to ensure that the right levels of transparency are provided to users, that they have effective control and that everything they do online is not continuously tracked and added to a profile of them.  As I said, some companies are now starting to introduce ways for individuals to delete their profiles, so we are seeing some positives coming into reality.</p></speech>

People have the right to access information that any organisation holds about them.  There are some exceptions to this right - there are always some grey areas - but a number of the larger platforms are now starting to provide better user interfaces to allow users to examine these matters, to make their choice in the first place as to what data they want collected in respect of their activity on these platforms, and to make decisions as to whether they want advertising targeted at them.</p></speech>

This is a body of work that the tech platforms will need to continue to work out.  We will drive it through our regulatory work.  It is a matter of providing much more effective user interfaces for individuals in order that they know what data are being collected and how they can manage their controls and settings, and that this is done in a simple and straightforward way and, as I said, does not just lead to user fatigue or users being turned off the idea that they have increasingly been given more rights and a greater ability to control their data.</p></speech>

This is the delay.  They could do this much more quickly if they so wished, but we must enforce them and request them to do this under the GDPR powers.</p></speech>

The GDPR has led to a changed environment in that companies are now much more sensitive to and aware of the outcome or the potential implications of getting it wrong and have driven to make a number of changes to their platforms.  Some things some of the big tech platforms have recently introduced allow for more granular choice as to what they collect when it comes to users' online activity and when they want that saved, deleted straight away or deleted after a month, for example.  The platforms themselves are trying to look at what more they can do.  I think it will be a mixture of both.  Companies will realise their responsibilities, drive to higher standards and realise and really acknowledge and accept, which I think many are increasingly doing, that they have an obligation to the users to protect their data and use them in safe ways.  The commission will fulfil its role through our regulatory work.</p></speech>

There is a sense that the interaction needs to be designed around the privacy-as-standard view.  The interesting thing I find, especially from our research whenever we look at voice technology, is that these technologies are seen as conversational and as using conversation or speech as a kind of metaphor for interaction.  That could be used as a way of informing people about what these systems can and cannot do and what they have when it comes to privacy or consent.  However, the tech companies need to do this through design.  That does not seem to be coming through the design of the systems at the moment.  It is therefore not just a matter of legislation.  It is about not only researching what the design issues are for the users but also how we can make interaction convenient for them with privacy baked in, and what they can do with the way in which these systems operate in the first place.  There are some really easy wins.  A conversational system could be used to ask whether it is appropriate that the platform is gathering certain data in certain contexts.  That is a design choice, however, and a design decision to make, so there needs to be collaboration between design teams and people involved in data ethics as well as legislators whenever doing this.  That is the only way in which a sustainable, user-centred solution will come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#J01500"><p>I thank both the witnesses for their presentations.  I think I was among a number of people who raised this issue back when Apple made an announcement - it was probably reported in <i>The Guardian</i>or one of those publications - that a number of people had been let go because of the issue of human review of sensitive private conversations.  We were probably all a little concerned that more information than was necessary was being captured.  I think part of Apple's defence at the time was, as Mr. Sutherland identified, that human review is necessary to improve the algorithms and assist in machine learning, and to an extent we get all that.  However, unless there is an appropriate regulatory regime for the big tech companies, then, as night follows day, liberties will be taken at some point in the future.</p><p>The most important aspect of it is that individuals have a clear knowledge from the start that the interceptor, as it were, is always on and that it is not minded to always understand the call, whether it is Alexa, Siri or whatever.  It is a bit like information on cigarette packets about the harmful nature of smoking; it requires authorities to flag the potential pitfalls of an activation that was not intentional.  Many people would not have known prior to this story breaking that there was the potential for such a level of inadvertent activation.  People do not know about it.  I know many people who would not be anxious to have it on all the time if they knew the potential for other conversations to be recorded.  There is an issue around protecting citizens from the perspective of civil liberties, which perhaps falls to the regulator.  It needs greater support from the State through laws that would require a much greater volume of information upfront and a very clear opt in, because I agree with the Chair that one is linked to so many different platforms that one just clicks through.  Of course things are buried and if someone goes to the bother of checking what information is held on him or hers, he or she agrees to it.  Even when it comes to just going through the standard approval to see what we have given different permissions for, many people just leave it and move on.  That is the beginning of a slippery slope to giving much greater control to the big tech companies.  We have to be clear that people must opt in in a very clear and concise way.  It is not about opting in to give them something that they want at a particular moment.  They must opt in very clearly and be shown the consequences of doing so.  Those consequences must be writ large, not just in small print.  I do not know if that comes from the regulator.  I doubt if the regulator having those powers is contained in the GDPR but perhaps it is.  Perhaps the rules of engagement need to have some other type of legislative basis, rather than data just being captured, so that people are clear from the start.  It is important that we get that right.  </p><p> When there is an inadvertent capture of information, sensitive or otherwise, a log is prepared.  It is used at a later stage in the human review to prepare better machine learning and artificial intelligence.  In any of those inadvertent captures, are logs provided to the regulator?  For every inadvertent activation, is a log prepared and forwarded to Mr. Sunderland as regulator?  </p></speech>

At this stage, we are more concerned about the systemic issue and nature of the processing from the start of the installation of the product through to the use of the data at the other end.  There may be multiple uses for that data.  We do not receive, nor do we ask for logs.  We are trying to stand back and look.  In the case of misactivations, we want to know what the company has done to minimise the incidence of misactivations.  They should be baked into privacy design, and, equally, dealing with misactivations, the way that is dealt with in privacy design and how it is implemented into processes.  Companies have introduce features such as on device screening to understand if a person is actually engaging with the device before it starts to record.  There are also further screening processes on the server side.</p> <p>  Misactivations still happen.  As I noted in my opening remarks, this is a concern for us and we think more needs to be done.  The Deputy is quite right that we are talking about private conversations in the home and in the workplace and many users were not, and still are not, aware that such misactivations can take place.  An interesting aspect that arose in the human review of voice recording was that there was no awareness whatever that humans would take a voice recording and examine it to see if the algorithm was working correctly.  The companies we have engaged with as lead supervisory authority have all enhanced their transparency requirements to say that this processing takes place.</p> <p>  On whether something more needs to be done, GDPR holds the tools because the processing of data, from the point it is collected, must be legitimate, fair, lawful and transparent.  It is about the application of those important data protection principles at each step of the processing of personal data.  From the moment someone says something, there should be safeguards and protections built in to ensure voice recordings are only taken when someone intends to engage with the device.  As Dr. Cowan said, data protection by design or default are fundamental principles of data protection law.  My colleague, Mr. Ultan O'Carroll, has recently completed work as a co-rapporteur on the European Data Protection Board's guidelines on data protection by design and default.  They are now out for consultation.  It is something we want to see more of from the companies concerned.  Before one ever starts to collect data - before the new ways of processing personal data to provide services is even designed - data protection concerns should be built in.  Along the chain, one should look at what safeguards can be built in.  It may be minimisation of clips or anonymisation of voice recordings.  There is a legitimate purpose for this review but it is about what the company needs to do to ensure the risk is minimised.</p></speech>

We all like to think that technology is now so advanced that there is no potential for mistakes to be made, but, of course, there is.  It is on a development curve.  The companies rarely provide those potential hazards upfront and they do not follow that path for a good reason, because far fewer people would avail of the technology and the service if they thought there was potential for these types of issue to arise.  It is less about the processing of the data in the first instance than telling them about the potential pitfalls.  I doubt that is contained in the GDPR; it is more about a clear description of what the technology is and is not.  Anyone who purchases a pharmaceutical product today will find a list of reactions that might suffer.  Such a warning is contained in the GDPR.</p></speech>

More could be done on user notices; that is a very good point.  As well as the transparency elements, we have tried to focus on ensuring the risk to this is minimised to the greatest extent it can be so that it is not just a case of continuing where there is a significant risk of misactiviations and it is a case of users beware.  This is so that users are protected from misactivations in the first place and that the data reviewed by humans are properly anonymised or pseudonymised and that they would take away personal identifiers so that when a human goes to review it that the privacy or data protection risk has been minimised to the greatest extent possible.  That is what we mean by data protection by design and that is how we can do it.  More could be done with user interfaces and the setup of these technologies to inform users.  There is a long way to go but we have seen some positive moves in recent months by the service providers and manufacturers of the devices.</p></speech>

However, there may also be an issue of ongoing consent so that when something is inadvertently gathered, the system could alert that to the customer to that effect.</p><p>That is a decision the design teams could make at these companies on the basis that that is what they want in their interaction.  One could have agents that diversify from the standards in the market by doing that.  I do not want to speculate about why they are potentially not doing that, but there is a sense that we need to think a bit more like behavioural scientists when it comes to that issue.  We are trying to get consent, not just at the start, so that people know what the systems do and how they are going to gather data.  That is important, but also that it goes through the interaction, because these are in people's houses for not just a day or a week but potentially for years and years.  The way that the data are being used may change.  We need to have that element of dynamic consent as we go through, but that is a design choice as well as a legislation choice.  Whether there needs to be legislation that says these companies must make users aware throughout the interaction, however which way they do that, that has to happen.  That could be a way of doing it but then the companies then decide how that is done.  It is not good to do it through a written description that someone has to look through, because people want to get that system set up so they just want to click on through.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ultan O'Carroll" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#L00400"><p>Part of what we were doing in Europe was an opinion on data protection by design.  The key takeaway from that is that Article 25 of the GDPR imposes a legal obligation on data controllers, the organisations that create these devices and do the processing, to account for data protection by design in everything they do.  It is not just about things like data minimisation or security.  It is to do with transparency and the legal basis for how gather consent, the way they process data, the way they design their processing chain from start to finish and how they dispose of information.  It has to be effective.  It has to be measurable in some respects to ensure that it is effective and that it can be demonstrated to be effective.  That is a key part of what they have to do as an obligation.<br/><br/>Article 25 is fairly simple.  It is not extensive within the GDPR but it applies horizontally across all activities that data controllers have to do and to account for.  Now, as this public consultation period and that opinion comes to a start, and as we get to the point where we can revise it based on public consultation, there are opportunities to emphasise those issues in much clearer ways.  GDPR allows us to do that in a number of cases with other accountability tools, such as codes of conduct and certification.  One might for instance see a code or certification like with signage for CCTV, which might say:</p> <blockquote> 	This is a voice processing device.  It does these things.  It may use human review in certain cases.  Your choices are explained here.  You can withdraw consent here and here. </blockquote> <p>Those are the kinds of possibilities that are available for transparency measures but it is very much to do with that difference in modality between what we are used to dealing with keyboards and computers to in-home devices where our voices are being processed, where the processing is sometimes invisible or it could be said to be that because it is going on in the background.  It is ambient.  That changes the way we interact with these things and it changes our expectations as well.</p></speech>

The companies are obviously not doing this then if we have had these glitches.  From our point of view, I am just wondering how we deal with it.  Mr. O'Carroll said Article 25 of the GDPR provides the legal framework.  Is the issue enforcement?  These companies are not adhering to the GDPR standards as specified in the legislation.</p></speech>

The work we are doing at the moment is to head towards that conclusion, because the systems are complicated.  There are many different moving parts and different things to consider.  Different kinds of data are being processed.  In some cases, it might be biometric and in others, it might not be.  When organisations do a quality control process, it could be based on a different kind of legal framework than the gathering of the data in the first place.  There are lots of different things to do.  We are going to work towards that and determine what extra work or gaps there are that need to addressed.</p></speech>

I recall at that event that experts from the Carnegie UK Trust explained the duty of care process, which was all about process design and the ability of states or regulators to set out in clear terms the design processes.  It was not the case that we would just rely on Article 25 but that we would be specific.  I do not mean down to the individual content moderation but in the design process.  My understanding is that informed its paper on harmful content but it could inform this area here as well.  Is the European system looking at that duty of care process as a European-wide standard rather than just relying on the broad articles of the GDPR to protect us?  Would that be a good idea?</p></speech>

The GDPR says that they are mainly industry-led but data protection authorities have a role to encourage the development of codes and certification.  A code of conduct is not what we might traditionally know as a code in the sense that everyone signs up to behave themselves, but in a GDPR context, it is about taking a principle of transparency, for example, and saying at a more granular level, for voice assistant technology, what is the industry going to sign up to say how it delivers transparency for this type of technology.  The GDPR then requires that there be an independent monitoring body and that the code of conduct be signed off by the relevant data protection authority or if it is a pan-European, cross-border code covering a number of jurisdictions, signed off by the European Data Protection Board.  We are starting to gear up for the DPC and other data protection authorities to encourage the development of codes.  An example is that the industry could come together to develop a code for voice assistant technology misactivations.  It would go through a regulatory scrutiny process and be signed off in the context of voice assistance, because it would be a cross-border processing code, ultimately by the European Data Protection Board.  We have been very proactive in that space in providing guidance.  Mr. Cathal Ryan was the lead rapporteur on the codes of conduct paper that the European Data Protection Board published last year.  That is an area we will progress in 2020.  We have said in another context that we would focus on children and children's rights in the first instance.  We will work with the tech companies and try bring them to the table to agree a code of conduct.  There is lots more scope for that concept.</p></speech>

Will that legal process drive this as well or is it just coming from the data protection commissioners themselves?  Are there cases before the DPC at present?</p></speech>

A number of those investigations cover the principles of data protection, issues around the standard of consent and what transparency means.  As the commissioner mentioned at the hearing to which the Deputy referred, we have significant investigations into Adtech.  Through those investigations, we will look in detail at how companies say they are complying with the law and aligning what they identify as their compliance features with what we say is the correct interpretation of the GDPR.  They will culminate in formal decisions of the DPC having gone through the measures of co-operation with all the other data protection authorities.</p></speech>

On a positive note, we have been on a significant upwards trajectory in recent years.  We have reached almost 140 staff.  The funding we will receive from the Exchequer for next year will allow us to increase to in the region of 170 staff.  At the time we expressed our disappointment that we did not get everything we asked for, but we will make do but what we have.  The story of resourcing the DPC must continue in the future.  We are in the upper tier of best resourced data protection authorities but we are not at the very top, yet we carry the disproportionate burden of being the first line of defence for regulating the technology companies in Europe.</p><p>That story has not ended.  The resourcing of the DPC must continue to be a focus in the years ahead.</p></speech>

It was reckless and wrong of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to turn down the application for additional resources and that decision should be reversed.</p> <p>  On voice listening devices, Dr. Cowan stated that we must take into consideration that if we own a smartphone, we have one of these agents in our pockets at all times.  He is indicating that if members have their phones on the table during a private session of the committee, the microphones and recording devices of the phones may pick up the conversation if someone has access to them.</p></speech>

It may be an issue of importance.  To some extent, the matter needs to be put into context.  It depends on the security of the devices as well as the security these agents may have.  Tech companies are best placed to discuss the security arrangements for devices.  That may be worth considering.</p></speech>

Mr. Sunderland stated: "Voice assistants record user audio clips and convert those clips into a text form that acts as an input to online services such as search, weather, shopping" and so on.  Many people have contacted members regarding verbal content recorded on their home voice device being converted into data that influences their search or advertising.  That is the reality people are experiencing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.239" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#M00700"><p>That may be correct.  Every platform has different ways of using data.  There is no ubiquity in that regard.  Generally, the transcript of what one says is used to provide what one asked for.  For example, if one asks Siri what the weather is in Dublin, that voice recording is transcribed into text, which is put through the company's systems to provide the information sought.  The company may then deduce that the user is interested in weather or, if the user asks about a holiday, that he or she is interested in a certain type of holiday.  An inference could be drawn that the user is interested in a particular matter.  If one's settings allow targeted advertising, the information recorded would be used to inform the selection of advertisements one may see on one's smart device.  One could be using a home assistant and receive targeted advertisements on another device because it is joined up in the background of the platforms.  We want to see more user choice regarding and control over those settings.  Some platforms now allow users to turn off the collection or recording of web and app activity such that the information is not used to build a profile.  Some companies are introducing deletion controls to allow users to delete audio data.  Previously drawn inferences are cleared and the slate is wiped clean.</p> <p>  The challenge for us in terms of our educational work as a regulator is how to educate users better on the choices that exist as well as driving higher levels of user choice and transparency.  We need to ensure users engage with the settings in a time and space that suits them.  Making decisions on all of the settings while signing up to something does not always work because the user wishes to get to the end service.</p></speech>

Dr. Cowan may be examining the issue of whether there is an underlying flaw in the basic business model whereby we have given up our personal data in return for free access and, in turn, the companies have this incredible surveillance capability and advertising power.  Is Dr. Cowan beginning to examine this area?  He referred to many small start-ups that are looking for opportunities.  Is there a big problem in terms of a monopoly on access to the data?</p></speech>

I ask him to address it now as I am going to try to wrap up shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.242" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Benjamin Cowan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#M01000"><p>I will address both issues.  There is definitely a monopoly in respect of the data gathered by several major tech companies.  We should try to ensure there is a level playing field in that regard for start-up companies and other organisations.  There may be an issue of inequality because data are such an important part of these companies' business models.  The data are used to build better tech as well as gain insight on users.  It is critical to realise that it is not just about using the data to build user profiles.  Those user profiles or information are used to make better technology, particularly in the case of voice assistants.  We should reflect on what we are doing in that situation.  I kind of agree with the Deputy on that issue.</p> <p>  On resources, much research is being carried out on trust in the context of artificial intelligence systems.  That is being pursued through the ADAPT centre funded by Science Foundation Ireland as well as through some of the work we do in UCD.  If we wish to signal to the tech companies how to do this better in terms of informed consent, dynamic consent or how to better design systems with that in mind, we need better funding of research.</p></speech>

I dealt with representatives of the DPC at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality when we were processing the Data Protection Act 2018.  I am alarmed by the soft wording in the statement provided by the DPC.  There is reference to ongoing engagement with the companies.  That is too soft and weak.  The DPC has strong legislative back-up under GDPR and there should be enforcement consequences.  Engagement is not good enough when damage is being done by companies that are based here.  People's private conversations and lives are being invaded and the GDPR is being breached.  It is not good enough to state that the DPC has yet to reach a conclusion.  It has a remit to inform the public about the breach of the GDPR by these companies and the fact that information on people's private conversations and lives is being collected.  We know from evidence presented in <i>The Guardian</i>and by whistleblowers that that has happened, and is happening.  However, the DPC is merely engaging with the companies.  It should be concentrated on enforcement.</p><p>Have the companies become too big to regulate?  Is the DPC too small to regulate them?  There is a trend across several areas whereby damage is continuously being done.  A leak of sensitive information could impact on people's private lives.  I do not criticise Mr. Sunderland.  There are funding issues.  I acknowledge the DPC is attempting to increase its ability to deal with the concentration of data that rests in this country.</p><p>The committee spent months discussing the digital age of consent.</p><p>That is not being adhered to here.  There is no lawful basis for what they are doing.  It is not transparent because nobody knows it is happening apart from people who happen to read <i>The Guardian</i>and other newspapers.  People with Apple watches or who subscribe to Amazon do not know that it is happening.  What is the commission doing to drive awareness of this?  Is there evidence of the sharing or sale of this data?  How many companies are processing data of this nature?  Is there a mechanism through which the practice can be actively monitored?  I would like to hear more from the commission about enforcement.  Can the officials provide detail about what that might mean for companies?  Is the enforcement consequence sufficient to remove the clear breach?  These companies have decided to breach the regulatory framework and GDPR and have knowingly breached them.</p></speech>

We discuss it with each other.  There is no consensus about what compliance is with regard to some of these issues so it cannot be taken de facto that there has been a breach because every element of compliance must be looked at.  We have achieved some change outside of statutory investigations over the past few months.  If it transpires that we need to look at this in a different context, the commission will do so but the companies with which we have been dealing have now enhanced transparency.  They are bringing their users through new engagement flows to bring customers' attention to this existence of this sort of processing.  They are introducing new technology around misactivation.  This is at one end, which is the area for which I am responsible in terms of the supervision element of the commission's work.  We drive change, including behavioural change, outside investigations.</p> <p>  The commission has opened 21 statutory investigations into the big technology companies.  The first decisions in respect of those investigations will start to conclude in early 2020.  That is the spectrum of regulatory activity we must acknowledge.  It involves investigations where there will be findings and where appropriate and necessary, sanctions, including administrative fines.  At the other end, we interact effectively and robustly with the companies to drive them to make changes outside of investigations.  If there is a need for the commission to go into a formal investigation mode, it will consider that fully and take that action.</p></speech>

I know there is context, risk and large-scale data processing.  We are looking through all these issues and are achieving change as we engage with the companies.  If based on everything we have gathered, we make an assessment that there is a need to look at this on a statutory footing through an inquiry under the Data Protection Act, the commission will make that decision.  We are doing this in co-operation with our European data protection colleagues.  The European Data Protection Board is looking at whether there is a need for further guidance in this field.  It is the view of all of the colleagues with which we engage at a European level that there are issues that need to ironed out but there might be a need for further guidance from the European data protection community on this issue.</p></speech>

It is in a European context as well.  Is big business in Europe able to manage the public affairs element of this with the economic side of the commission, for example?  Are data issues and privacy concerns subservient to the profits of these corporations and their capacity to lobby?  There will be serious consequences because we have not collectively enforced the GDPR.  People will face the consequences.  We have had other cases of breaches of data where lives have been lost.  If someone's personal life is revealed because of a data breach, which is probable based on the scale of this, there will be a significant reaction and enforcement so we must be ahead of the curve.</p></speech>

It is our job to take the legal framework we have been given and dispassionately regulate against that framework without fear or favour and this is what we are doing.  We are coming to the conclusion of our major investigations so the results of those will start to appear in early 2020.  That pipeline is filling up.  As I mentioned earlier, some of the key principles of data protection that have been in place here for 30 years feature in those investigations.  We make determinations on them and impose sanctions and other corrective measures where appropriate and necessary.  We have the means to regulate this sector and are doing so in co-operation with other European data protection authorities.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Sutherland think there is an information deficit among the public regarding this issue?  Does he think the normal mother, father or other adult is aware of the capabilities of whatever device is in front of them?  Does he believe there is a deficit of this information?  Do the public realise that the phones in front of us have the capability to monitor what we are saying, harvest that information and allow us to become the new currency?  Regarding this deficit of information, how can the commission step in to inform the public about what these machines do so that they have a genuine understanding?  As a public representative, until I sat in front of the witnesses today, I did not realise half of what was happening.  What needs to be done so that people can be informed about what a mobile phone can do?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#N01200"><p>There is a two-pronged approach.  First, the companies have an obligation to drive awareness of their products and services.  Deputy Dooley raised this issue.  More could be done at that point.  It is in the context of a broad number of services and what is nearly information overload in some respects, for example, when someone hits a webpage and is asked to consent to cookies, etc.  There is an element of user fatigue in all of that.  One of the answers is better user interfaces, which we touched on earlier, and better ways to bring information, including surface information, to individuals.  Let us not forget that these companies have some of the smartest and most capable and talented designers in the world working for them so it is not just about designing a good user experience.  There must also be better ways to bring this type of information to the surface for users.  That is something of which we are very mindful.</p> <p>  We also have an obligation through our guidance functions.  The paradox is that guidance we have published where, for example, we spoke about how people might be nudged towards choices online, etc., has not been picked up so there is a challenge there for us.  We are trying to consider how we can best tackle the important issue of user awareness.  It is in a context where we increasingly function in an online connected world.  There are significant risks if companies do not implement their data processing practices correctly and if users are unable to inform themselves or are unaware of the risks but also the choices they have to control their data.</p></speech>

It is a significant issue about which they are concerned.  Whether it acts a barrier to them using or stopping to use the technology is an open question.  There is a sense of there being an awareness of being monitored based on the clicks they make and the voice aspects of technology in respect of interactions so there is awareness on the part of some users but it is not universal.</p><p>There definitely does need to be more information about that and it needs to be much more upfront.  Removing my voice assistant researcher hat and putting on my behaviour change researcher hat, it is not just about information, it is about when the information is delivered.  The action is to be made when someone is to interact or someone is to decide that they are going to let this system gather a piece of data they may not want it to gather.  We need to figure that out and identify what mechanism we need to have a person make an informed decision based on that, at the point the decision is being made.  That is a design problem as well as a problem of understanding what the interaction is.  It is about how we design that more effectively, thinking about nudge and behaviour change-based technologies.  That is what many of the tech companies are using to gather this data and to get us to purchase new things and more stuff.  They are using nudge-based techniques so potentially we should be using nudge-based techniques for privacy as well.</p></speech>

We are in an usual space in Ireland.  We have a major conglomeration of tech companies that are a major force.  The Data Protection Commission is going up to 170 staff this year alone.  We are talking about multinationals that have very deep pockets.  Is it big industry against small government?  The commission has an independent remit but it is tied in budgetary terms as regards staffing.  Even though it is independent, when it comes to budget issues it is tied in to the Government.  What is the scale of the deficit at the moment and where do we need to go regarding the scale of funding that is required?  Are we looking at some kind of tax on the multinationals so they can be part of the commission's programme and so it can fund itself?  Where do the witnesses see the funding stream coming from?  Is it strictly coming from central Government?  Is there a European element to it?  Should there be an industry element as well?</p></speech>

I want to emphasise that the figure was up from approximately &euro;1.5 million six years ago.  It has been a steep trajectory, but necessary given the context in which we operate.  We receive our funding from the central Exchequer.  We are trained to become a separate Vote for next year.  As I said earlier, I think our funding needs to increase to allow us to be more effective.  We are committed to getting this job of work done and are working very diligently at it.  The first results of those inquiries and the draft decisions will come early next year.  However, it is not just about big tech.  We have received 11,000 complaints since the GDPR came into effect of which 9,000 came this year.  That is up from 2,500 the year before the GDPR.  That is a huge increase.  They are the ordinary, everyday complaints about access requests from someone seeking their information from a doctor or hospital, for example.  All of those complaints must be addressed as well.  It is not solely about the big tech companies.</p> <p>  I think it is likely that our funding will continue to be provided from the central Exchequer.  That is quite normal for data protection authorities across the European Union.  We will continue to make the case as to why we need that funding.  On staffing, compared to some of our peer data protection authorities and the larger authorities in the European Union, for example the French data protection authority has over 200 staff.  The Italian authority has around 200 staff and the Dutch authority is growing towards 200.  The UK Information Commissioner's Office has about 700 staff so they are somewhat of an outlier.  When we are the lead authority for these tech companies and their single interlocutor, it means they get to deal directly with us and we take on the responsibility of engaging with all of the other data protection authorities.  There is significant overhead in that simply on the administrative side, let alone engaging in regulatory matters.  There are tools in the GDPR that we want to maximise such as joint operations.  We are actively trying to promote the concept among our peer authorities that we would bring members from other authorities on board in helping us run our investigations.  We are hopeful that there will be some progress on that in the near future.  I hope I have answered all the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

The Government climate action plan, published in June of this year, identifies the need to plan appropriately to ensure that those most affected by our transition to a low-carbon climate-resilient society are supported and equipped to contribute to this transition.  The climate action plan recognises that the level of change required to decarbonise Ireland's economy cannot be avoided and that the taxpayer cannot compensate for all the many actions which will have to be taken.  However, it is essential that the burdens borne are seen to be fair and that every group is seen to be making an appropriate and fair level of effort.  This will be essential to maintaining the high level of political and civic consensus which has been built through the work of the Citizens' Assembly and in the Oireachtas Committee on Climate Action.</p> <p>  In its report, published in March of this year, this committee identified as a central concern the need to ensure that climate action is fair and that vulnerable citizens, workers and communities are protected.  The committee also highlighted the importance of exploring opportunities to green existing jobs and create new jobs in areas such as energy retrofitting for buildings, sustainable forestry and peat land restoration.  These are also core objectives of the climate action plan.</p> <p>  Since the Second Stage debate took place on 19 September there have been several important developments which are directly relevant to the committee's consideration of this legislation.  The Government has made a commitment to an early and complete phase-out of peat and coal for electricity generation.  The Government recognises that this will have a significant impact on the workers in these carbon-intensive sectors, their families and the midlands as a whole.  The Government has, therefore, committed to delivering a whole-of-government approach to addressing this challenge and to working with local stakeholders to ensure the people impacted can be best supported.  In this context, the Government has prioritised several initiatives in budget 2020, including the provisions of &euro;6 million for a just transition fund targeted at the midlands to support the retraining and reskilling of workers and to assist communities and businesses in the region to adjust to the low-carbon transition.  In recognition of its longstanding relationship with communities in the midlands, the ESB has agreed to contribute an additional &euro;5 million to this fund, bringing its total value to &euro;11 million.  While details around the allocation of this fund are still to be finalised, it is expected that it will support retraining and reskilling workers and assist local communities and businesses in the midlands to adjust to the low-carbon transition.  There will be further consultation with the structures in place in the midlands, including the midlands transition team, on the application of the funding.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;5 million has been allocated for the National Parks and Wildlife Service bog restoration and rehabilitation programme to restore 1,800 ha of bog to their natural habitat, ensuring the return of these bogs to carbons sinks once again and creating 70 to 100 jobs.  A further &euro;20 million is to be targeted at the midlands to deliver a new model to group housing upgrades, as set out in the climate action plan.  This will support an estimated 400 direct and indirect jobs as well as a significant upgrading of the social housing stock in the region.</p> <p>  To ensure that the theme of just transition is sustained on a consistent basis the climate action plan provides for the establishment of a just transition review group within the National Economic and Social Council.  The objective of this group will be to review the ongoing transition and identify specific transition needs among cohorts of workers, enterprises, communities and specific groups of people.</p> <p>  The Department has also been engaging with the European Commission to explore the potential for a support scheme, funded through a public service obligation, for the enhanced rehabilitation of the Bord na M&oacute;na bogs over and above what Bord na M&oacute;na is obliged to do under its Environmental Protection Agency licences.  The proposal is to fund a scheme for the enhanced rehabilitation and restoration by Bord na M&oacute;na of its peatlands that have been used for harvesting peat for electricity generation.  On 8 November the Government announced the appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as just transition commissioner.  The purpose of the commissioner is to provide a co-ordinated and effective approach to just transition for communities and workers affected by the ending of peat harvesting for power generation in the midlands.  The terms of reference for the office of the just transition commissioner have been published by the Minister and the details on the appointment are currently being finalised.</p> <p>  It is important for the committee to consider whether the Bill, as drafted, will achieve the outcomes on the substantive issues that it seeks to address.  In this context a number of high level issues arise in considering the provisions.  The Government has committed to leading on providing a just transition response as part of its overall policy approach to climate action.  It is not clear that the response to the challenges of a just transition should be devolved to an independent commission, which may not have sufficient accountability to Minister, the Government or the Oireachtas.  The functions of the proposed national just transition commission, as described in section 5, are wide-ranging in scope for a single body to have responsibility for.  The functions include, but are not limited to the designation of any body as a prescribed body where the commission considers it necessary; the approval, amendment or revision of just transition plans to be prepared by a prescribed body; mediating, where necessary, in the preparation of individual just transition plans; providing independent information and guidance to individual undertakings, to the general public and to any other category of body that may require it, including the promotion of education and public awareness specific to the proposed legislation and to the commission itself; providing specialist guidance and technical advisory services on just transition; making recommendations to Government with regard to the need for a just transition; and supervising compliance with duties imposed by the proposed legislation.</p> <p>  In empowering the commission to approve, amend or review just transition plans and by giving the commission powers of mediation, the Bill effectively gives the commission significant decision-making functions relating to matters concerning economic and industrial policy at national, regional and local level throughout Ireland's economy.</p><p>The operation of the proposed commission, in respect of its proposed mediation and adjudication functions, may also cut across the operation of the existing industrial relations machinery of the State, including for example the roles, as set out under statute, of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court.  The proposals set out in this Bill will involve a direct and ongoing cost to the Exchequer in relation to the establishment and operation of the national just transition commission.  Estimates of these costs would need to be made, as well as an assessment of the potential impacts of the proposed legislation by way of a regulatory impact assessment or otherwise. </p><p> This is a short summary of some of the key issues to which the Bill gives rise.  The Department is at the committee&rsquo;s disposal to further engage on the detailed provisions of the Bill as it sees fit. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Macdara Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019112600002#Q00300"><p>We thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to engage on the broad issue of just transition and, more specifically, on the Just Transition (Worker and Community Environmental Rights) Bill 2018.  In doing so, we note the proposals contained in the climate action plan to help deliver greater policy coherence and action on this critical issue, including the introduction of legally binding five-year carbon budgets; the establishment of a climate action delivery board chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach; the establishment of a more robust climate action council to advise and monitor Government progress in emissions reduction; the establishment of a standing committee on climate action to ensure accountability across all branches of Government; and ensuring that major State investment decisions will be subject to a carbon impact and mitigation evaluation.  However, from our perspective there is one key element missing from this list, namely, the establishment of an appropriate overarching structure to help ensure delivery of a just transition in workplaces and communities across the country.  For this reason, we welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Green Party and acknowledge its engagement with the trade union movement on its contents.</p> <p>  The Bill proposes to establish a commission that would bring specialist expertise to bear in respect of transition issues.  In last week&rsquo;s hearing before the larger, all party committee, we highlighted some of the difficulties currently being experienced in the midlands.  It is our view that some of those difficulties would almost certainly have been averted and avoided if such legislation had been enacted and the proposed structure was up and running.  As was mentioned at last week&rsquo;s hearing, all successful examples of just transition to date demonstrate the necessity for proactive policy action.  Indeed, they hinge on State-led advance planning, proactive engagement with all stakeholders and the allocation of appropriate resources.  Unfortunately, in the absence of any such process or overarching plan, the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na in particular and the communities of the midlands have been left without the support or the systems necessary to drive this critical transition process.  As matters stand, they have been asked to sacrifice their livelihoods for the good of future generations and have seen little that is concrete or certain in return.  </p> <p>  Change of this magnitude requires all-of-Government action and a strategic, overarching vision.  It cannot be left to chance or to the market.  It is not good enough to simply borrow the language of just transition; Government and policy makers need to engage on the substance of that concept.  As we understand it, the proposed Bill would see Oireachtas involvement in appointing members of the board of the just transition commission.  The board would then have the power to require companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na to develop a just transition plan for their specific enterprise that would encompass key issues such as retraining, re-skilling and redeployment.  We note that the Bill foresees the input of all stakeholders into such plans, a procedure to monitor implementation and a mediation system to address possible disputes.  These are welcome measures and the overall architecture as outlined in the Bill has the potential to overcome difficulties such as those that have been highlighted in respect of a company that refuses to engage in the WRC-facilitated forum that worker representatives have repeatedly called for.  In the same vein, it appears somewhat odd that the Government should appoint a just transition commissioner and then explicitly rule out that office having any role in industrial relations matters and the difficulties faced by workers, as part of that process. </p> <p>  While ICTU supports the content and aims of this Bill, the urgency of the situation in the midlands dictates that we cannot afford to wait while it continues its progress through the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the proposed WRC forum should be established now and utilised to address the issues that have arisen in Bord na M&oacute;na in the absence of any other legislative or institutional vehicle.  Indeed, the WRC may well have a useful role to play in the structures proposed under this Bill.  Earlier this year ICTU, in alliance with a range of environmental NGOs, called for the establishment of a properly resourced national just transition task force to oversee and drive the transition here over the coming years.  Our call echoed the recommendation of the Oireachtas joint committee contained in the report it published in March of this year.  Whatever model is adopted, the crucial point is that we urgently require an overarching, strategic vision as to where this process leads, a clear roadmap of how we get there and a legislative framework that is equal to the enormous and very pressing challenge that we face.  This should encompass social dialogue that includes all stakeholders; access to retraining and education; and respect for democratic rights to trade union and community representation.  The workers and communities at the heart of this transition process deserve nothing less. </p></speech>

I particularly appreciate the supportive comments from ICTU and others on this Bill.  I think they get it in the sense that the scale of the challenge in meeting our climate change targets means that we are changing everything.  It is system change at scale.  We are changing our energy, transport, food and industrial systems for the better of the Irish public, the Irish workforce and the environment.  As has been said, we must do this in a systematic, organised way.  We had discussions at committee last week with Ms Patricia King from ICTU and I agree with her view that in the absence of this legislation, the WRC would be a useful vehicle to engage as wide a variety of stakeholders as possible.  I still believe that this piece of architecture forms part of our partnership approach which is something that we do well in this country.  Historically we have done well in working collectively across different sectors of society.  This piece of architecture, which is very specific, is needed.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll from the Department cited a lot of very welcome developments since we discussed this Bill on Second Stage.  He referred to funding for various initiatives, although I think most people will agree that the way it has been done in the midlands has not been right.  There was no advance planning and the unions and workers there have not been properly engaged.  Various stakeholders have not been engaged but having said that, some of the funding commitments are welcome.  In terms of the Government's approach, it committed to the completion of the just transition review by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, by the end of this year.  It is unfortunate that representatives of NESC are not here today.  They said that they did not think the timing of this meeting was right so we are going to have to come back in the new year to-----</p></speech>

The NESC work is happening in parallel and is due to be completed this year.  In terms of the situation that arose immediately in the midlands, the Government needed to respond to that.  In my opening statement I went through a lot of the decisions Government has taken in terms of the funds and so on.  Part of that response was the establishment of a just transition commissioner.  The NESC piece, while it is focusing on the just transition and clearly what is happening in the midlands is the first serious manifestation, it is also aiming to take a much longer term and broader perspective.  It will be looking out over the coming decades and seeking to anticipate where the next instances will arise and to plan for that.  I do not see the two as being inconsistent.  There was something that needed to be dealt with in the midlands with quite a degree of urgency.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that an interdepartmental group was set up and led by the Department of the Taoiseach.  It cuts across a number of Departments, including the Departments of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Public Expenditure and Reform, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and Rural and Community Development.  The group will be meeting on an ongoing basis, as required.  The central co-ordination function rests with the Taoiseach's Department.  The just transition commissioner will be supported by a secretariat in our Department and in the midlands and will report to our Minister and, through our Minister, to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The role of the Department of the Taoiseach is still central in co-ordinating the whole-of-Government effort.</p></speech>

I am interested in the unions' perspective on this.  As skilled as Mr. Mulvey is, in the absence of some of the structures we are suggesting in our Bill, in the absence of the necessary resources and the ability to pull in expertise, set up mediation structures, designate companies to produce a plan, and review, monitor and scrutinise, and in the absence of all the legislative structures we have included after a great deal of deliberation to make sure we do this job well, there is a genuine fear that a single-person commission without legislative and other resources and without independence will not be able to do the job given the scale of that job in a variety of areas where we will have to apply this.</p> <p>  It is a matter of avoiding the mistakes made with Bord na M&oacute;na whereby we are not being proactive in addressing issues before they arise and are always sticking on Band-Aids.  This Bill overcomes that failing.  We have seen a specific example in how Bord na M&oacute;na workers have been treated.  Mr. Carroll's concerns are over the devolution of too much power, independence, authority and capability and too many resources but the opposite is that the current system and commissioner, without any clear resources or structures within which to do the myriad jobs that are likely to arise, would not function as envisaged.  Mr. Carroll criticises the measures as too much; I would criticise the Government's approach as being too little.</p></speech>

Among everybody who is part of this effort, there is consensus on the outcomes we are trying to achieve to protect the most vulnerable workers and areas of society as part of this transition.  It is a question of determining what the most suitable and effective model is.  We are looking for effective structures, be they grounded in legislation or otherwise.</p> <p>  With regard to developments to date, the decisions taken by the Government on the budget were only taken in October.  The just transition commissioner was appointed only earlier this month.  The terms of reference are very clear: to help ensure a co-ordinated and effective approach to the just transition, with a focus initially on communities and workers in the midlands affected by the ending of peat harvesting for power generation.  The commissioner will be able to engage with all relevant stakeholders, including Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, relevant trade unions, worker organisations, local community organisations and the structures already established, particularly the regional transition team, the regional enterprise plan steering committee, the regional skills forum, local authorities and public representatives.

We have got to the point where we can say he will be supported by a secretariat in our Department.  There will be a secretariat available to him in the midlands.  With regard to the relevant expertise, he is charged with reviewing experience and good practice, not just domestically but also internationally.  There is scope within the terms of reference to consult the types of experts the Deputy referred to.  The commissioner is also charged with taking account of existing plans and programmes.  He will be reporting quarterly to the Government.</p> <p> In response, the role of the just transition commissioner has only just been established and he has yet to start working through this programme.  The aim is that this will effectively deal with the types of issues we are all trying to solve.</p></speech>

What I propose would assist the Department in having an independent State-supported, State-regulated, Department-guided agency to make sure we are ahead of the game rather than chasing it.  I firmly believe the cost of setting up such a mediation service would be very quickly returned.</p> <p>  The Department sees nothing in the drafting of this Bill that presents any legal or other difficulties.  It is more to do with the policy approach.  I compliment and thank the legal advisory service.  We had counsel advising us on every stage on this.  It took a long time.  I thank Ms Sinead Mercer, in particular.  She was our researcher who worked on it.  This went through the legal wringer from our side.  Does the Department see any difficulty in the drafting of the Bill? </p></speech>

My central point is that this is partnership architecture that allows for a wider range of stakeholders to be deployed in a variety of circumstances.  I would be interested in hearing their view on the prospect.  At the committee meeting the other day, a question was asked about having a slightly slimmed down just transition commissioner, as in Mr. Mulvey and his terms of reference.  Do the delegates believe the approach the Government is taking allows for the proper partnership approach?  Is it slightly too narrow?</p></speech>

If the name is changed, it is effectively the same body.  It is a structure that would probably be commensurate with the scale of the challenge facing us.  If set up as proposed, it would allow for the process of engagement.  That is simply not taking place now or it is not possible now because we do not have structures or appropriate forum.  The fear is that what is currently under development might not be sufficient to meet the scale of the challenge.</p></speech>

I supported it on Second Stage and I welcome this scrutiny.</p> <p>  When did the Department first become aware that there would need to be a just transition policy and framework put in place?

Why is it only now that the Government is looking to put in place a process?  According to Mr. Carroll - we spoke at the Committee of Public Accounts on this issue quite extensively as well - the just transition commissioner is only in post for a couple of weeks.  The funding was only put in place in the budget of this year.  We had a decision made prematurely to close two power plants.  The head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions  said Bord na M&oacute;na would not engage with the trade unions and it was playing for time.  She said there was a strategy to de-unionise the organisation.  There was sharp criticism that far from engagement, it was quite the opposite.

We are sitting here today with the trade unions, and recently with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, saying that the engagement is appalling and not at the level that it should be, and is not even at the races in terms of what is needed.

In the climate action plan, the Government made just transition one of the central themes and a core piece.  In responding to what is happening in the midlands, I went through the long list of initiatives.  In the first budget since some of these developments, some funds have clearly been set aside and a just transition commissioner has been announced.</p></speech>

We have heard that again here from the trade unions.  Why was that decision taken?  Mr. Carroll has listed a range of initiatives that may are being worked on but, at this point in time, they are not in place and not working.  He told us that the just transition commissioner will have an overarching role to put it all together. One of the key ingredients, however, is supporting the workers, engaging with the trade unions, and having a role in industrial relations, which will not be one of his competencies or and responsibilities.

Mr. Carroll's Department is the line Department responsible for making sure that we have a just transition.

On developments this year, there is a very real urgency in the pace at which Government made decisions and put these new funds in place, with the supports package and the announcement of the agreed terms of reference of the just transition commissioner.  It is quite a coherent whole-of-Government response to the issues that have arisen in the midlands.</p></speech>

What the Government is doing here with the just transition forum, with which there are difficulties as well - is that it is all about consultation.  What we need, and what Deputy Eamon Ryan's Bill is trying to achieve, and what the trade unions are saying, is that the stakeholders need to be involved in decision-making as opposed to not being consulted at all.  Does Mr. Carroll accept that there is a frustration on the part of the representatives of the workforce of Bord na M&oacute;na, the ESB, and others, who need to be protected?  Those trade unions are telling us that the architecture is not what it should be.  Mr. Carroll, however, is telling me is that it is.  Can he accept the frustration of the trade unions in this regard?  What has he learned from what he heard from Ms King last week and from the trade union leaders here today that can result in changes, which will ensure that we get better at just transition?</p></speech>

The funds and the just transition commissioner have just been put in place and the terms of reference have just been agreed.  The commissioner has clear and comprehensive terms of reference.  He has not yet had a chance to go about doing his job.  He will report quarterly to Government and the arrangement is to be reviewed after two years.  It is hard to see how one can make an argument that a structure does not work when the structure has just been established and has not had a chance to operate as described in the terms of reference.</p></speech>

It should have been established a long time ago.  We are now asking these hard questions.  It is our job to put those questions to officials and to deal with this because the preparations were not made and the strategies were not put in place earlier.  It is not good enough to put it back on us and say that we cannot judge the Department on what is not in place.  The Department did not put it in place.  Everybody around this table knew that there would have to be a just transition element in what was needed to reduce our dependence on carbon.</p><p>Everybody knew that for years so it is not good enough simply to say that it is not up and running.

On the particular one the Deputy mentioned, in terms of what the Government is keen to do, it is something I said at the outset, there are always different proposals about how to solve a problem.  Whether it is a task force or legislation, there is a shared view as to the outcome everyone wants to achieve.  In terms of the Government exercising its function, it has made decisions regarding funding and structures it believes to be appropriate to meeting these challenges.  If there is any departure from recommendations by the joint committee, that would not be unusual in terms of the Government listening to recommendations and then making policy decisions.  Everyone shares an ambition to achieve an outcome that protects vulnerable workers and ensures there is fairness as we transition to a low-carbon economy.</p></speech>

We have heard from the union representatives about how the livelihood of workers are at stake, that the data have not been collected on the actual impact of this and how we had public relations, PR, stunts last week pretending to engage with communities when it is clear the Government is behind the curve on this issue.

I will not go through the funds announced because I listed them in my opening statement but I refer to the appointment of the just transition commissioner, a comprehensive terms of reference and the fact that the commissioner is about to embark on this work now.

This has been in the pipeline for some time.  The fact that Mr. Carroll could not clarify when the Department was commencing work on this is another concern.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll mentioned the just transition commissioner.  One of the union representatives who came before the committee last week said that he spoke to Mr. Kieran Mulvey on his initial appointment and he has not heard from him since because of issues with the terms of reference.  Why did the Department restrict the scale of engagement, in partnership with the commissioner, around this sensitive and just transition that needs to occur?  What is the reasoning behind restricting Mr. Mulvey's partnership with the union representatives?  When did the Department make that decision?</p></speech>

First, there is no attempt to stop Mr. Mulvey engaging with the unions.  The terms of reference explicitly require him to consult with all key stakeholders, including the relevant companies and the trade unions and workers' representatives.  That is clearly in the terms of reference.  There is no attempt to restrict Mr. Mulvey talking to the unions in those ways.</p> <p>  Second, in terms of the industrial relations, IR, piece, the view was that we have existing industrial relations structures and that they continue to operate.</p></speech>

The terms of reference have not reflected that in respect of mediation or partnering with the just transition commissioner.  How does Mr. Carroll respond to that?</p></speech>

It is explicitly stated in the terms of reference that the commissioner is to engage with relevant trade unions and worker representatives.

I have gone through the terms of reference of the just transition commissioner a number of times and there are structures in place with the joint industrial relations council and the Workplace Relations Commission to deal with IR issues in Bord na M&oacute;na.  I have highlighted the separate and distinct role that the just transition commissioner will take.  He will engage with relevant trade union and worker representatives, among other stakeholders.  That is to put him in a position to recommend to the Government, when that work is done, the essential elements of a just transition for workers and communities most affected.  That includes any additional actions or measures deemed appropriate and optimal structures or processes to support co-ordinated delivery of the just transition in the midlands.  It will be the role of the commissioner to develop liaison channels between institutions in the regions and central Government.  There is quite a lot in the terms of reference that apply to what the commissioner is to do.</p></speech>

Those are all IR issues but are they distinctively different to IR issues that arise as a result of the closure of peat production and, therefore, are they distinctly different IR issues to those that would come under the just transition that a commissioner is being appointed to look after?</p></speech>

The terms of reference for the commissioner are quite broad when it comes to delivering the wider or essential elements of the just transition in respect of having a coherent response, ensuring that other employment becomes available and that workers end up being retrained as appropriate.  Funds have been put in place for that through the budget.  The just transition fund is in place and there is also money for a programme of retrofitting in the midlands.  Everyone wants to see the same sorts of outcomes in the midlands.</p> <p>  There is also extra money being provided for peat rehabilitation.  We are really talking about the structures to deliver the outcome that we all agree should happen.  I am trying to outline the structures that the Government has put in place as a matter of urgency in response to developments this year.</p></speech>

It is an IR issue when workers find themselves redundant, out of work, without seasonal work, proper redundancy or proper access to pension schemes as a consequence of the closure of peat production.  A just transition, however, involves finding places for those workers in which they can retrain or maybe find another job.  Do we forget about all the other things that put those workers in the position where they are out of work or need to be upskilled and say that has nothing to do with just transition?  The transition happens, perhaps very unjustly, but the role of the just transition commissioner is to pick up the pieces by retraining them.  Does that really cover the definition of a just transition commissioner?</p></speech>

I know that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Government agencies are engaging closely with workers affected to make them aware of available retraining, education and employment opportunities and exploring opportunities for affected workers through schemes such as community employment and the rural social scheme.</p> <p>  I also know that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a competitive regional development fund in the amount of &euro;60 million administered by Enterprise Ireland and has allocated &euro;3 million-----</p></speech>

Generally speaking, we are talking here about an architecture for delivering a just transition which we all agree is something we want to achieve.  There is frustration on our side that, while the words "just transition" are bandied around quite a lot, nobody in government has come to ICTU, where the concept originated, and asked how we think it should be delivered.  The Government should not only be talking to us, it should equally be talking to employers and communities but we are lacking a national dialogue as to how this is delivered.</p><p>In the absence of that, the Bill is an impetus to that discussion and that is why we welcome it very much.  It has the potential to address many of the issues that we have been discussing today and discussed last week.  One of the key elements of a just transition is social dialogue and we, as representatives of hundreds of thousands of workers on the island, should be part of the dialogue in coming up with how we do just transition.  We should not be just recipients of it but active participants in designing it and ensuring that it is delivered.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is no conflict around the fact that we need this just transition.  No reasonable person will challenge the proposition that we have to cushion, protect, retrain and give jobs to people, particularly in the case of the loss of the bogs in the midlands and then generally as we transition from fuels.  That is not at issue.  I would like to put the following proposition just to have it confirmed.  Am I correct in saying there is a commitment of 100 direct and indirect jobs being created to retrofit homes in the midlands, 100 jobs through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, 100 new direct jobs and more than 150 indirect jobs in the development of renewable energy assets, 100 new jobs in recycling and potentially 150 jobs in the new green business projects and jobs in the restoration of the bogs?  We would much prefer a situation where people got trained for work.  Will all the machinery of the State be available for retraining?  It is the last chance to saloon as we do not want anybody going on welfare, or being unemployed.  In the very bleak scenario where that arises, people will be cushioned but they will get training.  While we all support just transition and a just transition commissioner, for the sake of a balance, are the points I made valid?</p></speech>

As to the number of jobs, 400 direct and indirect jobs will be created through retrofitting of homes in the midlands starting with social homes.  Up to 100 jobs will be created in the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Bord na M&oacute;na will be prioritising job creation.  There will be 100 new direct jobs and more than 150 indirect jobs involved in the development of renewable energy assets by 2023.  There will be 100 new jobs in new recycling options and potentially another 150 to 300 new jobs in green business projects.  Yes, Senator O'Reilly is correct in that regard.  It is also correct that the full machinery of State will be activated to engage with the issues facing these workers.  In my opening statement or somewhere in the questioning, I referenced the group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and the comprehensive involvement of all relevant Government Departments.  Through their various agencies and fora, they are already active on the ground in engaging with the workers, so yes, the full machinery of State is being brought to bear on this to deal with the issues being faced.</p></speech>

Could I assume that workers who want and who need various educational and training opportunities will avail of Athlone Institute of Technology?  Will the Athlone Institute of Technology specifically be marshalled in that regard along with the various educational institutions in the region?  Are any steps being taken to harness it to assist people?  If that is the case, there would need to be very real financial support and logistical support for people to avail of that.  I am just interested to know whether the institute is being marshalled in that regard.  There is a very fine institute there with very high calibre graduates.  I am from that catchment area, and I have a son who is a student there.  It is a wonderful institution.  Is there a partnership or collaboration with the institute to assist the just transition?</p></speech>

Decisions have yet to be made about the disbursement of those funds, but those funds will be made available very quickly to support that re-education and retraining.  Again, I know in the whole-of-Government approach, all relevant agencies and institutions are being marshalled and there would clearly be a role for Athlone IT given its location in the midlands.</p></speech>

I am very strongly in favour or people's rights so that is not an issue.  I wanted to put that on the record for the sake of balance.  We have to protect people rights through this process.  I wanted to establish that that was happening.  I put the following point to our guests and, very respectfully, to my colleagues.  We cannot have it every way.  If we are going to break eggs and make an omelette, we are going to have a difficulty.  We cannot have the green agenda on the one hand and on the other hand expect no dislocation in the process.  We have to protect people and families.  I fit into all these categories and I represent people who fit into these categories and I have family connections with this area.  What I am saying is that we need to get this right.  We are either going to have the green agenda and tackle climate change or not.  If we are going to do so, there is going to be dislocation.  Obviously, we must mitigate and protect people in the process, but we cannot just maintain the <i>status quo</i>and still deal with climate change.  Is that a reasonable proposition?</p></speech>

They have already recognised the fact that peat is gone.  They signed up to that and there is no issue there whatsoever.  The only promises they have had so far have been promises about replacement jobs.  They are vague and uncertain.  We do not know when those jobs will come on stream.  We do not know what pay rates will be paid.  Will people be on the same rate of pay or less?  Will people have trade union rights?  Who will the employers be?  Will the Bord na M&oacute;na workers who have left already, who are about to leave or who are being made redundant be guaranteed those jobs?  We do not know if they will have first choice in respect of those jobs.  In any transition process anywhere in the world where this has worked, replacement jobs are set aside for the workers in the industry affected.  Our fear is that what is going to happen here is that new industries will be set up and the existing Bord na M&oacute;na workforce will be cast aside.</p></speech>

I respect fully the crucial role ICTU has as a major social partner in preventing such a scenario.  That is purely speculative.  I do not want to be blasphemous about the doubting Thomas story in the gospel.  We cannot just create evidence of the jobs in the morning.  All there can be is earnestness of intention to create them.  It is ICTU's role as part of the trade union movement to ensure, and to be a crucial social partner in making sure, there are bona fides in this area.  I think there are bona fides.  Those who want to tackle climate change recognise one has to tackle the corollaries and the unintended consequences.</p><p>Would Mr. Doyle accept my point that there is no evidence yet of a lack of bona fides?</p></speech>

They are all in transition.  It is not like a seven-year economic plan where we deal with it as we go along.  ICTU is the crucial social partner dealing with this, and it has to be dealt with.  Anybody who properly represents people and has respect for people is not for a moment suggesting there be a diminution of people's rights or a diminution of opportunity and believes that every citizen counts.  My difficulty is that I cannot see how we can expect nirvana and a sort of <i>deus ex machina,</i>that almost everything will be put right and we will deal with climate change at the same time.  If we are going to make an omelette, we have to break eggs and it is going to be a painful and difficult process.  We have to have faith in each other.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

Would the commission, as proposed, have the power to direct a public or private company to carry out particular actions as long as those actions were in relation to the just transition?  Are those powers limited or unlimited?  That is the sense I am getting from one of the critiques of this Private Members' Bill.</p></speech>

That would be a fundamental concern.  I refer to the just transition commissioner and some of the concerns.  Leaving aside the industrial relations matter, which is, as has been mentioned, part of another structure, are the witnesses confident that having Mr. Mulvey co-ordinate this overarching strategic vision for this just transition, which is in this early phase, will deal with that and with every facet to ensure we protect not only the Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB workers, but future workers?

We felt it was better as a mediation service.  Section 37 states that where the commission has attempted to resolve a dispute referred to it under this section and such conference or the employment of those other means has not resulted in a resolution of the dispute, the commission shall notify the parties to the dispute and the Minister of writing of the fact.  There is a reference back to Government at every stage and not a compatibility, and I believe that is appropriate because, as I said, this is a piece of a jigsaw which encourages long-term planning, partnership and engagement with all stakeholders.  It is not a super authoritative stroke of a pen outlining what one shall do.  This is what we need.</p> <p>  I refer to the variety of circumstances in which this could be deployed.  I was just thinking about this in terms of where we started today.  We started with the chairman of EirGrid, who is the former Secretary General of the Department, coming in.  The committee will likely agree his one key message, in terms of its work, was that more than anything else what it needs is to bring community together, to bring people along and to engage in an innovative stakeholder mediation process.  That was his main message.  That is a perfect example.  The need to develop our grid is a critical piece of climate infrastructure.  We have seen how it can go wrong and how it is difficult for companies sometimes to manage that mediation process with communities and-or workers.</p> <p>  We started today with a really good example of how this piece of mediation architecture could and should work.  As I said, we are going to have to come back to other pieces of the jigsaw before the Government makes a decision on whether it will issue a money message or not, because it seems clear we have a majority in the Oireachtas supporting this on Second Stage and, I hope, on Committee Stage.  We need that review from NESC by the end of the year as it would be very useful.  As I understand from Mr. Carroll, it would include an example of other areas where this sort of mediation service or a just transition commission could be deployed.  It would very useful because we would have a better idea of what has happened in the midlands in terms of this.  It is very clear, as we heard last week, that resolution of this difficulty in the midlands is not something that can wait months.  It has to be resolved within weeks.  If we can come back early in January or whatever appropriate date-----</p></speech>

I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming.  The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with stakeholders on the provisions of the Retention of Records Bill 2019.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne; Ms Eileen Molloy; Ms Mary Harney; Dr. Mary Lodato; Ms Catriona Crowe; Dr. Fred Logue of FP Logue Solicitors; Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, lecturer in human rights law at NUI Galway; and Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley, lecturer in history at NUI Galway.  I will invite witnesses to make brief opening statements - a maximum of three minutes - that will be followed by an engagement with members.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne to make her opening statement.  </p></speech>

In 2000, Christine and I founded the Christine Buckley Centre to provide education and support to survivors.  Though, sadly, Christine is no longer with us, I continue to provide support both at the centre and through my outreach work.</p> <p>  The State&rsquo;s apology to victims in 1999, though meaningful at the time, is being undermined by this Bill.  The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was established to "address the continuing effects of child abuse".  From my experience and contact with survivors, I believe the Bill is likely to cause practical, emotional and psychological problems for survivors.  It also recommended that "the lessons of the past should be learned" and that the acknowledgement by the State and the religious orders of their failures was only the first step.  Further investigations were and are necessary.  This Bill will not allow such investigations to take place.</p> <p>  The commission also recommended that family tracing services should be continued, and this Bill has the potential to make family reunification more difficult.  The institutions operated a policy of separating siblings, and family visits were discouraged.  Every day in the Christine Buckley Centre we speak to survivors still searching for the truth of their past, their identity and family history.  We also witness survivors finding family members and the joy that brings.</p> <p>  Survivors did not agree to the destruction or sealing of their records when they agreed to participate in the commission and-or when they applied to the redress board.  They want their often harrowing experience of giving testimony to matter and to ensure that this never happens again.  All survivors should have the right to decide for themselves if they would like to access any records relating to them.  It is very important on our healing journey that we are empowered to make decisions and choices, something denied us as children.  Survivors deserve the right to own a copy of their testimony if they want it.  It is important for my children, grandchildren and future generations to understand what happened in Ireland and how thousands survived this very harsh and shameful regime.</p> <p>  In 2002, survivors attended a poignant service at the Grove of Reflection, in Ballygannon Wood, Rathdrum.  Deputy Seamus Brennan, the Government Chief Whip at the time and chairman of the National Millennium Committee, said, "This occasion is an opportunity to salute the bravery of individual victims who were determined to tell their stories and seek justice, and in doing so, shone a light into the dark corners of our past and present."  There is a grove in each province in Ireland that has a seat with the following inscription, "May the future ensure that those most vulnerable will never again endure such pain and deprivation."</p> <p>  I hope all records will be held in an interactive museum along with memorabilia such as the pliers used for making the rosary beads and samples of the types of clothing used throughout Ireland&rsquo;s industrial schools.  As part of the healing journey survivors have written poetry, stories, plays or created artistic pieces and music.  Some of these depict their own personal journeys and the pain they have endured, especially any letters to and from families at the time.  These need to be available to the public and researchers.  I have no problem with my testimony being available to the public.</p> <p>  I believe a museum can help survivors and their families, and this is particularly important given the intergenerational impacts of child abuse.  We cannot forget what happened to the thousands of children who were incarcerated in 200 institutions run by church and State.</p></speech>

As a past resident of an institution for all of my childhood - from 11 months to 16 years - I would like to have my records.  I am speaking for me.</p> <p>  Attending the Residential Institutions Redress Board was a traumatic time for all the survivors with whom I have been in contact.  That is the feedback we have been getting.  We had to reveal our stories to doctors, solicitors, family members, psychiatrists and counsellors.  As that was a requirement for attending the board, it had to be done.  Under normal circumstances, we probably would not have revealed this information, apart from to someone we were comfortable telling it to.  It was difficult to recall our childhood at the best of times.  The members can imagine how exhausting, mentally and physically, it would have been and how it affected us at that time.</p> <p>  One of the most stressful things we had to endure was that it was very difficult to take in the full extent of what was going on.  Any such records - medical reports, psychological reports and more - were often submitted by the solicitor to the redress board without the survivor seeing them.</p><p>It is very important that any survivor who wants to avail of these personal records should have the freedom to do so.  I do not think our personal information can be used in the future as history.  It is our history right now and should be made available to us while we are still alive.  It may give us a much clearer picture as to what actually happened and who we really are.  Most people who were not raised in institutions can apply for their records with much more ease.  Why is it so difficult for us to do the same?  Life was difficult enough for us as children.  Why should we have to fight for what really belongs to us?  It is so wrong.</p><p> I appeal to all members to reconsider their line of discussion about sealing our records for 75 years.  I ask the committee to take into consideration the fact that this is what most survivors want.  We are not responsible either for our past or for the situation in which we find ourselves in respect of this Bill.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

I appeal to the committee as one of the thousands of people who will be directly and seriously affected by the Bill.</p> <p>  I began my search for my personal records in 1965.  I did so through visits and direct correspondence with the mother and baby institution in which I was born in 1949.  Even though I was initially denied information on myself and my mother, I persisted.  In 1967, I received a letter with details of my mother's name and address and other family details.  With this information I was able to trace and contact my mother.</p> <p>  In the 1980s and 1990s, I continued my search for my personal records.  I was granted open access to legal documents and records that show I was illegally fostered at the age of two and a half.  By the time I was five, I was removed from the foster mother and committed by a court to an industrial school until I was 16 years old.  The documents also state that the whereabouts of my mother was unknown, yet according to my mother, the nuns knew exactly where she was.  She had been deported by them to the UK to work in a laundry operated by a religious order.  Department of Education documents revealed that the foster mother had continued to influence the direction of my life.  This went as far as requesting that my detention be extended.  Her request was granted by the Department of Education inspector, contrary to the court order.  I could not have constructed my early life and influencing events without access to personal records.</p> <p>  If we fast forward to 2005 and beyond, under freedom of information legislation, I sought information related to the circumstances of my fostering.  The redacted document I received told me nothing.  The difference between seeking information in the 1960s and seeking it in the 2000s was that my chances went from 80% to 0%.  In effect, were I to begin this search today, it would be impossible for me to receive any of the information I now hold.</p> <p>  When I testified before the Residential Institutions Redress Board I did so in good faith.  I was not informed that my statement was to be sealed for 75 years.  There are absolutely no valid moral or constitutional reasons the testimony of thousands of people and the records of the Ryan commission of investigation should be destroyed or sealed.  If this Bill passes, it will make survivors of the industrial schools invisible once more.  It will create another generation of the disappeared of Ireland.  I ask the committee not to let this travesty of justice continue.</p></speech>

These files belong to them.  The current process for accessing files should be redesigned in consultation with survivors.  The famous section 28, which inhibits survivors' ability to share their experiences, should be repealed.  It is a retraumatising reminder of the authority that church and State held over us.  If they can access their files, survivors will be free to share them with their immediate families.  Deceased survivors' close relatives should also be able to access their files.  These records may allow family members to understand a relative's story when a conversation may be impossible.  Access can have a therapeutic effect by allowing people to come to terms with intergenerational trauma.</p><p> Once access for survivors and families has been secured, the archives must be opened to researchers and the public.  This should be done as soon as possible so that survivors and researchers can work together to enrich the National Archives with oral history.  The history of institutional abuse in Ireland is dominated by the perspectives of the professional classes, including doctors, lawyers and religious orders.  Our files correct this power dynamic.  They tell what happened to us as children.  They also show how we were dismissed and undermined when we applied for redress.</p><p> Survivors can decide for themselves if they want their files to be anonymised or redacted before they are disclosed to others.  Personally, I am proud to be a survivor and would be proud to have my full story in the National Archives.  The proposed 75-year sealing of our files creates cynicism.  It makes it look as if the State is hiding something.  This State has already robbed survivors of so much and profited from our suffering.  It must give us our history and let us share it with the nation.  I understand that our narratives can seem threatening to State bodies and expose them to further scrutiny.  However, survivors still live with shame and secrecy imposed on them.  They urgently need a process of healing and reconciliation, and this requires willingness to confront the past.  Only openness and transparency can help society to take responsibility for its part in the abuse of women and children.  If we do not confront our past, we are condemned to repeat it.</p></speech>

I know legislators are incredibly busy people, but it would be nice to see a few more members of the committee here.  This is very important legislation with significant implications.  I am talking to the committee after members have had the privilege of listening to four survivors of the events described in the records that are proposed to be locked up.  Members have heard their dignified, respectful, compelling and deeply moving testimony.  It is right that they were the first people to testify to the committee this morning.  I will now read my opening statement.</p> <p>  I refer members to the longer statement already circulated to the committee for fuller information on the points I am going to make.  The Retention of Records Bill proposes to withhold from public inspection for 75 years certain State records dealing with the Commission of Inquiry into Child Abuse, the Ryan commission.  The National Archives Act 1986 has served the country perfectly well since its passage as regards the withholding of records from public inspection.  The section of the Act that provides for this allows for officers of Departments, with the consent of the Department of the Taoiseach, to certify that the release of departmental records that are over 30 years old would in certain circumstances be contrary to the public interest, or would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty or a breach of good faith on the ground that they contain information supplied in confidence, or would or might cause distress or danger to living persons.</p><p>Why that is not seen as adequate protection by the proposers of this Bill in unclear.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills in 2015 recommended the use of the National Archives Act, but the Minister turned it down on unspecified grounds.  To put it succinctly, this is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut and it begs the question of why it seems to be required to create an entirely new set of archival legislation when we already have a perfectly good Act in existence that covers the case.</p><p> The committee has heard the survivors tell it what their wishes are.  The only serious attempt to ascertain the wishes of survivors, commissioned by the Department of Education and Skills, is a recent research study that consulted 100 of those who had made submissions to the redress bodies to ascertain their views on the fate of the records, and which resulted in a majority expressing concern at the proposed sealing of the records.  Those who made submissions to the various inquiries should be given copies of their submissions.  This is a glaring gap in both respect for survivors and normal best practice when people are giving testimony to any inquiry.  They should get copies of their own submissions.  Why they have not, nobody has properly explained.  The same should apply to other commissions of inquiry of this sort, particularly the mother and baby homes commission, which is currently in session.</p><p> Administrative records tell us how these organisations worked.  They are currently held in the archives of the Ryan commission, the McAleese committee and the Murphy mother and baby homes commission, and they should be available when they are more than 30 - soon to be 20 - years old.  There are no privacy issues with these records.  It would set an extraordinary precedent if this Bill made it possible for the State, wrongly, to close important archives when it so chooses without recourse to the National Archives Act.</p><p> I have six basic recommendations to make to the committee.  First, there would seem to be no good reason not to use the provisions of existing legislation to preserve, withhold and make accessible these very important records.  Second, information on the desires of those who gave testimony to the Ryan commission and the McAleese committee, and who are currently giving testimony to the mother and baby homes commission, should be gathered to ascertain what they would wish to happen to the records.  Third, copies of submissions made to these bodies should be given to those who made them.  Fourth, administrative records of these bodies should be subject only to the provisions of the National Archives Act and not swept up in this ill-considered attempt to bypass its provisions.  Fifth, a quote for digitisation and redaction of the records should be sought from a reputable IT company, given this is a huge part of the history of our country and these are ways of dealing with sensitive records that would allow scholars to see them, for example.  Beyond a statement from the Minister that it would be prohibitively expensive to do this, we have no other information, so we should find out what it might cost.  Sixth, the elephant in the room is that the records of religious congregations who ran the institutions should be brought under the aegis of the State, either through the National Archives Act or through the establishment of a State-run religious records repository.  Ireland has the opportunity, after these very traumatic events and commissions, to lead the world in terms of preservation and access to records.  However, we cannot do that without the State grasping the nettle of requiring the religious orders to give up their records of these institutions.  I thank committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

I practise in information law and I act for individuals and public and private sector organisations.  In particular, I would like to comment on the handling of personal data which comes within the scope of EU law, the general data protection regulation and the Data Protection Act 2018.  Under the doctrine of primacy of EU law, any national law that conflicts with EU law must be set aside and that is an obligation on public authorities.  Insofar as the Bill would conflict with the data protection regulation, the National Archives, as a public body, would be bound under the treaties to disapply it.  Therefore, some aspects of the Bill, which I will discuss shortly, would in my view not even be binding on the National Archives.  Even under Irish law, it is impermissible to pass legislation that completely seals records.  Under the Constitution, the courts have full and natural original jurisdiction, so the High Court can order access to records.</p><p>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions need to be understood to be without prejudice to data subject rights, including the right of access.  I recommend that the Bill be amended to recognise that any aspects which put records beyond reach are without prejudice to data subject rights.</p><p> I do not believe there is a concept of sealing a record in Irish law.  I did a brief search of the Statute Book but could not find any legislation which dealt with that.  It seems that it will be over and above withholding it from public access.  My fear is that sealing will be interpreted narrowly as meaning no access whatsoever, even internally within the National Archives.  I also fear that it will be interpreted as no access if there is a dispute about access or if there is a subject access request.  This is a weak provision in the Bill.</p><p> As my colleague noted, there is already provision in the National Archives Act to protect particular interests.  In the Freedom of Information Act and the general data protection regulation, GDPR, there are provisions which protect both private and public interests which could be harmed if access was granted.  Again, why are those provisions not suitable to protect the interests that this Bill seeks to protect?</p><p> The Bill could be strengthened by expressly recognising rights of access, as directed by the courts, as rights of data subjects.  There should be ancillary access to give effect to those rights.  The Data Protection Commissioner must be able to order access to personal data and the staff of the National Archives or their contractors must be able to access the archives in order to give effect to those rights.</p></speech>

That is the State&rsquo;s failure to date to ensure truth-telling through the production of both its own State records and the records held by non-State bodies, which relate to the individuals who suffered abuse and the administration of the institutions and the network as a whole.</p> <p>  The failure to produce the records and to house them in an archive where individuals can retrieve their own life and family history, along with where administrative records and voluntarily deposited testimony can contribute to national education, undermines all efforts at reparation.  At the time of the Ryan commission&rsquo;s work, European and international human rights law required that survivors should have had access to the substance of the evidence that the investigation was considering so they could have commented on it and suggested further lines of inquiry.</p> <p>  I have major concerns that the State&rsquo;s investigating practice continues to breach this requirement, a basic one under European international human rights law.  For example, the ongoing mother and baby homes commission is proceeding entirely in private.  Survivors who have requested public hearings of their own evidence have been denied them.  Survivors have no access to any of the evidence being gathered.  They are also being denied a copy of their own transcript of evidence, as well as their own personal records that the commission holds of the death and burial of family members.  As for the McAleese committee&rsquo;s State records relating to the Magdalen laundries, the Department of the Taoiseach is currently holding that entire archive secret, claiming it is holding it for safekeeping and not for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act.  This is the general approach.</p><p>Beyond the right to an effective investigation that survivors of industrial and reformatory schools had at the time of the redress board and the Ryan commission, the secrecy of these records violates other reparation rights.  Without records, personal rehabilitation is gravely hampered.  Without records, revisionism by those who would prefer the past to disappear is a risk, while memorialisation and national education &ndash; basic human rights obligations in this context - are not what they should be.  Without records, accountability is denied.</p><p> We know that Garda investigations into the residential schools were insufficient.  If survivors and their advocates cannot access records or information, they cannot press for investigations or prosecutions.  Due to the passage of time, however, and because of the redress board legal waiver, criminal and civil legal accountability have become less available.  At this point, access to records and national truth-telling is where accountability lies.  It is where dignity lies.  It is a vital measure of justice.</p><p> I recommend that, while work is ongoing to consult on and redesign the Retention of Records Bill, some small but crucial amendments should be made to existing legislation.  I can make these amendments available to committee members later.  I recommend that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 be amended to state explicitly that survivors and relatives of children who died while incarcerated have a right to all personal data held in those archives, including information about how they were treated by others, in the interests of vindicating their right to a remedy and respecting their right to privacy.  I recommend section 28(6) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 be amended to make clear that it does not prohibit survivors from publishing information about their own life experiences.</p><p> I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention in particular to section 3 of our joint submission which explains our understanding of the existing legislative provisions, including that the Ryan commission&rsquo;s archive currently appears to fall within the remit of the National Archives.</p></speech>

The committee would be happy to look at those amendments.  Generally, when we engage with stakeholders, we allow them the opportunity to submit extra information if it is needed.  As we are under time pressure and have a deadline of 12 o&rsquo;clock tomorrow, however, we would need such amendments by this evening.</p> <p>  I call on Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#O00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to meet it today.  I agree with Ms Catriona Crowe&rsquo;s sentiments that this matter is important to academics and will affect how 20th century social and political history is written.</p> <p>  I am a lecturer in history at the National University of Ireland Galway, the president of the Women's History Association of Ireland and the chair of the Irish History Students Association.  I am also the co-PI - co-principal investigator - of the Tuam home oral history project.  As an academic, I have been writing and researching the history of child welfare and institutionalisation in Ireland for over 15 years.  I am a recognised international authority on the subject.</p> <p>  In this brief submission, I wish to speak to the Retention of Records Bill as a historian with an understanding of the role of historians in State commissions and investigations, as well as the opportunities we have to instil the principles of transitional justice, historical justice and historical accountability in regard to the history of residential care.  I also speak as a teacher and supervisor who has struggled with gaining access to bodies of records for my entire career, particularly those from religious orders and, at times due to lack of resources, those in State hands.  As a result, I can see the effect this has on the historical record and on the trust which survivors, academics and the public place in the State and State bodies.</p><p>I therefore argue strongly not for the Bill but for a stronger National Archives that is fully resourced and has the independence and support needed for such a pivotal State institution.</p><p> We are not alone in dealing with these types of histories.  We should view it as an opportunity as opposed to a contentious process.  Members can read in my submission the list of countries I believe we should echo.  Sealing records and denying survivors access to personal records is not an approach that has proved successful elsewhere.  We must learn from international best practice and trust the expertise of academics in Ireland.</p><p> There are appropriate and ethical ways to preserve and give access to different types of records, for example, administrative records, survivor testimonies and private records from religious and other bodies and State or semi-State bodies.  Survivors should be granted immediate access to their personal information if they so wish.  They should be assisted and not resisted in this regard.  The remaining records should be subjected to the rules in the National Archives legislation.  As others have said, the National Archives Act 1986 is suitable and appropriate as a legislative basis to deal with the records of Ireland&rsquo;s institutional past.  Resources are an issue for the National Archives and this needs to be addressed at governmental level.  Processes of anonymisation, redaction and ethically informed archival practices are sufficient to address concerns regarding uncontested allegations contained in records.</p><p> I fully support the idea of a National Archives child care-related records advisory board to work in conjunction with the existing National Archives advisory committee and would advocate for the involvement of national and international historical expertise as part of this.</p></speech>

As I said at the beginning of the meeting, each member will have three minutes to ask questions to specific witnesses or in general.  There will then be five minutes to respond.  The member will then have two minutes to wrap up.  We will begin with committee members and the Deputy and Senator present who are not committee members will have an opportunity to ask their questions afterwards.</p></speech>

Rather than making statements, I will go straight to questions to get the most out of the time we have.  There are two common themes in the submissions, which are access for survivors to their own records from the commission report and the preservation of administrative voluntary testimony for historical education and understanding.  This seems to be consistent in all submissions we received, even from people not represented among the witnesses.</p> <p>  The witnesses may want to take note of my questions as I have specific questions for specific individuals.  My first question is for Dr. O'Rourke.  Is it true, as the Minister has said, that the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provided for the destruction of all records?  On Second Stage, the Minister promised to introduce an amendment to the Bill to review its operation after 25 years.  There will certainly be amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies to reduce the 75-year ceiling period.  I hear 30 years being discussed as a compromise.  What are Dr. O'Rourke's views on this?</p> <p>  My next question is for Dr. Logue.  Is it credible that legislation dealing with this level of sensitive personal data without once mentioning GDPR or the Data Protection Act could create a robust legal framework for retaining these records?  Does the definition of personal data under GDPR provide that information about what other people have done to an individual is personal data?  If the Bill is passed and a survivor who makes a data access request is told the retention of records Act has prohibited access to his or her own data, what options for recourse would that survivor have?  What would be the likely outcome?</p> <p>  Will Ms Crowe speak to her practical experience of working under the section allowing the 30-year rule for records under the National Archives Act?  Is she confident the records of the Ryan commission could be adequately dealt with under the section?</p><p>Will Dr. Buckley give us a sense of what we would lose in terms of our historical understanding of this period and the experiences of survivors if these records were sealed for 75 years?</p><p> Ms McDonnell Byrne spoke about the memorialising of records and the failure of the State so far.  We had the site that was meant to be developed in Parnell Square.  What else could the State do to make sure we memorialise and remember the experiences of survivors?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#Q00200"><p>The Senator has asked four specific questions.  There are five minutes overall but because there are four specific questions perhaps everybody will be given two minutes, which will total eight minutes as opposed to five minutes.  The first question was directed to Dr. O'Rourke.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maeve O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#Q00300"><p>The question of whether the legislation, which still exists, that underpinned the Ryan commission and redress board mandated destruction is very important because the Bill is pictured or framed as the best we can do given that the records were supposed to be destroyed.  It states that what we will do instead is preserve them but because we are doing something so different from what was always envisaged, we must seal them.  It is important to ask whether the legislation actually mandated their destruction.  Simply put, as far as I, my two co-contributors and Dr. James Callan in DCU can tell, neither of the Acts stated the records were to be destroyed.  Section 7 of the Retention of Records Bill explicitly deletes the provision of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 that addresses the custody and disposal of its archive in accordance with the National Archives Act 1986.</p> <p>  As far as we understand, it was always envisaged that the Ryan commission's records were to fall within the National Archives Act 1986.  The definition of departmental records in the National Archives Act includes commissions of inquiry.  We did not see anything, including in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, that undid this, until the Retention of Records Bill.  We see in section 7 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 that the commission's records are to be kept in custody or disposed of in accordance with the National Archives Act.  There are also discussions in sections 33 and 34 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000 on transfer of the data provided to the confidential committee.  Nowhere is there mention of destruction.</p> <p>  The Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 does not bring the records within the National Archives, as was the case under the Ryan commission Act, but nor does it mention destruction.  It talks about the redress board and the review committee determining for themselves the disposal of the records.  It is our understanding that disposal could mean destruction but does not necessarily do so.  We find, for example, a definition in the National Archives Act 1986 of disposal in section 9, which states the director of the National Archives may dispose of archives in his or her custody.  According to the section, this means they should be either destroyed or transferred.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fred Logue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#Q00400"><p>To answer the Senator's first question to me, it is of serious concern that there is no mention of how personal data are handled in the Bill.  I alluded to this in my opening statement.  As we have heard from the survivors, there is a very large amount of very sensitive personal data, some of which survivors already cannot access.  There would have to be very specific provisions in the Bill on how personal data are handled in the archive.</p> <p>  To answer the second question, information on what happened or on the experience of people in the institutions is almost certainly personal data.  The definition of personal data under GDPR is broad and means any information about an identified or identifiable individual and by nature of its content, use or effect is linked to those individuals.  It is intended to facilitate fundamental rights.  This means anything about a person's experience, particularly regarding being abused or bad experiences, in these institutions will almost certainly be personal data.</p><p>There was a question about the options open to survivors if they wish to access information.  There is a fundamental right of access to personal data under EU law, under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  What will probably happen if this Bill becomes law is there will be confusion in the National Archives of Ireland, NAI.  Generally, if there is confusion, the public body will err on the conservative side and will start to restrict access to survivors.  That is my experience of what happens in these scenarios.  There will then be a conflict between the individuals and the National Archives of Ireland over access.  There may even be doubt as to whether the archive itself can access its own archive because of the idea of sealing, which is not very well defined.  In the first instance, there will be a dispute over whether they can look at the archive to see whether it contains personal data belonging to a person.  The options available if that dispute cannot be resolved with the NAI is a complaint to the Data Protection Commission, DPC, or litigation.  The DPC will face the same problem as the NAI.  In all likelihood, the NAI will tell the DPC that it is sorry but it cannot access that material and neither can the DPC, which may initiate more litigation at the initiative of either the DPC or the survivor.  One certain thing is that it will delay access.  With no disrespect to survivors, any delay for them will have a significant effect on them accessing their own information. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.447" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catriona Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#R00200"><p>I was asked about my experience with records of this sort in the NAI and there was reference to the National Archives Act.  I will give two examples.  One was the adoption files which were discovered in the archives in 1996, about 2,000 of them, which referred to Irish children who had been adopted in the United States between 1948 and 1972, long after the Adoption Act 1952 came into operation.  Those files were officially in the custody of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and still are.  The Department took back those which had been transferred to the National Archives of Ireland but the proper paperwork, because of the huge deluge of material which came into us in 1990 when the Act came into operation, had not been completed.  The individual case files of each child, who had to get a passport in order to travel to America which is why the files existed in the first place, contain a vast amount of information about the prospective adoptive parents and one piece of paper about the birth mother, giving her name, her address, her age and her signature to a declaration that she will never attempt to contact this child again.  They are heartbreaking documents with very little information about birth mothers but which are hugely important to those who wish to access them.  They should be accessible under freedom of information provisions to anyone who wishes to see them.  I am not sure if that is happening or not.  We retained the administrative records, about two boxes of papers, that tell of how the scheme operated throughout all of those years.  I spent a week going through those files one by one, taking out sheets of paper which had individual names on them, photocopying them and Tippexing out the names, putting the photocopy back in the file and putting the original document back in a separate envelope where they can eventually be reunited with the original files.  That meant that three or four people were able to write books immediately about how the system worked.  This is why we are making such a fuss about administrative records relating to the industrial schools and the other institutions and why the religious archives are so important.  We must be able to know, first as survivors, second as members of the public and third, as historians and academics, how these systems operated in this country over the period they did.</p> <p>  The second example is older.  The miliary service pension files, which number approximately 275,000, deal with people applying for pensions for actions taken during the War of Independence and the Civil War.  They deal with atrocious actions, including murder and all kinds of stuff.  Those records have been open for ten years.  When the testimony was being taken from people who were applying for pensions, they were all given copies of their testimony, which allowed some of the material to get into the public domain before the State's own records were released.  Again, we have a template which deals with very difficult and sensitive material that followed quite a liberal route in terms of access to those who gave testimony.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#S00100"><p>In 2094, and I cannot really comprehend how far away that is, we will lose the history of education in Ireland, the history of religious orders in Ireland, much from women's history, the history of childhood and the history of youth.  We will lose a great deal on the history of social class, as many of those who were sent to the industrial schools were sent because of poverty.  In many ways, we will lose the history of the transition from pre-independent Ireland to independent Ireland.  The industrial schools were part of the prison system but were then transferred to education.  That is really relevant.  I was reminded today that the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, spoke of how we need to include our dark history as part of the junior certificate curriculum.  How can we include this?  How can I, as a researcher, do that when there are huge gaps of administrative records missing to me?  Even today, there are many misunderstandings of what the different institutions did and why they were set up.  The media often confuses Magdalen laundries with industrial schools.  We need more history, not less history.  We are very able to do this work.  We are people who have PhD qualifications or are trained as archivists.  The Oireachtas needs to approach the experts in different fields and ask their advice on this.  There needs to be more consultation and more history.</p></speech>

There has been an argument that if this Bill is not passed next week, all the files will be destroyed.  It is very important that we push back against that narrative,as it will be used to get people to vote in a particular way.  Ms Crowe spoke of how the template exists and there is no reason to recreate how we do this.  We need to ask why that is happening and what is going on that we need a new template for that.  </p> <p>  I asked Ms McDonnell Byrne about memorialisation and how we can ensure that history is respected.  I have visited museums around the world, and there are museums such as the Holocaust museum, that memorialise such important points in history where history is respected and understood.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#S00300"><p>I am very passionate about this.  Mr. Justice Ryan recommended that there would be a memorial but that failed when it went to planning permission.  The question is extremely personal to me.  We were a family of eight and within the first year of being in an institution, I lost two brothers in a drowning accident while they were in an institution not far from Dublin city.  The accident happened in County Donegal.  I carry that with me all the time.  I had met them last on a Saturday morning and by 7.30 p.m. on that Saturday evening, they were dead.  It is so important that we remember the survivors who passed, some of whom have died because of suicide.  When I was given this very traumatic news, the nun in charge thought it was okay to give me a bullseye sweet for each boy who died and then I was told to go and say my prayers.  It has taken me years to grieve.  Imagine, at the age 11, being told that one's two brothers had died and being given a sweet.  That is the way they valued our lives.  We need to remember.  We need a national day for survivors.  It has to be there in our history.  We have it for other parts of our past, whereby 1916, for example, is remembered but this is so important for me.  That is what happened my two brothers, I lost a sister at 50 years.</p><p>Again, this was through institutional care and things that happened to her and I lost another brother at 60.  I am the longest living member of the eight siblings.  The other three are doing okay but they do have medical issues.</p><p> My family is just one family.  All those of us who are survivors are brothers and sisters.  We did not know one another and yet from what I am hearing from the opening statements this morning, we are all speaking from the same position.  We just want to be honoured and not dishonoured or disempowered.  We were so disempowered.  We were the forgotten children and now it looks like we could be the forgotten adults.</p><p> In the centre where I deal with survivors, they are now worrying.  They are thinking "I did get my redress money.  I do not want to spend it because I do not want to go into another institution."  Can we imagine how frightening that is?  That is our history.  We, as survivors, are carrying this shame and we are not the perpetrators.  Should we disclose how much we get, we would be penalised.  If we disclose again, there is a sentence.  Somebody must be held accountable.  There is too much secrecy and too many lies.</p><p> If I was go back now, my evidence to the commission would be very different because I was terrified when I gave it.  Even at that, we do not really get the core of what happened because it was so bad.  Of all the things that happened to me in my life, the redress was the worst.  It related to picking up the pieces up from survivors who came back from it because they had to regurgitate what happened.  Some committed suicide.  The only reason is because we were not believed, which was not right.  These records are filed away.  They have gone into a black abyss, never to be seen again.  As a survivor, I appeal to the committee to listen to what we have to say, give us a choice and at least ask us "Yes", "No" or "Maybe".</p><p> Over recent years, I have seen survivors evolve from those who did not want to be in photographs.  We saw it last year with honouring the Magdalen ladies.  One woman had attended my centre for years and I did not know she was a Magdalen lady.  I knew she had been in an institution and, of course, a Magdalen laundry was another institution.  She was carrying that shame.  When I met her, she was so embarrassed that she said "Oh please don't tell anybody you saw me."  This woman is in her 60s.  Why are we carrying shame.  I am 64.  Why, along with every other survivor, am I carrying this pain for the rest of my days?  This is why a memorial should be inclusive.  I know today's session is about the Bill but that is all I have to say.</p></speech>

What is happening is that the data controllers are liberally redacting much of the information.  I think one of the other witnesses showed an example of what they are getting.  The problem is that some of the Irish legislation such as the Bill is being drafted in a way that makes automatically incompatible with EU law.</p><p>Irish public authorities are not really embracing their duties under EU law to disapply national law that conflicts with EU law.  What happens then is that they will follow the national law and not disapply the EU law, which then leads to a dispute that goes to the Data Protection Commissioner.  That goes into a procedure that can take years to resolve.  Meanwhile, somebody who has a right to his or her information must go through this very long and technical process to get something to which he or she is entitled as a right.  </p></speech>

I think there is a significant need for consultation with international experts who have overseen completely different approaches in Finland, Canada, Australia and the UK.  Scotland is key as well.  My recommendations today are immediate.  I have brought some amendments that I believe could be enacted immediately within other items of legislation.  They are to undo those problematic approaches to data protection mentioned by Dr. Logue under the two Acts.  Under the Data Protection Act 2018, sections 188 and 193 were introduced to say that whereas previously there was no right to personal data access from the Ryan commission or redress board, because of GDPR those bodies can give personal data access if they believe it would not contravene their functions.  I have said that these provisions need to be amended to make clear that someone does have a right to personal data.  The two data access provisions are identical under the Acts of 2000 and 2002 but it seems they are being interpreted completely differently.  From speaking to people, it seems that nobody is being given his or her transcript by the Ryan commission.  People are being given some data by the redress board even though the law says the exact same thing about GDPR rights, which is that they are restricted but not entirely.  I am saying we should amend it next week to say that everybody has the right to his or her personal data unredacted with the same applying to family members of children who died incarcerated.</p></speech>

In respect of arguments that amendments need to be made to that, it has been quite sufficient since 1986.  I do not understand how this came about.  I have not seen a proper explanation for it so I am arguing that there should be more resources for the National Archives and that we can tackle this and go forward positively but I do so as a non-legal expert.</p></speech>

It is an honour and privilege to hear their testimony and I thank them for giving it to us.  I am sure it is very painful having to go through all this again.  I thank them most sincerely for their contributions.  On a more general point, it is past time that the State took the blanket off this issue and shone a good bright light on what happened.  Until such time as this happens and we lance this boil, we cannot move on and will continue to walk around in circles.</p> <p>  Either Ms Molloy, Ms Harney or Ms McDonnell Byrne can answer my next question.  What would it mean to them to have total access to all records relating to them?  How would that help them in terms of their healing?  The next question is directed to Dr. Logue, and perhaps to Dr. O'Rourke as well.</p><p>If this Bill passes as it currently exists without any amendments, what will the net effect be in lay person's language?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen Molloy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#V00200"><p>For me, personally, it would open up my past.  I do not know if any of the committee have ever lived in a haze about something that happened, when they were supposed to be there but were not there, and it was not until afterwards that the reality of the matter hit them.  We do not have that.  We just went through the motions.  We were told by the redress board what was required of us.  Some solicitors went and got the information without consulting the survivors and gave it directly to the redress board because most of the survivors could not cope.  I ran a support group for survivors in Tralee.  We had to go personally to the redress board with some of the survivors because they just could not handle it, and we barely could ourselves.</p> <p>  I have a family of five - three girls and two boys.  I have five grandchildren.  The personal information is a particular concern.  I was very moody when I got married.  I do not know how my husband put up with me, but he did.  We were talking about this recently.  My family knows a lot about where I came from but they do not know everything.  I feel it would give them a better understanding as to why I was moody.  They would cut me some slack sometimes.</p> <p>  I believe many survivors who went through the same thing might be able to open up more to their families with a clearer understanding of where they came from.  When we went through the Ryan commission and the redress board, some hid that trauma from their families.  They just could not open up and tell about it.  This might be the door that we need to go through, and as somebody said, we can just reveal everything and deal with it.  We are pushing on in years.  I do not want to die without knowing the answers.  If the answers are going to be locked up for 75 years, my children will most likely not see them and I do not know if my grandchildren will.  I really do not think the Oireachtas should deny us this.  It is a human right.  We are not statistics but human beings.</p></speech>

At least, that is the core of what truth and reconciliation commissions are about.  Without that truth, as Senator Gallagher said, we cannot move forward.  I am 70.  My mother is dead.  My uncle, who was also institutionalised, is dead.  I am the last of the line, as it were.  I have two half-sisters but I am the last of that particular family.  When I first held my birth certificate in my hand, I jumped up and said that I am someone.  Until that point, I did not know because my name had been changed when I first went in there.  It was then changed back again.  I was told that my mother was dead and it was a lie.  We were lied to and now, when we try to apply for our records, many barriers are in our way.</p> <p>  We are the ones who had to be psychoanalysed before we went to the redress board and who had to get testimony from doctors.  I had to go to a doctor who had to say how my nose was so battered and how my jaw is the way it is.  They kept asking if I was sure I was not in a car accident.  I was not.  I was beaten.  We all go through that, trying to find out what happened.</p><p> I ended up in hospital with a kidney complaint when I was about five years of age.  There is no record of that.  There is no record of the woman who fostered me going to the county for money to support me.  There is no record of me being in my first school.  These records have gone and we do not know where.  I have searched.  I wonder about other records and I wonder, when I ask the people whom I went to see, how Ireland is not a nation destroyed by fire.  I cannot tell the committee how many records offices had fires in the 1950s.  We do not know where the records are.</p><p> My mother died not knowing a lot about her past.  We had this healing bond of me knowing and getting the information.  We were a strength to each other.  We were not very close because a mother's bond with a two and a half year old baby cannot be put back once the baby has been taken away, but relationships and memories that are healthy can be created.  I have one photograph of me when I was five.  If we were to go to a party where we were asked to bring our baby photographs, we could not because we do not have them.  Our memories were wiped for us and we are now asking if we can have them back.</p><p> I am currently applying to the Residential Institutions Redress Board, RIRB, for information.  I accept that I have to go to a solicitor to prove who I am.  The most important document that I have to produce for the RIRB is my utility bill.  Every time we apply, we have to have a utility bill.  What does that prove?  What is it about?  These are the kinds of nonsensical barriers that are put up.  This redacted information was given to me because I asked why the ISPCC officer came to take me away from this woman who had fostered me and took me to court.  I do not know what happened and I will never know because it is redacted and I will not get it back.  We are referred to as "it" in some of these documents, with questions such as how long a person has had "it", when asking about the child.  The questions also ask if the child is illegitimate.  We have to look at all of these things, if we ever get any information.  Please do not traumatise us any more.  Please let us have our records.</p></speech>

I have seen applications made to the redress board already and I have also seen responses.  The redress board is reminding us of the gagging order in no uncertain terms.  That is a threat, as far as I am concerned.  I do not take lightly to threats, nor do any of us.  We were threatened all our lives.  Some of us have come away from it and we need to move on rather than backwards.  It is mean and nasty.  I applied and I got no such letter, not because I am vocal about it, but obviously somebody pulled the board up on this and it has decided to take this away.  It is not nice.</p></speech>

It is mysterious.  The ostensible motivation would be presumably to protect the names of people who were accused but not convicted that may show up in some of the statements made by our eloquent friends here.  That is a matter that is easily dealt with by redaction.  It is not a problem.  It should not put anyone out.</p> <p>  A more sinister interpretation would be, and Dr. Buckley made the point earlier on, that the overwhelming majority of those who went into these institutions were poor.  I do not want to get into a long discussion about class in Ireland but it is of interest that a certain cohort of citizens can be dealt with differently from everybody else.  That is sinister.  We have archival legislation that is perfectly adequate, as I think we have all demonstrated this morning to the committee, to deal with this matter sensitively and appropriately.  Why do we need something new for a particular cohort of citizens?</p> <p>  It is also likely that this is paving the way for this Bill, if it becomes and Act, which I sincerely hope it does not, to become a way of dealing with other similar kinds of records.  The one that is most evident at present is the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and Certain Related Matters, which represents the same kind of survivors and the same kind of need for people to see their records.</p> <p>  It would be lovely if we could just flip this.  What is wrong with this country that we cannot understand the eloquent statements of the sort that we have just heard from Ms Molloy and Dr. Lodato about what happened to people and make them the centre of our law-making?  Why are we constantly coming up against situations where ordinary citizens are treated badly and they must go through hell and high water to get redress for the problems they have?</p> <p>  Surely these people here should be at the centre of what we are doing about this extraordinary period in our history.  There is an atrocious record of treatment of children and woman at a certain time.  Can they not be put at the centre of this?  If they were, we would be seriously listening to them, consulting them far more than the derisory level of consultation that has taken place by the Department to date, and taking on board what they say their needs are.  There are ways of protecting people.  There are ways of giving them everything that they require.  It seems unbelievable that we are still at the stage where we cannot say, "Of course, you can have your records."</p></speech>

What is behind it is power and the issue of accountability, and the State not wanting to accept any.  We talk about redress.  We hear a great deal about redress.  What redress means is not airy-fairy from a human rights perspective and in hard law, according to the European Court of Human Rights interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights, which Ireland ratified in 1953 and which, one would imagine, might be the interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court if anybody was ever able to get to court but which, without records and with the Statute of Limitations, he or she cannot.</p> <p>  The right to redress is not only about money.  For massive human rights violations involving torture, arbitrary detention - we also see this in many of the other institutions, and this will serve as a model, which is my massive concern too - violations of the right to life, where people die in institutions and nothing is known of their fate or whereabouts or they are separated from family members, redress means accountability, ideally, in court.  It means truth-telling.  It means national, public truth-telling, not just truth-telling to the person individually.  Again, that is something that is clear in European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence.  Where there have been systematic and gross human rights violations, the right to truth is not just a very important right of the individual, it is also a societal right, because it is connected to another element of the right to redress, which is guarantees of non-repetition and education of state personnel.  The reason people have spoken out and the reason everybody is here today is for dignity, to feel that they matter and to make sure that it does not happen again.</p><p> It was asked what the net effect of this would be.  It would be a massive ongoing violation of human rights, a risk that this is now how all of the records of the mother and baby homes commission of investigation will be dealt with, and a risk that the Department of the Taoiseach thinks it is okay to continue to hold all of the records from State bodies relating to the Magdalen laundries, even though I cannot see the legal reason for that and they should be in the National Archives.  Ultimately, it would be a massive risk that we do not learn what is in, unfortunately, our national DNA, not that we are that different from anybody else, but that we do not learn how institutionalisation works, how massive discrimination against certain groups and socio-economic difference is exploited, and the types of things that we are doing still today that we choose not to stop because we refuse to deal with the entire 20th century habits that we had.</p></speech>

We have all been very moved, in particular, by Ms Harney's contribution when she said that their memories have been wiped and when she asked for them back.  It was incredible.  I cannot begin to understand what they have been through in terms of the abuse in residential institutions.</p> <p>  At the beginning of the contributions, Dr. Lodato stated how she was proud to be a survivor.  She spoke of the journey that she travelled to be proud to be a survivor and stated that she wants her full story in the National Archives.  We must listen to survivors on that journey to healing.  We have a role as a State to help them on that journey to healing.  Ms McDonnell Byrne stated that it is important on their healing journey that they are empowered to make decisions and choices because that is something they were all denied as children.  It is obvious that openness and transparency are essential parts of that healing.</p> <p>  My question for Dr. Buckley is an expansion on what Senator Gallagher was asking.  In some way, is this Bill about the Department of Education and Skills protecting itself?  Will Dr. O'Rourke and Dr. Buckley expand or give us some details on how other jurisdictions that Dr. O'Rourke mentioned have dealt with this sensitive issue?  Will Dr. Buckley take us through how it would be possible to categorise different types of records appropriately or how could they be appropriately anonymised or redacted, if that was needed?</p></speech>

On the motivation, and the questions are connected, all we can say as a group is that these two commissions relate to the Department of Education and Skills.  This Bill is not addressing the McAleese report.  It is addressing two commissions that relate to the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  I do not know what is in the archive.  I would love to know what is in it.  That would be really good.  Many of the records relate to the Department of Education and Skills.  That is a critical point for the committee.  This, to me, as a historian, is very important.  There are administrative records that it is possible we will not get access to after 20 years, which we should.  That is problematic.</p> <p>  When it comes to the international context, I will briefly mention Canada and Switzerland and then Dr. O'Rourke can come in with some other examples.  I have had the pleasure of dealing with the chair of the two Swiss commissions.  There are 40 academics - historians, sociologists and archivists - working on one of those.  They have as much access as they want.  They laughed at a conference when I explained how difficult it is to get certain access, particularly to private archives.  This is problematic.  They have done a full disclosure, it appears to me.</p><p> In Canada, as Dr. O'Rourke and her colleagues have written in their submission, confidentiality was initially part of the discussion.  Canada went back to survivors and now it is 15 years.  I do not know why we cannot understand a passage of time has occurred.  Some opinions have changed.  Survivors, thankfully, are more vocal, as are their advocates.  Now we need to have our plan for 2019.</p><p> On the processes that would need to happen, and I might refer some of this to Ms Crowe, we have expertise in understanding a different type of record.  At present, what should happen in the Departments of Health and Education and Skills and other Departments is that records should be transferred after 20 years and I should be able to access them.  That is not always the case, and I am sure other researchers would agree.  If that is due to resources, we must address that.  To my mind it is not a question of needing more legislation.</p><p> One can use redaction, although it is costly.  One can choose, with legal advice, which records can be released.  I cannot understand why survivors do not get their personal records immediately.  We should take the opportunity to form this archive.  It would be a body of records that could define some of our historiography over the next 20 to 50 years.  This t is a big opportunity and we should not be fighting it.</p></speech>

The written joint submission from me, M&aacute;ir&eacute;ad Enright and Dr. Sin&eacute;ad Ring, as well as Dr. James Gallen's submission, detail some of the comparative practice.  We are always available and may well send further information to the committee by this evening.</p> <p>  It is important to look at Scotland and the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, IICSA, in the UK.  That is the UK's ongoing historical institutional child sexual abuse inquiry.  It is much more liberal.  As the inquiry is taking place many documents are produced to survivors.  They work in groups with the legal team and are then able to suggest questions to the inquirer based on all the documents that are coming in.  They participate in the inquiry in the first instance, which is their basic right under the European Convention on Human Rights and other international human rights treaties.  When such serious things happen to somebody, the person's right to an investigation is a right to an effective investigation that safeguards the person's rights to the extent possible and involves the person.  Unfortunately, we have not had that.  However, one can deduce that because records have been produced in the course of the investigation they are therefore available after it too.  It would be interesting for the committee not just to speak to people but also to look at detailed legal documents such as the protocol on redaction that the IICSA uses in the UK in the child sexual abuse inquiry and how and where to redact records that it is producing to the survivors' legal teams, which would be available to the public in the future.  For example, if somebody has been convicted, the person's name can be released or the person is so notorious that there would be no point in redacting the person's name.  Another question is whether the person is an employee.  There are different approaches to whether to redact.</p> <p>  The Stasi files archive is an interesting example because it operates in Europe under the GDPR.  A group of us here today and other colleagues are meeting in December in NUI Galway to look at drafting the legislation we would like to establish an annex to the National Archives of care related records.  Somebody is coming from the Stasi files archive in Berlin to tell us how things work there and how it manages to be compliant with the GDPR so people can access their personal data about what was done to them during that period of time.  We will find out more about general public access to archives as well.</p> <p>  Finland's national child abuse inquiry will make its anonymised archives available for historical research.  In Australia, thousands of anonymised narratives constructed from testimony to the private sessions are published on the Australian royal commission's website.  I will not say more, but we might supplement what we have written with more by this evening.</p></speech>

It is quite humbling to hear them.</p><p>Much has been asked and answered today but I refer to what the Department of Education and Skills said about this legislation.  It said its aim is to strike a balance between those who gave evidence to the commission and redress bodies against the need to ensure that as a society we never forget the harm that was done to children and the need to ensure that the protection of children is always to the forefront of our minds.  I reiterate what Ms Mary Harney said this morning: "If this Bill passes, it will make survivors of the industrial schools invisible once more."  I believe Ms Harney.  It is quite stunning.  I was struck by the comment about power and accountability.  She is absolutely right.  It is important to make the point that this is still going on.  It is not as if the State has held its hands up and said what happened then was awful.  It is still not holding its hands up.</p><p> We need a Bill.  Ms Crowe put it very well when she said we need the records of religious congregations who ran the institutions to be brought under the aegis of the State, either through the National Archives Act or through the establishment of a State-run religious records repository.  Why are we not doing that?  I am not being flippant in asking that question.  We know from the testimony this morning that we should be doing more for the survivors, yet the Department of Education and Skills has produced a Bill which, effectively, will silence them once more.  My question is for all the witnesses, but I will start with Ms Crowe.  Why does she think the State has not sought to open access to the religious records, given all that has happened to date?  Why have successive Governments not acted on that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.497" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catriona Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#AA00200"><p>One reason is that the Roman Catholic Church has had disproportionate power in this country from Catholic emancipation in the 19th century up to very recently.  The overhang of that power might still be affecting how our bureaucrats see things.  However, there is more involved.  There is the adamantine determination of the religious orders not to make their records available if they can avoid it, with some honourable exceptions.  They do not accept that, effectively, they comprised a shadow state, particularly in respect of welfare matters for women and children.  The State willingly handed over its responsibility for the welfare of vulnerable children and women to religious orders, who willingly took it on and were paid for it.  A strong argument can be made, perhaps a legal argument although I cannot be sure as I am not a legal scholar, that these are State records.  They are State records because these are State responsibilities being carried out on behalf of the State by religious orders, and they should be turned over to the State, archived and made accessible in the right way.</p> <p>  I stated earlier that we could lead the world in this.  We have come through a unique set of commissions of inquiry, and we are in the middle of one at present, and they will produce extraordinary testimony of wrongdoing, bad behaviour and State absolution of itself in terms of looking after vulnerable women and children.  We also have the records of the religious communities.  We could put all of those together, along with court records, police records and all the material the wonderful people with me would wish to see.  There are many records.  There are also the records of the ISPCC, on which Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley is an expert.  Could we put all of them together in one place and make it a world-leading repository in terms of preservation of, and access to, records dealing with women and children in a newly independent State in the 20th century that is finding its feet, with a disproportionate amount of power, as we all know now, given to a particular religious denomination?  That is what my dream would be and I believe it would be the dream of the survivors here.  It would be everything that they might need, as well as what we as citizens and scholars need, to establish exactly what happened in all these places and why over a long period.</p><p>I doubt we will see it, but it is something to aim for.  Regular top-level talks take place between the Government and the churches, including particularly the Catholic Church.  I have recommended several times to the people who control those talks that they put the issue of what should happen to the religious records on the agenda.  So far it has not appeared.  Unfortunately, there is no great appetite on the part of the State to raise this issue either.</p></speech>

The State and the people who were in charge who it deemed necessary to raise us - loosely said - in the institutions are the perpetrators, not us.  Why do we have to beg for what is rightfully ours?  No other member of society has to do it.  Why do we?  We are no different.  We are human beings.  I cannot get that through enough.  We are human beings at the end of the day.  As I said earlier, I will die before the 75 years have elapsed, as will my children and grandchildren.  Why is the State doing this to us?  I would love to get a clear answer on that.  I am not legally minded or politically minded; I am just an ordinary simple person.  I should be given it in my language so that I can understand.  I do not think I will be happy with the answer, but that is what I really feel.  It needs to be brought down to our level.</p></speech>

It comes back to power and accountability.  It is shocking to hear that the State has never even requested that the issue of access to those records be part of those high-level discussions.  What does that tell us about the Departments?</p> <p>  I wish to clarify that Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to the Bill.  I will be opposing it.</p></speech>

The advice given by successive Attorneys General has been that a promise was made and a commitment was entered into at the time the then Minister for Education and Science, Michael Woods, did a deal with the religious orders.  I have raised the matter continually over the years.  The answer that has always been forthcoming, including at Government meetings, has been that a promise was given about the destruction of the records.</p> <p>  This morning's contributions, particularly by the lawyers, Dr. O'Rourke and Dr. Logue, have has been very helpful.  Freedom of information legislation, which is very strong in Ireland, the Data Protection Commission and GDPR all emphasise the right of individuals to their records over and above, as I understand it, what rights the State may have.  However, in this respect there is what is sometimes called in America a deep state, where a set of attitudes has rolled on as an inheritance from what happened in the institutions and what happened to children in different circumstances, who for one reason or another became institutionalised.  I do not think that those arguments will be easily let go.</p> <p>  I have been surprised at times to meet people many years younger than I am who still believe and certainly put forward the argument that as a promise was made, the promise needs to be kept even if I and many other people might believe it was an invalid promise because the people about whom it was made were never consulted.</p> <p>  Other people, particularly lawyers, tell me that the legislation we have in Ireland is very robust.</p><p>That should be summarised so that that argument is made to people who are making decisions about the legislation at the moment.  The proposed legislation should be stalled; perhaps it is entirely unnecessary.  I have an open mind about it.</p><p> We have seen the emergence of the 125 or 130 fraudulent or falsified birth certificates, which is probably only the tip of the iceberg.  Since GDPR came in, Tusla is absolutely refusing to give any information.  I have attended meetings with the Minister and with other Members of the Oireachtas at which it has reiterated that refusal.  At some of the meetings when, for instance, the issue of birth mothers came up, representatives of Tusla have said to people like me, "Our birth mothers", meaning that in an institutional sense the birth mothers are being minded by Tusla.  One of the protections it is offering to birth mothers is that their children will not have access to data when in practice most - although not all - have been quite amenable to information sharing and to information being made available, which is not the same as contact.</p><p> What has been said this morning is very important.  Do the witnesses believe that the powers they mentioned under the National Archives Act, the freedom of information legislation, GDPR and the Data Protection Commission are strong enough to address these issues?  Do those powers mean that this new legislation, which is being offered as a must-do alternative on the basis of the promises made as part of the Michael Woods deal, is not particularly necessary? </p></speech>

On a more serious note, it is obvious that a politician can make a promise that is against the law.  We are talking today about a draft Bill, which in our view is against the law.  Destroying the records or putting them beyond reach for a very long time has more or less the same effect on the people who are alive today.  I believe both courses of action would be against the law.  The structure of the GDPR, and even that of the Freedom of Information Act, allows for rights to be balanced against each other.  If there is a public interest reason for restricting access to information, there is sufficient architecture in the GDPR to allow that to happen.  The Legislature has to do it through very specific legislation that meets the standard of the GDPR.  It cannot just pass a law stating that people cannot have access and that is the end of it.</p> <p>  In response to Senator Gavan, I say it might strike a balance, but the balance is zero for the survivors and 100% for the State.  Technically that is a balance, but GDPR requires that where a balance is to be struck, any restriction on rights must be strictly necessary to meet a public interest objective.  There must be evidence to show that that objective will be met.  One cannot just say, "We have struck the balance and that is the balance that will be struck."  The law sets constraints on that.</p> <p>  I believe that the Bill should not be passed and that we should rely on the Freedom of Information Act, the National Archives Act and GDPR.  However, if the Legislature believes that particular interests need to be protected in the public interest, then much more work needs to be done in crafting restrictions on rights that meet the standard of European human rights law.  Article 23 of the GDPR sets out how to go about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Maeve O'Rourke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#DD00100"><p>My personal view, based on how difficult it is for someone to use the GDPR against a State body without any explicit legislation that helps to do so and without any legal or advocacy assistance, is that we could do with an access to records Bill.  It seems to us that the National Archives Act 1986 brings the Ryan commission archive within its scope.  Apparently there are 2 million documents in that archive which seemingly already falls within the scope of the National Archives Act.  A lot of material still in Government Departments that relates to all of the institutions currently falls under the National Archives Act.  We have to ask, however, what it will take for the appropriate resources to be given to the National Archives to make operational all of their obligations.  Under that Act, it is envisaged that the director could work with the Ryan commission and operationalise the Act and could do what should have been happening over the decades in all of our institutions and all Departmental records relating to them that are now over 30 years old.  I will defer to Ms Crowe and Dr. Buckley in that regard.  It may be that legislation is required to set up the compartment of the National Archives with the advisory committee that receives everything and that then brings the funding that is necessary.  I would make the point to politicians and the Government specifically that memorialisation was the number one recommendation of the Ryan commission.  It was also a recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke in respect of the Magdalen laundries.  Money was supposedly designated to implement these recommendations so, in theory, that money should be available.</p> <p>  In terms of the Freedom of Information Act, this goes to whether the promise could possibly have been made, particularly in respect of the Ryan commission.  During my research I noticed that until 2014 the Freedom of Information Act applied to the Ryan commission under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000.  In 2014, in an appendix to the Act which was practically impossible for anybody to notice, the definition of "public body" was stated now to exclude the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, demonstrating that previously it had included it.  Now it was to exclude it except for its own records of its own administration.  That goes to that promise but it also shows that there may be an issue now with the Freedom of Information Act not being sufficient.  It also indicates, although I will defer to Dr. Logue on this, that the records are older than freedom of information legislation and there may be issues around the extent to which the legislation actually applies to them, so there may be a need to strengthen that.  </p> <p>  On GDPR, as I have said already, the rights need to be put explicitly in legislation.  There is an immediate need to amend the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act and the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 to say that people have an express right.  Ideally, the legislation would provide for a right to advocacy assistance.</p></speech>

It is open to the Legislature to restrict the rights of religious institutions or members of the congregations.  The GDPR recognises historical research and archiving as a public interest that can justify restricting data subject rights in that context.  We are having the same conversation, as Deputy Burton knows, about access to adoption information for adopted people.  It is open to have greater access than the default that would be provided under the Freedom of Information Act or GDPR in the interests of survivors and in the interests of historical research and having a good archive.</p></speech>

Perhaps Ms Crowe might be able to answer it.  The threat to people who are in government was that if there is not some legislation like this, the imperative would be to destroy the records.  There has been a genuine fear on the part of many, given what people with particular views in this area have done in the past.  Does Ms Crowe think realistically that today, in the event of there being no legislation, there could be a view in the Department or the Office of the Attorney General that there is an imperative to destroy the records?  That is part of the reason legislation like this has been offered.  It is not that people intend to be destructive but they have been told and advised that the records may be destroyed in the absence of legislation.  That is the kind of gun that is put to people's heads.  Could people in the relevant Departments decide that they should implement what was seen to be in the deal?  It was not just a promise.  It was an agreement between the then Government and the then Minister.  It was not reflected in law but it was certainly widely broadcast across the country.  People like Ms McDonnell Byrne and the late Christine Buckley, who is sadly not here today, would have all been told that unless there is a structure, the records can all be destroyed.  I would just like to ask Ms Crowe about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catriona Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019112600002#EE00100"><p>It was not an intelligent promise to make in the first place and it was done without consultation with the people whom it was going to most affect.  However, that does not mean that it stands.  Dr. O'Rourke's submission, which I commend to everyone to read in its entirety, is the best account we have of the legislation.  She has painstakingly gone through how everything was constructed.  Her submission seems to me to put that issue to rest in the sense that the word "destruction" is not mentioned anywhere while the word "disposal" is.  "Disposal" has been taken to mean destruction in archival terms over the years but this is not the case in the context of the National Archives Act.  It is a separate thing.  That argument can easily be made.  In any case, there is nothing to say that people cannot change their minds.  Scaremongering about this is ridiculous.  Again, we are back to this point - what we need to do is consult the survivors.  Only 100 survivors have been consulted so far by the Department out of all the people who gave evidence.  We have Revenue Commissioners and a Department of Social Protection that can contact any citizen at any time they like.  It cannot be beyond the bounds of the Department of Education and Skills to get a proper consultation system into operation that finds out what the feelings of survivors are around destruction and preservation, whether we should open the records now or keep them for 75 years or whatever the case may be.  We need to know what they actually think.  So far we have heard today from four people who want the records to be open, certainly to themselves.  When we go further and start to look and see what else happens, that is it.  They have to be at the centre of it.</p> <p>  There has been scaremongering about destruction of the records.  I had discussions with a number of officials in the Department of Health and Children as it was then known about the necessity to keep these records for posterity, not to speak of the pressing need for survivors to have access to them.  The issue is a paper tiger really and it needs to be removed.  The Department of Education and Skills, however, has a disgraceful record in terms of destroying its own records before the National Archives Act of 1986 came into being.  I am not saying I would not put anything past it; that would be very wrong and I do not wish to attribute bad motives to anybody.  If the Department were to attempt to go ahead and destroy these records, there would be a national outcry the like of which we have not seen.  Everybody now knows how important this material is so I do not think that is going to happen.</p></speech>

We should not have what would effectively be a second wave of indemnity whereby mistakes would be dug in further by a sealing of the records.  That point is important.  I agree with Dr. Logue that GDPR is not a thing we use to look at legislation after the fact.  It is now prevailing law so we cannot legally draft legislation that conflicts with it, no more than with the Constitution which reaffirms our commitment to enforce that European law.  It certainly is not a fix that individuals should have to try to use after the fact.  It must apply at the design stage of any legislation and this legislation does not meet GDPR standards.</p> <p>  An argument was made which seems to me most disingenuous.  I refer to the idea that we would have a gagging order to silence women and stop them talking about their experiences and that we would then say we have balanced out their interests and are choosing to speak for them, versus our natural desire for collective knowing.</p><p>It seems that there is neither a case made in terms of individuals nor a case enumerated in the public interest.  This is despite the possibility that a very strong public interest argument could be made in terms of an openness of information in healing, learning and moving forward as a State.  That was articulated in the course of the testimony.</p><p> There is a question about disposal and transfer.  We know one of the tests of the GDPR is deciding what is necessary and proportionate.  Currently, it seems that there is a mechanism which involves a decision.  The director of National Archives is currently in a position to look at necessity and proportionality regarding particular records; this is to apply GDPR processes even if they are not there in terms of law.  Under the National Archives Acts, is that a better current solution when it comes to necessity and proportionality?</p><p> The protocol of redaction issue was really interesting, as the decision regarding redaction comes under necessity and proportionality.  The GDPR gets thrown around a bit.  It has been thrown around by Tusla as an excuse to close records.  My understanding of the regulation is that it concerns people's rights to information and records and knowing what happened or which decisions were made about them.  The GDPR is not there to protect administrative processes or the secrecy of those processes.  Ms Crowe described the administrative processes that she was able to extract with regard to overseas adoptions.  When we look to the administrative processes within the Department of Education and Skills, we could see what happened with transfer patterns in a moment of abuse.  I was really struck by Ms McDonnell Byrne hearing her story and other similar stories.  It is her story but it is a pattern so it is not really simply about survivors and perpetrators; it is about processes, systems and abusive practices that were embedded and allowed.  We may or may not want to redact the name of an individual, depending on whether that individual was an employee or doing a job that he or she was paid to do, but the process, decisions and the reality of people's lived experiences should certainly not be redacted.  This relates to whether a person was sent to hospital or a decision on fostering, for example.</p><p> Will the witnesses comment on the importance of having their story placed alongside others and in the public space being able to see that their experience was part of a bad systemic practice that society now acknowledges and rejects?  Will they also comment on the gagging rule?  There were comments about War of Independence records and the fight for Ireland.  All these men wrote about their experiences, including violence and attacks, and it is all in the public realm.  Some of the books came out well within the 75-year limit.  Those are men's stories and I notice that many women's stories and vulnerable women's stories in particular are not allowed to be told in the public space in the same way.</p></speech>

I will go back to the threat of destruction.  Destroying personal data comes under the definition of processing under the GDPR and this can only be done if there is a lawful basis to do it.  We have already heard that the legal requirements is to dispose of records and not destroy them.  Any interpretation of that must be compatible with the GDPR.</p> <p>  The data controller must retain the information for as long as necessary.  There is a retention obligation and the Department of Education and Skills, or specifically whoever is the controller, cannot just destroy the information on a whim.  There must be a retention policy.  There is a debate about what happens to these records so any destruction, unless mandated explicitly by law, could be a breach of the GDPR and expose the controllers to compensation claims.</p><p>If a controller destroys information that it knows people want or there is a debate about it, in and of itself, that would be a breach of the GDPR.  All the scenarios must be considered through the lens of the GDPR data protection rights.  Any kind of threat or suggestion that unless a particular law is passed everything will be lost would be hollow.  The Department of Education and Skills must be specifically asked what is the legal basis for any potential destruction.  It must be examined explicitly and in detail by this committee or the Legislature.</p></speech>

They have been written into history in a major way since.  Women made statements to the Bureau of Military History and applied for pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts, which the Deputy spoke of.  The people who made submissions or applications to both those bodies, which are effectively the oral history of our revolutionary period and unique in Europe, became the leaders of this country after the revolutionary period in various ways.  It is very valuable material and all of it is in the public domain and there is no problem.  The sky has not fallen on our heads.  These people became Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Deputies and Senators, with a few exceptions.  This is, in effect, a record of people who became quite powerful after suffering a great deal during the period of the revolution.<br/><br/>What has happened to our eloquent survivors and their sisters and brothers is of a scale, significance and importance of equal level to what happened in the revolutionary period.  It took place over a much longer period and it was hidden for a huge period.  As Ms McDonnell Byrne has said, it carried a burden of shame that should have been on the other side but it does not seem to have made itself felt, which is strange.  I have not heard a single person from the State or religious orders say they felt ashamed, which is strange.<br/><br/>We are talking about a gigantic archive of abuse, mistreatment, psychological deprivation and a lack of shame on behalf of those who should have been giving care and compassion to vulnerable children.  It is a mind-blowingly important archive that this country badly needs to understand and learn from.  First and foremost, the survivors must be placed at the centre and made cognisant of their own records.  They must be given whatever they want.<br/><br/>None of this is undoable.  We are here discussing an unnecessary piece of legislation that will waste much time.  I hope that, ultimately, that legislation will not be passed.  All of the people speaking before the committee today have stated that they do not want or need this.  There are ways to get this done and there are people sitting before the committee who would willingly give their time and expertise to help manage this process in order to give survivors, scholarship and the public what they need at whatever time that is necessary.</p></speech>

We listened to the expertise and particularly to the voices of the survivors.</p><p>It is one thing getting and reading submissions; it is another hearing them in the witnesses' voices and having the opportunity to ask questions and to listen to them.  It has been a very humbling experience.  I know I speak for all the members when I say I completely honour the witnesses for what they have gone through.  At the very least, as recommended in the Ryan commission report and committed to by the Government under the Magdalen redress scheme, there should absolutely be a memorisation in the form of a national archive regarding what has happened in order that we cannot wipe this out of history.</p><p> Is it okay if we send all the witnesses' statements to the Minister?  As this was of a sensitive nature, we had decided we would publish the report when we had the opportunity to discuss it further.  We were not going to include some of the statements just because of the sensitivities involved, but is it okay if we send everything to the Minister?  We feel that that absolutely is important.  I take it everyone assents to that.</p></speech>

It is very important to be listened to, and I get the feeling we were actually heard for the first time in my life.</p> <p>  I remember, going back to 1997, when I met Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and Bertie Ahern.  They had only come into power.  They asked us, that is, Christine Buckley, Bernadette Fahy and me, to give a brief of what happened to us, and I was so taken aback by the response.  They stood up, looked us in the eye and apologised.  That started me on my road of healing and recovery.  I am still on that road of healing, as are all the survivors.</p> <p>  We have poured our hearts out today and it is not easy.  Thankfully, counselling helps us to get through these things because we are so passionate about protecting other survivors and ourselves.  Therefore, I just hope what we have said today does not fall on deaf ears because many survivors do not trust the Departments at all.  We still hear survivors say, "Let them bury the records because they never believed me anyway."</p> <p>  I am not the perpetrator.  From the time I got involved in this in 1996, which was after the "Dear Daughter" documentary, I have had phone calls from people attempting suicide.  I do not want to get those phone calls.  I have had them all my life.  My role as a survivor is not to protect another survivor from suicide.  I am not the perpetrator.  I am only trying to help.  It is about time someone was held accountable and, as I said, that our voices were heard loud and clear and we were respected because we need to be honoured as a whole group.  As Ms Harney said earlier, we are unique people and none of us are here screaming and shouting, despite what happened.  We may have anger and other things but we have learned how to control that.  That was very evident after the Ryan report, when we had the march of solidarity.  There was no screaming and shouting; people walked in silence.  I was part of that, as were some of my sisters here.</p> <p>  On that note, I thank everybody - I really do.  I did not say that in my three minutes at the beginning.</p><p>It means so much.  It also means so much to hear the professionals who are working so hard and putting so many hours into trying to put right the wrongs that happened.  Thank you.</p></speech>

Our opinion would not be nearly as important, obviously, as the legalities, because the law is the law, but it is almost side by side with that and they should go hand in hand.  If our records are revealed to us now, once and for all, it is done.  However, we are getting this in drip feed after drip feed.  It is tiring.

Our first session is with representatives from IBEC and will be followed by a session with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  From IBEC, I welcome Dr. Kara McGann, head of social policy, and Mr. Rhona Murphy, head of employment law services, and thank them for taking the time to attend.</p><p>I remind members, guests and those in the Public Gallery to please ensure their mobile phones are switched off or to flight mode for the duration of the meeting as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment, even when on silent.  In accordance with procedure, I am required to read the following.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  They have been circulated with copies of the presentations submitted by our guests.</p><p>I invite Dr. McGann to make her presentation to the committee.</p></speech>

IBEC is pleased to have contributed to the review of economic migration policy carried out by the interdepartmental group last year, which served to inform many elements of the Bill.  We are familiar, therefore, with the detailed work that has gone into the development of the general scheme.  We also welcome the commitment of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, notably the team in the economic migration policy unit, to engage with business.</p> <p>  This timely Bill seeks to build on the existing employment permits system, which has provided a strong framework to supplement skills and labour needs in the State, and ensure it will be future-proofed, agile and responsive to the dynamic Irish labour market.  It will give priority, quite correctly in our view, to the ability of the system to adapt to rapid changes in the needs of the labour market of the future, something that will support the competitiveness of business in Ireland.  Its success, however, will ultimately be judged by how it delivers.  This complex area will require collaboration from all stakeholders, including business, if we are to respond to the changing needs of the economy and citizens.</p> <p>  We will be unable to comment in detail on a 117-page general scheme document in a short input and, therefore, I will highlight where the most significant opportunities and challenges exist from a business perspective.  A constant challenge in this area of labour market policy is the ability to remain responsive to the changing needs of organisations and industries, and the swift administration process of various permit types.  Backlogs and delays in the permit process generate uncertainty in the business community and can in some cases result in jobs or significant projects falling through, while failure to respond to growing challenges in meeting skills or labour needs has implications for the ability of business to meet existing demands or grow.</p> <p>  In the current economic expansion, the combined effects of EU migration and domestic labour market activation are not sufficient to meet Ireland&rsquo;s rapidly growing demand for labour.  The level of difficulty in filling vacancies has increased in the past 12 months, with almost three quarters of those vacancies deemed "hard to fill&rdquo;, primarily due to an insufficient number of candidates with skills in the Irish labour market.  The vacancies spanned both high and low-skilled roles.  Industry remains committed to enhancing our indigenous skills supply to meet labour market needs through a combination of upskilling and reskilling programmes. We know, however, that given the fast-paced, changing global business model, education and training cannot meet all demands in real time.  Developments in infrastructure, increased capacity, innovation and changing skills needs take time.</p> <p>  The general scheme has identified several areas where flexibility and responsiveness can be built into the system.  They include retaining sensible rules such as the 50:50 rule, except where the individual in receipt of the permit would be the only employee; reforming the operational features of the labour market needs test to align it with the appropriate vacancy advertising practices used by employers today; and introducing a seasonal employment permit, which will help alleviate labour market demands during peak production or delivery times in specific sector.  The provision of streamlined renewal processes for the permit&rsquo;s users will encourage it to be used appropriately and prevent seasonal workers from overstaying their permit permissions, thus ensuring it will be retained for its agreed usage.  Other areas include simplifying the administration of intra-company transfers and contract-of-services employees in line with trade agreements, which will also enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these important processes for business; streamlining the permission of spouses, partners and dependents of critical skills employment permit holders or researchers on hosting agreements through the provision by the Minister for Justice and Equality of a visa for them to reside and work, thus supporting the aim of retaining these important skills in the State; and working on the processing system to ensure an automated system is available to reduce the administration burden on applicants, given that system that allows for auto-population and ease of completion will increase efficiencies on all sides and support the speed and accuracy of administration and reduce the backlog in this process.</p><p> Unfortunately, the general scheme does not directly tackle the issue of the low and unskilled workers who are needed to support the maintenance and growth of industry in certain sectors, such as food processing, hospitality, agriculture, social care and health care.  The absence of this category of workers is not addressed by the reduced pool of resident workers and these sectors fail to be in a position to compete with higher-paying sectors like construction due to low margins.  However, failing to resolve this crisis is likely to endanger existing business and limit the ability of organisations to take on new business opportunities internationally.  Yet, in the context of Brexit that is crucial.  In the longer term this will impact on the ability to meet Department targets set for certain sectors, e.g. Food Wise 2025.  Shortages among lower-skilled workers and subsequent pressure on wages have the potential to be as harmful to the Irish economy as a shortage of skilled labour.  This is particularly true for indigenous businesses predominantly based in sectors that use a higher proportion of low-skilled labour, such as tourism, care, retail, manufacturing and agrifood.  These sectors then often set the cost floor and thus competitiveness in the economy as a whole.  Many of these workers in the care or food processing sectors remain on the ineligible list, thus stunting the ability of businesses to meet existing needs, let alone grow.  Some employers have found this is impacting workforce development as well as they struggle to staff a shift let alone release people for learning and development.  Given our commitments to lifelong learning as a way to remain competitive, this is a concerning trend.</p><p> IBEC believes that a model such as the lower skilled occupations visa used in Canada or the essential skills work visa in New Zealand could offer opportunities and parameters that could suit Ireland's need for lower-skilled general operatives beyond what the general employment permit offers.  Eligibility requirements include the equivalent of a high school diploma or two years of job-specific training and enable a worker to remain in the country from six to 24 months and, as such, fill immediate labour shortages where gaps exist.  In addition, such visas define the duration, wages and conditions for the stay of the worker in the country.  One of the challenges to the provision of low-skilled workers that arose during discussions contributing to the review of economic migration policy related to how greater access to low-skilled immigrant workers may stifle innovation and automation of certain roles.  However, many of the sectors in question are sectors where future automation is not possible or where a transition to automation away from labour will be slow and costly, such as tourism, hospitality, social care and health care.  These jobs require unpredictable, non-routine work involving personal interaction and emotional rather than artificial intelligence and are not easily replaced by automation.  As such, the repeated reference to conditionality around knowledge transfer and process innovation to be prescribed in regulations is a worrying one that many employers may struggle to fulfil.</p><p> Immigration will remain an important source of labour for Ireland in future, one that can allow a quick response to emerging skills shortages and provide an ongoing supply of skilled workers where the number of new entrants or experienced workers is too low.  The continued economic recovery means that shortages will be observed in greater number and in more occupations and sectors.  In an increasingly uncertain global environment, policy must continue to innovate and challenge boundaries.  New ways to attract migrants must be undertaken to meet the labour market needs that extend beyond our capacity.  Competition will increase and failure to meet the skills and labour market demands will do untold long-term damage to elements of our economy.</p><p> The general scheme of the Bill is welcome.  It aims to provide a more responsive and agile employment permit system for Ireland.  In doing so it will support the Irish economy and its ambitions for growth while future-proofing the system for the expected ebbs and flows of the labour market.  I thank the members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present the views of Ibec on this important Bill.</p></speech>

We will take questions from the floor.  Deputy Troy is first.</p></speech>

We had the general scheme discussion a fortnight ago with officials from the Department appearing before the committee.  I raised some of the concerns that the IBEC deputation raised today relating to certain sectors that are going to be exempt from applying for the worker permits.  I gave an example relating to the hospitality and health care sectors.  There is no automatic entitlement or qualification.  I would be interested to hear a little more from IBEC on the potential long-term damage that could be done to these sectors if they continue to be prohibited from providing work permits.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.561" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#E00400"><p>We talk to employers in these sectors.  The views we are getting suggest it is not only already stifling their growth but also their ability to meet current business.  It is damaging how they deliver on a daily basis and their opportunities to upskill and develop their staff.  Several employers have particular concerns in light of the extra challenges that Brexit brings.  They believe this will further impede their ability to do business.  In some cases it is a question of meeting the current need let alone trying to grow and be competitive.  That is what they are experiencing on a daily basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#E00500"><p>I asked the question because I was thinking of care assistants in nursing homes and people working in the hospitality sector, perhaps those working front-of-house and those in the cleaning section and housekeeping.  It is similar to the challenges those in the food processing industry find in terms of attracting and recruiting workers.  This is because of the type of work.  The pay associated with the work makes it difficult to attract people locally.  That is why there is a permit to facilitate people from non-EEA countries to work in this sector.  It is extended for up to nine months.</p> <p>  When I made the point on the hospitality sector and the health care sector, departmental officials actually said they are not coming under pressure.  They encouraged people to make the point if particular sectors were feeling a challenge or were coming up against obstacles in trying to attract key staff in certain roles.  They said people need to make that point to the Department.  When I made the point to Department officials they pushed back and said there was no one telling them that.  They said if people were telling them that then they would have to respond.  It is welcome that IBEC has made the point today.  I realise the IBEC representatives are limited in what they can say in a short period.  However, they should ensure that these points are made to the Department.  It is crucial that this permit system is available to the sectors that need it.  Frankly, at the moment with almost full employment some sectors are struggling to find the right staff and to retain staff.  As a consequence industry is not growing to its full potential.</p></speech>

It is something we raised both at the review and in different submissions and conversations.  We will absolutely go back to members to bring the point up again.  One sector in particular is the home care sector.  It is trying to meet the needs and demands of the strategy in terms of the approach to try to keep people in their homes longer and out of other health systems.  However, it is struggling to meet those needs.  That is one example of a sector that will be hit by this particular issue.  It is something those in the sector are vocal on and we will certainly bring that point back and ensure it is continued.</p></speech>

Under these systems a restrictive permit can be offered to help to meet the challenges that currently exist.  I call on IBEC to reinforce the message with the departmental officials, because they did not believe me when I said it from this side of the table.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#E00800"><p>Page 5 of the document furnished to the committee flags that the proposed legislation does not make provision for low-skilled workers.  I am curious and seek the opinion of the deputation on this point.  Is it the fact that there are such low standards in these sectors?  Is that the reason there is such a shortage of staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00100"><p>The range of roles that come under that heading crosses a number of different sectors.  What they have found is that the resident available workforce is not coming into contact with the sector or tapping into it.  They are not able to resource from the local population.  We have different interest in different roles in some cases.  They are just not getting the interest from the local population and are having to look further afield.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00200"><p>Why does Dr. McGann think they are not getting the take-up from the local population?  What are the barriers?  Could it be low pay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.568" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00300"><p>In some cases the types of roles would be for low-skilled and maybe unskilled general operatives in the area, where employers are competing with the construction sector, for example, where the pay may be higher.  Some of these sectors are on low margins and are not in a position to compete with the likes of the construction sector, which adds challenges to the area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00400"><p>I suppose the same could be said in response to the Irish Hotels Federation submission.  If we are looking at giving out permits we would need to be confident that the pay would be sufficient for people to live on.  In the hospitality sector, we would need to be confident that people who would come here on a work permit would be given sufficient hours instead of these zero-hour or six hour a week contracts and that there would not be any other exploitation.  What are employers doing to ensure this is not the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kara McGann" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00500"><p>Employers are very keen to look at various ways that we would look at these areas including both engaging in training and development and in how and where they look for the different types of staff.  Just because they are low margin does not mean they are not quality jobs and opportunities to careers.  All of that feeds in to the business and how people run their businesses.  We have a lot of supports in place to protect that.</p></speech>

I understand there has been a particular concern in recent years about the predictability of employment and to what extent people will know in advance what kind of hours they are going to work.  We do have legislation in place since about this time last year, namely the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, which significantly curtails the circumstances in which zero-hours arrangements can be used.  Many of the arrangements we would be looking at here would not be in scope.  There is also an entitlement for someone to gain predictability of working hours where they can apply to their employer to be placed on a band of hours and make sure they follow that pattern for the following 12 months.  These are areas that are already quite heavily regulated.  For any compliant employer, and we would say the vast majority are compliant, those issues are really largely addressed now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00700"><p>Given that the witnesses have flagged up the fact about the low-skill workers, the reality on the ground is that a substantial part of the reason people are not taking up those jobs is the low pay and the lack of a guarantee of sufficient hours to get by.  That is the reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rhona Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00800"><p>In terms of sufficient hours to live, that is not something we are hearing back from our employer members.  In fact what they are saying is that they cannot get staff.  It is not a case that people are being denied hours of work that they want to work.  It is quite the opposite.  They cannot bring them in and cannot get enough people to come in and work the hours they have available.  In terms of the issue of pay, I am sure pay is a factor in determining whether somebody decides to take up a position.  We must bear in mind as well that a lot of the sectors in which employment permits will be needed will not necessarily have particularly high profit margins.  Very often there is a public service element and people are relying on these services in their own homes, for example.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.574" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#F00900"><p>We are straying away from pre-legislative scrutiny of the permits a little bit.  The critical skills employment permit, CSEP, currently has a minimum threshold of &euro;30,000 and the worker must hold a degree qualification.  A CSEP could also be granted where remuneration is above &euro;60,000.  The &euro;30,000 is going to increase to &euro;32,000 and the &euro;60,000 is going to increase to &euro;64,000.  For those who will come in on those particular permits, the terms and conditions will be fixed.  That is all part of it.  We are straying into questions of why we cannot get people locally to do those jobs and why we need to bring people in on permits.  It is quite clear in what the Department is setting out that the remuneration is there in respect of full-time hours.</p></speech>

It is an ongoing, continuous shortage.  Do we need to have a conversation about low pay in the State rather than lobbying for permits to bring workers in?  Is that the conversation we need to have?</p></speech>

We are at a current unemployment rate of 4.8% and we are looking for additional sources of labour beyond what we can provide within the labour market.  I think that is probably the underlying issue.</p></speech>

I was at the receiving end of this when I was in Australia.  I was a sponsored worker and all those parameters of certain conditions and a certain salary applied.  I had to be on the list of skilled migration, whatever it was, and the list of skills changed over time.  I could have been in a position where my skill was knocked off the list and it would be "Goodbye".  This is a few years ago.  It was not very reassuring when somebody went into a country.  Are there any parameters or provisions for attracting workers at that level by providing some sort of career path or permanent path so they have something to work towards?  If what Dr. McGann is saying is correct and we are at such a high rate of employment that we are trying to attract people in, is there any provision for a permanent path so that those who make a move here can see some sort of bridging to enhance their career and stay in Ireland?  Is it more about giving people two years and reviewing?  What are the parameters around that?</p></speech>

If they came in through the general scheme or whatever, that would be where those parameters would probably kick in.  In the low skill piece, I suppose it is to try to look at how we would address that challenge.  Something like the Canadian or New Zealand model, which has a very defined duration much like what the Deputy is describing, would be at a point in time where we would be but certainly looking at how we could go broader than that would be something we would need to review.</p></speech>

Is there a transferral path?  I am basing my questions on my own situation, because I am not too <i>au fait</i>with this.  A worker in my situation could work for several years on a sponsorship visa.  My visa allowed me to apply for different roles.  I qualified on one strand of the visa and the company qualified on another.  If I wanted to change company, only the new company had to apply.  I had already qualified for four years.  The other strand had to be applied for every time to allow people to move.Are parameters in place to make this process as easy as that?  I had the choice of whether I wanted to apply for permanent residency, or down the road, citizenship.  All those parameters were in place.  Has experience in other countries shown that these people stay?  Is it being proposed for Ireland, or is it still just-----</p></speech>

I would like to raise a further question.  The new Bill seeks to introduce a seasonal employment permit.  Does IBEC have any thoughts on how long the seasonal employment permit should be valid for?  The Department's officials were before the committee two weeks ago.  It has not really finalised its position on this.  It is open to different viewpoints.  In the tourism industry the season runs with the weather.  It could be four, five or six months depending on what kind of summer it is.  Does Dr. McGann have any thoughts on that?</p><p><b>Dr. Kara McGann:</b>There is certainly a conversation worth having.  We think it should be between six and 18 months.  The important considerations would be very strong parameters around how people would leave and ease of renewal should somebody wish to return, for example in the following season.  It would be important to ensure that the seasonal permit works efficiently to allow people to come for a period and then leave and allow them to return for a later season should they wish to.  It appears that a lot of people move from one jurisdiction to another in different seasons, depending on where they are at certain times.  The conversations we have had have envisaged somewhere between six and 18 months. </p></speech>

I am not sure that sector would call for 18 months.  I thought it would be between six and nine months.  A lot of seasons are included in 18 months.  I am just thinking out loud.

A lot of the workers there came into the country on permits.  They were living from week to week.  Some of them were laid off.  I was in contact with some of these workers.  It was one of the side-effects of the strike.  Jobs were being lost outside and inside the plants.  Some of these workers, who were low-skilled or had no skills, were literally living on a week-to-week remuneration.  Things were very difficult at that stage.

The issue for unions is what rights migrants have and how those rights can be vindicated.  This involves examining the bona fides of the sector seeking the permits and the process whereby minimum wage levels are set and enforced.  Unions also have a concern for the maintenance of decent societal values and the promotion of social cohesion.</p> <p>  Job vacancy rates in the Irish private sector are low by international standards.  I checked last week and according to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, they range between 0.6% in transportation and storage to 2.1% in professional and scientific services.</p><p>In fact, the vacancy rate in professional scientific services has fallen by a percentage point between the first and second quarters of 2019.  According to EUROSTAT, the vacancy rate in Ireland was 1% in the second quarter of 2019 compared to a rate of 2.3% in the EU and the euro area in the second quarter of 2019.  To put things in perspective, our overall vacancy rate is the fourth lowest in the EU 28.  If we take a broader definition of labour supply, known as PLS 2, 3 + 4, as defined by the CSO, we find that the rate is 17% compared to a headline unemployment rate of 5.7%.  Taken together with the fact that Ireland has an in-work training rate of 23.3%, which is 9% behind the EU 28 average, it is apparent that there is a mismatch in the Irish labour market which current policies are not addressing and that will not be addressed by migration.<br/><br/>There are a number of downsides to relying on labour migration as a policy instrument.  Labour migration will pose additional strains on housing.  This would not be the case if greater effort was put into mobilising people already on or beyond the live register.  Principle 5 of the review of economic migration policy states the intention that permit holders should be a net contributor to society.  <br/><br/>Another downside is contained in the review of migration policy, which highlights &quot;the risk that the development of particular skills in the resident labour pool may be discouraged if it seems attractive on a cost basis for employers to hire non-EEA nationals at salary levels below the [national] average salary&quot;.<br/><br/>There is a danger that the demand for more non-EEA visas for low-paid workers will be seen as a stratagem to drive down wages.  This perception is not helped by the opaque way in which the wage thresholds for permits, originally set at &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000 per annum, have been gradually eroded.  I refer, for example, to thresholds for recent graduates and customer service roles with non-EEA languages of &euro;27,000 per annum; for meat boners of &euro;27,500 per annum; and for specified agrifood categories of &euro;22,000 per annum.  No logic has ever been provided for the erosion of these thresholds.<br/><br/>A significant and uncontroversial part of the Bill involves tidying up existing legislation.  One major concern is the effect on the labour market and on society as a whole.  Consideration is needed of the consequences of moving decisions from primary legislation into statutory instruments.  In practice, that frustrates public scrutiny.  In 2018, 42 Acts were passed by the Oireachtas compared with 675 statutory instruments enacted.  Administrative convenience should not trump transparency and the right of citizens to be able to follow what is happening in society.<br/><br/>A report published last week by the EU Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs, DG ECFIN, pointed out that activity rates and participation rates in Ireland have not recovered as expected in the decade since 2008.  The report acknowledges the continuing role of migrants in our workforce but also points to lower participation rates by women.  It is important that the work permit regime should not be used as a sticking plaster for other more deep-seated problems such as the participation of women in the labour market or the still low levels of take-up of in-company training.<br/><br/>The role of pre-legislative scrutiny is rather like the role of risk assessment that one would have in the private sector.  The members may ask what could possibly go wrong.  What could possibly go wrong is the fishery workers fiasco, which was dealt with by a committee of the Houses.  It has ended up in the courts.  The operation of this scheme is one of the main reasons Ireland has been downgraded from tier 1 to tier 2 in the US State Department's trafficking index.  This downgrading brings significant reputational damage to Ireland.  That unhappy episode demonstrates the danger that a lead Department could be subject to regulatory capture and could act solely in the interest of employers.<br/><br/>That brings me to my next point.  The thresholds for employment permits were originally set at &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000 in 2006 and are derived from the then average industrial wage of &euro;29,911 for all employees.  Since then, those thresholds have remained constant, thus falling behind average industrial earnings, which are currently &euro;38,490.  We acknowledge the intention of the Department to realign them with average annual earnings on a phased basis.  The link between these threshold levels and average earnings should be enshrined in primary legislation.<br/><br/>It is unacceptable that the current opaque wage-setting mechanism for permits should continue.  In all other cases where the institutions of the State set a wage, it is done in public after the interests of employers and workers are heard.  That would occur in the case of the Labour Court or the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  In contrast, the wage thresholds for employment permits seem to be set internally in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in a closed internal process.<br/><br/>With regard to seasonal work visas, the proposal to introduce these visas is fraught with potential difficulty, more so as it would seem the process of designation of sectors would be undertaken within the Department.  The difficulties of enforcement multiply and the difficulties for workers to secure redress increase exponentially.  Ireland has a larger than average number of young people attending third level who traditionally seek work during the summer months.  This should be more than adequate for the needs of highly seasonal employers.  As to the argument that we are unique in the EU in not having seasonal work visas, if there is to be an alignment with mainland European standards, it should be part of a widespread review of all aspects of labour standards, including redundancy rights and the right to collective bargaining.  It is not acceptable for us to pick out one aspect of the labour code and say that we are out of line on that without looking at other aspects.<br/><br/>The purpose of the trade union movement is to protect the interests of workers in Ireland, regardless of their nationality.  Irish and EEA citizens have demonstrably equal rights under the law.  The work permit regime allows non-EEA workers these rights <i>de jure</i>.  It is questionable whether they are available de facto, especially for lower paid and more vulnerable workers.  That is why we have suggested amendments to this legislation.  This is best served by having a transparent wage-setting mechanism involving the labour market institutions of the State.  The rules have to be calibrated with a view to the regulation of high-risk employer behaviour, in the light of previous experience.<br/><br/>An important aspect that politicians, as opposed to administrators, have to pick up on is the general climate surrounding foreign workers in society and how it fuels other attitudes.  The interaction between the labour market and migration needs to be managed carefully to preserve our civic values.  We have openness to foreign workers, inspired possibly by our experience as an emigrating nation.  We must preserve this value and the best way of doing it is to have regard for the weak and vulnerable in the framing of public policy.<br/><br/>The members will see I have included footnotes at the bottom of my script showing from where I got information.  I am happy to answer any questions they might wish to put.</p></speech>

In an ideal situation, where the State sets a wage, those representing the sellers of labour and those representing the buyers of labour come together in a process and thrash out this argument, and an institution of the State decides on the figure.  That is not the case in these thresholds.  We hope that there would be a section in this legislation stating that what was to be &euro;30,000 is set with reference to the average wage for full-time employees, which is as stated in the submission.  There would have to be a transitional provision to take up the slack to cover the years where this was neglected and not brought up, which in our view is an argument for having it in primary legislation.</p> <p>  The other argument we make in respect of primary legislation rather than statutory instruments is that this is not the Shannon navigation by-laws.  This is a vital part of society and the labour market that, if it is not handled properly, will have people whipping up anti-foreigner sentiment in the community.  The more of it that is in primary legislation where it can be debated by elected Members of the Oireachtas, the better.  It may be inconvenient for the administrators but in an area like this, that is something they have to accept as being a civic price that is necessary to be paid.</p></speech>

Traditionally, people always took up summer work.  There should be a forum where people can make a case for that.  I had a very bad experience dealing with a particular Department.  I am cautious in speaking about it, given the strictures the Chairman laid upon me.  We told the Department we needed work permits, that we had a consortium in to talk about it and that the margins were cut-throat.  At the meeting I said we would discuss anything and that we were in the business of discussing issues.  I asked it to send us information on the grounding arguments for its position.  I was given an undertaking that information would be provided but when I followed up that request with an email I was told that information was commercially sensitive.  How information for a consortium in a cut-throat industry can be commercially sensitive is beyond my ken.  I have a belief that Departments which act in a conscious way, whose officials are honourable men and women, can be subject to regulatory capture.  They act as advocates for the sector but there is an absence of a voice for the potential workers.  If there is a case for seasonal workers, somebody in a sector should have to go to a forum of the State and say those in the sector are being crucified because they cannot get seasonal workers, that their season for doing X, whether it be serving breakfasts, killing cattle or picking mushrooms, is for three, four or five months and they need those workers and can prove it.  They can provide evidence, say they hired an economist and can present a highly important paper that weighs half a kilogram and, therefore, it must be of high quality given that its weight.  A licence to lower wages and employ people on a minimum wage is de facto a subsidy from society, if not, from the State and it should be done in a public manner.  The onus should not be put on a civil servant to go into a room and be told to come up with a figure.</p></speech>

Somebody said "give me a one-handed economist" because an economist will say on the one hand and on the other hand.  There should be an institution of the State that would say, for example, in the case of the widget-making sector, taking account of all the circumstances involved, its peak season is from February to April and it considers the sector should get the numbers sought to make widgets from February to April.</p></speech>

They went while they were in college and they knew they would be coming home again.  If seasonable employment permits are issued, I imagine many students would come to Ireland to take up those permits.  A timeframe for the termination of such permits would be required.  I did not agree with the earlier comment of it ranging between and six and 18 months.  I am thinking it should be shorter than six months.</p></speech>

I agree fully with Dr. Rigney's comment that it is critically important we get this right, given the potential for the rise of any anti-immigrant sentiment.  Unfortunately, in recent weeks and months, we witnessed an underbelly and an undercurrent of blatant racism that exists.  We certainly do not want to bring forward any legislation that could give that any sort of ventilation.  We have to get this right.  I was encouraged by Dr. Rigney's stating at the end of his presentation that we have an openness to foreign workers, inspired possibly by our experience as an emigrating nation, which we do.  We must welcome them.  Often, in instances, they are critically important.  We need them to ensure certain sectors of our economy perform, develop and grow.  Without some of those workers, certain sectors of our economy would not develop and grow.</p> <p>  I take on board what Dr. Rigney said about seasonal workers and potential for sectors to take on third level students.  As was said by previous contributors, certain sectors of the economy operate under tight single-digit margins.  I refer to food processors and Dr. Rigney mentioned mushroom pickers, which he may have mentioned in passing, but the latter is a sector that only afford to pay a certain amount.  We would love it to pay more but it can only afford to pay a certain amount to ensure that sector of the economy is sustainable into the future.  When we have practically full employment, there are sectors that cannot get people to take up jobs.  In an ideal situation it would be great if sectors could get workers.  I am sure most businesses would rather employ people locally because it is expensive to recruit people from the international market.  Where there are tight margins and businesses cannot attract workers, how does Dr. Rigney propose they recruit workers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.624" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Rigney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#J01100"><p>I would need to see more evidence of people being unable to recruit and to fill positions.  There are difficulties but some of them can be resolved.  There is a differentiation between low-skill industries.  For example, the contract cleaning and security industries both have employment regulation orders and pay a little bit above, albeit not wildly above, the minimum wage, and have certain minimum conditions, relating to basic sick pay, provision of uniforms and so on, laid down.  That does not apply to the meat cutting or hospitality sectors.  Sometimes, the possibility of having an employment regulation order, which would increase conditions slightly in the sector, can improve matters.  For example, on a day like this, if I had a choice, with all other things being equal, of being out working on a roof in the construction sector or being inside as a kitchen porter, I would prefer to be inside as a kitchen porter.  The fact that guys, and they are mainly guys, would prefer to be out on a roof is because the construction industry pays more.  It is rule one of first-year economics.</p></speech>

If a business is to be sustainable and profitable because ultimately it is taking a risk and making an investment, there must be an element of profit for the employer.  In certain sectors, there are certain wages that can be and are being paid but they are not attracting people at that level.  If we do not facilitate people from the non-European Economic Area to come here and take up the slack where Irish people and local people are not taking up the jobs, those sectors of the economy will be challenged and will flounder.</p></speech>

First, it is not Irish people and local people.  There is a labour market of, I think, 55 million in the EU 28.  We as unions get complaints and the last one I heard was from a very vocal shop steward in a company who was giving out about what he considered to be an abuse of work permits.</p><p>Second, in order to evaluate the case, one has to look at the evidence.  Normally, when I am dealing with a company which is in difficulties, I go to the Companies Registration Office to look at its last filings.  In some of these sectors, one finds a multiplicity of companies, sometimes hundreds of companies, within the one family which are availing of the small company exemption or are registered in the Isle of Man or Jersey.  There are companies in the food sector in particular which are highly profitable and are flagships of the Irish food industry.  They still manage to pay a decent wage and their reports are regularly available on the Irish Stock Exchange.  There are also some people who avail of their constitutional right to privacy to have a network of private companies.  I can only go on the evidence I can find.</p></speech>

I do not support people manipulating the system to drive down the cost of wages.  However, certain industries in our economy are working on tight margins.  Dr. Rigney referred to the mushroom industry.  It has gone through a serious challenge with Brexit.</p></speech>

In certain cases, the industry simply cannot do this and it can only afford to pay a certain wage.  We have to be careful.  While not compromising any employees&rsquo; terms and conditions, we must support certain industries which could make a tangible case to employ non-EEA workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.631" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Rigney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019112600002#K00500"><p>That is the basis of my point.  Where and to whom does one make the tangible case?  Who else participates in this?  That is at the nub of what I was saying.  The Constitution states justice shall be administered in public.  That has been extended to wage setting, which is not a legal matter.  The mushroom industry was one of the first to get widespread access to EU labour.  The bestselling book in Latvia one year was <i>The Mushroom Covenant: Baltic Blacks among Celts</i>, a diary of a Latvian woman picking mushrooms, along with many other women from the Baltic states, in the Border counties.  I was only able to read bits of it.  I do not believe it has been translated into English.  It is interesting to look at us through others&rsquo; eyes.<br/><br/>I remember when I was studying for the leaving certificate, the Irish text was <i>Rotha M&oacute;r an tSaoil</i>by Mic&iacute; Mac Gabhann.  He went first to east Donegal, then to England, Cleveland, Ohio, and then to Alaska.  That man spoke very little English but he had enough to be able to read a danger sign or his rights.  Many of the people in question do not speak a word of English.  If certain sectors want to bring in people from a non-English speaking background, they should encourage or facilitate them to learn the language.<br/><br/>What conditions my view on this is as follows.  I mentioned the trawler visas.  That fiasco was settled by the State on the steps of the High Court in a case taken by the International Transport Workers Federation which has a quasi-legal role in dealing with maritime matters from a trade union point of view.  The weekend Romania came into the EU, the International Transport Workers Federation stopped a ship in Dublin Port.  RT&Eacute; news had a lovely shot of the crew members with their money, who had just been paid by this intervention.  There was a picture of Romanians waving wads of &euro;50 notes but the reporter then stated the Ukrainian crew members decided to stay on the ship.  If people believe that they have citizen rights, as the Romanians did as EU citizens, they feel they have the strength to assert them.<br/><br/>The high-skilled workers have a skill which is in shortage and, by and large, they will be able to look after themselves.  Those in the low-skilled area, however, do not feel they have the capacity to vindicate their rights.  That is the problem.  They are in danger of being exploited by others with a particular view of the world.  That is what we are trying to sort out.<br/><br/>Bills to codify and tidy up unwieldy legislation are always welcome.  There is a special point about the labour market which requires it to be kept in the public view and where legislators have control of it and the issues around it.  There is a particular issue with the setting of wages.  It should be done in a public forum.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.665" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019112600002#B00300"><p>I welcome members of the committee, and viewers who may be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV, to the meeting, the purpose of which is to continue the committee's deliberations on the topic of education and how it impacts on the Traveller community.  This is our third session.  The committee has heard from Ms Catherine Joyce of the Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group, the National Traveller Women's Forum, Mr. Patrick Nevin of the Travellers' Community Development Project, Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in,Mr. Martin Collins of Pavee Point, and Ms Shreya Chaturvedi and Mr. Bernard Joyce of the Irish Traveller Movement and its Yellow Flag programme.</p><p>When the committee heard from Mr. Oein de Bhaird&uacute;in last week, he told us that it is a misconception that Travellers do not value education.  This message has come through loud and strong in our deliberations on education.  I am sure we will hear more to that effect this morning.  Mr. de Bhaird&uacute;in said:</p> <blockquote> 	There exists among all people a desire to prosper, grow and learn, and the doorways created by education are greatly valued and desired by Travellers.  However, many of these doorways are locked to us. </blockquote> <p>The committee heard that Travellers are far more likely to be put on reduced-hours timetables and that travellers are 50 times more likely to leave school without a leaving certificate.  This is a very hard, strong, clear and sobering fact.  Some 57% of male Travellers are educated to primary level at most, and only 13% of Traveller females are educated to upper secondary level or above compared to 70% of the wider population.  Fewer than 1% of Travellers have a third level qualification.  In 2011-12 during the height of the recession, there were draconian cuts to Traveller education that resulted in visiting teacher services being disbanded and a loss of 42 resource teacher jobs.  Those cuts still have not been reversed in any meaningful way.  Traveller centres were also closed.</p><p>We heard how Travellers do not so much drop out but are pushed out through bullying, lack of adequate supports and understanding, etc.  That is what Pavee Point stated last week.  There are also some positive aspects in this area, and we will hear about some of those today.  Some six new schools will get the yellow flag in Leinster House this Thursday and that is to be celebrated.  Again, however, that programme runs on a shoestring and it would be good to see it put on a firmer footing.  It is something practical the Department of Education and Skills could consider and I am sure that will feature in our recommendations<br/><br/>These sessions are concerned with removing barriers or identifying ways to remove the barriers for children who routinely find the door closed to them.  We need to learn how to make schools warm, welcoming and safe spaces for Travellers, how to clear the pathways and take specific and affirmative action so that Travellers can enjoy their right to education in the same way as the general population.  We will be hearing today from Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  It is a miserable morning and she is stuck in traffic.  She is on her way, however.  The Deputy is a former Minister for Education and Skills and current co-chair of the Oireachtas Traveller Group, and it will be valuable to hear her perspective on these issues.  I also think she is presenting the yellow flag awards on Thursday.  We will also be hearing from Dr. Teresa O'Doherty from the Marino Institute of Education, MIE, and from Mr. Patrick McDonagh, a Traveller and PhD student in medieval history at Trinity College Dublin.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make her or him identifiable.I remind everyone in attendance that his or her mobile phone is to be turned off because mobile phone can still interfere with the recording system, even when left in silent mode.  I also advise that any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  That website is a fantastic repository of information.<br/><br/>We will take questions from members of the committee after the witnesses have presented.  I call Dr. O'Doherty to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

An associated college of Trinity College Dublin and established more than 100 years ago, MIE offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in education, and in teacher education in particular.  The college has 1,100 students, half of whom are registered on initial teacher education programmes at undergraduate or postgraduate level.  We would like to bring our work on initial teacher education to the attention of the committee today and especially our access to initial teacher education programmes for students from the Traveller community.</p> <p>  We initiated a three-year project in May 2018, called Tobar, as part of the programme for access to higher education run by the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  The overall objective of the project is to enroll four Travellers on initial teacher education programmes and, to date, two Traveller students have progressed via Tobar to initial teacher education programmes.  One is now enrolled on a professional masters of education in primary teaching at MIE and the other is enrolled at Maynooth University on a professional masters of education in post-primary teaching.  It will be noted that the students mentioned are studying at postgraduate level and have completed a leaving certificate and an undergraduate degree programme.  </p> <p>  From its outset, Tobar established a two-strand approach for its intervention.  Strand 1 focuses on Traveller students aged 15 to 18 years old who aspire to become teachers.</p><p>Strand 2 focuses on Travellers who may want to enrol on the B.Ed. programme through the mature entry route or those who already have undergraduate degrees but wish to enrol on professional masters programmes.</p><p> In the current year of 2019-20, our project is putting additional focus on Strand 1 and on the students at second level who may aspire to become teachers.  The project has already established positive relationships with schools, community groups and, in many cases, individual families.  At present nine students, ranging from the junior cycle to the leaving certificate, are registered with the TOBAR project.  In each case, the TOBAR project officer works in collaboration with school staff to determine each student's interest, disposition and academic ability.  Suitable supports and interventions are then scheduled depending on the individual needs of students.</p><p> Within Strand 1 we deliver in-school workshops for students on becoming a primary teacher.  We meet families and arrange for the students to visit the Marino Institute of Education.  To date, we have worked on about 30 visits and 30 workshops in schools.  In addition, our project officer has engaged in sustained collaboration with Traveller groups and, for example, has been invited to join the board of Exchange House.</p><p> Although the TOBAR project is only in its second year of activity, we have learned a good deal about the concerns, fears and difficulties faced by Traveller students in schools.  We have also learned about the frustration of Traveller graduates in terms of their careers post third-level study.  It is telling that the first reaction from Traveller students in the workshops is incredulity at the suggestion that they could, if they so wished, become teachers.  The lack of ambition within the students to become a teacher or pursue any professional career reflects society's failure and that of the education system to actively promote careers to Traveller students. </p><p> The Traveller students we have worked with often show a lack of belief in themselves.  This, combined with a lack of belief in the education system and higher education, means that students who can succeed in pursuing professional careers often drop out or drop back in subjects.  I mean they move from honours level to ordinary level or foundation level in their subjects for reasons that are not aligned with their academic ability.  Without any intervention such changes have long-term consequences for the students in terms of accessing higher education.</p><p> Initial teacher education or ITE programmes have minimum entry requirements.  It is vitally important that a student who aspires to a teaching career is aware of the necessity to achieve the minimum entry requirements and maintain enough higher level subjects to achieve points to access an ITE programme through the Central Applications Office, CAO.  In such a case, it is equally important for the student's family and teachers to be aware of their student's aspiration and provide what support they can.  </p><p> It is important to emphasise that our engagement with schools through TOBAR has been extremely positive.  The level of facilitation that has been afforded to TOBAR by school staff has been, and will be, integral to the successful achievement of the project's aims.  The institute's partners, within the Leinster Pillar - Cluster 1, have also been generous with their time and expertise.  We acknowledge the Higher Education Authority, HEA, as the funder of TOBAR and appreciate its ongoing support.</p><p> Within the institute, TOBAR is operated by a small team and I thank everyone involved.  The HEA funds half of the cost of one project officer and the institute co-funds the remaining half.  We also have access to a very small stream of philanthropic funding to support Traveller students who enter our programmes.  However, if the institute is to continue to bring Travellers through the TOBAR programme additional funding will need to be sourced not just for operational aspects but, more important, to support students while on their ITE programmes.  I wish to emphasise that the initial teacher education programme is very expensive.  The institute is acutely conscious that it is a significant risk for any third-level institution to raise aspirations and subsequent expectations for members of the Traveller community without having the resources to support access, retention and progression through the ITE programmes.  Therefore, as part of our recommendations in our written submission, we strongly suggest consideration be given to establishing a centralised funding stream to support Travellers to pursue initial teacher education programmes.  </p></speech>

I will first apologise, as traffic was horrendous.  I thank the Chair for the invitation to address the committee on the topic of education and the Traveller community, with particular reference to school completion rates and educational attainment compared with the settled community.  There is no doubt that this is an issue that needs to be addressed urgently, given that statistics show that Travellers' progression rates from junior to senior level in post-primary school and from post-primary to further and higher education are well below the levels of their non-Traveller peers.  The 2011 census was some time ago, but according to it only 8% of Travellers had completed education to leaving certificate level compared with 73% of non-Travellers and only 1% of Travellers aged 25 to 64 years had a degree compared with 30% of non-Travellers.  These statistics are stark and need to be changed.</p> <p>  I will touch on what I consider to be the main issues.  Since I am conscious that I speak as a non-Traveller, my first point is that listening to the voice of Travellers and acting on what they say are crucial and central to deliberations.  I know that the committee is doing that.</p> <p>  As a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills and co-chair of the cross-party group on Travellers' issues, I have had the opportunity to engage with Travellers in considerable detail, including in my community.  The Committee on Education and Skills has produced a report on issues of transition in the education system and an interim report on reduced timetables, which we are working on progressing with the Department of Education and Skills.  The issue of reduced timetables had been hidden.  We were not, and indeed many people were not, aware of how much reduced timetables were being used in respect of Traveller children in particular, but also other children, in the education system.  Since our interim report, we held a meeting on 5 November with the Department on the progress being made in addressing the points that we had made concerning reduced timetables.  I am hopeful that there will be progress.</p> <p>  During the course of our hearings on progression, we learned that a proportionately large number of Traveller children were subjected to so-called reduced timetables, which effectively constitute exclusion from schools for long periods and have to date been at the discretion of schools, with little or no consultation with parents.  We learned that children with special needs were also subject to such discrimination.  They also presented to the committee.  As a result of our hearings and recommendations, I am confident that there will be radical changes in how these measures are used or not used in future.  Some of the issues that we raised were about not sending children home without full consultation and agreement with parents and only using reduced timetables as a last resort.  Data must be gathered on this, given that it is a hidden situation.</p> <p>  The fundamental issue at stake is every child's right to an education, as guaranteed in the Constitution.  A rights-based approach is fundamental to achieving the changes necessary to ensure that children in the Traveller community have full access to and full support in education.  The other issue that underpins progress is understanding and validation of the Traveller way of life and cultural history so that Traveller and settled children and teachers understand one another's identities, have confidence in their own, and value diversity in the school and educational environment.  As well as Travellers, this affects many other children who are at risk of misunderstanding.</p> <p>  I understand that the Minister has not published a report carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, auditing the curriculum on Traveller history and culture.  It is important to find out when that report will be published.  I welcome the Chair's Bill.  I will work with her and others to ensure it progresses through the D&aacute;il as it has the Seanad.</p> <p>  Many of the initiatives contained in the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, NTRIS, have not been implemented since the strategy's launch in June 2017.  These need to be tracked and followed through.  The reinstatement of the Traveller education advisory committee would provide a mechanism for issues affecting Travellers' progression in education to be brought directly to the Minister by Travellers themselves.</p><p>Other points have been raised by previous speakers.  Any initiative should especially recognise the importance of collating and monitoring data nationally as a matter of priority where Travellers are at risk of early school leaving and also establishing a Traveller-specific education strategy.  The Department of Education and Skills or Tusla should collect data on the practice of reduced timetables, to which I referred.  I believe there will be progress in that regard.</p><p> Intercultural awareness training should form a mandatory component of continuous teacher professional development.  While it is already included in teacher education, it is particularly important that teachers who have gone beyond the initial stage of education should also have mandatory intercultural awareness training throughout their teaching lives.</p><p> There are some specific programmes that could make a real difference if they were provided nationwide.  A young man from Galway addressed the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  He told members of an after-school programme he attended that gave him one-on-one support to deal with difficulties he had in achieving his potential in school.  It helped him to progress to third level education.  Programmes such as this, which have been shown to work, should be mainstreamed because they have the potential to make a significant difference.</p><p> I look forward to the recommendations of this committee across all areas.  We particularly need to have mechanisms for monitoring to ensure the recommendations it makes are implemented.  On the recommendations the committee will make on education, it will be important that the education committee work with this committee to ensure that the work of both committees contributes to positive change for Traveller children and their families. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.674" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019112600002#F00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I am a PhD student at Trinity College Dublin and I am also a Traveller.</p> <p>  I believe that education is one of the major problems facing the Traveller community and the most pressing one in many ways, at least from my perspective.  Only 1% of Travellers have a third level qualification.  This is quite a bleak statistic that needs to be addressed and changed.  The existence of this special Oireachtas committee is a positive sign and one that I hope can help bring positive change to the community.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my written submission, there are many issues facing Traveller participation in education at all levels.  These include cost, unfamiliarity, discrimination and fear.  I have also suggested some provisional potential solutions to these issues, particularly the creation of Traveller scholarships and a deliberate policy of focusing on Traveller children in late primary and early secondary school.  When I refer to education I do not mean only my own route through to a university education but education in the broad sense of further education courses and apprenticeships, as well as universities.  It would be a mistake to adopt a one-size-fits-all approach.  This extends beyond the Traveller community to the wider community.  Education in all the different areas should be encouraged based on people's interests and skills and what they want to do.</p> <p>  Some of the problems I have outlined in my submission are generational that will only change with time.  However, in the case of some of the other problems, if concerted action was taken now, it would create a push to help change.  Some of the problems I have outlined are costs and unfamiliarity.  Focusing on Traveller children in later primary school and early secondary school and creating scholarships would encourage a greater number of Travellers to continue in education than is currently the case.  The ideal hope would be that pursuing policies such as this, at least for a certain period, would help to create a critical mass which would then self-perpetuate.  I believe the numbers doing so are currently too small and they are more of an anomaly so the position is not sustainable.  We will see a real change in Travellers' educational attainments if action is taken now rather than pushing the issue down the road.</p></speech>

It is helpful in our deliberations in this committee.  We have a report to produce and we will be making recommendations based on what we have heard.  I thank them accordingly.</p> <p>  Will Deputy O'Sullivan expand a little on the reduced hours?  That is news to me.  How does that work on a practical level?  If the children all go into school at the same time, are some of the children then sent home at a particular time?  She might expand on that because it is the first time I have heard about that.</p> <p>  It sounds like the Tobar programme should be mainstreamed.  We might think a little more about that in terms of our recommendations.  Dr. O'Doherty talked a lot about the children and their ambitions, and Mr. McDonagh did the same.  I wonder about reaching the parents to encourage the children.  Clearly, they have a considerable influence on their children.  In any community, if parents have ambitions for their children, the children will do well.  Is there any programme to share with parents how there is potential there and possibilities for the children that the parents themselves may never have had?  Is that a direction the witnesses would consider?  Maybe it is happening somewhere.  Is it something that we could be looking at as well?</p> <p>  I deal a lot with young Traveller families.  I notice that they are young.  There is nothing unusual in that to my age group.  I was married at 25.  By then, some of my school friends were married for five years and had children.  They got married at 19 and 20.  Mr. McDonagh touched on culture.  Is that shifting in the Traveller community now, although a little slower than it did in the settled community?  For example, it would be unusual for my children's generation to get married at the age I did.  They are marrying later.  Is there anything there that we need to be looking at, for instance, in terms of encouraging people to remain in education longer?  It struck me, as Mr. McDonagh was talking, as something that may be worth looking at as well.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy.  First of all, we published a draft interim report from the Joint Committee on Education and Skills.  Maybe I could ask that the report be circulated to all the members of this committee, which would be useful, and that we keep in touch with this committee.  As I said, we had an interaction with the Department of Education and Skills recently and we will be returning to the subject and issuing a final report.</p> <p>  To be quite honest, it came as a bit of a surprise to all of us, as members of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills as well.  We were looking, first of all, at Traveller education separately, and the representatives of Travellers groups told us about reduced timetables being a big issue for Traveller families.  We subsequently decided we would conduct a full investigation on the issue and we found that other groups were similarly affected.  For example, AsIAm, which represents those who are on the autism spectrum, came in and presented and it turned out that it was a very significant issue for children on the autism spectrum as well.</p> <p>  One of the worrying elements about it is that it is only supposed to be used rarely and as a last resort, but in practice it appears to be used, certainly by some schools, whereby the parent gets a phone call to collect the child and the child has to be taken home, but there would not be advance discussion with the parents as to whether this is a good or bad thing.  In some limited situations, for example, where a child has a real phobia about school or whatever, the parents might say that it is good that the child does not have to spend the full day in school.  In the majority of cases, however, it appears to have been purely the school acting off its own bat.  Obviously, the school is much more powerful than the parent in many situations.  Many parents themselves might have had a bad experience of school and would not feel that they could argue for their child in an equal way.  This is another recommendation that we made, that there must be at least an equal relationship and that it should be with the agreement of a parent if reduced timetables are used.</p> <p>  No data are collected because these are not expulsions.  This is something that the Department has stated it will correct.</p><p>Expulsions are recorded.  Reduced timetables are not considered to be expulsions and, in some cases, a parent is made to feel that if he or she does not accept a reduced timetable, his or her child is at risk of expulsion.  It is a really difficult issue for many families.  By bringing it out into the open and insisting that data on it will be collected, that there will be proper engagement with parents and that it will only be used as a last resort, the system will change.</p><p> The managerial bodies and representatives of principals and deputy principals all stated that it should only be used on very rare occasions, but we obtained evidence that it is used quite a lot in practice.  This means that a significant number of Traveller children and children with special needs are not getting access to their right to a full timetable in school.  If they fall back, it is much more difficult for them to gain a proper education.  It is a matter of rights.  If this committee and the Joint Committee on Education and Skills argue strongly that this simply has to change, it will make a difference in the context of opportunities for Traveller children and children in some of the other categories.</p></speech>

The Minister for Education and Skills will come before the committee next week.  We can ask him what action is being taken on foot of the report.  It would be helpful for us to make common cause with the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on this matter which, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan stated , was hidden in plain sight and not officially documented by the Department.  This practice affects Traveller children in particular and children with special needs.  Dr. O'Doherty was asked some specific questions.</p></speech>

It is very important that we create supports so that families have ambitions.  Not everybody wants to become a teacher.  We are working on initial teacher education access, but students may have had poor experiences of teachers in school.  We need to invest in creating career trajectories for young people, beginning at second or even primary level, and support them along the way to enable them to choose who they would like to be.  They would then know that they need to do the leaving certificate and get points in order to do that.</p> <p>  If a child has been put on a restricted timetable, the level of ambition and encouragement to attend school is not very strong when he or she feels unwelcome.  One of the issues is that children who want to become teachers at primary level must have higher level leaving certificate Irish.  As part of our support for students, we have provided grinds and Irish language classes on campus and in homes.  We are offering trips to the Gaeltacht, which other children go on, to support them.  We do not want to dilute the entry requirement; rather, we are enabling students to reach that target.</p> <p>  Our project officer has spent a lot of time working with families because the whole family sends a student to school.  Students cannot achieve their goals without the support of their parents and siblings.  While parents are very supportive of and ambitious for their children in many ways, they know they cannot afford certain things and many children feel they do not want to put an undue burden on their families in order to go to college, which is very expensive.  Working with families, raising expectations and knowing that the system can be trusted are all important.</p> <p>  In our written submission we raised the fact that many students feel they cannot trust the system, even the higher education system, because when the very small number of Travellers who attend third level are awarded degrees they cannot get employment.  We are supporting people through the different transitions from primary to post-primary and post-primary to third level, but a lot of support is needed in terms of retention in third level and transition to the workforce.</p> <p>  Structured support was mentioned.  The time has come to make sure there is specific structured support for these students, over and above what might be given to other candidates.  Poverty and disadvantage are intergenerational.</p><p>I think that needs a lot of support.  Now is the time, and I think Mr. McDonagh said it extremely well, to grasp that when we have work like the PATH project happening in different higher educational organisations, supporting Travellers through teacher education or through education generally.</p></speech>

In regard to the parents, I think they should be brought in and be very closely involved.  One idea that should at least be considered is a focus on Traveller children in primary and early secondary school, perhaps by some kind of external mechanism would bring in the parents.  Both of my parents supported me for my educational route, and I went a long way.  I always asked if I was doing something, what was going to be the result?  Given that many Travellers do not have secondary educations never mind a completed third level qualification, there is not the same awareness of what is going to be the point of something or what one will achieve out of it.  If one includes the parents and career advisers who can explain that if one wants to be an accountant or a school teacher one has to do a certain thing - one needs at least a leaving certificate or one has to do an apprenticeship or one needs a particular degree.  We must at least provide the steps to show them how it is meant to be done.  For some Travellers, they feel like they cannot do that or that is really not their place.  This is about showing people this is how they can do it.  If there was a route that could be shown to them, that would help and encourage them that their children can do it.  It is very important to bring that in because, obviously, it is very hard for a child or teenager to do anything without parents' support.  This will help a lot to bring them in and, also, it is about being proud.  I was quite lucky in that regard but I cannot speak for everyone in that sense.</p> <p>  Culture was mentioned, people marrying young and that still exists today.  My own parents married quite young.  I am 23 years of age and I have not married, which is quite old in some sense depending on one's point of view, but I am doing a PhD.  If people are doing degrees, by definition they are probably not going to get married until afterwards.  That does not preclude people marrying before or during, but there is less of a possibility.  It depends on the educational route a person takes and obviously personal choice, so that is something that probably will change if there are more Travellers going onto higher educational routes, but that will be a generational change rather than an overnight one.</p></speech>

Their children get excluded, are on a reduced timetable, are getting bullied and listening to nasty words and hate speech.  Then there are the practicalities of the cost.  Staying in education is expensive.  There was a group in Cork who were saying that for people who did have their children younger, it was very often when their children were young that they were stimulated to go back into education.  I know that if Senator Ruane was in the room, she would have plenty to say about that.  There are different routes to education, and we do not always need to take the traditional or linear route.  It is important that all of those routes are open.</p></speech>

I wonder if there are any initiatives that would, for example, help Mr. McDonagh or others share why they decided to take the path they did.  We have had some wonderful presenters in here over the last few weeks, and I wonder if there is something like that out there where, for example, an expert farrier, a teacher, somebody doing a PhD could share their experience and say "if I can do it, you can do it".  There is obviously a need for such an initiave, but if there was something there, it could be built on.</p></speech>

I was quite lucky in my circumstances.</p><p>I never had a teacher who told me I could not do something.  I went to a school where most people did go to university.  If students performed academically, there was no reason for them to be told they would not be going, unless they chose not to go.</p><p> Having said that, however, my younger brother had a bad experience of school.  I refer to fighting, bullying and unsympathetic teachers.  The experience of education in my own family was, therefore, different.  My brother is doing an apprenticeship now.  He decided to go back into education and pursue a qualification, but one quite different from mine.  That is a good example.  Even though his experience in school was negative, he still decided that it was a good thing to return to education and to try to get a qualification because he was interested.  We cannot rely on lucky circumstances or having good teachers, however.  There are many good teachers, but many Travellers still do have a very good experience of school.  I did, but my brother did not.  I am perhaps rare in my experience rather than an example of what is normal for Travellers.  There needs to be more sustained encouragement to tell Travellers that they can pursue education and that it is not just for settled people.  Education should be seen as being for anyone.</p></speech>

We have students coming through who want their ethnicity to be identified and who want to be recognised as Travellers, but we also have some students who do not.  It is very hard on those students.  Even those students who have come through the Tobar project might not necessarily want that said to their peers.  They have to work through their own willingness to identify as a Traveller.  That is always a challenge for students and a very personal issue for them and their identity.  It would be wonderful if we had students, like Mr. McDonagh, who were willing to encourage others by telling them they can do this, but some students in the system do not want to be identified as Travellers for a variety of reasons, including fear.  That is a very hard situation to be in.  I would also like to mention that in initial teacher education programs, particularly in our institution, we certainly do much intercultural work to ensure students are exposed to as much information about Traveller culture and education as possible.  As was mentioned earlier, however, that process needs to go further and be part of professional development throughout teachers' careers.</p></speech>

Those flags are awarded to schools if they are inclusive and anti-racist.  Schools must have a whole programme on inclusion of Travellers and Traveller culture, but also on other potentially excluded cultures.  That programme is running in a limited number of schools, however.  Yellow flags will be presented to six schools in the audiovisual room here in Leinster House this Thursday, but there is no core funding for the programme.  If such funding existed, the programme could be expanded to many other schools.  I say that because some schools are Traveller friendly while others are not.  An inclusive programme of that sort for all schools would be very beneficial and would help with a situation such as that experienced by Mr. McDonagh's brother.  I refer to young Traveller children who feel they do not fit in school, are not being treated properly and are not fully included.</p></speech>

We heard that this morning about the yellow flag programme, the Tobar initiative and the Ballyfermot group, and it is important that this committee recommends action in this area.  These initiatives work, but they need mainstream funding and not to be dependent on philanthropic funds, as is the case with Tobar.  This is far too fundamental an issue for that to be the case.  We cannot leave things to the vagaries of philanthropists or occasional donors.  These programmes should be on a firm funding footing.  Traveller pride, for instance, an initiative similar to what Deputy Corcoran Kennedy described, is also funded on a shoestring.  It is important that proper resources and funding be put into these kinds of initiatives, and there should also be an examination of previous cuts that now need to be reversed.</p></speech>

However, some of my peers and people in my year left after they sat the intermediate certificate exam due to pressure from their families to leave school and earn money.  In fact, many of them became seamstresses.  However, my Ma and Da made sure that I remained in school until I sat my leaving certificate examination.  They wanted me to at least attain a leaving certificate, which I did, and then I commenced working in the public sector.  We are not trying to reinvent the wheel in terms of education.  This is a group of people who, like what happened to working class people in the past, were not encouraged to remain and continue in education.  The State made a conscious decision because first it needed people for jobs but they had to have attained a certain level of education and it recognised that people needed an education.  What is happening with Traveller education is a microcosm of what happened to working class people in the past.  The tragedy is that 45 years have elapsed and education should never have reached this stage.  This committee can put Traveller education on the agenda in terms of intercultural attitudes in all of the Departments, insist there is a change in mindset and secure funding for education.</p> <p>  My next comments are for Dr. O'Doherty and Mr. McDonagh.  Pavee Point has repeatedly referred to the fact that the scheme of visiting teachers for Travellers was discontinued.  The scheme had a very good impact on my community in Labre Park where a teacher visited the business school.  The families also brought their kids to the school, ensured their children were enrolled and tackled all of the associated problems.  Do the witnesses think that the visiting teacher scheme must be re-established?  We will not get kids into higher education if they do not attain primary and second level education. </p> <p>  We are talking about higher education and apprenticeships.  I agree with the witnesses that the one glove does not fit all and children need variety in terms of education.  I recall the time during my schooldays that a sister of a friend of mine, who was an air hostess, visited the school.  She told us about her job as an air hostess and how we could apply for such work on completion of the leaving certificate.  Such an initiative should be introduced for the Traveller community.  I mean that Traveller parents must be informed that their children, if they attain a certain level of education, can achieve certain things.  We must also give a commitment to bring those children through.  Only by doing structural things like that can we ensure we will not be here in ten or 15 years time talking about the same things.  </p></speech>

Parents will not realise it is important for their child to do honours Irish, for example, unless someone communicates that to them.  We need the visiting teacher structure right through the system but we must assist the children in schools and their parents to get through into second level and through the process.  We must also provide assistance all the way through to employment.  One needs a whole support system wherever that employment is whether it is an apprenticeship or higher education.  I say that because we have found that even with the students who have come through higher education are now postgraduates in teacher education.  They had negative experiences of trying to get jobs once they were qualified with a degree.  Assistance is not just needed at primary and post-primary levels, there must be structures right through.</p><p>I would also like there to be some sort of targeted entry route to professions, whether through apprenticeships or higher education, outside of the mainstream.  In our proposal, we suggested a structure whereby at junior cycle, if a student is identified as being high achieving and capable, he or she will be nurtured throughout the next two or three years, with a promise of a place in college if he or she satisfies the minimum entry requirements.  It would not be a matter of taking a place from another candidate.  They would be <i>ex quota </i>places dedicated to the Traveller community.  We need something as targeted and specialist as that now, which we did not have in the past for working class students.  Such special support will be necessary for the next five to ten years in order that in ten years, a greater number of successful candidates will come through the system and be able to become the bearer of that torch for their communities.  Currently, however, it is difficult for anyone with a degree to return to the community and say that, having done well, he or she cannot get a job, or that, having done well in the leaving certificate, he or she cannot get into college.  It would be useful to have a visiting teacher at primary and post-primary levels, right through to career support, identifying the career trajectories people might want, whether that is in the Garda, the Civil Service, nursing, the legal profession or teaching.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-26a.701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2019112600002#M00200"><p>The use of visiting teachers should be revived.  A clear need for it was felt at the time, and it was successful and worked.  Especially in Labre Park, it would help because the group knowledge is not there.  It is not normal.  Much like in the case of working class communities 40 years ago, or in Northern Ireland, where I am from, Catholic communities 50 years ago, if people are not used to a certain type of education, it might be that no one will tell the student what he or she has to do.  There are deadlines, and the student will have to pass examinations and choose which subjects to take.  It would be useful to have someone come to the school to explain that, even to the parents, which might be of more value because they can then tell the child why he or she is not studying Irish, or whatever the case might be.</p> <p>  Direct action is needed now because unless the infrastructure is provided for the routes that have been outlined, there will be no point talking about it.  There should be a targeted Irish Traveller scholarship.  The numbers would be quite small for the time being and, therefore, the cost for the State to bear would be quite low.  It would be worth pursuing.  If nothing is done to encourage the student when he or she is in primary or secondary school, there will be no point waiting until he or she is 16, 17 or 18 years old and saying, given that he or she has reached that far, that he or she might get a scholarship at that point, because there will not be enough students coming through the system even to partake in that.  It needs to be applied the whole way.</p> <p>  Likewise, there is not much point telling 11 year old children they can do this or that, and then, when they are 17 or 18 years old, telling them we have no way of helping them.  It needs to be consistent from a young age because many Travellers do not complete secondary school.  The age group of ten to 14 years old will probably be the most important to target and encourage that they can do something different.  They need to know they do not have to live how their parents did or to have no education qualifications.  They should not be afraid of doing something different.</p> <p>  Even the identification of negative experiences is important.  Statistics for Travellers at university depends on self-identification.  While I have had no issue with doing that, I do not blame others who would have an issue because there is a fear that it will have an impact on one's social circle and even job prospects.  It is like writing down the wrong address when applying for jobs.  Many people fear that stating they are a Traveller would only encourage a rejection, even if they were highly qualified for the role.</p></speech>

It was quite a good school.  During the summer I was concerned as to whether it would come up.  I moved into Trinity Halls and on my first proper day in Trinity someone said it would be horrendous to have a Traveller as a flatmate, which obviously was quite an interesting exposure to college.  I have been lucky that it has been quite a rare occurrence for me.  That was my first real impression of being in Trinity.  All of my friends know I am a Traveller but sometimes it takes a few months to say it.  Not everyone would say they are Traveller with people saying such things in front of them.  I have a strong Northern accent.  No one in Trinity thought I was a Traveller.  People see what they want to see and they see someone coming down from the North and that is all.  People will say what they usually think.  I do not blame Travellers for not wanting to say they are Travellers because quite rightly they fear it might impact on their social life or work life or even getting a job in the first place.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh mentioned early intervention.  Does he have statistics on Traveller participation in preschool education?  I imagine the children of most so-called middle class families who go to college probably had at least one year of preschool education.  Programmes such as Aistear and S&iacute;olta are in primary schools and preschool education and the quality can be very good.  I am not sure whether many Traveller children have access to preschool.  It means that when they go to school I imagine the majority of their classmates will have already had at least one free preschool year and now there is a second free year.</p></speech>

Living on the edge of the city it may be difficult to access one.  I do not know whether Mr. McDonagh has gathered statistics on this but perhaps there could also be intervention there and a conscious programme to facilitate Traveller families to have this opportunity.  I was involved in preschool education at one stage.  I was in Montessori.  Any data will tell us that the opportunities people get at a very early stage in their educational experience stands to them hugely later on.  It might be an issue.</p></speech>

People need to trust that when they send their little one to a cr&egrave;che, it is a welcoming place that understands them.  This has been a theme running from early years to primary to secondary level and Mr. McDonagh has given us examples of third level.  We will ask for the statistics on uptake of early education because that has an impact on people.  It is a positive experience and those children go on to thrive at primary level.</p> <p>  With regard to employment, that will be dealt with in our next module when we have finished with education.  There is 80% unemployment in an economy and society with almost full employment.  If people cannot see that the sacrifice of staying in education does not lead to a job because people are discriminated against in the workplace, that will also have to be tackled.  It is across all of the systems.</p></speech>

Giving Traveller children access to that could be very important.  I do not know whether any of the cr&egrave;ches or preschools in my area have Traveller children attending them.  Many are privately run and there is a cost factor.  Many poor people cannot afford to send their children to privately run cr&egrave;ches or preschools.  It is something which should be examined and supported very strongly by Governments.  </p><p> Early intervention is important because at that age children are at their best mentally to benefit from education.  They have a thirst for learning.  I fully concur with what Deputy O'Sullivan said.  The number of Traveller children who complete their education and go on to third level is very small compared with other groups in society.  Children have the ability but do not get a full education.  The loss to their community and our society as a consequence should be borne in mind.  </p></speech>

I imagine if someone does not have access to a community cr&egrave;che because there is significant pressure on places, parents who can afford to pay for extra hours in private services probably get preference over those who cannot.  I would prefer if all provision was public but the reality is that private facilities exist.  There needs to be some kind of positive programme which would allow access for Traveller children to vindicate their right to the free element of the two-year programme.</p></speech>

Given the drop-out rates for Travellers at all stages of education, it is too late to wait until the leaving certificate to intervene.  It does not matter how many scholarships are offered or university or apprenticeship schemes are in place if only a small number of Travellers get that far because they will not be effective.  The main thing is to build a critical mass of Travellers who have gone forward and will encourage others.  It is no good me being here on my own.  The numbers progressing are still quite small and there are too few to make this self-sustaining, unlike in the settled population where progression to third level is an acceptable route.</p></speech>

He referred to deliberate targeting, which was clear.  Firm recommendations have come from all witnesses today that affirmative action needs to happen from the early years, right through to primary, second and third level and into employment.  Initiatives that are working, like Yellow Flag, Tobar and Traveller pride events, need to be put on a firm footing so they are not operating on a wing and a prayer.  He also referred to scholarships, but unless the early work is done, they will have a limited impact.  His last point concerned legislation on hate speech to address racism towards Travellers.  I ask him to explain why it is one of his key recommendations and is so fundamental.</p></speech>

To put it bluntly, there are few things more dangerous than being a minority group in a democracy that does not like us.  We see political parties of all persuasions targeting Travellers as a way of gaining electoral support.</p><p>That is not a positive atmosphere to have around.</p><p> My experience has been being asked why I have many settled friends and why I am good friends with them.  Most of my friends are settled people.  I still believe there is a strong element within the Irish population who do not much like Travellers, and that is putting it mildly.  The same happens in Britain as in Ireland - passing laws that make it illegal to live like a Traveller.  It is burn them out or push them out.  The history of the State shows it in so many ways.  I refer to the anti-Traveller rhetoric in the D&aacute;il in the 1940s and 1950s.  There is the Report of the Commission on Itinerancy.  It has increasingly created more of a dangerous atmosphere for Travellers.  I am not saying it is life and death, but that is not the point in some sense.  However, it is bad.  Being anti-Traveller often wins candidates support, and unless something is done to address that, it will only get worse.</p><p> In fairness, the State has made some improvements.  Obviously, there was the formal recognition in 2017, but as I say, formal recognition is in some ways meaningless if no steps are taken to safeguard and protect that group.</p><p> By addressing hate speech, it would make it illegal to incite hatred or provoke anger, whether it be through the burning of a halting site, the blocking of halting sites, getting a Traveller removed from a housing estate or whatever the case may be.  By doing that, the hope in the short term is that it will discourage it.  It will not change the current generation's perception or opinions.  There is no such thing as an overnight cure.  The point is that it becomes a long-term process of changing views to recognise that it is wrong to do that.</p><p> I have mentioned many problems but all of my solutions are not overnight solutions.  These are ten or 20-year solutions.  That is the best way of viewing that.  Unless something is done now, there were will be same ideas in 20 years.</p></speech>

Many people made presentations to the committee.  There is, at best, inertia.  There is indifference and then there is the institutionalised racism.  I refer to the lack of progress and the lack of good initiatives, and the initiatives that have not had the impact that they were meant to have.  Repeatedly, for example, we see the local authorities not spending their budgets or the funding allocated to them.  In employment, we see where employers, both in the State sector and in the private sector, routinely discriminate against Travellers in terms of access to jobs.  In offering rental accommodation, landlords also discriminate against Travellers.  It is right across the system.  Mr. McDonagh would seem to be giving the committee a strong message that it is most important that there would be strong hate speech laws that can underpin progress not only in education but across all the other areas as well.</p></speech>

It is like the social media comments following the Carrickmines disaster.  Quite a few were quite pleased they had died in such a tragic way.  Obviously, it was horrendous for the families.  Speaking myself as a Traveller, there is a clear indication my death in a sense would at least be welcome by some people on that basis alone rather than anything else.  That is partly why the law is necessary.  Some people would consider it worth glorifying this horrendous tragedy as if it was a good thing now that there are fewer of them.  Obviously, that may only be a minority opinion but it is certainly a vocal one, and it is one that finds some political support in Irish society.</p></speech>

It is also helpful to have her insights, as a former Minister, on how to move the system.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Teresa O'Doherty.  While it is great to hear of positive initiatives, it is disappointing to note that they are run on goodwill and are not deliberate, mainstream, State-funded efforts.  Mr. Patrick McDonagh shared with us very thoughtful insights based on his experience and gave his perspective as a historian, especially on developments around attitudes to Travellers and what has changed and needs to change.  He also made very strong recommendations, which the committee will note.  I thank all witnesses for their presentations and for dealing with members' questions in such a comprehensive manner.  They have given us plenty of ideas for questions to put to Minister and his officials, as well as the representatives of various other bodies who will appear before the committee next week.
