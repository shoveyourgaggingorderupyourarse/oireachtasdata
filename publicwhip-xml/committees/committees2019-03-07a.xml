    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019030700002#B00100"><p>We are joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness at the committee.  He is joined by Mr. Mark Brady, the deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.</p> <p>  I propose we postpone dealing with the business of the committee and meet directly with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As people are aware, he will be here until lunchtime after which he will go before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We will probably have a session very early in the afternoon to deal with the routine business of the committee's correspondence and to complete the periodic report that has been discussed several times in private session.  That will also be in private session.  We will also discuss the annual report that will be launched next week.  The annual report is a statistical compilation of all of the meetings and witnesses but does not have conclusions or recommendations.  It is just a summary of the work.</p> <p>  Before we begin I want to deal with an issue.  We issued an invitation to the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure at Reform, Robert Watt, and in the letter of invitation we specifically asked for Mr. Paul Quinn to come along and for officials from the Department of Health with responsibility for the health Vote to come along.  The position, and I am conscious of it, is the first reason we asked Paul Quinn to come along was we received a letter from him some time ago in his role in the Office of Government Procurement.  He is also a member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  Our interest in Mr. Quinn relates to his role specifically on that board.  Members of the board and representatives from the Department of Health have come before the committee but Mr. Quinn was not at the previous meeting.  We have requested him to come before the committee.  The appropriate time for Paul Quinn to come before the committee is when the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board comes back before the committee because what we want to talk to him about is his role as a director of that board.  I do not have the names today but I am inclined to suggest any other public servant on that board should also be here that day.  A key element of our work is the interaction between public servants and the State bodies and boards they serve on and the lines of communications with the relevant Minister.</p> <p>  The main issue for today's meeting is capital projects and not the children's hospital.  We have dealt with the children's hospital previously and we have agreed to come back to it again as soon as the report on the cost overruns is ready, when the national paediatric hospital development board will come before the committee again.  That is the meeting we will need Mr. Quinn to attend in his capacity as a director of the board and I expect he will be here on that day.</p> <p>  I will now throw it open to comment.  It is a valid point.  We read Mr. Quinn's detailed letter at a previous meeting.  Some people may have read it and others may not.  His line Minister in respect of his role on the board is the Minister for Health who appointed him to the board.  It is a health function.  Members may comment.  I am laying out the context.  As he pointed out in his letter, he has he has no role with regard to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of his membership of the board of directors, as I understand it.  People might disagree with this.  His reporting structure is to the Department of Health and the Minister for Health.  We said this at the previous meeting.  Several members have indicated and we will proceed with the meeting.  I am most dissatisfied that this invitation was issued a month ago but we learned only late last night that Mr. Quinn was not coming here today.  That is a source of annoyance and aggravation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019030700002#B00200"><p>Was that communication from Mr. Quinn himself?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019030700002#B00300"><p>No, it was from the Secretary General of the Department.  All the communication is through the Accounting Officer.  As is normal, the Accounting Officer decides whom he or she brings to the meeting.  We have never refused to accept a witness that an Accounting Officer wanted to bring.  There is respect on both sides.  If an Accounting Officer brings in witnesses we respect those witnesses but we also expect respect whereby if we ask for someone specifically that person will come to the meeting.  I have considered the matter and the appropriate time for Mr. Quinn to be here is as a member of the board of directors of the paediatric hospital.  That is my opening observation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019030700002#B00400"><p>I do not accept that at all.  It is very unsatisfactory that Mr. Quinn is not here today.  My first comment in response to the Chairman's observation is we need to be careful we do not undermine our own work.  The committee, as a committee, decides who to invite and when to invite them.  We decided as a committee that we would invite Mr. Quinn to attend today with the Secretary General of the Department.  All of the correspondence sent to Mr. Quinn was about today's meeting.</p></speech>

With regard to the invitation to the meeting we specifically asked for Mr. Quinn.  That is a matter for the committee.  It is not a matter for Mr. Watt.  Neither is it a matter for the Chairman to unilaterally decide-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019030700002#B00900"><p>I have not decided anything.  I made an observation the same as the Deputy is doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019030700002#B01000"><p>-----when it is best for Mr. Quinn to appear before the committee.  I have no difficulty if he wants to come in on two occasions, if the Department and the board come before the committee again.  If Mr. Quinn wants to come before the committee again as a board member that is fine but we were looking for him as the head of the Office of Government Procurement and somebody who also sat on the board.  He is in a unique position.</p> <p>  The Chairman said we learned of this only last night.  As members of the committee we have to prepare for meetings.  A lot of the preparation was about the minutes relating to Mr. Quinn's involvement as a board member.  Some of them relate to the joint committees on construction and finance, where he is cited, including on 30 August 2018.  We cannot put any of the questions we prepared for him because he is not here and we learned of it at the very last minute.</p> <p>  We have an opening statement from Mr. Watt that runs to 18 pages and he does not mention the national children's hospital once.  I accept it is not the basis on which he is coming before the committee, which is a much broader remit, but, at the same time, in the documentation he sent us on the major projects in Project Ireland 2040 the national children's hospital is the second major project listed.  It is one of the major projects but Mr. Watt does not reference it once in his statement.  This is a clear tactic by the Accounting Officer.  I am putting it on the record that from my perspective there is an attempt by some at the top of the public service to kick back against the Committee of Public Accounts and we are seeing it more and more.  Here is another example of it.  We have to stand our ground as a committee.  We do our best.  We ask questions without fear or favour.  There are a lot of issues and questions surrounding the spend on the national children's hospital and a number of Departments are involved in its oversight, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p> The Accounting Officer for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of these issues and we have reasonable questions we want to put.  I do not want this to be a game that is being played by senior civil servants.  The Accounting Officer is due to appear before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach today.  There was an attempt to play one committee off against the other through the media a number of weeks ago.  That is not good enough.  It is not a good way for an Accounting Officer to treat committees of the Oireachtas.  That is my opinion, and mine only.  I say that in the context of putting all of this on the record.</p><p> I will conclude, particularly as other members wish to comment.  I am deeply disappointed that Mr. Quinn is not here.  Up to last night, we were under the impression that he would be.  We prepared for it and he should be here because he was invited to appear.  It is not for Mr. Watt alone to decide who comes before us.  He can bring whomever he wants from his Department but, from my perspective, if we make a specific request for someone to be here, then we should be able to expect that he or she will appear.</p></speech>

We have reached a stage where the level of contempt with which Oireachtas committees in general are being treated is unacceptable.  The notion of pesky politicians having the effrontery to ask questions in the public interest when it comes to the expenditure of public of public money and how that is being treated is wrong.  We had correspondence from Mr. Watt, or certainly from his Department, previously stating that the Accounting Officer would decide what team he or she would bring.  I had understood that this committee decides who it wants to come before it and they do so.  Is that not the case?  Do we not decide?</p></speech>

No one else is accountable.  An Accounting Officer is free to come on his or her own if he or she so chooses.  Regularly, they bring officials with them to assist the progress of the meeting but that is at the behest of the Accounting Officer.  No official below the grade of Accounting Officer is obliged to appear at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

I am trying to put the matter on the public record.  There is a practice of Accounting Officers coming in here and bringing people with them.  There have been several occasions when we named people we would like to accompany an Accounting Officer.  On all such occasions previously, there was that level of co-operation and that person came but, technically, it was always at the behest of the Accounting Officer as to who he chose to bring.  As already stated, I am of the view that it was disrespectful for us to hear last night that a person we had asked to come us was not going to do so.  However, that is at the behest of the Accounting Officer.  Paul Quinn or any other assistant secretary or senior officer is not answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts; it is only an Accounting Officer who is answerable to us.  I just want to put that on the record.</p></speech>

We got a hint in previous correspondence that, in effect, this person would not be made available; it said that the Accounting Officer would decide.  That is fine.  He is within the rules.  Can the Chairman, the clerk or whomever advise on who we should petition to change the rules?  If we are examining public expenditure and there are people who are heads of particular functions such as public procurement and the Committee of Public Accounts, because of some euphemistic interpretation of the practice or the rules, is precluded, in a vexatious fashion, from talking to those people, that is wrong.  I totally disagree with the Chairman's assessment to the effect that, because this person served on the board, it was a matter for the Department of Health and that we would be looking at that again.  I am sorry.  It is coincidental that the man happened to be on the board.  The reality is that his function is public procurement and when we are looking at matters like tendering and so on, what that individual has to say adds value.  If he does not have anything of value to add - I am sure Mr. Watt will be perfectly fluent in answering all those questions to do with tendering later - perhaps there is some other person who could be brought in.  I do not care but I see this as proff of officialdom's continued annoyance with the Committee of Public Accounts in the context of its role in asking questions.  If we are to put up with this kind of thing, we might as well declare an actual dictatorship - instead of the virtual one in which we are currently living - and abolish committees because the tail is wagging the dog.</p> <p>  I have read this opening statement and, frankly, the most political of political speeches by any Minister in the past, from whatever party, would barely be as good at blowing one's own trumpet in the context of policy.  We are not interested necessarily in policy today, as Mr. Watt well knows.  We are interested in the intricacies of why &euro;1 billion of the public's money, which this time last year was not going to be needed, is now needed and all we have is an 18-page document from the chief officer responsible to this committee in which he manages not to mention the national children's hospital once.  That is tantamount to giving a Harvey Smith to the committee.  It is giving us the two fingers and stating, "We will do what we want, when we want".  The document also lists a series of suggested improvements that will be made at some stage in the future but, as always, there is no accountability to the public.</p></speech>

We had a discussion about this last week and, essentially, this is entirely within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts because it is about process and failures of process.  We need to understand those failures.  It appears that there is an institutional gap and yet we cannot explore that with this official in the context of his exact remit.  For example, would he be looking at industry norms relating to bids for a contract in terms of whether it is good tendering practice and what advice he might be able to give us.  There is no point in having the head of Government procurement, who effectively can control the purchase of biros, give advice and ensure that proper procurement happens if we do not have people controlling the big projects about which the public will be concerned relating to the way tendering happens and how a particular type of arrangement happens.  I refer, for example, to a special committee and the control there is of that.  It would be enormously helpful to us given that he has the dual roles of being head of the Office of Government Procurement and also having been on the board of the national children's hospital.  He is in a unique position to give us that insight.  We said that this morning would be about capital projects and control of capital projects.  One would have to ask whether he has a role in this at all.  I would have liked to ask him about his role.  I have to say I am deeply angry that the decision has been made to essentially exclude him from that discussion, which I believe is a very valid discussion.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinn gave written evidence to this committee on 25 February and that came on headed paper from the Office of Government Procurement.</p></speech>

It came on the headed paper of the Office of Government Procurement.  He made a number of assertions in that written correspondence, which I personally would have liked to have tested today given that he is the person in charge of Government procurement.  As far as I am concerned, this is the meeting where that evidence should have been tested because we are dealing with major capital projects - tendering and procurement.</p><p>Mr. Quinn is the person who has the answers to those questions.  It is unfortunate that we are not able to test evidence from a witness who has given written evidence to the committee.  Mr. Watt will have to explain why he did not choose to bring Mr. Quinn to this meeting.   I hope for Mr. Watt's sake that he has all of the answers to the questions we are going to be asking.  If he does not, it was he who decided that the very person who does have those answers was not needed.  That was a judgment call on Mr. Watt's behalf and it remains to be seen whether that was a good decision.  We will know that at the end of the proceedings today.                    </p></speech>

I know Mr. Watt well since he worked with us in Government previously.  We will ask him many questions and I am sure he will do his best to answer them.  On the specific detail, however, Mr. Watt will not be able to delve down to the same level in his answers as the man who has been sitting on the board and who is also head of procurement for the whole country.</p></speech>

That is fine.  I have no issue with that.  That was some weeks ago.  It goes beyond what is reasonably fair, or the right way in which to act, to send a letter the night before a meeting.  We are after spending a long time preparing and expecting that we would have the head of public procurement in Ireland in front of the committee.  The Chair has expressed his annoyance at that.  Before we start today, however, I expect, and ask, the Chair to make it very clear that it is not an appropriate way to deal with things.</p></speech>

It would be very helpful to have Mr. Quinn appear.  As it stands, however, we need to address those questions to the Accounting Officer today.  I think it would have made sense to have Mr. Quinn here.  He is particularly important.   As has been stated, he has communicated using the headed paper of the Office of Government Procurement where his title is given as the Chief Procurement Officer.  Mr. Quinn also sat on the financial sub-committee, as well as the procurement sub-committee of the board of the national children's hospital.  I accept the remit of this committee and that it has to be the Accounting Officer who appears before us according to the rules.  The Chair has a duty to lay that out as he has done.  How we can see if the governance is working, within that restriction, is the question.</p> <p>  The nominee of the State had a particular role on that committee.  He stated that he was there in a personal capacity but he actually had a particular role to report back.  He set that out and I thank him for doing that.  He set out on 25 February the circumstances within which he would have to go back to his Minister in that situation.  I refer to where there were serious weaknesses in controls or a strategic or reputational risk etc.  We know there was a serious reputational risk.  It would be helpful, therefore, to have Mr. Quinn here today.  It will be interesting to see how the Accounting Officer can deal with these questions without having Mr. Quinn.  I think we should proceed with the meeting and find out how Mr. Watt can deal with the obvious gaps.    </p></speech>

Given what has been reported, however, this needs to be aired here.  A journalist tweeted that he overheard Mr. Watt, following a conversation with the Chair outside of this room, state that the Chair should control the mob, that mob being the Members of this committee.  I think that is outrageous, if that is the case.  I am stating that is what has been reported.  It feeds into what was said earlier about there being serious push-back by senior representatives.  If that was said, it is completely unacceptable.  That occurred before the Accounting Officer had even come before this committee and he is appearing on foot of reasonable and genuine criticisms put forward by members of this committee.  I stress that is what has been reported.  We will put it to Mr. Watt when he comes in that he has referred to members of this committee as "a mob".</p></speech>

By way of public information, I want to state that this is highly frustrating.  The public are watching this.  I am on public record for the last fortnight stating that Mr. Quinn was coming before this committee today.  We had understood that and had issued the invitation to the Secretary General as the Accounting Officer.  We had also named Mr. Paul Quinn.  There has never been a situation, that I can recall, where a named senior official requested to come before this committee has not appeared.   We are in very strange territory.  It was discourteous to this committee for the person not to be here and also to only hear about this late last night.</p></speech>

When we all received this letter via email yesterday evening, a member of this committee, or at least one, immediately sent that to a journalist.  The journalist then rang me and he had our letter.  I have no idea who that member was, but someone on this committee immediately forwarded that letter to a journalist the minute it arrived last night.  I will give another similar example of what has happened with a member of the committee in the past week or so.  An item of correspondence was received by the secretariat and circulated to the members.  The officials later spotted an embarrassing typing mistake in that particular document.  I use those words carefully.  The officials immediately phoned the relevant Department, stated the document had been received and circulated but that there was an embarrassing typing mistake, from the perspective of the Department.</p><p>However, the Department stated it had already had an inquiry from a journalist on the matter.  Within an hour of our correspondence being circulated to members of this committee, a member forwarded our correspondence to journalists so that a journalist could contact the Department.  A member of this committee gave it to the journalist and it was not the journalist's fault.  Our interim and periodic reports are not being circulated because one member forwards them on to journalists the minute he or she gets it.  This is dreadful.  I have no idea who this member is but this is what we are dealing with.  Some of the fault for the item being seen on Twitter or in the papers lies within this committee.</p><p> For the information of the public, approximately 40 or 41 Votes are approved by the Oireachtas for Estimates each year and there are 15 Secretaries General or Accounting Officers.  An Accounting Officer is often the Accounting Officer for a group of Votes within a Department.  Mr. Robert Watt is the Accounting Officer for the Office of Government Procurement.  Mr. Paul Quinn is not an Accounting Officer and is not answerable to this committee.</p></speech>

I know the Chairman is quoting the letter of the law but if that was the case, this committee would have 40 witnesses annually and nobody else.  Would the work of this committee, including the positive outcomes for which it has been responsible in the past, have been possible if we had limited our output to 40 individual witnesses, namely, the 40 Accounting Officers for each Vote?  With respect to the clerk to the committee, this question is for the Chairman.  If we want to take a literal interpretation, that is fine.  I asked a question of the clerk at the beginning but got no answer.  How do we change these rules if we are not happy about them?</p></speech>

We have been dealing with the point Deputy MacSharry raised and we dealt with six different Votes in the group of Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach recently.  We had all the legal officers in on one day, such as the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor and a group of other bodies.  We have regularly combined groups within a Vote and an Accounting Officer covers three or four Votes.  The head of the Prison Service was here recently with representatives of the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for the Prison Service, and technically the head of the Prison Service did not need to come.</p> <p>  We have an exact and specific remit from the Committee on Procedure and Mr. Robert Watt is the Accounting Officer for the Office of Government Procurement.  One of the reasons we spoke about Mr. Quinn was that we wanted to ask how they got a derogation from the Office of Government Procurement in relation to the national children's hospital.  The letter we got details the fact that the derogation was granted by the Government contracts committee for construction at a consultative committee forum for the discussion and development of policy in the tendering and contracting of all aspects of construction projects.  The derogation was granted by the Government contracts committee for construction, the chairman of which is here today as a witness, namely, Mr. David O'Brien.  Mr. Paul Quinn was not part of that process.  We have the chairman of that office and the Accounting Officer for the Office of Government Procurement present today and we will have Mr. Paul Quinn here in a matter of weeks when we get the report on the cost overrun.</p> <p>  They are the rules of the House relating to who is allowed to be here.  I find it discourteous that the specific request we made was not granted but, by the same token, if the committee was so minded, we could have told Mr. Robert Watt that he had to be here on his own and without back-up.  A level of courtesy should work both ways.  We are disappointed but they are the rules.  If people want to change, it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure.</p></speech>

I am not being technical because of what has happened recently.  I understood, all along, that Mr. Quinn was responsible to the line Minister relating to the cost overrun.  The line Minister appointed him to the board and he was the Minister for Health, not the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

We perfectly understand the rule that the Accounting Officer is Mr. Watt.  He can come on his own but Accounting Officers often bring officials with them to help.  We have had Accounting Officers from universities and institutes of technology on questions of finance and they brought their finance officers.  I believe there is a reason Mr. Quinn is not here today and that it was a decision taken by Mr. Watt.  We will ask him when he comes in.</p> <p>  Nobody was under the impression that Mr. Quinn was an Accounting Officer, that he had to be here or that he could be compelled to be here.  However, he was asked, in a courteous way through Mr. Watt, to be here.  We can blame members of the committee for leaking information and we know it happens but the Department was also quoted in the media which I have seen.  The Department is well able to spin too and to brief the media.  Let us not put all the blame on members of the committee.  There are undoubtedly members who unfairly leak documents, of which I and other members have to learn through the media.  One of these was the story about Mr. Quinn not coming in, which we received media queries about.  The way we found out about the decision not to allow him to be here was discourteous.</p></speech>

We have to finish at 1 p.m. because Mr. Watt is scheduled to meet another Oireachtas committee and that committee is entitled to its slot.  The situation is unsatisfactory but I spelled out the remit of the committee because members of the public are watching and they may not have been aware of it.  Other Members of the Oireachtas may also not have been aware of our remit because they say that we are always going beyond our remit when we do not.  I hope those Members are listening.</p></speech>

The focus of today's meeting is the Department's role in ensuring that value for money is achieved through the systematic appraisal and professional management of all capital projects.  We also wish to explore the role of public officials on State boards.  The matter for consideration today initially arose from our meeting with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  We will be engaging with that board again in the coming weeks.  Ten major capital projects that are currently in various stages of development are listed before us.  One of these is the national children's hospital.  I want to put the &euro;140 billion of expenditure under this plan in context.  The children's hospital represents about 2% of that amount.  The committee is concerned that the issues affecting that project will arise in other major projects.  We wish to know what control mechanisms are in place to deal with that.  We want to ensure that commitments given are delivered within cost and that value for money is achieved.  We are here today to discuss not just one project, but several projects.</p> <p>  We are joined today by Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Mr. David O'Brien, principal officer at the Office of Government Procurement.  Mr. O'Brien is also the chairman of the Government contracts committee for construction, is that correct? </p></speech>

We are also joined by Mr. David Feeney, principal officer, and Ms Ciara Morgan, assistant principal officer.  Members should note that Mr. Watt is the Accounting Officer for the Office of Government Procurement.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off all mobile phones.  If they are merely put on silent mode they will still interfere with the recording system.  </p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are also reminded of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a member of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol. </p><p>Before I call on Mr. Watt I note that we had quite a discussion on the non-appearance of Mr. Paul Quinn, whose attendance the committee has specifically sought.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, who is the first speaker, may want to raise that issue.  I will not get into it any further but I wish to put the witnesses on notice.</p><p>Another matter I wish to raise is a comment in connection with this committee which was tweeted a few moments ago and attributed to Mr. Watt.  Perhaps Deputy O'Brien wishes to raise it.  I request that Mr. Watt clarify it.  This is a very specific point before we get into the business of the meeting.  It only arose in the last few minutes.  </p></speech>

Nobody in the committee heard it.  We were in here doing our business.  It was reported by a very responsible journalist that Mr. Watt was quoted as saying that the Chair, Deputy Fleming, "has to control the mob", the mob being members of this committee.  If that was the case it would be deeply unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

This has an important role to play in alleviating capacity constraints that might otherwise restrict economic and social progress.  Value for money is the key policy objective and policy seeks to support efficient and sustainable public investment.</p> <p>  The selection, appraisal, and delivery of individual public capital projects is the responsibility of each relevant Department.  My Department is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the national development plan within Project Ireland 2040, supporting value for money and protecting sustainable capital investment of the State.  In that context, I will discuss very briefly Project Ireland 2040 and progress in rolling out the different projects; the existing processes for selection, appraisal and delivery of public sector capital projects, including governance; and the plans in place to strengthen those processes.</p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 was launched a year ago.  As Deputies are aware, it seeks to achieve ten strategic outcomes building around the overarching themes of well-being, equality and opportunity.  It consists of the national development plan and the national planning framework and it seeks the alignment of investment with the spatial outcomes set out in the planning framework.  Project Ireland 2040 moves beyond the approach of the past, which saw public investment spread too thinly and investment decisions that did not align with a spatial strategy.  These practices contributed to some of the major issues that we face today as a country, particularly the predominance of Dublin in terms of economic growth and development, alongside the challenges facing rural communities.</p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040 seeks to develop Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford as viable cities of scale that can act as alternatives and a counterbalance to the continued growth of Dublin and its surrounding region.  These cities will act as drivers of growth for their wider regions and for rural areas.  Over the first ten years of Project Ireland 2040, &euro;116 billion will be invested and investment will reach 3.5% of national income - defined through GNI* rather than GDP - this year and over 4% of national income by 2027.  This significant acceleration in investment is in line with national and international analysis to the effect that Ireland's public capital infrastructure needs to be substantially strengthened to support the resilience of our economy in response to risks such as Brexit.  As Deputies are aware, public capital spending was necessarily impacted upon as the Government sought to restore the public finances during the recession.  This plan seeks to accelerate the necessary catch-up in public capital infrastructure.</p> <p>  There has been much recent commentary on the delivery of large-scale projects.  In that commentary, we can lose sight of the significant progress that is being made.  Project Ireland 2040 is already delivering better transport links, facilitating improved health and environmental outcomes and delivering more housing.  I will not go through the list of projects but I will highlight some of them.  The national road network is being upgraded and, for example, the M11 Gorey-Enniscorthy motorway will open to traffic later this year.  It is the largest project under way in the State and is currently scheduled to be completed on time and on budget.  Works will be started on key arteries on the N4, as Deputies know, the Ardee bypass, the N22 and many other projects.</p> <p>  To improve our international connectivity, works commenced on the new runway at Dublin Airport last month, which is due to be operational by 2021.  This is a significant project for Dublin Airport, and we can consider the time taken to deliver it compared with high-profile runways in our nearest neighbour.  It is a useful benchmark of the speed with which this project will be delivered.</p> <p>  There will be over 90 new school building projects in construction this year and over 300 schools will benefit from minor works improvements, while 2019 will see the completion of the national forensic mental hospital and the opening of 18 primary care centres throughout the country.  There will be 6,500 social housing units developed and when acquisitions and leased units are added, that figure will be reach 10,000.</p> <p>  The Bandon flood relief scheme will be completed this year, along with other flood relief schemes.  The projects upgrading the water supply in Drogheda and Dundalk will be completed this year and projects to address water quality and capacity in other towns and cities will also begin this year.  Sewerage schemes in Blanchardstown, Athlone and Liffey Valley will commence in 2019.</p> <p>  The majority of recent projects have been delivered on time and on budget, and I will highlight a few of them.  The N22 Tralee bypass was completed on time and at a cost of &euro;73.4 million, which is under budget.  The N25 Cork south ring road interchanges upgrade was completed at a cost of &euro;81.5 million, while the north docklands sewerage scheme was also completed.  The Waterford towns and villages wastewater project was also completed on budget at just under &euro;26 million, while phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena is expected to be completed ahead of schedule this March at a cost of &euro;26 million.  Notwithstanding the challenges that exist and which we will no doubt discuss later, this highlights the professionalism across many sectors in delivering public capital projects.</p> <p>  To support Departments as they work to achieve value for money in investment in capital infrastructure, a suite of key reforms has been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040 and its objectives.  The Land Development Agency has been set up by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure optimal use of State land.  Four new funds have been set up focused on urban and rural investment, climate action and disruptive technology to prioritise funding to the best projects, and they are being managed by the relevant line Department.  A construction sector group has been established to ensure regular and open dialogue between the Government and the construction sector, which is important in addressing various capacity and skills issues that exist in the sector, as well as the need for the Government and the system to work collaboratively with the sector in order to improve performance in the years ahead.</p> <p>  A Project Ireland 2040 delivery board meets regularly to ensure effective leadership of the implementation overhaul.  The investment projects and programmes office has been established in my Department to co-ordinate reporting on Project Ireland 2040 and drive reforms, including strengthened business cases and project appraisal.  A capital projects tracker is published on our website to inform citizens of the variety of projects being implemented in their area and to give a greater overview to the construction and infrastructure sectors.  The tracker is currently being updated.  A capacity and capability review of public sector bodies is being commenced in the Department to ensure that the State's delivery practices are to the highest standard.  This reflects a concern that the capacity and performance of bodies varies, depending on historical role in delivering infrastructure.  Given the scale of this project and the demands placed on Department that would not previously have managed projects, it was necessary to carry out a review of that capability.</p> <p>  As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland's capital management systems, the Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery and with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.</p> <p>  I will touch on the processes that are in place to ensure the effective selection, appraisal, delivery and oversight of capital projects.  Let me stress that the management, delivery and oversight of individual investment projects within the agreed allocations is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister. The Government receives regular reports informing it of actual expenditure and my Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that actual expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  In addition, the drawing down of funds from the Exchequer is monitored and reported on against profile on a monthly basis in the published Exchequer statement.</p> <p>  A range of processes and guidance is in place to support Departments and Ministers in securing value for money and I will discuss some of these as they relate to the public spending code and public procurement rules.  The public spending code is the set of rules, procedures, and guidance to ensure value for money in public expenditure.  The public spending code encompasses guidance on a variety of issues related to the management of expenditure at each stage of the expenditure cycle.  This includes central guidance on the application of appraisal and evaluation methodologies, including cost-benefit analyses.  The public spending code sets out the oversight and approval process for public expenditure proposals, including capital projects.  Governance and clear lines of responsibility are key to successful public capital investment.  The public spending code supports this by clearly setting out the responsibilities that lie with different roles.  These main roles are the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.</p> <p>  The Department or agency proposing and implementing a project is the sponsoring agency.</p><p>It is responsible for appraisal, planning, implementation, management and post-project review of the project.  The sponsoring agency is responsible for developing a project proposal, which is then submitted to the sanctioning authority for decision on approval at key designated gates in the project lifecycle.</p><p> The Department or body funding the project and which is responsible for project approval is the sanctioning authority.  It is responsible for approval in principle at the key gates in the project lifecycle, that is, following appraisal, approval to proceed to tender, and approval to accept a tender if the project has significantly changed, such as through an increase in costs.  The sponsoring agency is responsible for managing and monitoring the implementation of the project.  The sanctioning authority must be satisfied that the agency has appropriate systems to ensure that the project is delivered in line with what has been approved.  If adverse developments occur which affect the desirability or viability of the project, the sponsoring agency must report to the sanctioning authority.</p><p> Sponsoring agency and sanctioning authority roles can lie within separate public sector bodies.  The relevant local authority will typically be sponsoring agency and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be the sanctioning authority for a social housing regeneration project.  Sponsoring agency and sanctioning authority roles can also be within one body.  For example, for maintenance projects funded by local authorities, the local authority may be both the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.  For larger projects costing more than &euro;100 million - and this is a key point - the Government is the ultimate sanctioning authority.  For practical purposes, in respect of these projects, the relevant Department will lead on that project.</p><p> The public spending code is supplemented in some instances by sector-specific appraisal guidance.  These are developed by the relevant Department and set out additional requirements and parameters specific to the sector while remaining in line with the public spending code.  In the transport sector, for example, specific rules and cost-benefit analysis of transport projects may differ from the cost-benefit approach in other areas of public policy.</p><p> Public procurement rules cover the acquisition of works, supplies and services by public bodies.  National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations.  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime.</p><p> The high-level review and reporting structures set out in the public spending code are key to better project management and form the basis of the guidance material on project management that is set out in the capital works management framework, which was first published in 2007.</p><p> All public works projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the plan must be procured in accordance with the provisions laid out in the capital works management framework.  The framework is mandated by circular and was developed to provide an integrated set of contractual provisions, guidance material, technical templates and procedures which cover all aspects of the delivery process of a public works project from inception to final project delivery and review to assist contracting authorities in meeting their requirements.  The public works contract is a key component of the framework and is a lump sum, fixed-price contract which is used not on all projects but on most public works contracts.</p><p> This framework is maintained by the Office of Government Procurement in conjunction with the Government contracts committee for construction.  As mentioned, David O'Brien, who is with me today, is the chair of that committee.  The committee has representatives from all the main sanctioning authorities and bodies across the public service.  It is possible for public bodies to seek a derogation from the use of the standard forms of contract from the committee.  This process may be used for complex or large projects which have specific requirements that do not naturally fit with the standard "lump sum" contracts and has been availed of by a number of sanctioning authorities.  A derogation, if agreed, does not approve the approach or strategy of the authority but simply acknowledges that the circumstances are such as to warrant a different approach from the standard.  It is a matter for the contracting authority and the sanctioning authority to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the approach with regard to compliance with procurement rules and project appraisal in accordance with the spending code.</p><p> Reform is an element of Project Ireland 2040.  We also have to learn from experiences, both good and bad.  There is no doubt but that the experience of delivering capital projects highlights the need to step up the pace of reform still further.  The delivery of large, complex, multi-year capital projects in a construction market impacted by shortened economic cycles brings many challenges in terms of tender price volatility, skills shortages, etc.  This is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently set out a further suite of reforms.</p><p> First, we need more certainty on project costs.  Government will no longer pre-commit to major bespoke projects until there is 100% clarity on tendered costs.  The Government will approve major projects to be evaluated and designed, but there will be no final commitment until the tendering process is complete.  It is not possible to know the price of a capital project with a high level of certainty unless there is a full design specification, planning, if necessary, has been achieved, and the project has been competitively tendered.  In future, Government will not commit to projects until the design and price are clear.  This could delay projects, which I know will be an issue, but will ensure greater cost certainty.  There is a trade-off between timeliness and core certainty regarding large bespoke projects because the time it can take to develop the detailed design, in many cases, can be years.  This certainly increases the cost but it also takes time.  Of course, it also involves expenditure up front.  Depending on a final decision on a project, that may involve expenditure which ultimately does not lead to an end product or a final build.</p><p> We need more realistic costs and a better understanding of costs in capital projects.  In future, the budgets of large bespoke projects will include a significant premium for risk in order that cost estimates are more realistic.  As risk is managed through the project lifecycle, the risk premium will reduce.  For example, a project on a brownfield site with a high degree of complexity and which has not been fully designed has a higher risk premium incorporated into its budget.  As the risk is managed, this premium should reduce over time.  The revised capital works management framework will require Departments and their agencies to improve the quality of information on projects as they are implemented.  This will improve decisions on projects and allow projects to use digital technologies such as building information modelling, BIM, to improve how efficiently they are developed.  This is another significant challenge for sanctioning authorities in ensuring that the information is there at the outset to ensure we can use the technology embedded in the BIM approach.  As part of the reviews of Ireland's capital management systems, my Department will conduct a full assessment of how cost estimation for capital projects could be improved.  This will include exploring the potential of external peer review of cost estimates for projects over a certain size.</p><p> We also need to strengthen our capital management systems.  As I mentioned, we are reviewing them.  The Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to examine how capital projects are currently selected, designed and delivered and to strengthen these processes, taking account of lessons learned.  The reviews will result in a range of changes.  I will highlight just two changes at this point.  One is earlier identification of projects.  At present, Departments are typically presented with projects which are fully formed and in respect of which the delivery methods and project roles and responsibilities have been set.  In future, Departments will engage at an earlier stage to have more input into project roles and responsibilities; delivery method, critically; identification of risk; and discussion on costs.  Second, and finally, a number of high-profile projects have highlighted issues with the performance of advisory firms.  We will seek to link payments to advisory firms to clear performance standards.  We will bring in performance standards linked to payments in future contracts with those firms.</p><p> That is, I hope, a quick run through of our approach to what is a very complex area involving many different types of projects and many different agencies and authorities across the public service.  I look forward to engaging with the committee on these matters.</p></speech>

I am here to discuss the oversight and implementation of capital projects.</p> <p>  I did not directly reference the children's hospital but I indirectly referenced it several times in mentioning the experience of recent projects and the lessons we can learn from those.  My job, as the person who is responsible for the overall approach to the capital management of projects, is to learn lessons from how we manage projects.  Over the past number of weeks, with colleagues and the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, we have debated how to improve the process and I have set out a variety of measures today which the Government has taken and announced, and which I have set out for the committee.  They set out a new approach to ensure we manage projects as best we can.</p> <p>  As the Chair has said, and as everybody in this committee knows, I am not the Accounting Officer for the children's hospital and our Department is not the sanctioning authority or the sponsoring agency.

There are issues around the nature of the tendering process because we moved away from the lump sum contract and they sought a derogation, which led to a two-stage process.  As the board, and others closer to the project than I, have set out, the complexity of the project meant that it was not possible to set out a detailed design and they went into a two-stage process where preliminary works were undertaken and the detailed design was then set out.  When the detailed design was finalised, it became apparent that the estimate that underpinned the contract in spring 2017 was not accurate.</p> <p>  There are a number of issues for us and I have set them out in the statement.  We never know what the cost of something is until we have a detailed spec and a tendering process.</p></speech>

First, we committed to significant preliminary works before the final tender was established.  That was because the preliminary works were significant, at &euro;200 million.  The Drimnagh sewer also had to be moved and there were very significant enabling works on which significant spending occurred before the final cost.  It is very clear that we should not allow that to happen again.</p> <p>  The second issue is that we were given commitments relating to the approximate bill of quantities that underpinned the contract and how accurate they were.  They did not turn out to be accurate and that is something that has also been documented.  The Government has committed to a review of that by PwC.</p></speech>

The costs soared in a very short period of time and nobody, in the Department of Health or the development board which includes civil servants who are obligated under a circular, saw fit to mention it to Mr. Watt, despite a memo from the HSE stating that it should be brought to the attention of the Department as part of the budgetary process.</p><p>Why did that not happen?

We were told in November about this and we asked for a detailed note.  A detailed note was received by us on 19 November, we had a discussion with the Department and we communicated with the Minister a few days afterwards in terms of that.  We were told about the significant cost issue at that stage and we met our colleagues in the Department of Health and we engaged with the Minister at that stage on it.</p></speech>

Every year, there is an annual allocation which is set out and voted upon by the D&aacute;il.  Against that allocation and profile, we receive reports every month from each spending Department which sets out that Department X had a capital budget of &euro;100 million and was meant to spend &euro;10 million in January.

I express my disappointment at the comments attributed to him earlier today in the media.</p><p>I do not consider a colloquial expression of that nature to be helpful and it is unbecoming of a person in his office.  That being said, we are here to discuss Government contracts and in particular, the contract for the national children's hospital.  Hindsight is wonderful, of course, but from my perspective there are two flaws with that particular project, the first being the fact that it was two-stage and the second that there were additions and problems on site which have pushed the total expenditure up.  I am not sure that any Government Department was equipped with the necessary foresight to be able to determine that these problems were arising.  That is glaringly obvious when there are changes made to the manner in which Departments operate in terms of the note that Mr. Watt has provided to us in his opening statement.</p><p> I have five specific questions.  On the two-stage tender process, I do not understand and, to a certain extent, I do not accept that there was not an element of foresight in terms of understanding the difference between the two-stage process in the context of the ability of the Department in question to obtain a competitive tender on the basis of the complexity of what was being done on the ground.  As someone who worked briefly in the formwork business, I cannot understand how on earth a secondary company would be able to walk on site and say that it could tender, based on what is in the ground or what was supposed to be put in the ground, as per the original contract.  How was that considered appropriate?  Was there any knowledge in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that this was the nature of the contract?  Perhaps Mr. Watt or Mr. O'Brien could answer that.  Was there anyone with the experience to say that it could not work for various reasons?</p></speech>

The plan was to do the enabling works, start phase one and as the contractors would be there, dealing with the reality of the project, they would then finalise the design and move to the guaranteed price.  The contracts committee was told the quantities were 95% set at that stage.  It was an approximate bill of quantities but it was fairly certain, at 95%.  That is really the issue, as the Deputy identified.  To go to a two-stage process and to commit to significant spending when there is uncertainty about the final outcome is not appropriate.  However, we were told that the bill of quantities was well established.  As I see it, there is an issue about how that happened.  I cannot talk about it because I was not involved.  It is for those who were involved to explain what happened there but clearly, it is risky for the State and that is why we have set out that we will-----</p></speech>

The Government would have been in the position to re-tender when we got to the guaranteed price and that was the decision the Government had taken.

Any reasonable person who is planning a project, regardless of what that project is, has an idea of what that project is going to look like, what it is going to deliver, how quickly it can be delivered and how much it is going to cost.

It is known typically as early contractor involvement and is widely used in infrastructure projects internationally.  It is a development out of design and build, which is a form of contract that transfers a significant degree of risk to the contractor.  It has had its problems and this process has evolved out of that approach.  The benefits are that it gets the contractor involved in the design and risk evaluation of the project at the earliest point possible to try to uncover and work through issues that may arise on the job.</p></speech>

In the case of the hospital, that would be all the bill of quantities for every room, corridors, systems and so on.  We must set out the detailed design and that must be priced competitively, in a process.  That said, within a detailed design there is always potential for price variations and for disputes.  If one thinks about a traditional lump sum contract, that is not necessarily the end of the matter.  There can be disputes and it can get very adversarial.  That is a function of the quality of the tender and design.  If we have a very well designed project, where we have sufficient detail and have spent a lot of time and money on developing the design, that ensures that we will have the optimum level of certainty.  Even if 100% is not achievable, it will be 98% to 102%.  It will be at a rate where-----</p></speech>

Let us take a road project as an example.  Once we have set out the design and have a price, we have reasonable certainty about how much it is going to cost.  That has been the history in the past 15 or 20 years.  My view is that where people put out numbers for the cost of a project without having set out the detailed design or tested the market, it is a guesstimate.  It is an estimate, not a certain price.</p></speech>

Shortly thereafter - I think in 2012 - the figure for the hospital project, admittedly on the Mater hospital site, was &euro;450 million.  Hindsight allowed me to profile the cost of T2 at Dublin Airport which Mr. Watt mentioned.  It was estimated to cost &euro;690 million, but with extra costs for fit-out and so on, the project came in at a cost of &euro;960 million.  The cost of the national children's hospital was pitched at &euro;450 million.  I often ask myself how we came up with the figure, given the cost of the T2 project that had only recently finished at the time and which was probably far less complex.  Did the expenditure profile document provided not set off alarm bells?</p></speech>

We assess expenditure against that profile.  Actual expenditure is the issue.  Clearly for this project, the actual expenditure is for preliminary works; it was not the prospective spend when the final details were established.</p></speech>

On the aggregate spend in the Department of Health in the period in the year to mid-November, when the issues were formally communicated, were there no indicators that there something was going wrong in that Department?</p></speech>

To respond to the second question, the profiles relate to actual spending.  Reports were provided for us on the actual expenditure incurred in undertaking preliminary works related to the children's hospital and other projects that are the responsibility of the hospital.</p> <p>  To respond to the first question regarding the Department being passive, we are not being passive at all.  Between 2012 and the spring of 2017, there was voluminous contact - I think the emails are out there under freedom of information requests - in which the Department was raising issues about governance, procedures and cost estimation for the children's hospital project.</p></speech>

It was our understanding at the time that there was a figure for the hospital that was higher than that which had been put out there.  It was &euro;980 million.  That was our understanding of what was happening.  It is not fair to suggest we are being passive.  The contrary is the case.  It was our understanding - it is fair under the public spending code - that the sanctioning authority was managing the project, given the Government decision in the spring of 2017.</p></speech>

Let us take ten off, that is, 42 meetings a year.  I do not believe it credible that Mr. Quinn would not say to Mr. Watt, "Just to let you know what's going on down the road.  We are overshooting here".  For a man of Mr. Watt's experience, given all the excellent projects that have worked out so well, which he rightly put on record as he is entitled to do and in which I support him in so doing, it is not remotely credible that Mr. Quinn did not fill him in on what is currently the largest project costing &euro;1.7 billion or whatever will be.  It is grand to say it is not in minutes and that they followed the correct procedures but I am putting it to Mr. Watt that it is not credible.</p> <p>  I am probably rushing but I have two very important points I want to raise and I know I will only get one bite of the cherry.  We were provided with a note from the Department of Health on 31 January arising from our earlier meeting.  It looks like we are heading for a cost of &euro;1.7 billion.  PwC are helping us, and Mr. Watt laid out a series of improvements for the next projects, but we are still faced with the public having to pay the bills for this project.  A footnote states: "Exclusions include changes in scope, excess national construction tender inflation above 4% post July 2019, changes in legislation (e.g. VAT, PRSI, statutory labour rates, building regulations)".  Let us focus on the construction tender inflation because I am conscious that this was subject of a "Prime Time" programme the other night but it was in a footnote of a document given to us in January.  According to AECOM Ireland's annual review and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland in respect of last year's performance and next year's projected performance, construction tender inflation has run at 7.5%, on average, in the past year and is likely to be no less than 7% in the year ahead.  Does that not mean, in effect, that the BAM-provided construction inflation exceeds the 4% that is budgeted for in the contract or that this briefing document would suggest, and that once construction inflation performs at broadly the same as last year, it is open season again on negotiations?</p></speech>

There is a board, which is the sponsoring agency.  There is an authority, which very clearly has responsibility for this.  As I understand it, and I do not recall the document the Deputy is referring to, if inflation is above a certain level, that has implications for the cost.  I think that has been set out clearly.</p></speech>

I only have a basic understanding of language and certainly none of value engineering but, reading English, this says to me that if construction inflation goes over 4% when it is performing at 7.5% last year and projected, according to AECOM Ireland's annual review looking ahead to 2019, that it is likely to be at 7%.  Seven minus four equals three.  Can we look forward to the fact that BAM will be able to invoke the exclusion mentioned here of it having exceeded 4% and, therefore it will be open season again, and that &euro;1.7 billion was the accurate price then but now we have to negotiate because inflation has exceeded the 4% provided for?</p></speech>

So that we are absolutely clear for the people watching at home, for all of our organisational oversight and reviews, nobody knows what the price will be because if construction inflation performs broadly in line with profile of experts such as AECOM Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, we can chuck it down.  BAM will be in a position to renegotiate aspects of price because of construction inflation so in terms of &euro;1.7 billion, we may as well have said &euro;900 million because it will be higher, and it is likely to be significantly higher.</p> <p>  In terms of the contract, I would like to know - and the public are entitled to know - whether it is an annual construction tender inflation rate or a Dublin-based one.  These self-same expert groups suggest that Dublin could be performing up closer to 10% and 12% in terms of tender inflation whereas nationally it might be an average of 7% or 7.5%.  Either way, the public, to this day, for all the facts we have been provided with, are being sold a pup because nobody knows, least of all Mr. Watt, because of this?  I have one final question.</p></speech>

My questions relate to the Estimates process, the functionality of the Department, communications between Departments and circular 12/2010.  These are my four topics and I hope to get through the four questions.</p> <p>  Article 28.4.4&deg; of the Constitution states, "The Government shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year, and shall present them to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for consideration" , while Article 17.1.1&deg; states the D&aacute;il "shall consider such Estimates".  I cannot get my head around the Estimates process we went through late last year and revised earlier this year.  We had a situation where Estimates were published on 9 October, which was budget day, and we had Revised Estimates on 19 December.  There was awareness in the Department of a massive overrun in the children's hospital.  The Constitution is clear that the Government "shall prepare Estimates of the Receipts and Estimates of the Expenditure of the State for each financial year", and they have to be done truthfully.  How can we say the Estimates done last October were done accurately and to the best ability of the Department?  How can we say the book of Revised Estimates of 19 December were also done in this way?  On 20 February in the D&aacute;il, when there were further Revised Estimates, the Taoiseach tacitly said they had to be re-profiled.  There had been awareness in the Department of the issues relating to the hospital, with regard to an assistant secretary, for some time and there was awareness in the Department on 19 November, as Mr. Watt has outlined, of the large overrun.  Were inaccurate Estimates given to the D&aacute;il last October and, subsequently, last December?</p></speech>

A summary Estimate is set out by the Minister on budget night.  Changes are then made.  This year there were very modest changes.  There are always technical issues as end year positions become clearer.  Then, as the Deputy has said, Revised Estimates are set out.  The implications for the children's hospital and what it meant for the allocations of Departments were not decided upon by the Government.  There was insufficient time for us, because the Government was debating, to recast the Estimates, and they were published because we are always anxious to publish them before the end of the year.  We do not publish them the following year.  We do not believe it is appropriate to publish the Estimates after the year has begun.  We now endeavour to publish them before the end of the year.  A decision was taken that we would publish the Estimates.  As the Deputy will be aware from his time in government, it is not unusual for the Government to publish its Revised Estimates at a time issues are outstanding that the Government may know might require a revision subsequently.  There were cases when the Deputy was a Minister, which I will not go through, when the same thing happened.  This is not unusual and I am absolutely confident the Estimate prepared was accurate.</p> <p>  The amount is &euro;100 million, if I understand, with regard to the implications for the health Estimate-----</p></speech>

It is not credible in my eyes or in the eyes of most people to state there were Chinese walls and that Mr. Watt or the Minister was not made aware of anything to do with an overspend.  If that is accurate, which is what is being said, there is an issue of dysfunctionality somewhere.  I have a couple of questions on this.  I have gone through all of the emails from the Department of Health to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Why did it take so long for the two Departments to meet to discuss the children's hospital?  I do not know these people and I am referencing them only to show who was communicating.  There was an email from David Moloney to Fiona Duffy at the Department of Health on 20 November, in which he stated Jim Breslin had made him aware of some issues relating to the children's hospital and the budgetary process in October but that this is the first documentation the Department has been provided with.  In fairness, Mr. Watt said that earlier.  What does not add up to me is Mr. Watt said he found out on 19 November but the Minister found out on 9 November.</p></speech>

I will read it into the record because, following my question, Mr. Watt will need to hear it.  Ms Conroy is the assistant secretary of the acute hospitals policy division in the Department of Health.  I do not know Mr. Moloney.  The email states:</p><blockquote>David we have been seeking to meet your division on this issue since the end of September - Fionnuala's discussions with Barry O'Brien on September 27 and follow up voicemails and emails requesting a meeting on October 17, October 24 and November 15.<br /><br />I'd appreciate if you could revert with a time [...]</blockquote> <p>In light of the scale of this issue and the fact that the Minister for Health has been aware of it since the end of August or early September, why in the name of God did it take so long to reach that point?  We now know Mr. Watt's Minister was aware of it on 9 November.  Mr. Jim Breslin made a reference to it during budget negotiations in October.  That is acknowledged by an official in the Department.  Why did it take so long for officials in two Departments to sit down and have a meeting?</p></speech>

During the budget process, there could be 30 plus meetings between officials in our Department and the Department of Health about matters relating to the budget.  Mr. Moloney and his team asked for a detailed note on what the position was and it was stated that we would engage with them when we had the facts, but the facts were not established at the time.  It is very reasonable to ask, on any issue, that the facts be set out and that a meeting take place when the facts are received.</p></speech>

We have seen all the documentation, the letters that came through the board and the board's minutes.  The Department of Health officials certainly had enough to have a discussion with Mr. Watt's Department.  The fact that there was no meeting is bewildering to me.  I do not find the answer satisfactory.</p><p>The Estimates process is bewildering.  There were MAC meetings taking place.  An official was present but nobody said anything.  I refer to the Revised Estimates, the lack of capacity even to have a meeting between the two Departments and the awareness between 9 November and 19 November.</p><p>I want to ask Mr. Watt about circular 12/2010, which is the protocol for civil servants nominated to the boards of non-commercial State bodies.  We do not need to go through the steps outlined.  It basically concerns how State bodies should perform.  The circular is quite clear about what any State official serving on a board has to do as regards making a Minister aware of matters.  Footnote 1 states the relevant Minister is the Minister under whose aegis the body falls.  The circular states: </p><blockquote><i>Occasions when information must be conveyed directly to the relevant Minister without delay </i><br /><br />The Minister must be notified without delay where:i There are serious weaknesses in controls that have not been addressed despite being drawn to the attention of the board or the Chairperson;<br /><br />ii There is a significant strategic or reputational risk to CIB that is not being addressed;</blockquote> <p>We can hardly say now there have not been reputational issues relating to the national children's hospital.  Given that we now know there was massive over-expenditure in the summer of 2018 and that we have seen the board's minutes, would it not have been reasonable, bearing in mind that Mr. Watt is the person who governs the area covered by the circular, for the person on the board to go directly to the Minister about the over-expenditure?</p><p>Is Mr. Watt not concerned that, given the way the circular has been interpreted in this instance, issues could arise over other State boards and how civil servants or State employees adhere to this circular on those boards?</p></speech>

In 2015, the new hospital board appeared before this committee prior to my becoming a member of it.  As a result of previous issues relating to the original project, the new board appeared before this committee.  Absolute assurances were given to the committee that the board had learned its lessons, governance was in place and no issues would arise.  In the same way that Mr. Watt told us in his opening statement that the Department has learned lessons, the board stated at that time that it had learned the necessary lessons.  Did Mr. Watt look at the transcript of those proceedings?  He did not.  Well, I did.  I took the precaution of reading the transcript of that meeting and looking at what the board members said.  I then followed up regarding what the Department was to do.  It was to produce a report on what had been learned from the debacle that led to the meeting.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to provide the figure written off in regard to the previous hospital site.</p></speech>

I do not expect Mr. Watt to address that issue but I expect him to be familiar with it and to know what was learned from it.  The board provided assurances.  Does Mr. Watt agree that its members were picked for their expertise?  Okay.  I regret that Mr. Quinn is not appearing before the committee today but that was the decision of the Department.  I went through the minutes of the board meetings on this matter.  The minutes of a meeting on 4 July 2018 note the lack of co-operation of all parties and that the guaranteed maximum price had not been agreed.  That had been an ongoing concern since earlier that year.  Nobody knew what was the guaranteed maximum price.  As the months go on, the minutes keep recording that concern.  At some stage, the board engaged an expert.  This took place under a two-stage process that the Department allowed and to which I will return if I have time.  The board was alerted to the high level of risk in July 2018.  A guaranteed maximum price had still not been agreed by August.  I ask Mr. Watt to listen to the following when he is ready.  Plan B was discussed by the board which noted that the performance of BAM during phase 1 up to that stage fell far short of what would be expected of a tier 1 contractor.  That is noted in the minutes.  I highlighted these issues when going through the minutes and I wondered what were the board and the contractor doing.  I am not commenting on that; I am asking a question.  In October the board remarked that BAM had not delivered, and questioned whether various design and contractor teams were fit for purpose to deliver a project of this scale and complexity.  Shall I repeat that or has Mr. Watt taken it on board?  In October the board noted that BAM had not delivered and questioned whether the design and contractor teams were fit for purpose.</p></speech>

I highlight those minutes to show Mr. Watt that questions are being raised by the board about its design and other teams that were procured for their expertise under the new Government's model at great cost.  Private contractors were brought in because of their expertise.  There are ongoing issues relating to the new model.  I wish to move to the issues explored by Deputy Kelly regarding the emails.  It seems that the Department of Health was writing to Mr. Watt even earlier than was previously clear.  On 17 October, an email was sent to Barry.O'Brien@per.gov.ie, who I presume is an official in Mr. Watt's Department.  It states, "we spoke briefly a couple of weeks ago when I said we want to brief you on the current position" and so on.  It refers to "potential cost issues emerging relating to the GMP" or guaranteed maximum price.  The Department was clearly on notice of those issues on 17 October.  Reference is made in the email to a previous meeting.  Am I not making the question clear?</p></speech>

One of the notes from the Department suggests that we may be looking at a project cost of &euro;2 billion.  That is according to departmental emails.  The two-stage process, which was allowed, did none of those things.  It did not avoid litigation, did it?</p></speech>

We do not know that if another children's hospital were to be built tomorrow, it would not go from costing &euro;650 million to &euro;2 billion.  Are we looking at a project cost of &euro;2 billion as suggested in the email?  That is my difficulty.  In the 18-page document, Mr. Watt mentions that a few reviews are under way.  Again, it is noteworthy that he does not mention the children's hospital project or itemise what has been learned by his Department about how governance needs to be improved in the context of circulars.  Mr. Watt stated that the Department is reviewing Ireland's capital management systems.  Is that review being conducted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, when did it start and when will it be completed?  There is one more commitment on page 15 of the document.  Mr. Watt stated that his Department would conduct a full assessment of cost estimation.  Mr. Watt's opening statement contains those two promises.  Have these reviews started and when will they be completed?</p></speech>

I will read from the invitation that the committee approved and agreed and which was issued to Mr. Robert Watt.</p><blockquote>I wish to confirm that the Committee requests your attendance at a meeting to discuss the Department's historical and continuing role for the oversight and implementation of projects under the national framework for capital investment, and under the national development plan 2018-2027, as specified in your Department's published Annual Business Plans.  The Committee would particularly like to focus on the Department's role in ensuring that value for money is achieved through systematic appraisal and professional management of all capital projects.</blockquote> <p>In light of this letter, the committee wrote a number of days ago to the Department asking it to list approximately the ten major projects that fall under this issue, and we got the list.  It starts off with MetroLink and goes on to the national children's hospital.  It then deals with the water supply project - eastern and midlands region, for which Irish Water has responsibility; the N20, Cork to Limerick; the Galway city ring road; the public private partnership, PPP, M11 project, Gorey to Enniscorthy; the greater Dublin area drainage scheme under Irish Water; the N21 to N69, which runs from Limerick to Adare to Foynes; the PPP N25, which is the Newross bypass; and the national broadband plan.  We have been here for over two hours and I am concerned, as Chairman, that we have not been sticking to the subject matter of the invitation.  We have spent most of our time dealing with one item, namely, the children's hospital.  I must make sure that this meeting is run in a balanced way that is fair to the members and the witnesses who were called to discuss the national capital plan, not solely one item.  As Chairman, I have a duty to ensure that the discussion aligns itself to the invitation.  The invitation did not refer to the national children's hospital specifically.  Yes, we can mention it, but, as Chairman, I am going to ensure that for the remainder of the meeting the discussion aligns itself with the invitation.  I hope I am making myself clear.  Yes, there can be some further comment on the national children's hospital-----</p></speech>

It is important that witnesses and members have respect for each other.  Although I do not want to labour the point, I feel the comment did not get this meeting off to a good start.  I think it was utterly inappropriate.  Mr. Watt has apologised.</p><p>I refer to page 9 of the opening statement, on which the public spending code and looking to achieve value for money are mentioned.  Mr. Watt stated: </p><blockquote>The Public Spending Code sets out the oversight and approval process for public expenditure proposals including capital projects.  Governance and clear lines of responsibility are key to successful public capital investment.</blockquote> <p>Of course, they are.  With regard to the list of projects Mr. Watt provided, many are roads projects and the lead authority would be the National Roads Authority, which has a great deal of expertise at this stage.  My county of Kildare, for example, has more motorway running through it than any other county due to the location of the N7, N9, N4 and so on.  The NRA is the lead authority for much of this and has great experience in those projects, and, essentially, it stays on budget and on target.  It is in the context of bespoke projects that the real problem arises.  We cannot really go into the national broadband plan, but a great deal has been said about the procurement process for that.  We cannot really discuss  MetroLink because it is a current project.  The stand-out project, which is the bespoke one where there is a degree of experience and where we can see there are institutional gaps, is the national children's hospital.</p><p>Mr. O'Brien heads up the section that deals with capital projects.  What is his background?</p></speech>

I just had a look at the DIT for an outline of what can go wrong where there are serious project design errors.  Essentially, it states that if the design plans are defective, one will inevitably be destined for cost overruns in construction projects, particularly if there is a design deficiency or a poorly-designed, inaccurate or incomplete plan.  Would Mr. O'Brien have anticipated some of these things?  For example, a derogation would have had to be given in this regard.  Did he have an input in respect of that derogation or was he involved with it in any way?  Not locking things down, an incomplete plan, a change of orders, poor site management - all of those contribute.  Will Mr. O'Brien explain his role in this?</p></speech>

It is a committee made up of representatives of all of the main capital spending Departments, primarily people with a construction or technical background.  We are a forum or an advisory body for the establishment of construction procurement policy.  Government policy is governed by the capital works management framework, which is an online matrix or toolkit for public bodies.</p></speech>

The derogation process is set out under a circular.  With regard to public works contracts, when the capital works management framework was introduced, it was mandatory, so it is a default position that one must use and the suite of contracts is published there.  When these were published, provision was made for bodies whose project parameters did not fit within the delivery mechanisms, typically for a lump-sum contract.  In addition, there is an early contractor involvement form of contract which is published under the capital works management framework and which also requires Government contracts approval if one is going to use it.  That is how we became involved in the process.  We regularly advise public bodies - members of the GCCC - on these issues.</p></speech>

Let me specify.  Since the public works contracts guidance was first published in 2007, we went through a severe contraction in the industry and very competitive pricing.</p></speech>

Throughout that process, there was quite a spread of prices in tenders.  Where this project is concerned, it is, as the Deputy stated, a bespoke project and, because of its size and scale, it carries particular risks.  Therefore, the market is going to take a view at a given point in time as to what it believes the construction cost is going to be.  The reason the two-stage process was chosen in this case was because of the scale of the project in comparison with the standard market.</p></speech>

Indeed, had this been presented as a project that was going to cost over &euro;1.7 billion, whether it would even have been proceeded with is in question.  It was incredibly important that this was not a guesstimate but a serious estimate.  The way this was proceeded with shows there is a serious lack of expertise feeding into this, to all appearances.</p></speech>

The Department of Health set up a specific delivery board and an executive group that have the requisite expertise.  That is not normal where projects are concerned, and there is expertise there.  Context is very important.  We had an industry that did not show any signs of life until September 2013.  The issue is that when the meetings and the discussions were being had about this two-stage process or the procurement strategy, there were serious concerns on the part of the project development board and the hospital board as to whether the industry here had the capacity to deliver this project at the outset, as the initial engagements were being had.  The tendering strategy had to reflect this and that is why there is this different approach.</p></speech>

I do not see where the learnings are.  While we are discussing this as a real-time project, there is another project that is being dealt with on this list which is being dealt with internally in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  What we are hearing is there is a possibility of the &euro;500 million that was outlined when it was announced becoming several billion.  How can we have any confidence that there is control in respect of matters when they are announced?</p><p>We are not saying these projects are not needed.  If only a particular amount of money is available, however, the way they are proceeded with might be very different.  The two-stage process was probably because of the site selected.  Would that have happened if that had been a greenfield site?</p></speech>

There are Irish Water projects, for example.  Irish Water is a commercial semi-State company and such projects do not come to the GCCC either.  It is only direct, Exchequer-funded, construction projects that come through the GCCC.  Coming back to the point, the difficulty we have is an ever changing market.  Deputy Catherine Murphy is talking about certainty and cost and so on.  As I pointed out, in 2013 we were not quite sure where construction was going.  Within two to three years, we now have skills shortages in that sector as a result of investment.  That is the issue.  A construction project can only be delivered with cost certainty at a point in time.</p></speech>

Returning to the greenfield site, it is not necessarily the site alone.  That is, of course, part of it.  That site adds complexity to the project.  The national children's hospital, however, is a complex project in terms of its brief and scale no matter where we put it.  It is enough for the market to take a look at that it to realise it is a big project with a lot of associated risk.</p></speech>

Because one has a price breakdown, one is looking to see where that low price might be.  Construction contracts and their pricing are inordinately complex.  There will not be an item suggesting 300 individuals will be working on this site and the resulting labour cost will be a certain amount.  All of the costs are linked into work elements of the job.  There is a degree of forensics required and the contractors are encouraged, through the process, to drive value for money.  That is partially why we have the competitive process.  It is to ensure we are getting the best possible price.  The Deputy is absolutely right.  If the price is determined to be abnormally low, then the contracting authority has an obligation to investigate, raise issues, seek clarification and reach its conclusions.  If the contracting authority is then of the view that the price is abnormally low, it may reject it but is not obliged to do so.  It is only obliged to reject the tender where it can be determined that the price is abnormally low or where there is a breach in labour, environmental or social security issues.</p></speech>

I will stick entirely to the basis upon which he has been invited here because I have respect for his office.  It is up to him, as the Accounting Officer, to ensure that respect goes both ways.  I return to Mr. Watt's opening statement and his point that "the selection, appraisal and delivery of individual public sector capital projects is the responsibility of each relevant Department".  That is correct.  There is no quarrel from this committee with that.  He noted that his Department "is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the National Development Plan within Project Ireland 2040, supporting value for money and protecting sustainable capital investment."  We also agree with and support that view.  There are ten major projects contained in Project Ireland 2040.  All of them are worthy projects and important for the State.  We certainly also agree with that.  Which of those ten projects is the most advanced?  There is MetroLink, the national children's hospital, the water supply project in the eastern and midlands region, the N20 from Cork to Limerick, the Galway city ring road, the public private partnership for the M11 from Gorey to Enniscorthy, the greater Dublin drainage project, the N21-N69 from Limerick to Adare and Foynes, the PPP for the N25 New Ross bypass and the national broadband plan.

This is not a game.  It is very serious.  To be helpful to Mr. Watt, the national children's hospital is probably the next most advanced project.  It is certainly very advanced.  It is the only one of these ten projects where I can see a significant cost overrun for State.  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

I come back to Mr. Watt's opening statement and his point that he is responsible for overseeing "the implementation of the National Development Plan within Project Ireland 2040, supporting value for money and protecting sustainable capital investment."  Of those ten projects, the one which jumps out where there is a significant cost overrun is the national children's hospital.  Did Mr. Watt's Department ensure we got value for money in that project?  In doing so, have we protected sustainable capital investment?  I ask that given that, of the ten projects, the children's hospital is the one where we now know there is a significant cost overrun.</p></speech>

I am assuming Mr. Watt and his Department can take credit for the other projects which have come in on budget.</p><p>However, the one of which we are aware, on which there is a significant cost overrun, is the national children's hospital.  There is the potential for it to be the most significant.</p></speech>

What I have set out in the opening statement is a valid point, lest the people watching these proceedings think otherwise, that not every project faces significant challenges of the type faced by the children's hospital.  Not every project is delayed, nor are there overruns on the scale we have seen.  We wanted to contextualise the debate because it would be disappointing if people thought all projects were subject to the overruns we have seen on the children's hospital project.</p></speech>

What I am repeating to Mr. Watt is what he has given us in his opening statement, which is that he has a responsibility to support the obtaining of value for money.  As Accounting Officer for the Department, is he confident that we have achieved value for money so far at the national children's hospital which is one of ten major projects?</p></speech>

On achieving value for money, the issue, if we are building a national children's hospital and on that site, is if an alternative procurement process or way of going about it would have led to a different price or cost outcome.  We do not know the answer to that question.</p></speech>

The line Ministers and Departments can have their views.  I asked Mr. Watt for his.  He has somewhat given me a response, but I want to test it in coming back to one report that examined this issue - the Mazars report.  It also looked at the cost overrun.  In general terms, it showed that the guaranteed maximum price had ballooned, that the design team had made guesses about the cost, that the value engineering savings had not materialised to a significant degree and that the philanthropy had fallen through, the accommodation to be provided by McDonalds being one example.  It also found that the procurement process had added to the cost overrun and that it raised questions about the fast-track two-stage tender procurement model.  The Mazars reportis the only report of which we know so far that has examined the project in any detail.  Does Mr. Watt's Department have to sign off on the fast-track two-stage tender procurement model?</p></speech>

We have set out the position.  The contracts committee had discussions with the national children's hospital board which came with a proposal and sought a derogation from the requirement for a lump sum contract.  It sought the derogation, as Mr. David O'Brien mentioned, because of the complexity of the project.  In setting out a detailed design for it and bringing it to the market to have a lump sum contract, there would have been not only very significant costs incurred in developing the design but also a time delay.</p></speech>

Did the Department sign off on the procurement model to be used?  That was the question.</p></speech>

It is chaired by Mr. David O'Brien and there are people from different sanctioning authorities on it.  It is not the only derogation to be granted; there were ten projects in the past few years in respect of which derogations were granted.  A derogation was granted from the normal lump sum contract because it was the collective view of those on the committee that it would not have been possible to deliver the hospital project within the timescale and have a competitive process for it on the basis of a lump sum contract, given the inherent risks involved in such complex projects.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned, this goes back to the fact that when it comes to repeat projects such as motorway, school and primary care centre projects, we have a much better idea of the unit costs.  We know, for example, that it costs &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million to build 1 km of a motorway.</p></speech>

There were meetings and presentations were made to the committee on two occasions.

We accepted that the contract could not be delivered using the lump sum, standard form.  There is usually a discussion process about the merits and demerits of the solutions and so on.  Issues were raised, of course, about that.  We are well aware of the risk of a contract re-measurement bill.  Prior to the introduction of public works contracts, we had re-measurement contracts.  The strategy was designed to arrive at a cost certainty at the GMP.

We will bring in performance standards linked to payments in future contracts [with those firms].</blockquote> <p>That is longhand for a bonus.  Is that right, or am I reading it wrong?

I cannot leave here today without asking something about the hospital because it is the subject of the day that is on everyone's mind.  To carry on from what Deputy O'Connell asked, why was only the preliminary cost known?  We have some expertise here now.  Why did those involved not know that costs which started at &euro;600-odd million would probably end up at &euro;2 billion?  That is the question that all the Joe and Mary Soaps, the taxpayers, out there want to know.  Why did professional people not say that the preliminary cost was &euro;600-odd million but there were to be add-ons and whatever it was, so the cost would end up at &euro;1.4 billion or &euro;2 billion?

It had to make a decision on whether to stop the project, not move to phase two, write off the money already spent and start again on a children's hospital on whatever site for whatever cost at some time on the future, or to proceed with the decision on the current hospital even though it was going to cost us more money.

There was the Mater site, then there was Crumlin, then it came to the St. James's site and now there is talk of a new greenfield site out in the western environs, which many people still believe should be the site because they maintained that the St. James's site can cater for only half the project.  There should be a maternity hospital, a children's hospital and a general hospital.  People feel that it should be built on a greenfield site.  That is another issue and is a decision for the Government of the day.  I understand that it is not a decision for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What effect will this have on other projects?  Mr. Watt spoke about the New Ross bypass, which is in my constituency, and other projects.  They are all going to be finished but there are other projects.  There are eight primary care projects in the pipeline.  These people have approached me because they feel the projects may be withdrawn.  The money for the children's hospital bill has to come from somewhere.  As the responsible body does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform know from where this money will be taken from and who is going to suffer?  Where will we in rural Ireland lose out again?  Where will projects lose out?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has said that the quote for broadband, which has been mentioned already, could be a multiple of the original price.  As the Department with responsibility for the money and spend perhaps Mr. Watts will comment on this given that the broadband scheme that was not rolled out in the past five years might not be rolled out for another five years.</p></speech>

We established that it is not going to be &euro;1.7 million and that it will be more because of the inflation tied in.  Where does Project Ireland 2040 stand?  Mr. Watts touched on this earlier but if the same 4% above construction inflation applied one would want to have an awful lot more in the drawer than &euro;116 billion to cover the projects that were announced in the 2040 plan.  Would this not be the case?</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills has its allocation and is committed to deliver various schools.

All of this ultimately depends on the capacity of the sector.  This affects the price.</p></speech>

Mr. Watts has served through various Administrations.  Projects have gone well and badly for all parties and none over the years.  As a matter of practice is there a process by which on a weekly, monthly or quarterly business the Minister of the day - I do not refer specifically to the current Minister - sits down with the Secretary General and says "These are the 50 capital projects and here is the update"?  Does this process happen at all and, if so, how frequently?</p></speech>

We now have a tracker, which we did not have previously, of 180 to 200 of the top projects.  There is now a tracker on those in our Department, which we publish.

I loved the last statement in the Secretary General's opening contribution which Deputy O'Connell captured very well.  He feels that the performance relationship in terms of actual delivery rather than bonuses is the way to go.  What tangible sanctions is he recommending by way of reform for State personnel who may be asleep at the wheel or do not do a good enough job?  What tangible sanctions can the public feel are in place if officer A or Secretary General B did not perform?  What kind of oversight or recourse will we have in terms of the proposed reforms?</p></speech>

I talked about what this contract is about.  Someone is asked to do a particular project and to spec something - a discrete piece of work - whey they can then define afterwards how well they did in speccing it.  They said they would need ten windows but how many did they actually need?  I know that is simple, but the Deputy knows the point I am making.  What I am suggesting is that we should link payment to the ultimate delivery, so they said something and then they said what.  That is relatively straightforward.</p></speech>

I speak from experience in a previous occupation I had.  The project is coming from across the road from where I live.  A full environmental impact assessment report and a Natura impact statement, NIS, are being prepared.  If the Secretary General does not have all the information, he can supply it to us in writing afterwards.  What are the timelines for this project over the coming years because obviously the Department plans ahead?  I understand it goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year.</p> <p>  On the scale of this project, I raise a big flag here about scope creep.  Essentially, this will be an Irish Rail for water.  It is not just bringing water to Dublin; it also covers the midlands, etc., which, by the way, is fine.  I have covered the timelines for this project and the potential for scope creep.</p> <p>  Third, how will this be tendered for given the conversations we have had?  Is this one project or multiple projects?  Those are genuine questions because I do not know.  The project kicked off a few years ago, but what is the update on timelines.  It goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la this year.  Over the coming years, I am genuinely concerned about project creep.  How will the project be tendered for?  Will it be in blocks or one big project?  Has that been decided?  Surely something must have been decided if we have plans going out for the next few years.</p> <p>  I accept that Project Ireland 2040 is not the Secretary General's area.  As a public servant he implements policy.  I have concerns about Project Ireland 2040 as regards regionalisation and its scale given that we need to redesign how our population is going.  However, that is a different story.  I ask the Secretary General to deal with those three questions.</p></speech>

The overwhelming majority is still coming from direct Exchequer funding.</p></speech>

We will come back to the Deputy in relation to the projects.  I do not know the details of it.  This is an enormous project.  I do not know if it is one lump sum or if there are parts of it.</p></speech>

If he does not have the answer now, that is fine.  I seek a briefing on it, covering the status of it, what is planned over the next few years, the tendering and scope creep.  I have a genuine interest.  There is a big difference between a pipeline from Birdhill to the outskirts of Dublin or an Irish Rail-type network that goes off into Mullingar and other places in the midlands.  Those are two totally different projects scale-wise.</p></speech>

The Galway city ring road project is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Secretary General does not need to comment on it.  The document states the project is at "detailed appraisal stage".  What does that mean?  Is that appraisal being done by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?</p> <p>  What role, if any, does the National Development Finance Agency have in the national children's hospital?</p> <p>  Example from the top is extremely important as is accountability.  I refer to two operating theatres in Galway.  The Secretary General may ask what this has to do with anything.  However, it comes down to accountability.  Two operating theatres went out of action in 2017.  We have been waiting for a year and three months for procurement.  We were told that contracts were exchanged in February 2018.  We are in March 2019 and we are informed that contracts are still being exchanged.  The language and accountability at this level is not acceptable.  We in Galway are left being told in February 2018 contracts had gone out to be signed and in 2019 we are told that they were not contracts but letters of offer and all sorts of waffle.  I do not expect the Secretary General to comment on that, but I expect an answer on the other two.</p></speech>

In 2016, the national children's hospital was announced and the figure given by the Taoiseach was &euro;650 million all in.  Where would that figure have come from?  Under the big capital projects, did the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have had a guesstimate at that stage?</p> <p>  Is the same the case for the national broadband plan?  Is it a guesstimate or an estimate?  How does that play out?</p></speech>

It might be based on some cost matrix, unit costs or some approach, or somebody may have said a children's hospital in the UK was built and had these specs and what was the cost of it.</p></speech>

This is where we need to get away from saying that that project cost that amount.  We only really know when somebody is willing to say, "I will charge you &euro;100 million for doing that."</p></speech>

We had to be able to show we could pay for it.  There was an upper limit on that as well.  There should have been some tolerance within that guesstimate that it would be at least an average.</p></speech>

What we are saying in the future is that if the Department comes to us and says, "We think that is going to be &euro;200 million", we will say, "Well, based on our experience of doing certain types of projects, if it is a brownfield site or whatever we will add 50% and say in actual fact it is &euro;300 million now."  That has to happen because otherwise the system would be gamed where people will, of course, come in low to get the Government to commit to it and it will be much more than that ultimately.</p></speech>

Agreed.  There are no matters arising that will not be dealt with in the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  There are three categories of correspondence.  The first relates to briefing documents and opening statements from Departments.  These are Nos. 2034 and 2037, which we discussed this morning.  We note and publish them.</p> <p>  The second category relates to correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts.  No. 2013B, dated 25 February 2019, is from Mr. Barry Donoghue, Deputy Director, Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, providing information requested by the committee as follows: details relating fees paid to prosecuting counsel; public sector organisations that can initiate District Court prosecutions; delegation of prosecuting authority to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and statistics relating to outcomes of indictable cases.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  I draw attention to a matter which surprised me.  By way of information, there are 21 agencies of the State that can initiate prosecutions in their own right.  We all thought that only the Director of Public Prosecutions and one or two other agencies could do this.  The Health and Safety Authority, the Consumer Protection Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Central Bank, Road Safety Authority and the National Transport Authority may do so, while An Post may institute court proceedings in respect of television licences.  Gas Networks and ESB Networks may do so where people interfere with meters and equipment.  The matter arises of the general direction to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The latter deals with many of the cases in the District Court.  That is probably the background to that.  In the context of indictable cases, the Garda has sent us trial outcomes by year.  In 2018, there were 2,588 cases, with 2,410 convictions, a rate of 93%.</p> <p>  The correspondence contains details of fees paid to counsel under the following headings: Circuit Court; confiscation of assets; asset-seizing in the High Court and Supreme Court; the Central Criminal Court; books of evidence; consultations; the High Court; higher brief fees in judicial review cases; Supreme Court; High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court bail; Court of Appeal (criminal); sea fisheries - District Court; health and safety - District Court; and conferences.  Fees and refresher fees are given for senior and junior counsels.  People may read this and decide if it is a good profession to join.</p> <p>  No. 2016B is correspondence from Ms Maria Browne, Chief State Solicitor, providing information requested by the committee.  We asked about annual operating costs for the cost recovery unit which we are given.  We asked for details of the number of vacancies within the Chief State Solicitors Office including the length of time the vacancies have been open.  There is a detailed list of the 15 pre-existing vacancies and the status of efforts to fill posts.  It says Garda clearance can take a couple of months in some cases.  We understand that they must be particularly cautious.</p> <p>  We have also been given a note on the arrangements regarding lottery grant approval.  We raised this with the Chief State Solicitor's office.  When dealing with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and, in particular, the Minister for Transport Tourism and Sport, we have all encountered cases where grants could not be approved because they were with the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office.  We have been given the figures we asked for.  In 2017 there were 89 cases but in 2018 there are 264 cases, probably because the lottery applications were open in that year.  To date this year there have been 19 cases.  We will write back and inquire further because we have not been told how many cases were outstanding at the end of the year.  It is fine to tell us how many cases were received but we have no idea of how many were processed and how many are outstanding.  We have discussed delays.  The Chief State Solicitor's office gives various reasons for the delays but it does not give us a breakdown of the numbers outstanding at year&rsquo;s end.</p> <p>  No. 2018B is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, HSE, providing follow up information on procurement arrangements for section 38 and 39 organisations and a note on any conflict of interest that may arise in relation to any former managers of the HSE being employed by section 38 and 39 organisations.  The note is a page and a half long, which we note and publish.</p> <p>  No. 2019B is from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, dated 27 February 2019 and providing information in respect of the operation of the criminal justice operational hub, including the timetable for its completion.  The hub will provide a centralised facility to allow for data to be exchanged between the existing ICT systems in the criminal justice agencies and accessed in an anonymised format for the purposes of researching and developing evidence-based policy.  He also provides a breakdown of compliance with data protection legislation and so on, which we asked for when he was before the committee.  We acknowledge his detailed response.</p><p>No. 2021B from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll provides information requested by the committee on the number of people who are not covered by free legal aid in cases before the Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court.  The letter states that 72,684 free legal aid certificates were granted in 2018.  I was curious about how many cases there were where that was not the case and am shocked that the correspondence states: &quot;The Courts Service advises that it does not have statistics in relation to the number of persons appearing before the courts who are not legally aided.&quot;  That means that it seems it does not have the total number appearing before the courts.  If it had the total number and knew the number who got free legal aid, the difference is those whose cases did not get free legal aid.  If it cannot provide that, it must not have the total figure.  The letter continues: &quot;It further advises that the position is that the majority of indictable offences dealt with summarily or on indictment in the Circuit and District Courts are covered by legal aid, however, most civil cases dealt with are not legally aided.&quot;  We need to write back and ask for the total number of cases processed through the different courts, including the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, etc.  I would have thought that was a basic figure.  It may have it.  We just need an indication of the scale and we will write back about that.<br/><br/>No. 2023B is from Mr. Paul O'Toole from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, dated 28 February 2019, providing information requested for our next periodic report, with regard to the independent Thorn review in Limerick.  It states:</p><blockquote>[The] University has implemented 9 of the 10 recommendations from Dr. Thorn's report on the University of Limerick. The remaining recommendation is in progress.</blockquote><p>It continues with regard to the Attorney General's advice about the review of spin-out companies.  We got a letter about that at the previous meeting and are aware of that.  It continues with regard to Cork Institute of Technology and certain named companies:</p><blockquote>A draft report of the review has been prepared by Mazars consultants.  The HEA is reviewing this draft and will revert to the Committee at the earliest opportunity.</blockquote><p>We can incorporate that into the next periodic report.  We will note and publish that.<br/><br/>No. 2024B is from Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive of NAMA, providing an update requested on the Player Wills and Poolbeg sites.  We will note and publish this.  We had considered this at the meeting before Christmas and asked for an update on both sites.  He makes it very clear with regard to the Player Wills site that the loans attached to the site were fully repaid at par value by the borrower in late December.  NAMA has nothing further to do with that site.  It is good news that the taxpayer got all the money back at par value.  I know many people hoped that site would be developed for housing or other purposes.  It is up to the private owner to develop the site but it is out of NAMA entirely.  With regard to the Poolbeg site, we mentioned the delays and he states:</p><blockquote>It is a matter of public knowledge that the Poolbeg West Planning Scheme is currently awaiting approval from An Bord Pleanala.  NAMA would welcome An Bord Pleanala's planning decision on the Poolbeg West Planning Scheme in early course as without that no proposed work on the site can commence.</blockquote><p>He hopes the committee can be of assistance with the matter.  The point is that the delays associated with that are not NAMA's fault so we will not include any of that in our periodic report.  We will note and publish that.<br/><br/>The next item is from Mr. Maurice Buckley of the Office of Public Works, relating to the premises in Galway that was mentioned when it looked at the Miesian Plaza for the Department of Health on Baggot Street with regard to measurements.  He states: &quot;The annual rent being paid reflects the final agreement reached between the OPW and the Landlord and therefore the OPW are satisfied that an overpayment of rent has not occurred.&quot;  We will take that as written to us.  We will note and publish that.  It is relevant to our periodic report.  There was an issue but it says it is satisfied.  That is as far as we can go.  We cannot tease that.</p></speech>

I outlined on the day why it was not a complex calculation and that it had agreed a price, divided by the old mechanism for measuring, and then multiplied the area by the new mechanism and came up with a higher price.  I asked if there were any disciplinary proceedings under way and who was at fault.  The chief commissioner said he supposed some of the responsibility was his.  He said that it was not a disciplinary matter.  That is the theme of everything here.  There are never disciplinary proceedings or tangible outcomes.  Repetition is, therefore, not deterred and is quite likely.  I think the OPW is something that we need to return to.  I was not happy with that as an answer.  The OPW said to leave the matter to it and that everything was tickety-boo.  It was not fine at the meeting and there was nothing in that letter to say why it now is.  Maybe I am reading it wrongly.</p></speech>

We  will note and publish this.  I propose that we forward it to the individual who raised related matters with the committee.  However, we agreed previously that the matter was closed and are forwarding the item for information purposes only.  Is that Agreed? Agreed.<br/><br/>No. 2029C is correspondence from<b></b>Mr. David O&rsquo;Flynn, registrar at the Dental Council, in which he provides information requested by the committee on the new public service single pension scheme.  We will note and publish this.  We sought this information in the context of our periodic report.  There was not clarity with regard to this organisation last week but we have that clarity now.  A sentence on it will go into our periodic report, which we will deal with shortly in private session.<br/><br/>No. 2039 is dated 6 March but has just been received.  It is an update requested by the committee on Miesian Plaza and the basis for measurements to determine the rent.  Mr. John McCarthy states that, at the time of the finalisation of the report, the OPW stated that it had engaged with the landlord with a view to rectifying the matter.  The response is up on the screen now.  As members can see, it says that the matter is still under consideration by the OPW and discussions with the landlord have not yet concluded.  That response is from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairperson of the OPW.  We will note and publish that and incorporate it, as necessary, into our periodic report.<br/><br/>In terms of statements and accounts received since the previous meeting, we have received two, both of which received clear audit opinions.  One is from the Qualifications and Quality Assurance Authority for 2017 and the other is from the Private Security Authority, PSA.  We will note both of those.<br/><br/>The last item on the agenda is our work programme.  It is possibly a surprise to some but the D&aacute;il is not sitting next Thursday so we will not be meeting on that day.  Obviously, the D&aacute;il will not be sitting at all the following week.  We will be back on 28 March and will deal with the broadband issue on that date.  We also will deal with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in respect of its appropriation accounts.  We will deal with the Department of Justice and Equality the following week.  There is quite a bit to be covered in that meeting.  Representatives from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will be in the week after that.  We have also received confirmation of attendance by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will return to our work programme at our next meeting and finalise it.  I am just referring now to the next few meetings that have already been arranged.<br/><br/>We have now concluded the public part of today's business.  Our next public meeting will be on 28 March, when we will meet officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and resume our consideration of that Department's 2017 appropriation accounts.  The Department will also provide an update on the national broadband plan.  We will now go into private session.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that my Department is not the sponsoring agency or sanctioning authority for this project.  In addition, I am not the Accounting Officer for it.  I have submitted a detailed document to the committee addressing the matters raised in the letter of invitation.  I do not propose to go through that in detail but I will take the opportunity to set out my Department's role in respect of capital projects in general, my Department's role in respect of the national paediatric hospital and the role of the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, in the issues being discussed today.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's responsibility in overseeing the effective implementation of the national development plan, NDP, in respect of capital projects is to set the overall five-year multi-annual capital expenditure ceilings for each ministerial Vote group and settle with each Department how these multi-annual ceilings are reflected and refined in the annual Estimates, which are voted annually by the D&aacute;il.  Decisions on how and where these allocations are invested is a matter in the first instance for the relevant Minister and Department, in line with the conditions of the delegated sanction, that is, the formal approval to spend Vote moneys, which they receive via the relevant Vote section in my Department.  We monitor actual spend against monthly expenditure profiles based on information submitted by Departments to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's relevant Vote section, to keep track of aggregate spend by each Department compared with planned profile spend.  The Department does not approve expenditure at the individual project level.  Of course, for projects costing more than &euro;100 million, the Government is the sanctioning authority and we brief the Minister for Finance and give our views to the Minister in the context of debates at Government.  We maintain the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure, such as the public financial procedures and the public spending code.</p> <p>  The NDP and Project Ireland 2040 do not change the long established arrangements for oversight, monitoring and management of voted Exchequer resources.  Exchequer funding continues to be managed through the normal systems for control of voted funds.  Departments and agencies are still responsible for delivering their projects within their budget allocations.</p> <p>  Two features of capital expenditure are monitored each month: aggregate capital and carryover spend in the year to date, and compared to profile and spend in the previous year; and Departments which are significantly ahead of or behind profile in actual spend and the reasons for the variation.</p><p>Departments must provide an explanation for variances.  Where necessary, my Department liaises with Departments, through Vote sections, to ensure that significant variances in actual spend are addressed and overall expenditure stays on track over the course of the year.</p><p> End-of-year monitoring for December reviews the annual position, including comparing the percentage of the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, capital allocation spent compared to the previous ten years.  Any capital unspent by each Department is identified, along with the amount of carryover into the following year.  This important change, which was introduced a number of years ago, ensures that we do not have the practice of unnecessary spending at year end, that is, Departments trying to spend capital in a hurry towards the end of the year.  Instead, Departments are allowed to carry over amounts into the next year, which is a sensible approach from a budget management perspective.  The focus is on budgetary aggregates rather than performance on individual projects, which is the responsibility of individual Departments and Accounting Officers.</p><p> My Department has responsibility for the public spending code, which is the set of rules, procedures and guidance that ensure value for money in current and capital public expenditure.  It sets out the rules and guidance on the oversight and management of spending at each stage of the capital project life cycle, including by setting out the responsibilities that lie with different capital expenditure project roles; setting out appraisal requirements where differing levels of public expenditure will be incurred; and setting out approval requirements at different project stages.</p><p> The main roles in the context of responsibility for capital expenditure projects are the sponsoring agency and the sanctioning authority.  The Department or agency proposing and implementing a project is the sponsoring agency.  It is responsible for appraisal, planning, implementation, management and post-project review.  It is responsible for developing a project proposal, which is then submitted to the sanctioning authority for decision on approval at each designated stage, or gate, in the project life cycle.</p><p> The Department or body funding the project and responsible for project approval is the sanctioning authority.  The sanctioning authority must be satisfied that the sponsoring agency has the appropriate systems to ensure the project is delivered in line with the approval it has been given.  The sanctioning authority is responsible for approval in principle at the key designated stages in the project cycle, namely, following appraisal, approval to proceed to tender and approval to accept a tender if the project has significantly changed due to, for example, an increase in costs.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, for projects costing more than &euro;100 million, the Government is the sanctioning authority.  The day-to-day oversight functions in those instances are the responsibility of the relevant Department funding the project.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not the sanctioning authority for the majority of capital projects.  It is only the sanctioning authority for the capital projects funded by its Vote group, which account for less than 3% of overall voted capital expenditure.</p><p> To support Departments as they work to achieve value for money in capital infrastructure investment, a suite of key reforms have been introduced to support the efficient implementation of Project Ireland 2040.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, has been set up by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to ensure the optimal use of State land.  Four new funds have been set up focused on urban and rural development, climate action and disruptive technology to prioritise funding to the best projects.  These are managed by the relevant line Departments.  The objective was to ensure an element of competitive tendering within the system to try to bring forward the best projects as early as possible for funding.</p><p> A construction sector group has been established to ensure ongoing dialogue between the Government and the construction sector.  A past criticism was that while the construction sector was delivering projects on behalf of the State, we did not have proper channels of communication.  We now have a group that meets to discuss the procurement, capacity and skills issues that impact upon the sector's ability to deliver on behalf of the Government and the taxpayer.</p><p> A Project Ireland 2040 board has been put in place and meets regularly to overview the overall implementation of the plan.  The investment projects and programmes office, IPPO, has been established in my Department to co-ordinate reporting on Project Ireland and drive reforms, including strengthened business case and project appraisal.  A capital projects tracker is published on my Department's website to inform citizens of the variety of projects being rolled out in their areas and to give a greater overview to the construction and infrastructure sectors.  The tracker is currently being updated.  A capability and capacity review of public sector bodies is being commenced by my Department to ensure that the State's delivery practices are to the highest standard.  There has always been a concern that capacity varies across elements of the public sector.  We understand and appreciate that and will undertake a review to ensure that all bodies charged with implementing the plan have the necessary expertise and skills.</p><p> As part of the ongoing reform of Ireland's capital management systems, the OGP is conducting a review of construction procurement strategy and my Department is reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to strengthen the existing guidance to better align with the realities of project delivery, with a particular focus on improved financial appraisal, cost estimation and management.</p><p> In line with the public spending code provisions, the Government is the sanctioning authority for the national paediatric hospital and the day-to-day oversight functions of the sanctioning authority are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  My Department's role in that project involves setting out the overall five-year capital envelope ceilings for the health Vote and settling on the annual basis for these multi-annual ceilings to be reflected and refined in the annual Estimates submitted to the D&aacute;il for its approval.  Decisions on which projects to invest in is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and his Department in line with the "delegated sanction" for overall capital expenditure.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's role also involves monitoring actual spend against monthly profiles based on information submitted to its Vote section so as to keep track of aggregate spend by each Department compared to planned spend.  We maintain the national frameworks within which Departments operate to ensure appropriate accounting for, and value for money in, public expenditure, such as the public financial procedures and the public spending code.  Responsibility for compliance with the national frameworks is a matter for the relevant Accounting Officer, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Health in respect of the project in question.</p><p> The committee will be aware that the OGP is a division of my Department.  The OGP leads on the implementation of the Government's procurement reform programme.  It provides procurement solutions, advice, guidance and systems for public bodies, promoting good practice and proactive engagement with our sourcing partners in the health, education, defence and local government sectors through the procurement executive.  It also has responsibility for developing and setting out the overarching policy framework for public procurement.  This framework enables a more strategic, consistent and co-ordinated approach to public procurement across the public sector by setting out the procedures to be followed by public bodies.</p><p> Public works procurement is covered by the capital works management framework, CWMF.  This consists of a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents.  It is mandatory for use on all projects delivered under the Exchequer-funded element of the public capital programme.  The CWMF is maintained by the construction policy unit of the OGP in consultation with the Government contracts committee for construction, GCCC.  Mr. David O'Brien, who is present, is the chair of that committee.  The OGP has no direct involvement in works procurement, with the exception of the framework for rapid-build social housing.  Capital works are procured directly by the many public bodies tasked with delivery of the public capital programme.</p><p> Regarding the paediatric hospital, the responsibility for the day-to-day oversight rests with the Department of Health.  The role of the GCCC in this instance was to consider a request for a derogation by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board from the use of the standard forms of contract.  A request for a derogation may be used for complex or large projects that have specific requirements that do not naturally fit with the standard "lump sum" contracts.  Since 2011, there have been 12 derogations from the lump sum contract.  Not all of them has gone through the two-stage process used in respect of the children's hospital, as there are other forms.  It is unusual, but not unique, that derogations are sought and given.  The derogation acknowledges that the particular circumstances warrant a different approach.  It does not approve the approach or strategy and the responsibility for the public procurement process rests with the contracting authority.</p><p> Reform is part and parcel and a key element of Project Ireland, but we also have to learn from experiences, both positive and negative.  There is no doubt that the experience of delivering capital works in recent years highlights the need to step up the pace of reform still further.  The delivery of large, complex, multi-year capital projects in a construction market that is impacted by a shortened economic cycle brings many challenges in terms of tender price volatility, skills shortages, etc.  This is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform recently set out a further suite of reforms.  We need more certainty on project costs.  The Government will no longer commit to major bespoke projects until there is clarity on tendered costs.  It will approve major projects to be evaluated and designed, but there will be no final commitment until after the tendering process is complete.  It is not possible to know the price of a capital project with a high level of certainty until there is a full design specification, any necessary planning has been achieved and the project has been competitively tendered.  In future, the Government will not commit to projects until the design and price are clear.  This could delay projects, leading to commentary and angst about delays, but it will ensure greater cost certainty.  There is a trade-off between speed of delivery and cost certainty in respect of large, complex projects, in particular.</p><p> We need more realistic costs and a better understanding of costs in capital projects.  In future, the budgets of large bespoke projects will include a significant premium for risks so that cost estimates are more realistic.  As risk is managed through the project cycle, the risk premium should reduce.</p><p>For example, a product on a brownfield site with a high degree of complexity which has not been fully designed would have a higher risk premium incorporated into its budget.  As the risk is managed, the premium should reduce.  The risk premium of a standard project such as a school, primary care centre or road, where we have lots of experience of building similar projects, is commensurately lower than that of a larger, once-off bespoke project.  The revised capital works management framework will require Departments and their agencies to improve the quality of information on projects as they are implemented.  This will improve decisions on projects and allow projects to use digital technologies such as building information modelling to improve the efficiency of their delivery.  As part of the reviews of our capital management systems, my Department will conduct a full assessment of how cost estimation for projects could be improved.  This will include exploring the potential for external peer review of cost estimates for projects over a certain size.</p><p> Moreover, we need to strengthen our capital management systems.  As I mentioned, we are reviewing our management system.  The Office of Government Procurement is conducting a review of construction strategy and we are reviewing the public spending code.  The purpose of these reviews is to examine how capital projects are currently selected, designed and delivered and to strengthen these processes, taking into account lessons from the range of projects that have been completed.  The reviews will result in a range of changes.  I would like to flag two of these at this stage.  One change will be earlier identification of projects.  At present, Departments are typically presented with projects which are fully formed or for which the delivery method and project roles and responsibilities have been set.  We believe that Departments should engage at an earlier stage to have more input into roles and responsibilities, delivery method and identification of risks and costs.  That process should take place earlier in the life cycle, particularly with larger projects.  Second, several high-profile projects have highlighted issues with the performance of advisory firms.  We propose to link payments to advisory firms to clear performance standards.  We will bring in performance standards linked to payments in future contracts with those firms.</p><p> I hope I have set out our Department's role in relation to the children's hospital.  I hope my briefing is helpful to the committee.  I am very happy to engage with any questions members may have. </p></speech>

At this stage, has Mr. Watt got to the bottom of what went wrong in the children's hospital project?  There is a confirmed overrun of &euro;450 million and there may be a lot more yet to come.  People want to know what went wrong.  Can Mr. Watt give a clear answer?</p></speech>

We adopted a two-stage process which involved significant preliminary expenditure, spending &euro;200 million on preliminary works.  There was a commitment to finalise the design and move to phase 2 of the project.  There was a view at the time of the signing of phase 1 of the contract that there was certainty about the approximate bill of quantities.  That did not turn out to be the case.  The estimates of how certain we were about the bill of quantities were not correct.  The bill of quantities increased very significantly compared with what was included in the project.  The reasons for the cost increase from the Government decision in spring 2017 to where we are now are set out very clearly.  Most of the increase relates to remeasurement of the bill of quantities.  There was some design scope creep.  Some value engineering savings were not delivered and other matters played a part.  The Mazars report and other discussions have very clearly set out the reasons for the increase in prospective costs.  We are working through what that means for future procurement.  That is what I have been trying to outline today.  One lesson is not to commit to projects until we have absolute certainty about costs and to ensure that we have detailed designs which form the basis for any cost.</p></speech>

Alternatively, was it the fact that the design brief and the detailed specification were not nailed down before the project was sanctioned?</p></speech>

However, the way in which this two-stage process was implemented and rolled out in effect led to the difficulties.  A contract was signed with an outline design and we were led to believe that there was certainty around the approximate bill of quantities.  We were told there might be some variation, but we were given a view during the preliminary works and when the first contract was signed that there was reasonable certainty about the bill of quantities.  That did not turn out to be the case.  This is critical to the expenditure to which we are committed.  We committed to significant expenditure before we knew the final cost.  We thought we knew the final cost but that was not true.  That should not happen in the future.  We should not commit until we have a very detailed design which has been competitively tendered and we know exactly how much it will cost.</p></speech>

In other words, it was based on quicksand.  It was a very rough estimate because the detailed design was not done.</p></speech>

Several issues have been identified that lead to a potential for that to rise further.  One of these is construction inflation.  The contractor must be compensated for any inflation above 4%, as per the average of three published tender price indices, which may occur after July 2019.  Has the Department worked out what that could potentially be?  The Office of Public Works, OPW, appeared before the committee a few weeks ago.  Its representatives said that in delivering their projects they find that construction inflation is in double digits.  They mentioned 11% or 12%.  What is the extra cost of every 1% above 4%?</p></speech>

We do not know what it will be.  The contract is very clear on what it says.  The Deputy is right in his interpretation of the contract.  That is absolutely certain.

However, I am sure that the Department of Heath can provide us with the figures on the associated costs.</p></speech>

That is from the HSE and the Department of Health; it is their estimate of the overrun.  There were details of the extra &euro;200 million in cost claims from BAM at that point.  Is there nothing wrong with that not being conveyed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department?</p></speech>

Clearly, it is not satisfactory that the Government was told in spring 2017 that a project would cost X but it transpired that it would cost significantly more.  It is obviously unsatisfactory and nobody is happy with it.  All I say to the Deputy is based on the information I received when we were notified of this.  Neither I nor anybody on this committee would work on another basis when being told of a serious problem or issue where the Minister was notified and he told us.  We asked for a report as that is what we must do.  It does not have to be a long report.  It can be a page saying the position is "X", and on foot of the report, colleagues in the relevant section of our Department met officials from the Department of Health and we put in a detailed submission to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.</p></speech>

Cost issues were emerging from late 2017 and concerns were being expressed.  It was confirmed in August 2018 that this was &euro;191 million over budget and BAM was seeking an extra &euro;200 million.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was not told about that until November, which is extraordinary.  Does Mr. Watt agree?</p></speech>

On 18 December 2018, the Government approved the final contract of &euro;1.433 billion, with Revised Estimates being issued the following day.  As far as I can see, the Estimates issued on budget day in October 2018 and again on 19 December did not take account of the increased costs of delivering the national children's hospital.  Why was that?</p></speech>

In the past number of years, those changes tended to be of a technical nature and not of a significant policy nature.  In the past, there used to be significant policy changes adding hundreds of millions of euro to the summary REV, the abridged REV and the final revised REV.  We now have technical adjustments and this year they consisted of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million.  Mr. Feeney can compare them but it was a small amount in the overall scheme.</p> <p>  We realised then that for the children's hospital to proceed and for the Government to make a decision, it needed to allocate more money for the hospital in the allocation for the Department for 2019.  We were anxious to publish the REV but, as the Deputy will be aware, there are many moving parts in this and it is a very detailed document.  We were anxious to publish it but the timeframe did not allow us to get the Government decision not only with respect to the children's hospital but also what the implications would be for other Votes.  The Minister and the Government took a view that there had to be a reallocation not just for one Vote but for other Votes.</p></speech>

There is one case in the State over the past 40 years where a fraudulent Estimate was delivered to the D&aacute;il but I will not bore the committee with the history of that.  It happened a long time ago.  I do not recall that happening in the recent past.  The Deputy responded to the budget on the day and we and the Department of Finance set out clearly the cost of every single change incorporated into the Estimates.  On this occasion, we would have preferred to have ensured the impact of the decision relating to the hospital and allocation for other spending profiles could have been incorporated into the Estimates.  We did not allow it because of the timeframe.  There was a discussion as to whether the REV should have been delayed but the decision was taken to publish it because the Government had made a final decision that had an impact on each element of the REV.</p></speech>

I have had the opportunity to appear before many committees in this role for a number of years.  It has always been my understanding that such matters are up to the accounting official or accountable official or person; I am not the Accounting Officer here today of course but I am the accountable person and the lead person of the Department.  I take responsibility for the Department and actions with the Department.  In taking that responsibility I am here with my colleagues trying to answer all the questions put by the committee.  If we cannot do so, we can come back to them in a written procedure.  It is my decision as to who comes before the committee.  The key issue of procurement in this matter related to the derogation from the standard form in the context of the contracts committee.  Mr. Feeney is the chairman of the contracts committee and he is here to answer any detailed questions that members have in that respect.  I understand Mr. Quinn will appear before an Oireachtas committee in his capacity as a member of the national children's hospital board.</p></speech>

It is up to the official responsible, the accountable person, to lead and be here to represent the Department, as well as explaining our role in the matter.  The official referred to by the Deputy does not have any function in respect of this matter as an officer of this Department.  He has a role with respect to his membership of the board but not as an officer of the Department.  I know that sort of Jesuitical distinction is not necessarily uppermost in people's minds in a debate but the reality is Mr. Quinn does not have a role with respect to his discharging of functions in the Department with this matter.  Mr. Feeney and other colleagues have such a role, as I do.  It was my judgment call and I am here.  I spent four hours before the Committee of Public Accounts this morning answering questions.  I have sent a detailed note to the committee and set out issues in a presentation.  I am here to answer questions.</p></speech>

I have received over 30 pieces of correspondence from four committees.  I have been criticised unfairly, on many occasions by many Deputies, for non-attendance at committees, which is untrue.  My colleague, Mr. Paul Quinn, who is an excellent official who discharges his functions diligently on behalf of the State, has been unfairly criticised.  I am not going to make a big fuss about it or get into an argument about it.  I am here to talk about the issues for which I am responsible.

There is the cost element and the value we put on the new hospital.  We currently have three children's hospitals.  Nobody is satisfied with the condition of these facilities.  I was in Temple Street Hospital a few weeks ago.  Members are aware from their own personal experiences or the experiences of their constituents that the current facilities we have for paediatric care in this country are not adequate and that is why everybody supports the construction of the new children's hospital.  There is a value on the new facility but nobody in this room, in my Department or anywhere else knows what that value is.  The cost of providing it is higher than we thought would be the case or would have hoped and a judgment call had to be made.  The Government made the judgment call in December to proceed with the new children's hospital even though the costs, as outlined to Deputy Michael McGrath, are greater than was anticipated.  The Government decided that even with that cost, the benefit and importance of this facility are such that it would proceed with it on behalf of the taxpayer.</p> <p>  In regard to what represents value for money, nobody can put a value on facilities.  On the question of whether I am convinced that everybody here will be happy to have this new facility, I think they will be.</p></speech>

We all want the best facilities, particularly for our children.  I have had reasons to attend Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals and I am aware of the condition of those facilities.  I do not accept that it is not possible to put a value on the new facility.  It is one of the central roles of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do that.  Mr. Watt is the Secretary General of that Department.  Value for money is a key role of his Department.  Mr. Watt said that nobody can put a value on the facility.  It is core element of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

In the normal course of events, projects are tendered on a lump sum basis, in respect of which a standard contract form is used.  In respect of the national children's hospital, the board appeared before the contracts committee over a number of years and debated the merits and feasibility of the existing approach versus the other approaches.  Following those debates, a derogation was sought from the lump sum contract and the board then proceeded on the two-stage basis.  A derogation was sought.  It is not for the contracts to approve that derogation or for my Department to approve it.  The board sought a derogation and it was awarded.

It is not entirely clear what the counterfactual would have been if we had adopted a lump sum contract.  It is not clear that the hospital would have been cheaper.  It might have taken us longer to get to the price and it would not have been described as an overrun versus the position set out at phase 1.  The counterfactual is not clear.  That is an important issue.  Nobody can say, and we are not convinced, that a different approach would have necessarily yielded a different result.  A different approach would have ensured the project did not evolve as it has done, with elements of the final cost being characterised as an overrun.  In terms of the implementation of the two-stage process, on this occasion, in my view, there were mistakes with it.  There are two issues.  First, to commit to significant spending on preliminary works and say that the Government could at a future date opt out when it gets to the maximum price is not credible.</p></speech>

The number used in this regard was 95% but that does not turn out to be the case.  The fact that bill of quantities was wrong meant that when the final tender price came out it was significantly above what the Government was told the price would be.  The fact we had committed significant spending on preliminary works made it very difficult at that stage for the Government to call a halt.  The cost of re-tendering and so on would have perhaps led to a situation where the alternatives would have been more expensive than continuing with the two-stage process.  I do not think <i>per se</i>the two-stage process in all cases is the wrong approach but there are lessons to be learned, as I tried to set out in my opening remarks, in terms of committing to significant spend on preliminary works while saying that the Government has an option to opt out.  I am not sure that is credible, to be honest.  It is only credible if, of course, the guaranteed final price is in line with the price that was set but the bill of quantities was obviously mis-specified.</p></speech>

The Secretary General at the Department of Health and the Minister for Health were made aware in late August that there was a &euro;191 million overrun and a potential additional &euro;200 overrun.  As Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, does Mr. Watt believe that that information should have been relayed to him at that point given the work the Department would be undertaking?</p></speech>

I will outline the point in case Mr. Watt did not understand.

The sanctioning body was the Government and the appropriate Department was the Department of Health.  We see from the minutes that have been released that the Department of Health was seeking to meet officials of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for a number of weeks to discuss the issue, but that meeting did not take place.  It took place at a later stage after the Minister had been alerted to the overruns.  Correspondence from Barry O'Brien to Tracey Conroy in the Department of Health basically states the Department received nothing from the Department of Health that considered the total cost and where the overall cost of the project stood.  It asks questions about other non-construction costs amounting to &euro;300 million, whether that figure will increase and if it is now a project that will cost over &euro;2 billion, which would make it the most expensive hospital in the world.  It appears from the content and tone of the email that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was put out by the fact that it had not been informed of this increase.  It acknowledges that there were some discussions on it at budget time, but there was no detail.  Is it the case that if a Department is developing a major project, whether it be a rail line, road or sewage treatment plant, and aware of a major overrun, that it is okay not to bring that information to the attention of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?</p></speech>

When we say something is going to cost X, what is the basis for it?  My view, which I have set out in the note, is that a cost indicated for something only has meaning when the specifications for the project are set out in full detail and the project has been tendered for competitively in the marketplace.  Many estimates before it are general in nature, particularly when it comes to once-off projects.</p> <p>  When it comes to the overall management of budgets, I am happy to defend the management of the public finances in the past few years.  When I was appointed to this role, the fiscal deficit was 15%, the banking system was bust, our international reputation was in tatters and we could not raise money on the financial markets.  The rate of unemployment is now 5%; we have a balanced budget; the yields on ten-year money are 100 basis points and so forth.  I am happy, therefore, to defend the role of the Department and my colleagues in the Department of Finance in managing the public finances.</p> <p>  To respond on this issue, the figure is &euro;100 million for 2019.  In the context of this project, clearly the overruns are very significant, at 40%, 50% and 60%, depending on which element of the budget one is discussing.  The figure of &euro;100 million has to be seen in the context of a capital budget for 2019 that is being increased by &euro;1.5 billion and an overall capital budget of &euro;8 billion.</p><p>If I use words like "not material", people out there will spin it as if I said that it is not significant.  It is significant but in the overall scheme of things, in the context of the size of the Irish State, it is a manageable amount of money.  </p><p> I would make a general point about the capital plan of which Deputies are aware, although it may not have received enough publicity.  The capital plan, by its nature, is an iterative plan.  There is a figure of &euro;116 billion set out there and a whole variety of projects will be funded within that.  How these projects are funded and the timeframe for projects, as the Deputy will know, changes.  One school will be ready before another one, there will be delays with one school so another school is prioritised and so on.  The same applies with primary care centres, roads projects and so on.  It is an iterative process involving many different actors and it will evolve over time.  Hopefully, if the economy continues to grow and prosper, we will have the resources to deliver all of the commitments set out in the plan.</p></speech>

Do Mr. Watt and his civil servants sit down with the Minister and Ministers of State and go through all of the pertinent financial and other issues related to the Department?  This is such a significant project in the Irish context and is so important to the country.  It is also such an expensive project, even at the old price, especially when one considers that the site was donated and we did not even have to buy the land.  In that context, how frequently did the Department discuss the project, in general terms, at its management meetings?  How frequently did the Department discuss the overall capital plan in the run-up to the budget?  Was there a discussion of the quality of that plan and the figures contained therein, particularly for very large projects like the children's hospital?</p></speech>

At those meetings each member of the management team sets out the issues for the week and we run through legislation, what is happening in the D&aacute;il and so forth.  We have a management forum every third or fourth week where we discuss things in more detail, including policy issues that colleagues want to bring to the table.  The Minister sits in on the meetings.  Once every four or five weeks, he will come along, discuss his priorities and check with colleagues about how we are getting on with those.</p> <p>  In the run-up to the publication of Project Ireland 2040, discussions on the capital plan with the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government and colleagues in other Departments would have been on the agenda pretty much every week in the formulation of the plan because it was a key part of what we were doing.  In the run-up to the budget, every Monday morning we discussed progress on the budget in respect of current spending and overall capital spending.  The main focus tends to be on the larger budgets so most of the conversation would be related to social welfare packages and current spending on health, including medical cards and so on.  There would also be issues relating to education and justice but most of the time, as the Deputy knows from her own time in government, focus is on the larger spending Departments.  In the run-up to the last budget there was not a significant discussion on capital spending because it is, in effect, locked down in the main because we have a multi-annual approach to such spending.  We have five-year plans and we have a ten-year plan-----</p></speech>

Of course, there were discussions about capital allocations but the adjustment to the capital envelope for 2019 compared with what would have been in previous documentation in respect of the allocation for the year was not significant.  There was more money put in for housing, over &euro;100 million, because there were various issues relating to serviced sites and so on that were included as part of the negotiations.  There were other issues too but I do not think that the capital allocation was very different from what we expected it to be some months before the budget discussions took place.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the contractors are able to call the shots on variations, although Mr. Watt has said that they will have to prove their case.  Is there an effective cartel in operation among a chosen group of contractors?  The Taoiseach was in Lisbon last week and I did some research on hospital projects in Portugal.  A hospital is being built there at the moment comprising 875 rooms, so it is much bigger than our children's hospital.  It is expected to come in at &euro;330 million or, to round it off, less than &euro;400 million.  Did Mr. Watt and his Department or the Department of Health have a look at comparative costings of hospitals in different parts of the world?  When this project was originally mooted, I did that.  I visited children's hospitals when I went to the USA for St. Patrick's Day.  The Irish national children's hospital is stunningly expensive and Mr. Watt has not explained why that is so.  He made reference to the fact that it is being built on a brownfield site.  Let us say that a brownfield site adds 10% or 15% to the cost.  I am prepared to accept that but I ask Mr. Watt to explain to us, on behalf of taxpayers, how we got it so incredibly wrong.  Is there a cartel in operation?  It seems that contractors are pitching at particular prices but those prices are only a first guesstimate and they get inflated afterwards.  How does that happen in Ireland when similar projects in other countries are coming in at a much lower cost?  I know that wage costs in other countries may not be exactly the same but even in places like California, hospital projects are cheaper than they are here.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt is aware of the section 38 and 39 institutions that rely on the State for capital funding.  I am talking specifically about hospice developments around the country.  A voluntary project to build a hospice for one or even two counties will involve a huge amount of voluntary fundraising.  Mr. Watt will know about the project in Blanchardstown which has been ongoing for years.  At the end, the State comes in and tops up the funding to finish off the development and allow the hospice to open.  Mr. Watt just said that &euro;100 million is manageable but what is going to happen this year to the section 38 and 39 organisations that are due to receive capital funding?  A sum of &euro;100 million is a lot in the context of their projects.  Can Mr. Watt say that no hospice in the country will be delayed for funding reasons?  Where will the &euro;100 million come from?  We have heard from the Taoiseach and a range of Ministers that it will be &euro;3 million off this and &euro;3 million off that in a range of Departments.  The Department of Health is offering up some of the budgetary reductions so what is going to happen to the section 38 and 39 allocations?</p></speech>

I know more about Blanchardstown than I want to know, to be honest.  I hear a lot of talk about Blanchardstown and other matters in Dublin West, as it turns out, funnily enough.  I am familiar with the issues relating to the section 38 and 39 organisations.  There is a broader question there relating to their status and how their capital is funded because they have to do more fundraising and they do not benefit from Exchequer funding for projects in the same way as other bodies in the health system.</p><p>They do not benefit from the same Exchequer funding for projects as other bodies classified differently within the health system, but that is a wider policy question which I am not mandated to discuss.</p><p> On the small number of contractors, there is an issue with the depth of contractors in Ireland, particularly for larger projects.  It is definitely the case and we have debated and discussed whether we can get more international players involved and more people considering these projects.  Part of what we have tried to do with Project Ireland 2040 is set out a pipeline of projects and try to attract home some of the consulting and construction teams which left for the Middle East, Australia or Canada during the crash, which is something we have debated.  Nevertheless, I agree with the Deputy that there is an issue, although I would not describe it as a cartel, given that such behaviour would be a legal offence.  I am not covered by privilege at the committee and, therefore, I will not comment in that regard.  It is certainly the case that a small number of contractors bid for these projects, which would have implications for the competitive nature of any competition.  It is not fair in any way to suggest I am belittling the additional costs associated with this project.  I am not and we have been very serious about it since we realised there was an issue.  The sum of &euro;100 million, however, needs to be considered in the overall context.  We should not give the impression to taxpayers and citizens that no projects are delivered on time or on budget.</p><p> In fact, as members will know better than I, the vast majority of projects such as primary schools, secondary schools, primary care centres, motorways and other roads are delivered through lump sum tender contracts where the price comes below, at or slightly above where we tendered.  It is not fair, therefore, to characterise the case of the national children's hospital as a fair representation of the generality of product delivery in the State.  Rather, it is fair to learn lessons from the project, particularly the circumstances of dealing with large bespoke projects, and the merits of different options.  Our focus is on trying to ensure that the public spending code is reinforced, that procurement policy is reinforced and that we do all we can to ensure that we get value for money for future projects.  While it is not meant as an excuse, there has been some debate or chat that Dermot Bannon's kitchen extension would not be dealt with in this way but that comparison is utterly facile and is of no relevance to the discussion whatsoever.</p></speech>

I have a copy of a letter sent from Mr. Watt's Department to the Department of Health, dated 20 November, in which it is stated that, as the Department of Health would be aware, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had voiced serious concerns about the governance of the children's hospital project and was assured that the arrangements in place were sufficiently robust.  What serious concerns did Mr. Watt have, and if he had serious concerns, what measures did he put in place to ensure that those concerns could be allayed?</p></speech>

The emails and correspondence, or at least the timeline for those discussions, have been set out in the public domain.  We raised issues with the governance because of its complexity and we wanted to ensure that whoever was given responsibility for managing the project, that is, the sponsoring agency, had the necessary expertise.  That led to the decision to establish the children's board, which comprised people with significant experience, mostly in the private sector where people had experience dealing with large projects.  Tom Costello, for example, who chaired the board, had worked for Sisk for 30 years in Ireland and elsewhere, while other people on the board had a whole variety of relevant qualifications.  We had discussions about governance because we were concerned about it and wanted to ensure there was clarity as to which body was the sponsoring entity and which body was the sanctioning authority that would manage the oversight on a daily basis on behalf of the Government.  They were our concerns and we raised them consistently.</p> <p>  I am not allowed to discuss Government memos because they are covered by other procedures but, as the Minister for Health and the Secretary General at the Department of Health have set out, the Government memo of 2017 outlined the governance structure.  At that point, we were satisfied that the governance structure could deliver the project.  Long before my time, the Department had consistently raised issues with the cost of the project, which has been running for 20 or 30 years.  In 2012, there was the issue with the Mater Hospital site and there was the decision where the planning permission was refused.  We went back to the drawing board and the then Minister for Health, Senator Reilly, came forward with a review of the different options.  It was decided that the hospital would be co-located with St. James's Hospital and then it was off and running.  We had significant problems with the cost of the project and how we could manage it given its scale.  We made those concerns known to the Department and they were consistently set out in observations on memos during that period.</p></speech>

A derogation to move away from the lump sum contract was sought and granted.  If the alternative to the two-stage process was a lump sum contract, it is not clear, although I accept that no members would claim otherwise, that we would have delivered the hospital faster or more cheaply in a better way that would have satisfied the concerns that people have.  I do not think it would have happened that we would be in a position to set out the detailed design required to have a competitive competition for a lump sum contract.  I do not think we would have attracted contractors who would have taken on board that risk, given the inevitable uncertainty of the two-stage process.</p> <p>  The issue is the way the two-stage process was managed.  While I do not think the decision to have a two-stage process was the wrong one, it is clear that there are issues with how it was managed and lessons will be learned for the future.  Other projects that are significant for the State are being developed where there will be considerable challenges such as finalising a design and deciding when the design will be put to market.</p></speech>

It is not exactly the same as the approach to the children's hospital.  It is working to a guaranteed maximum price for the project but works are not currently being undertaken.</p></speech>

The implementation of this particular two-stage process, of course, has led to these difficulties.  As far as I can see there are two problems which I mentioned to Deputy Pearse Doherty: committing to significant preliminary works which, in effect, tie the Government into completing a project on that site without us knowing the final tender; and that the approximate bill of quantities was not in any way consistent ultimately with what we were told it would be in spring 2017.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt will say the contractor again.  There are a couple of issues for people looking at this.  Obviously there is the governance about which he had serious concerns, not just general governance observations or whatever but serious concerns.  A number of people in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are dedicated solely to monitoring the health budget and what is spent on health.  However, nobody in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform knew what was happening even going back to 20 October 2017 where the &euro;40 million overrun was identified.  In that instance &euro;40 million is a lot of money.  How many people in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform monitor health spending?</p></speech>

There was a significant debate which I have set out.  I am in danger of repeating myself here.  Significant issues were raised repeatedly with the Department of Health in the run-up to the decision in 2017.  It was our understanding that we had a final tender price which was going to be close to the final bill here and that turned out not to be the case.  I have set out why I think that is.  Mr. O'Brien, who is the expert, will confirm this.  We had to learn lessons from it and it has implications for how we manage projects.  I have not spent the past eight weeks or longer since this issue came up among the other challenges we face finding out who did what, when and how.  I have been working with the Minister, as I was asked to do, to set out what this means for the delivery of this facility, and what it means for the capital allocations for next year and this year, and then-----</p></speech>

I have not come into this committee with my hands down by my side saying, "There's nothing to see here.  There are no lessons."  I have not said that.  I have set out in a long contribution the issues I think this raises for public policy.  They are not in any way trivial issues.  If we do things differently in the future, it means it will take us longer to do projects because we will need to spend an awful lot more time and money on getting detailed designs and we will not go through a process where we have this two-stage approach.  It raises fundamental issues for us in terms of how we manage projects which people here will be grappling with in the future no doubt.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt stated: "The Government will no longer commit to major bespoke projects until there is clarity on tendered costs."  How can one tender for something when one does not know the design?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-03-07a.1042" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019030700002#K02100"><p>Clearly with a lump sum contract a very detailed design is set out and contractors will price it based on the detailed design.  What can happen is that there is an adversarial relationship and there is a lot of discussion about price variation where the contractor will say, "Oh, you said you wanted windows like that or that number of windows.  In actual fact we needed X number of windows.  Therefore we're going to argue that it wasn't us; it was the design."  There are endless discussions about the extent to which even the detailed design matches up with the ultimate requirements of the client, what is being delivered by the contractor.</p> <p>  What we are saying clearly is it does not relate to building a school or a primary care centre because they are projects we repeat time and time again and we know what we are doing.  When it comes to projects that are unique, the learning from us here - we are here to advise the Minister and the Government - is that we need to spend much more time on the detailed design before we can commit that design to tender.  That will increase cost certainty, we believe, but it will come at a cost because it will take an awful lot more time and money to develop the detailed design particularly for once-off projects.</p></speech>

It is impossible for people to understand why a design could not have been done for a project of this size.  We meet departmental officials all the time now.  There is a cost to this.  There is a cost in cutbacks and things that people do not have now because of the mistakes that were made.  Having listened to Mr. Watt, I am not convinced that the communication mechanisms are in place within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the other Departments to ensure that overruns and governance issues are not reported to the Department which will have a major impact on its budget planning.  Based on what I have heard today, I am not convinced that there has been sufficient learning.  I am concerned that there is a normalising of what happened.</p></speech>

The first concerns the overrun and its extent, and the distinction to be made there.  The second relates to the delay in the Government finding out about it, compared with the position of the board.  In that respect, the position of Paul Quinn, the chief procurement officer, is important given that he was on the development board.  First, to return to the question of why he is not here now and why he was not at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts earlier, Mr. Watt said, and I agree that this is a description of the situation legally, that it was his decision.  Mr. Watt made the decision that he would not come.  I accept that.  However, can he explain why he made that decision and why he did not think, given that Mr. Quinn was on the board and the chief procurement officer, that Mr. Quinn could bring important information to light or at least was worthy of important questioning by Members of the Oireachtas in view of his unique position of being on the board?  Why make the decision not to have him here today?</p></speech>

That was Paul Quinn's fiducial duty and he carried out that duty.  Regarding his role on the children's hospital board, he is there not as a member of the Department but in a personal capacity.  I know that is a little Jesuitical but it is important for the purpose of this discussion.  Ultimately, David O'Brien is the chair of the Government construction contracts committee, and that is the key committee that was involved in this decision relating to the derogation.</p><p>Mr. O'Brien is the chair of the Government's construction contracts committee.  That is the key committee involved in the decision in respect of the derogation.  It was my view that Mr. O'Brien should be here to answer questions.  I understand that there is another invitation for each member of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  Mr. Quinn will go along to committee in that capacity, as is appropriate, when that invitation is received.</p></speech>

It has sometimes been said that he was on the board in a personal capacity as a way of getting out of the obligations of that circular.  Mr. Watt seems to accept that those obligations applied to him.</p></speech>

There is no contradiction between the two.  They are complementary.  I addressed this issue in my submission and I addressed it this morning at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am 100% sure that Mr. Quinn discharged his duties and acted appropriately.  He has done a brilliant job for the State over the last six years as head of the procurement office.  He has established an office and driven very significant reform.  In light of his previous role as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Chairman will be aware of the significant problems we have had - and still have although they are not as great as they were - in respect of unprofessional procurement practices in how we do our business.  Mr. Quinn has been very much engaged in the professionalisation of that function.  He has done an excellent job.  I am happy that he discharged his functions in respect of this matter.  I have no problem with him.  I will not get into an argument about the ins and outs of all this.  I do not believe it is appropriate that officials are named as they have been.  They are now named in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  That should not happen but it now happens repeatedly without any sanction and without anybody saying that they are not happy about remarks being made about civil servants when they cannot defend themselves.  I am not happy about that.  I made a decision about Mr. Quinn's attendance today.  He discharged his functions in the circumstances.  I have no problem whatsoever with that.</p></speech>

That is useful.  I thank Mr. Watt.  He made an interesting point earlier.  He spoke about a counterfactual situation in which we were not here.  He said, fairly, that different variants were possible.  One was that we did not have an overrun, but another is that the hospital would have been the same price without this process.  If it ended up in the second position, which is that this is the cost to build this sort of children's hospital at this time and to these specifications, would that indicate a problem with the way in which BAM tendered?  Would it be an example of the lowballing about which the Taoiseach was talking?</p></speech>

I was not involved in the selection process and, as the Deputy knows, I am not involved with the sanctioning agency or authority, but I understand BAM's tender was lower than others.  There is a variety of reasons for the escalation in costs.  These relate to the bill of quantities, the design scope, and simulations of value engineering.  Debate will take place about how fault is apportioned between the different players, but it is not the case that this is all BAM's problem.  That is clearly not the case.  There might be issues there in respect of the value savings.  I have not thought about it in those terms but I do not think it is as straightforward as that.</p> <p>  Issues around abnormally low tenders have been raised.  That raises a whole variety of questions.  If, for example, we were building a motorway and a tender came in that was &euro;100 million lower than the second cheapest tender and it became apparent that, for some reason, the National Transport Authority, NTA, had decided not to go with that lowest tender, the Committee of Public Accounts and everybody else would have the NTA in and would be saying that it was an absolute disgrace that the lowest tender was not picked.  How does one construct a process which ensures that people do not come in low and then fight for increases?  That is the issue.  The way to stop that is to have the best-quality information.  As Mr. O'Brien pointed out to me repeatedly, the best information possible and very clear and detailed designs will ensure that, when it comes down to it, there will not be that level of dispute.  If the design is specified one will of course have the normal adversarial discussions, because contractors try to maximise the benefit to themselves, but one will not have the type of issues that can lead to significant problems with delivery on budget.  </p> <p>  I am getting there in a roundabout way but, on the issue of abnormally low tenders, one could debate - and we have had these debates - whether one should give top marks for bidding close to the median price.  There is, however, then a danger that everybody will try to guess the median price and will cluster around it.  One will then not have the type of competition one wants.  There has been discussion on changing the weighting.  It has been suggested that less weight should be given to price and more to non-price factors.  However, if one is building a school, a school is a school.  What are the factors that will enable one to determine the winning bid?  All those tendering will say that they will build a school.  The factor on which a decision is made is the price.  Can a competition be constructed that ensures that non-price factors are significant?  Can other criteria be introduced into the system?  </p> <p>  There a big policy issue with respect to abnormally low tenders, but I do not have the solution.  No solutions are immediately obvious or clear from our perspective.</p></speech>

One therefore avoids this whole process, the dangers involved in it, the involvement of all these companies which seek to maximise profit, and the race to the bottom with respect to working conditions and so on that goes along with that.</p></speech>

There would be no competition because there would be one supplier of labour, namely, the State employees, with all the issues related to that.  The public good is funded by the taxpayer but the delivery of the public good is in a contestable market.  That is the most efficient way of doing that in the construction market.</p></speech>

We could have an ideological discussion about socialising the construction sector and what that would mean but that is a policy matter that is outside my remit.  I do not think that it is a matter for this committee.  There was a time in the past, which I have heard people talk about, where local authorities used to do the vast majority of work themselves and did not use contractors.  I do not think that that was necessarily the most efficient way.</p></speech>

We have concentrated a lot of the time between August 2018 and when it was approved in December.  I want to go back before that as that is only a manifestation of the problems that arose well before then.  I want to examine the sequence.</p> <p>  I first refer to the derogation.  When did the application for the derogation come in, that there would be a different approach?  This is a change from a detailed once-off tendering process to being a two-stage process where underground was detailed.  Has underground come in on budget?  How much did this cost?  Overground was preliminary in design, and much of the detail in that was published in a press release published by the National Children's Hospital Development Board on its website on the same day it was approved by Cabinet.  The board went into great detail.  When did this come in?  How was it approved?  Was a specific type of alternative tendering process pursued?  Who signed off on it?  Was there any further follow-up in the application of that tendering process?</p></speech>

The process was at a very preliminary stage then.  They were working through how this would be delivered.  One must consider the context.  September 2013 was the first time that we saw any growth in activity in the construction sector since May 2007, when the financial crisis hit.  We had a very fragile construction sector at that time.  The board had very real concerns about how a project of this scale would be delivered.  Did anyone have the capacity to deliver it?  As such, various approaches were looked at.</p> <p>  In May 2014, they issued us a note with preliminary faults.</p></speech>

Again, given the scale and complexity of this project, had one gone with a fixed price lump sum approach, it is questionable whether one would have had a contract or tender on that basis because of the risk being taken on for a project of that size.</p></speech>

There was a weakness within that particular process because it meant whoever got appointed for phase A and phase B was getting detailed underground but preliminary design overground.

It was a process where they would come in, start the works, get the team together, get on site and then move towards the process of getting to the guaranteed maximum price.</p></speech>

The understanding for the stage two process was that the design at the tender stage would be a detailed design and that the approximate bill of quantities would be 95% certain - I think that was the expression.  The issue was exactly as the Senator describes it and as we have spoken about today already, namely, a derogation was given on the basis that there would be more certainty about the nature of the final design than was the case.  That is the reality of it.</p></speech>

Effectively, the Department was just looking at profile versus spending and, given the design of its monitoring process, it would not have picked that up.  Am I correct in that?</p></speech>

That did not happen until six months later, so it was to be ten months and it overran to nearly 16 months.  The overrun was of the order of 33% of the cost, or &euro;191 million, exclusive of VAT.  As I am assuming VAT is at 13.5%, the gross overrun is well over &euro;200 million at about &euro;217 million.</p><p>Is it not fair to say that the monitoring system in the Department should have facilitated picking up that level of overspend of nearly one third-----</p></speech>

In summary, is it not fair to say that, first, the tendering process that was established, which was a two-stage process rather than an overall lump sum process, contributed to the weakness in the overspend that allowed a preliminary design and, second, the reporting procedures within the Department should have picked that up because if it had looked at not just what was spent to date but changes and increases in spending, that overspend would have been picked up much earlier and we would not be where we are today?</p></speech>

For example, the Taoiseach has said that he takes responsibility on behalf of Government for this overrun but as magnanimous as that is, it cannot be allowed to stop there, notwithstanding the PwC report that is ongoing.</p> <p>  The Senator beside me has touched on it and I want to concentrate on this area.  Who is responsible for the &euro;450 million overspend?  It has a knock-on effect, namely, as prescribed but not necessarily teased out, the &euro;100 million this year but there will be multiples of &euro;100 million for the next number of  years, which will force the same Taoiseach and others to row back on commitments they have been making for the past year or two since they announced the Project 2040 capital development plan.  They have been slow to do that but they were very quick to tell different constituencies how they would benefit.  I am told we will get more details on that in the spring economic statement.  The people on the contracts committee are the ones who granted a derogation from the way this is normally done.  They did that based on information and a recommendation by the board or a sub-committee of the board.  That allowed the Government to sanction it because it was happy that the contracts committee was involved.  I would like to see a written list of the members of the contracts committee.  Who are they?  Who appointed them?  What responsibility and expertise do they have because it further appears that when that application was made to them, they took the word of the board and the information that was available to it?  The committee never questioned, scrutinised or analysed the bill of quantities or the expertise behind that document.  I would have thought it may be standard practice in the private sector for an independent assessment of that but maybe these guys are so expert in their own fields they did not need that.  That is why I want to see who they are or what they are because it would appear they took what was presented to them hook, line and sinker.  That gave the Government an out and everybody then proceeded accordingly.  Mr. Watt said earlier that the contracts committee is responsible to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Am I correct?</p></speech>

Mr. Watt said he sits on another committee that meets on a weekly basis to discuss capital spending across all Departments.  I imagine it engages in extra scrutiny around the time of the Estimates.  However, the information was not relayed to Mr. Watt to bring forward an Estimate.  Of course, it was not fraudulent, but it had to be amended because of it.  That amendment could have taken place before now.  That is neither here nor there but the bottom line is that there is a contracts committee which is ultimately responsible for allowing the board to go down this path.  That falls under Mr. Watt's Department.</p></speech>

I do not say that in a way which dumps on them.  I am not suggesting for a moment that we are not involved because we are.  I have set out our responsibilities and the lessons we can learn from this position.  Certainly, my conclusion from this is that it is very hard at this remove, with the benefit of hindsight, to say that was the wrong approach.  Clearly, the implementation of that approach did not deliver what we all expected.</p></speech>

As I said to Mr. Watt at the beginning, I would have thought my role was to establish as far as I can who is accountable, who is culpable and how this can be rectified into the future.  How can we be certain it will not happen again?  The Taoiseach can say he takes responsibility and run off but it is not as simple as that.  From what I have heard here today, especially, I am convinced the contracts committee was asked for a derogation and granted it and, therefore, has some responsibility and culpability.  As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I would like to see who is on this committee.  That is all.  Mr. Watt has given me minutes and I can check it against that.</p></speech>

Is that not a conflict of interest in that one player is on the board of the children's hospital while the others are on a committee which answered to Mr. Quinn, as the chief procurement officer?

Having read through the minutes, my sense is that there was a dialogue or a conversation.  The experts who have experience were trying to use their expertise to help the national children's board.  When the board came with an outline proposal, there was a debate, a conversation or a dialogue.  We should not have given the impression that it was a formal application.  It was a debate or consultation.  It went on over 18 months.  It was a rolling conversation.  It eventually led to the collective view that this option was the best option.  I accept what Deputy Cowen said earlier.  I would not want to characterise it as a conflict because it is not.  They are all trying to do the same job.</p></speech>

Every procurement process of any scale that we undertake in Ireland leads to the threat of legal action or to actual legal action.  This is a very litigious area which is covered by EU directives transposed into Irish law.  There are armies of solicitors working for the main contractors.  This is a very contested space in terms of how the awarding of the contracts is managed and in terms of the delivery of the contracts and how they are operationalised.  The Chairman is aware of the situation we had in Grangegorman.  He has previously quizzed me on that situation, which led to a three-year delay in that contract.  There are many other cases.  Unfortunately, there are difficulties.</p></speech>

There was a change, not in the tender process but in the circumstances of all of this.  The other bidders - if there were other bidders - would surely have had to be asked.  It changed, and the Department stuck with the one contract and the one tender.  Even though there had been a change, it did not revert back to any of the other players.  Has the children's hospital board left itself open to legal action?</p></speech>

From the outset, the intention to undertake the guaranteed maximum price process was subject to change.  That was clear to the tenderers that were taking on the process.  From that perspective, everybody would have been aware of the potential.  The process is designed to bring people in to work through the issues with the project to arrive at the guaranteed maximum price.

We did our best to have the meeting and be constructive about it.  Just to be helpful, we invited members of two other committees - the budgetary committee and the health committee - because of the number of invitations Mr. Watt had received.  We notified the other committee members.  In our correspondence to Mr. Watt, we asked that Mr. Quinn would attend.  We did so because of the fact that his Department works with this committee.  Mr. Watt, or somebody, chose not to have Mr. Quinn here.</p></speech>

Whatever about differences Deputies have about where we are now, I think we have tried to set out our roles and responsibilities fairly and as well as we can.  It is my job to represent the Department and take responsibility for the Department.  I hope we have done that today at this committee and at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think Mr. Quinn has said that if the committee invites the children's board, he will be happy to come along in the context of his role as a member of the national children's board.  I think that is fair enough.</p></speech>

In the context of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, would Mr. Watt not have thought of stating to the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Minister that it would have been a good idea to get an independent assessment in place to report directly back?

The Government wanted to achieve it.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, had a role in respect of advice up to 2014.  That is according to Mr. Watt's own note.  I am reading from that.  At one stage, therefore, the NDFA was involved.  The Government, that is the Cabinet, made the decision.  The Department of Health was involved because that is the overseeing Department in respect of the expenditure.  The HSE was involved because it-----</p></speech>

The HSE ended up deciding to have PwC involved.  Mr. Watt's Department has the contracts committee.  Advice was given by the OGP directly to the national children's hospital board and the Department had someone on that board.  In spite of all that Government involvement, from political aspects to the various structures I have mentioned, it has been possible, collectively, to make a right cock-up of the cost of the national children's hospital.  Even in accounting for that, and I appreciate Mr. Watt's role in this, it has spread to many different agencies.</p> <p>  For one reason or another, each agency is able to wash its hands and state that it is not its responsibility but that of another agency.  Looking back over the history of expenditure in the State, there was some good expenditure.  I agree with Mr. Watt that there was also much over-expenditure.  The State has learned very little.  In private industry, people would be running a mile from a project if the price was not secured, if the money was not secured and if the professionals were not in place.  We seem to have had layers of professionals in place on this project.</p></speech>

How did all those bodies come together and arrive at a situation where not only can we not get a handle on how much this is going to cost us when it is finished, but we cannot even get a handle on the efficiency of the spending or the bad spending that took place.</p></speech>

There are clear issues that we have learned from.  My sense of the governance structure is clear enough.  The national children's hospital board was established to deliver this hospital and it is full of people with significant expertise.  The authority was the Department of Health.  There was a role for the contracts committee but that was very clear in respect of the roles of the board of the national children's hospital and the Department of Health.  A variety of issues are being aired about how this project has been managed.  We need to ensure that does not happen again.  I do not wish to be discordant or disagree with the Chair, but it is not true to state this does not happen in the private sector.  It happens all the time in the private sector.  We do not hear about it and somebody involved does not spend nine hours in one day in front of D&aacute;il committees talking about it.</p></speech>

It was then up to the board to develop its own strategy.  We advised and discussed.  As the Secretary General outlined, there was extensive discussion on the matter.  On the basis of the circumstances of the project, there was agreement, in principle, among the committee.  It was not me making the decisions, there was much expertise around the table.  That then is the basis of the derogation.  We were satisfied a lump sum approach was not suitable in the circumstances.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt stated that the CPO was satisfied that matters were being addressed by the board and reported through the governance arrangements established by the HSE and the Department of Health.  He went on to state that the CPO would have advised the Minister for Health if he felt that serious matters were not being addressed and were not being communicated to the Department of Health through the governance structures.</p><p>I take from this that the chief procurement officer was satisfied that the chairman of the children's hospital board was reporting to the Minister.</p></speech>

The note also mentions the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, which assisted with a review of the financial robustness of the design team, architects, quantity surveyors and engineers.  It is indicated the NDFA has had no involvement with the project since 2016, when the NDFA's formal engagement as adviser to the HSE ended.  It is extraordinary that another agency did all of this.  We cannot forget the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General also did a value for money audits and the charge on it was &euro;38,000.  In spite of all that, this has happened.  It must be said over and over again.  We have not got to the end of this by a long shot.  If Mr. Watt was concerned about officials and civil servants not doing their job, or indeed the Minister not doing his job, would he feel obliged to say it?</p></speech>

The Estimate figure of &euro;464 million takes account of the rescheduling of funding to programme A, flood risk management, that was within the original Estimate I presented to the committee on 12 February.  During my attendance at the previous committee meeting I outlined how the 2019 allocation for flood risk management would support both capital infrastructural and non-infrastructural work to mitigate flooding and provide much needed protection for homes and businesses.  I reiterate the Government's commitment within the national development plan of &euro;1 billion for flood risk management.  The rescheduling of funds in no way undermines my commitment to achieve the targets outlined in the 29 flood risk management plans published in 2018 or the 119 new projects to be undertaken in addition to the 35 projects included in the existing programme.  This work will be progressed in the next decade and provide protection for 95% of the properties assessed in the plans to be at significant flood risk.</p> <p>  The OPW will consider all possible options to mitigate any negative impact of the rescheduling of funds from the original Estimate presented to the committee.</p><p>The OPW currently has ten flood relief projects at construction stage, 25 schemes at design and planning stages and an additional 57 new projects from the flood risk management plans which I announced in May 2018 on which further design work will be advanced during 2019.  As the committee will be aware, the progression of these projects is dependent on many variables.  Hence, the OPW will review progress throughout 2019 in order to assess where the rescheduling of funds is most effectively allocated.  I fully support the OPW in this exercise and reassure the committee that all projects will be delivered in the quickest possible timeframe.</p><p> There is no change to the 2019 Estimates funding of &euro;355 million previously presented to the committee regarding estate management, which supports the OPW in the provision of accommodation for civil servants and the ongoing enhancement, maintenance and preservation of the State&rsquo;s heritage sites and monuments.</p><p> I thank the committee members and administrators for the speed in scheduling the reconsideration of the OPW 2019 Estimates and I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

The burning issue when dealing with the Estimates is that the OPW is currently reviewing the most appropriate means of achieving its required capital rescheduling of &euro;3 million in the flood risk management area.  The big question for many of the community groups the Minister of State has worked with on the alleviation of flooding in their areas is whether there will be an impact on the timing of their project.  I understand the knock-on effects of this rescheduling have not been identified.  Can the Minister of State give comfort to those groups that have made applications and have been part of the CFRAM programme either as priority projects or further down the line that they will not see a delay in the flood relief and mitigation measures in their communities?</p></speech>

There will be no delays under my watch.  Planning issues can be unforeseen.  I stressed this in the D&aacute;il in recent days.  Having announced all the schemes, I had hoped to have machines in the ground in Cork last summer, but there has been a delay.  The same applies in Ennis south.  Thankfully we will sign the Ennis south contract next week.  Given that type of delay, I believe I can absorb the &euro;3 million loss.</p> <p>  As the Chairman will know, in his constituency I announced further schemes under tranche 2 which had not been in the first allocation.  The Deputy and other Deputies from his neck of the woods were in my office when I announced the second one.  I am in the advanced stage of announcing schemes and getting them up and running.  We try to do these in a timely fashion but there can be delays in the planning process.  That is where I believe I can deliver on the schemes.  I am committed to ensuring that no woman, man or child need fear that I will not get on with the job that I am proposing.  My record speaks for itself.  When we went into government, we were spending &euro;43 million on flood relief schemes and we are now spending &euro;73 million.  It is a major increase in a year.  I am committed to ensuring that those schemes will be delivered.</p></speech>

We both agree that every euro - possibly more - is needed to deal with communities at risk of flooding.  Did I understand the Minister of State to say that the Department will not take any conscious decision to delay any project and that he expects the full &euro;3 million to be absorbed because of delays that are outside the Department's control?  Although the Minister of State is quite certain and we understand the number of projects in planning, if those delays do not materialise, can he confirm the Department will not take a conscious decision to delay any projects as a result of the-----</p></speech>

Has the OPW investigated more natural flood defences such as the slow-flow model?  Is there a danger that an approach from the OPW that sees physical concrete defences as the best way of preventing flooding to communities and property is causing delays resulting in difficulty for homeowners and businesses in being able to avail of insurance?  Has the OPW examined other non-concrete defences to prevent flooding?</p></speech>

The best practice that we are engaged in at the present time is the best possible way of protecting homes.  However, it is not all about concrete walls.  We have announced the schemes, but when we bring in architects into a town sometimes it is not easy.  One has to break eggs to make an omelette.  We have to be able to do the work to protect people.  We are trying to do a better job in helping and enhancing towns and villages around the country.  Where we go in and do the work, we always leave a town in a far better way.  Particularly in an historic town it is hard to get everything right.  That is why the consultation with residents through the local authorities is working well.</p></speech>

What engagement has the Minister of State or his Department had with the industry on the matter?  We repeatedly hear frustration from business owners and homeowners who cannot get insurance despite flood relief measures that have been implemented.</p></speech>

Where we have put in the defences, insurance companies are now coming on board to insure the place.  As the Deputy can imagine, each insurance company operates different policies.  We are happy to say that it is starting to crank up and they are getting insurance.  I see that across the country.  Even in my town, Athlone, where people could not get insurance and where no flood defences have started yet, they are getting insurance.  I accept it is costly in some cases, but where we are building the defences, insurance premiums are coming down and people are getting insurance.</p> <p>  On the last occasion the Chairman asked about insurance companies using the flood risk maps.  I have checked it out.  In no way are they using the maps.  They have their own maps regarding insurance setting out the parameters of where there is a flood risk and where there is not.  If the Deputy or the Chairman is aware of individual cases, I invite him to bring them to my attention and I will take them up with the insurance companies the next time I meet them.</p></speech>

I have previously mentioned examples in my community where a river flooded nearly a decade ago and caused substantial damage to businesses and homes in the vicinity.  I know of one homeowner who was refused insurance because of the potential for that river to flood again.  Looking at a map one would see that the home is quite close to the river and therefore one might believe it is at a risk of flooding.  However, because not all land is flat, if one were in the area, one would see that the house is on the top of quite a high hill.  If that house were to flood, a big part of the parish would also flood.  There is concern about insurance companies taking a blanket approach based on their own maps or the Department's maps showing that a house is close to a river.  Local knowledge is not being brought to bear.</p></speech>

If one reads the small print, it will show that the insurance company takes that stand where houses are close to a river.  I take the Deputy's point about a house on a hill.  In cases where people argued with the insurance companies, brought them out and proved to them that their houses could never flood, in fairness to the insurance companies they have been supportive of them.</p></speech>

They have shared pictures of the heavy rainfall over the past 48 hours.  Those pictures are scary and I will share some of them with the Minister of State later.  He knows Castlefinn and Ballybofey well because he accompanied me to meet residents there previously.  It is frightening to see the level of water lying around those premises and businesses, especially since that was not a flooding event.  </p> <p>  Those communities suffered two "once in 100 year" events within a few weeks some years ago.  It is part of the programme and on the priority list, along with Burnfoot, Glenties, Downings, Kerrykeel and Lifford.  There is, naturally, concern as to when this work is going to happen.  The Minister of State referred to the meeting we had with the residents and business groups from Ballybofey.  That area is not on the priority list but funding has been granted.  Is there any update on the advancement of that project?  Anything the Minister of State can tell us will help alleviate the concerns of people in those communities.  I refer to these projects being on track and the Department taking a hands-on approach.   </p></speech>

Some councillors from his party have sent on material in recent days.  I have also been talking to people up there.  As the Deputy stated, I went to Burnfoot and Castlefinn, and all of those other affected areas, and announced the schemes.  I have also given the relevant local authorities the resources to employ engineers to move these schemes forward.   The councillors in those areas need to keep on top of the local authorities to ensure those schemes are being driven forward.  It is up to them to raise these issues in meetings.</p> <p>  In recent days, I have asked the OPW to talk to the relevant county councils.  I also intend to visit those areas again.  Where schemes have been announced, I want to see them started.  All of us in the House have people contacting us on issues daily, but I want to go to Donegal to make sure those schemes are being driven on.  Money and resources have been allocated and I am keen to ensure those projects are delivered.   </p></speech>

We have been in meetings with the Minister of State and council officials, but bringing the OPW and the council officials together is the best approach.  A visit to Donegal by the Minister of State, with his officials, would be helpful to ensure any unforeseen problems are identified and overcome before they cause delays to the project.  I also want to ask the Minister of State about information he supplied to the committee on Garda stations.  Many have been closed.  I am opposed to the closing of rural Garda stations, but I am not going into that policy now.  I am concerned with the closed Garda station buildings and the use of those premises from the OPW's perspective.  In respect of many of the buildings, I think it is 53, it has been stated that future use is on hold, pending the outcome of a Government review of closed Garda stations.  Will the Minister of State update the committee on whether that review is complete?  What is the current status?</p></speech>

I emphasise that I announced six major schemes during that visit.  The associated costs are &euro;6 million in Lifford, &euro;1.5 million in Burnfoot, &euro;1.75 million in Castlefinn, &euro;900,000 in Downings, &euro;600,000 in Glenties, and &euro;30,000 in Kerrykeel.  A sum of &euro;2 million was also allocated to minor flood relief works, with &euro;175,000 for a scheme in Ballybofey-Stranorlar.  I am very much in agreement, therefore, with what is happening in Donegal and the surrounding areas.  I am with the community.  As I have said, I will visit soon to drive on those schemes.</p> <p>  Regarding the question on the review of closed Garda stations, I have examined the situation since I came into office and since we last appeared before this committee.  I have been answering frequent parliamentary questions on the matter.  I want to do something with these premises because many closed stations are lying idle.  I met with the Garda Commissioner recently.  I put forward proposals regarding some stations that could be given back to the local community through the local authorities.  That could be for a community hall, a boxing club or whatever it might be.  I want to deliver on that for communities all around the country.  We will offer some closed Garda stations to the housing authorities, to the local authorities and to the Land Development Agency.  If they do not want them, those premises will be sold.  I am confident that a number of the remaining closed stations will reopen in the near future.  </p> <p>  The Chair asked at the last meeting for a list of all vacant properties.  As can be seen from that list, most of those properties are closed Garda stations and we need to do something with them.  There is no point having those buildings empty and unused.  They are costing taxpayers money each year to secure them, make them more presentable and ensure they do not fall into disrepair.  Some of the closed stations have already gone to wrack and ruin and it has been suggested they could be used for parking.  I support that.  I have sent a list to the Garda Commissioner and I also have to meet with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan. We will then move to the next stage of the process. </p></speech>

If the review has determined, however, that some stations will not reopen and will be sold - we have seen sales take place in the past - I welcome the Minister of State's comment concerning transferring ownership to the local authorities for community use.  That would be very beneficial.  Regarding No. 15 on the list, the building in Cloghan, Donegal Mountain Rescue, a local community organisation, has expressed interest in using that as a base.  It provides lifesaving services to people in Donegal and neighbouring counties, in conjunction with mountain rescues groups in those areas.  Donegal Mountain Rescue does not have a base and that raises health and safety questions because its equipment has to be checked.  It is very difficult for the organisation to do that at the moment.  If a decision has been taken to not reopen Cloghan Garda station, consideration should be given to its use by Donegal Mountain Rescue, given the buildings central location in the area where the group operates.  During the Minister of State's visit to Donegal, I suggest he accompany us on a visit to Donegal Mountain Rescue, look at the premises in Cloghan and consider the potential future use for it.  </p></speech>

I also have to discuss this with the Minister for Justice and Equality, however.  A letter is on the way to the Garda Commissioner as well.  Pending that, I will visit with Donegal Mountain Rescue when I am in Donegal.  I know the excellent work done by such organisations all around the country.  I have dealt with similar groups and helped them.</p></speech>

I have one last point.  Perhaps when he is in Donegal, the Minister of State and I can examine this matter further.  There has been significant progress on the announcement of the six major schemes to which the Minister of State has referred, as well as the work that needs to be advanced in Ballybofey.  He will also be conscious of other work taking place in respect of coastal erosion.  I ask the Minister of State to update us on the Magheroarty project and the seawall to protect against the threat of coastal erosion.  Again, the Minister of State accompanied me and some other Members of the Oireachtas to view that situation last year.  Perhaps he could furnish us with a note and update us when we are in Donegal.</p></speech>

I outlined some months ago that in 15 years coastal erosion flooding could be more damaging than ordinary lake or river flooding, such as occurs with the Shannon.  I have seen the major problems that exist and everyone turns to me when there is a flood.  That area, however, is within the remit of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and his Department.  I am seeking to meet with the Minister and his officials because I foresee problems arising around the coast.  We dealt with one such issue recently in Dublin.  It seems to have been a successful operation and has protected a number of homes.  I would like to see that approach extended around the country and I will speak to Deputy Pearse Doherty about that during my visit to Donegal.</p></speech>

The review had been ongoing for quite some time and in order to speed it up and see an end use for some of the Garda stations, I took it upon myself to meet the Garda Commissioner to express what I wanted to see happen.  I believe giving some Garda stations to local authorities for community use would be welcomed.  I am of the same view as the other Deputy in that I would love to see all Garda stations open, but, realistically, that is not going to happen and there is no point in sending that message.  Some of them could be put to community use or used to provide local housing, as was done in the past.  We will continue to work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister in charge in that regard.</p></speech>

I want to ask about the meteorological station in Kilkenny.  The comment is that it was an intra-State transfer.

Did the county council express an interest in it or was agreement reached in some other way?  Mr. Long can answer that question if he wants to do so.</p></speech>

In the eyes of the Chairman and the general public, it was taking a long time to deliver the scheme.  The local authority came back looking for help and resources for it.  We gave them two engineers who will look at the design and what is in play and inform local councillors.  It will be put on public display.  My Department will be working closely with the local authority on the scheme.</p></speech>

Engineers working with the local authority will design the scheme.  I cannot tell the Chairman if it will happen this year or next year, but I will come back to him about it.</p></speech>

I want to ask about vacant properties and rents.  Are there many vacant properties?  I know that the OPW manages them for some Departments, but are they often left with properties such as office accommodation?</p></speech>

We examine other vacant properties to see if they could be used for civil servants.  We may offer other vacant properties to local authorities for use as housing, or to the Land Development Agency.  We have 2,500 properties all over the country, of which a total of 96 are vacant, of which 53 are Garda stations.</p></speech>

The Kilkenny flood relief scheme was one of the biggest in the country.  In spite of the size of the scheme and the fact that the area has not flooded since, residents of John's Quay in Kilkenny city still find it difficult to get insurance cover.  I raised the specific question of insurance companies taking information from the report on the website.  I am asking that in meetings with the insurance companies, or Insurance Ireland, the Minister of State highlight the fact that insurers are treating some residents unfairly.  The example I gave the Minister of State the last time he was before the committee was of an area which had never flooded, yet the residents cannot get insurance cover or sell their properties.  When there was flooding at John's Quay, millions of euro was spent on the flood relief scheme, but some of the residents are still having difficulties in getting insurance cover.  If the Minister of State has ongoing meetings with the insurance companies, or their representatives, will he, please, bring pressure to bear on them where insurers are being unfair and unreasonable?</p></speech>

I point out to the Chairman that I have dealt with many insurance companies after schemes have been put in place and the companies are stepping up to the mark and working with people.  There are, however, isolated cases.  If the Chairman brings an individual case to my attention, I will work with the insurance companies to find a solution.</p> <p>  I also point out that all maps are regional; there are no individual, house by house, maps.  There is no advantage to any insurance company in using them.  At the risk of being parochial, in my town of Athlone the house in which I was born and reared is 33 feet above road level on a hill and my father could not get insurance cover because it was deemed to be in a flood risk area.  We had to fight with the insurance company, but we eventually managed to get insurance cover.  I agree with the Chairman that in some cases insurance companies are being unfair, but they are working with people.  If the Chairman knows of an individual isolated case, I will gladly take up the matter for him at the next meeting.</p></speech>

I raised some issues in that regard.  I do not expect the Minister of State to know the answer now, but I will send him further information.  I would like the correspondence to be dealt with as efficiently as possible.  Further questions have been raised with me about the quality of the blocks used and what is going on in the procurement process and thereafter in terms of maintenance and repair.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the matter.</p></speech>
