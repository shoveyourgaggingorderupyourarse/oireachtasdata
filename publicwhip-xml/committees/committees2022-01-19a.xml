I am the deputy head of unit for the governance of agrifood markets in DG AGRI.  We are dealing with the agriculture and farmer side on these issues.  We will try to contribute to the members' questioning on these issues.  After my opening statement, I will be happy to answer questions.</p> <p>  The issues of fertiliser prices and fertiliser availability are of serious concern to the European Commission.  The Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Wojciechowski, repeated several times, including at the last sessions of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, most recently last Monday, that the issue arises because of the potential impact on farmers and the agrifood supply chain.  The cost and supply of chemical fertilisers are directly impacted by the situation of energy markets.  The production of chemical fertilisers is an energy-intensive activity.  There is a significant correlation between the circumstances of energy markets and the circumstances pertaining to fertilisers.  Many citizens and sectors of our economy, not only in agriculture, have been feeling the impacts of rising energy prices in recent months.  Agricultural markets are not escaping.  The recovery of the EU, US, Chinese and other economies, which is good news after the pandemic and the difficult times we have gone through, means higher demand for energy and other inputs.</p> <p>  Some of the energy markets have seen price increases that remain reasonable.  The oil price is back to $80 or $85 per barrel on the world market, a level seen before the pandemic.  If it was not at that level, it was close to it.  The prices of other commodities in the energy market, such as gas, have suffered a much more spectacular increase.  Since last year, there has been a fourfold increase, and a sixfold increase at certain moments.  We have seen a linked increase in the electricity price.</p> <p>  Energy markets in general are of concern in the EU economy as a whole and were on the agenda of Heads of States at the two last European Council meetings, in October and December.  Therefore, it has been discussed more widely.</p> <p>  On fertiliser, nitrogen fertiliser prices in particular are strongly influenced by natural gas prices because one of the main feedstocks in the production of nitrogen fertiliser is natural gas.  In this regard, it is used as a source of both energy and carbon.  Nitrogen fertiliser prices have increased significantly over the past year.  According to World Bank statistics, the world price of urea increased by 263% between December 2020 and December 2021, and that of diammonium phosphate increased by 92%.  Phosphate and potash fertiliser prices are also under pressure - but less so than nitrogen fertiliser prices since they depend less on natural gas - because they also involve an energy-intensive production process.  They also have seen increased demand.  Pressure has been exerted by some supply-chain disruptions linked to Covid and geopolitical tensions.  Overall, the World Bank&rsquo;s fertiliser index for December 2021 shows a 165% increase over December 2020.  This means the price is two and a half times higher than one year previously.</p> <p>  Regarding how fertiliser prices affect farm accounts, we have the data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network, which gives accountancy information for 80,000 farms in Europe.  We can see that the cost of fertiliser represents a reasonably modest share of the cost of production of EU farms, amounting to an average of 6% to 7%.  The average is hiding different situations.  For example, specialist cereal growers use much more fertiliser, on average.  For field-crop specialist farms - that is the name of the category of the Farm Accountancy Data Network - the share of the cost of fertiliser in the overall cost of production reaches 13%.  The data for Ireland show that the share of fertiliser in the cost of production incurred by Irish farmers, at 9%, is higher than the EU average, which is 6% to 7%.  It is 18% for field-crop specialist farms in Ireland by comparison with 13% in the rest of the EU.  Even with dairy, beef and sheep specialist farms - grazing livestock farms - there is a differential.  The cost of fertiliser is 9% of the cost of production on these farms, while the EU average is only 3.5%.</p> <p>  In a market economy, price signals, for both inputs and outputs, comprise information necessary to allow farmers to make better production and investment decisions.  They adjust decisions based on the price relationship.  However, when the volatility is sudden and strong, it is more difficult to adjust and there is different timing for the decisions.</p><p>The volatility is sudden and strong.  It is more difficult to adjust and there is different timing for the decisions.  The Common Agricultural Policy in general addresses these difficulties by supporting EU farmers through direct payments, which have a strong income stabilisation impact when compared with other regions of the world that do not benefit from this kind of support.  A variety of risk management tools, insurance, income stabilisation tools and mutual funds are available in the rural development programmes.  Farmers also can protect themselves against the volatility of both input price and output price through hedging tools, for example forward contracts.  They can do that directly and very often they do so through producer organisations or co-operatives, which organise these hedging tools.  It is a protection against the volatility in markets and provides some stability.  We should encourage EU farmers to use these tools to smooth this volatility.<br/><br/>Farmers are not bound to fully bear the full volatility of prices themselves.  Sooner or later - the same is true for reduced income - extra costs will be passed through the food supply chain to consumers, through price transmission mechanisms.  The European Commission pays particular attention to having a well-functioning food supply chain to ensure this transmission is happening.  All the burden lies on one stage in the food supply chain, very often the farm stage, being characterised by more atomisation of the producer and less concentration on other stages of the chain.<br/><br/>We did a lot.  We paid particular attention and did not spare our efforts to improve the functioning of the food chain.  I will give some examples.  Many elements related to the option for farmers to co-operate by derogation from traditional competition rules.  For example, rules on contractualisation were improved.  We adopted the directive on unfair trading practices to prevent stronger actors in the chain from abusing their dominant position.  We also favour market transparency in order that everybody has the same level of information and can make their decisions based on the same amount of information.  All these elements aim to reinforce the position of farmers in a food supply chain where other stages, in particular retail and processing, are often more concentrated.<br/><br/>Clearly, the recent sharp increase in price of fertilisers, as shown by the figures I quoted earlier and which the Chairman also mentioned in his opening statement, go beyond what are considered normal fluctuations.  For the moment, very strong increases in fertiliser prices have been offset by the very good level of agricultural prices.  We have several indices for agricultural prices.  The main indices show that agricultural prices have increased by 10% last year and by close to 30% in the last two years.  That needs to be put in the context of the increase in energy and fertiliser prices, and other costs.  Farmers can still absorb at least part of this cost.<br/><br/>As the Chairman mentioned in his preliminary words, there have been also some concerns over the supply of fertilisers for the next applications from next spring.  The expectation so far is that sufficient fertiliser supplies will be available for the forthcoming spring operations and that there will also be a sufficient incentive for our farmers to maintain production levels.<br/><br/>The economic optimum for the application rate for fertilisers is a function of the relative prices of the fertilisers and the output price expected from the crops or other agricultural products that are being produced, because Ireland has a grass-based system for which the animal product prices are also important.<br/><br/>As we saw, both these indices have increased in the last year but fertiliser prices increased more than the price of crops.  According to all the estimates we have seen, we expect that the economic optimum for farmers would be to apply slightly less fertiliser than usual in the coming year, with a possible modest yield impact.  In parallel, advisory services are here to help farmers to optimise their application rate of fertiliser in view of this evolution of prices.  Farmers may also decide to adjust their rotations and choose crops with less need for chemical fertilisers.  Given these elements, we do not expect this situation to represent a risk to the overall EU food supply and food security this year.<br/><br/>We will need to remain vigilant on this and follow economic projections from for example, the European Central Bank.  It remains of the view that the factors that have led to supply chain bottlenecks should ease this year and that we will return to more moderate price trends.<br/><br/>The Commission keeps a close eye on the markets and stands ready to intervene in case it is necessary to do so.  As an example of what has already been done, President Von der Leyen discussed the current situation of energy markets with the Heads of Government at the European Council.  The Commission presented a toolbox of measures to mitigate the current spike in energy and fertiliser prices at the end of last year.<br/><br/>The reformed CAP will continue to support our farmers through direct payments, risk management tools and rural development.  If necessary, as was in the case in the past when the market was disturbed, exceptional measures can be triggered.  These were instrumental to the success of our agrifood sector during the Covid pandemic, ensuring that a food crisis was not added to the health crisis during such difficult times.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the EU state aid rules regime provides that member states may support farmers in this exceptional situation.  EU member states may quickly act by granting what we call <i>de minimis</i>aid.  Among others, the state aid temporary framework, adopted during the Covid pandemic, may provide options to the member states.  It has just been extended until the end of June 2022.  The overall state aid amount per undertaking active in the primary production of agricultural products has recently been increased by &euro;65,000, that is, from &euro;225,000 up to &euro;290,000.  Where it can be shown that the market is already under pressure due to the Covid situation, this should allow member states to address this difficult situation for our farmers in the short term.  Some member states have already used this opportunity.<br/><br/>It is important to take a longer-term perspective of this situation.  This episode demonstrates how the EU agrifood sector is especially vulnerable due to its heavy dependence on fertilisers, and therefore on fossil fuels.  We must tackle this vulnerability by reducing our dependence on key imports, especially from unstable sources or unreliable third countries.  In the context of the EU industry strategy in general, the Commission continues to work with member states on strengthening what we call our open strategic autonomy by reducing our dependence on certain imports, as well as identifying such imports.  Regarding fertiliser, phosphate rock has been listed in the EU's list of critical raw materials since last year.<br/><br/>Specifically concerning food security, in addition to this general reflection on how to ensure our open strategic autonomy, we established a new European food security crisis mechanism expert group in December.</p><p>In the context of that expert group and the mechanism, the Commission will map vulnerabilities and dependencies specifically linked to the food chain and will discuss them and ways to mitigate them with the member states and all stakeholders of the food supply chain in order to be better prepared for any event that would put food security at risk.  The first meeting of this expert group, which is scheduled in the coming weeks, will look at the issue of high input costs, including fertilisers.  This has already been announced by the Commission to the member states.</p><p> This issue is not only a question of input prices and food security.  It is also important for our overall wider Green Deal objectives, where we are committed, in fact, to reducing nutrient losses.  By 2030, we have the target to reduce by 20% the use of fertilisers for the purpose of the Green Deal.  In fact, we have with this episode a bigger incentive to use less gas and mineral-based fertilisers and to use them more efficiently.  We must, therefore, act decisively under the new CAP to accelerate this transition to a more sustainable agriculture including for fertilisation practices.  I will list some examples of actions: greater use of precision farming for better optimisation; the use of more bio-based nutrients and organic fertilisers; the use of more adaptive crop rotation practices that are less dependent on mineral fertilisation, for example, with a higher share of pulses and nitrogen fixing plants; and as I said earlier, we must encourage farmers to use more risk management tools that are available on the market and through the CAP supports.</p><p> I would conclude that the current situation provides an excellent reason to use the opportunities of the reformed CAP, at a time when member states are presenting their CAP strategic plans, to improve the sustainability of food production through reduced use and greater efficiency in relation to fertilisers.</p></speech>

I will raise one issue with him.  He talked about producers having forward contracts.  These contracts are being promoted very strongly here by dairy processors.  It is actually a very serious situation for dairy farmers now, some of whom have three-year contracts.  The price of the product they are selling has gone up by 25% to 30%.  They are losing roughly 10 cent per litre on the price of those contracts and they now have the full impact of this very significant increase in the cost of production.  They have the worst of both worlds being in fixed-price or three-year contracts because they have the price as it was in 2021, which is fixed for three years going forward.  They are now operating on a higher level of cost of production.</p> <p>  I sit on a board of a co-operative.  We discussed this matter the other night.  There are serious questions about these farmers' viability.  Their price is fixed at approximately 30 cent per litre.  These contracts were set at 30 or 31 cent per litre.  The milk price now is approximately 40 cent per litre.  They are, therefore, losing very significantly on the  price.  As we said, the cost of production has increased very substantially.  These farmers find themselves in a very unenviable position where they have a fixed price with costs having escalated beyond anyone's expectation.  Mr. Santini can comment on that later.</p> <p>  I will open the floor up to members now for questions.  Senator Lombard was the first speaker to indicate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022011900002#C00300"><p>I welcome the representatives from the Commission, who are here this evening to discuss this really serious issue of fertiliser prices and how we will deal with that going forward.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the tariffs pertaining to fertiliser.  In his comprehensive statement, I do not believe Mr. Santini mentioned the dumping tariffs that are in place at the moment in the European Union.  Could he go over the amounts that these tariffs will involve and what plans the European Commission has for dealing with them going forward?  Dumping tariffs are part of our policy with the European Commission over the years.  It is unusual, to say the least, that we would have a scenario whereby we have a tariff on a product coming into the European Union that has significantly increased in price.</p> <p>  To give Mr. Santini an idea of how prices have increased in Ireland, today I quoted urea fertiliser at &euro;905 per tonne.  I quoted the same product this day last year for &euro;314 per tonne.  I quoted calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, today for &euro;700 per tonne.  I got it for &euro;205 last year.  That is a dramatic increase.  If we were to take an average dairy farmer in Ireland with 79 cows, we would be talking about an increase of nearly &euro;25,000 alone in the incoming product of fertiliser for the year.  It is very hard to see how we are going to have price inflation to cover that.  It is, therefore, a really significant issue.  Mr. Santini might go over what he believes can be done and how the tariff issue can be looked at going forward.</p> <p>  Supply of product coming into the European Union or Ireland is probably one of the key issues here.  What work has the Commission done to ensure that there will be a suitable product supply coming into the European Union and Ireland?  Let us take into consideration the fact that two thirds of all fertiliser will be spread between now and 1 June.  Either it is sorted now or it will not be sorted.  That is our growing period and that is a really significant time lag when it comes to Ireland.</p> <p>  Mr. Santini referred to work pushing forward for food security and where that will go.  What work has been done in respect of fodder security going forward?  I refer to feed for the animals.  We can have a reduction in spreading of compound fertilisers of anything up to 20% in Ireland and probably the same across Europe.  What work has been done to make sure we have enough fodder in the European Union and Ireland?  We are very much aware that in 2018, we had an issue regarding fodder.  We had to import it from France.  I am very concerned about what forward thinking the Commission has done to ensure we will not have the same scenario.  Any cutback in product will result in a cutback in the amount of fodder available and the knock-on effect could have a real issue regarding our national herd.</p> <p>  Mr. Santini touched on the issue of finance and the availability of certain funds.  The biggest issue for farmers is the ability to get finance to buy fertiliser over the next six-week period.  In terms of banking institutions, co-operative societies and the State, what ability does the farmer on the ground now have to access finance to ensure he or she gets the product?  Without that, he or she is then stuck in this scenario that he or she cannot get the grass growth that is required.</p> <p>  The Chairman rightly mentioned the issue of fixed milk prices.  Mr. Santini mentioned that issue but the real issue here is that the farming community did not have the ability to forward buy fertiliser for three years.  They were given a 60-day or 80-day period of quotation while they were selling their milk for a three-year period.  There is a body of work the Commission needs to do about that.  If farmers should have the ability to move their risk by selling milk on for a three-year period, surely the opposite should be applicable regarding buying in the concentrates required for the product itself over a three-year period.  This engagement with the Commission is really important because when we talk to our agricultural community, this is the single biggest issue at the moment.  We have a price increase that will not cover this.  We need a banking institution that will need to step in to cover the financial concerns.  The time bomb is ticking, however.  From now until 1 June, two thirds of all our fertiliser will be spread.  The real issue here is what research is being done regarding supply and if we do not have that supply, what research is being done regarding the fodder issue?</p><p>Where are we going with the tariffs?  What is being done at European Union level on the tariffs?  Where are we going to go to finance this product?  If we cannot finance it, we cannot have a sustainable industry going forward. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fabien Santini" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022011900002#D00200"><p>I will start with the forward contracts, because both the Chairman and the Senator have raised this.  I referred to these forward contracts in my opening statement as a possibility to hedge the risk of the volatility of the price of fertilisers.  Of course, if one is only hedging for the output of the milk price but not for the costs, one might end up in a very difficult situation.  I understand that I cannot intervene in that particular case.  I do not know if there is a possibility in Ireland to go beyond the 60 days or 80 days mentioned by the Senator.  There are possibilities to hedge, and maybe not just for one contract.  It could also be around access to future markets.  Tools such as this at least allow for protection against the volatility of the price of fertiliser, as it would allow for protection against the volatility of the price of milk.  In the particular case that was referred to, the forward contracts for the selling of milk is not protecting the farmers.  It is protection for a possibility in the decrease of the price but, unfortunately, as has been said, the prices have increased in milk.  In Ireland in particular there has been a very steep increase in the spot markets in milk recently.<br/><br/>We are really insisting on the risk management strategy by the farmers.  There are tools available to the member states, there are tools available for the farmers, and there are tools available for the producer organisations and co-operatives.  Of course, what needs to be elaborated is the strategy of managing risk that is prudent but which does not put the farmers in a trap of losses, as seems to be the situation with the case just referred to.  I do not know all of the details of the particular co-operative mentioned.  I would be interested to understand how this can be.  It is not satisfactory, and this is not reflective of a well-functioning food supply chain.  As I have said, we are insisting that when adding a well-functioning food supply chain where the volatility of both input prices and output prices are smoothened, farmers are not excluded from any profitability.  On the contrary, it is slow continuity, a good flow, and good working of farming activity.<br/><br/>With regard to the tariffs, the EU has relatively high self-sufficiency rates of fertilisers.  The main problem is the cost of the raw material of the gas that is imported - it is not the fertiliser.  Depending on the year, 70% to 90% of nitrogen fertilisers are produced in the EU.  While it is not overwhelming, we have relatively satisfactory self-sufficiency rates of fertiliser production.  In the EU we have provisions on anti-dumping, which are derived from World Trade Organization roots.  Dumping is something we need to fight.  As DG AGRI officials, we are asked to take anti-dumping measures to avoid precisely unfair competition from third country providers.  This is a very lengthy process where one must demonstrate that damage is due to a dumping practice in another country.  In the case of nitrogen fertilisers, in 2019 the investigation reached a conclusion that for certain nitrogen fertilisers coming from certain origins - the US, Trinidad and Tobago, and Russia - there are anti-dumping practices that deserve to be compensated by an anti-dumping duty.  If my memory is correct, they are expressed in euro per tonne and not as a percentage.  It is between &euro;30 and &euro;40 per tonne depending on the case.  When prices increase, the duty relevance decreases because they are expressed as euro per tonne and not percentages.  They are not <i>ad valorem</i>.  The initial request was for <i>ad valorem</i>but the Commission considered that to protect the farmers in precisely these kinds of situations it was important not to have an <i>ad valorem</i>issue.<br/><br/>These measures protect against anti-dumping practices, whatever the price calculation.  If one can demonstrate that there is damage through anti-dumping practices, normally they stay.  There is a provision in the regulation dealing with anti-dumping duties that where one can demonstrate that this damage is not demonstrable anymore because of the evolution of the situation of the markets, one can ask for a suspension of these anti-dumping duties.  That is the case currently.  There are several organisations that consider that the situation is such that these anti-dumping practices are not deserving of an anti-dumping duty in place any longer, and that they should be suspended given the situation.  To my knowledge, several requests have been presented by Copa-Cogeca, which is the overall professional organisation of farmers at EU level, and some professional organisations of cereal growers on the Continent.  Right now they are being assessed as to their severity to see if there is a sufficient level to demonstrate that the damage still is or is not material.  This is not a procedure that one can run through very quickly because it is very thorough and evidence-based.  One needs the evidence and the figures, and the floor must be given to all of the parties at stake.  This means farmers and also the fertiliser producers.  This is currently in process and the Commission is doing its work and assessing.  While the requests are being examined currently, there is no conclusion yet as to the context.<br/><br/>The committee also asked about the supply of fertilisers.  Like us, the members have probably read press clips about production facilities of nitrogen fertilisers closing down for various reasons in September, October or November.  Our latest appreciation is that most of the plants have relaunched their works and, if I understand it well, they have taken the opportunity to do their normal annual updates.  They are back in process.  There is no real concern around production capacity at present.  That the prices of fertilisers have increased is bad news for farmers but it is good news for producers in that they are incentivised to put the product on the market.  The availability of fertiliser does not seem to be a real concern.  Precisely for the reasons mentioned by Senator Lombard, which I also mentioned in my opening statement, there is evidence that because the prices have increased the use will decrease.  The Senator mentioned 20%.  We estimate a decrease of between 10% and 15% in total quantity.  This depends on the crops and crop mix of each member state, so it is very difficult to have a clear assessment.  It is logical because the economic optimum of a farmer if the fertiliser prices are higher, and even if the crop is more expensive, is to use a bit less.  There are very nice curves prepared by an advisory service and by fertiliser companies, and I am aware that Teagasc in Ireland is also excellently talented in delivering the correct advice to farmers in Ireland.  These curves show where is the optimum, given the prices.  They all show that with such an increase in fertiliser price there will be a decrease in their use.  Given that the price of agricultural goods is also good, not to the cost of a very big decrease of production, that is the estimate.</p><p>Of course, things can change but that is what we have for the moment.  That is a reason to go to the next point - fodder security.</p><p> Fodder security is part of food security.  With fodder and feed in general, you have some possibility to compensate a bit less fodder by more concentrated, and the contrary, for the grazing livestock.  Fodder security in general and feed security in general is part of food security in our understanding.  We take this as a clear view.</p><p> I remember well the time the Senator mentioned, in 2018-19, when Mr. Hogan was Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development.  The then commissioner was very concerned that we would have animals not being served with the right quantity of fodder.  At the time, it was for different reasons.  It was for the reasons of drought.  At the time, we took the exceptional measures when the issues were at stake.  I remember, for example, that we accepted that any ecological focused area at that moment could be grazed because of the lack of normal fodder because of drought.</p><p> At this stage, we do not know what will be the fodder production, which does not depend only on fertiliser.  It also depends on precipitation, which for the moment is quite good.  We cannot complain, or not farmers at least.  Maybe tourists can complain, but not farmers.  I come from the south of France and I have never seen so much water, so much green grass.  It is cool.  It is not completely down.  We have, for the moment, all elements.  We are in mid-January.  How can we know yet what will be the fodder situation when it will be at stake in April-May when it will start to be an issue?  We will monitor it.</p><p> We are monitoring every month.  We have a specialist from the joint research centre in Italy in the Commission that is publishing online an evolution of the stages of pastures.  By the way, that was a very useful tool for us to decide on exceptional measures in 2018-19 so that we would have some exceptional measures for the authorisation to use ecological focused areas to feed the animals that needed fodder.  I think I have answered most of Senator Lombard's questions.  If I did not, the Senator should not hesitate to repeat them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022011900002#E00200"><p>I will make a few comments at the outset.  Family farmers - it is a family-farm model that operates predominately in Ireland - operate on an extremely tight margin basis and increases in input prices can put considerable pressure on family farms.  However, the sharp hikes that we have seen in fertiliser prices have gone beyond anything that can be managed at an on-farm level.  Urea fertiliser prices have increased by 160% in the past 12 months.  Calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, prices have increased by 228%.  Supplies are limited and this is having a devastating impact on the grass-based model of farming for which Ireland is renowned.  Farmers are crying out for a response and what they are getting in response is nothing from the Government.  What we hear today is that they EU and the European Commission intend essentially to do nothing.  That is not good enough.</p> <p>  In fact, the EU is adding to the problem by imposing levies on imports of fertilisers from outside of the EU and on top of that, imposing anti-dumping duties of up to &euro;43 per tonne.  This is providing the European fertiliser industry with a protection that EU food producers do not have.  This fertiliser industry is making substantial profits.</p> <p>  Gas prices have been cited as a cause of the hikes but fertiliser price hikes have been greater than gas price rises and since gas prices have reduced, fertiliser prices have not followed suit.  Then we are told that this is a global phenomenon but the truth is that European farmers are paying 16% more at a minimum than their US counterparts.</p> <p>  This committee needs to urge the Government to intervene at an EU level for action.  There has to be urgency here.  We need action in a matter of days, not months.</p> <p>  Every member of this committee accepts, I think, and agrees with the objectives to reduce the levels of artificial fertiliser use and we have supported initiatives that will allow greater efficiency and greater protection in that regard.  The way to do that is not, as has been outlined here today, by essentially forcing farmers out of business through short-term volatile shocks but in partnership with those communities.  Therefore, we have to see a sea change and we have to see it incredibly quickly.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I might put a couple and if we can get short responses, I might come back in.</p> <p>  My first question is in relation to a Commission response to my colleague, Mr. Chris MacManus MEP, in December that the Commission would carry out a review to see how reducing tariffs on non-EU imports for a limited period would operate.  I wonder if our guests could give us the status of that review and when it is expected to be finished.</p> <p>  Perhaps we could also get clarification as to what has been done to date in order to bring about a reduction in the cost of fertiliser.  In other words, what specifics does the EU Commission propose that will see the cost of fertiliser coming onto farms in Ireland reduce, in particular, in the medium and short term?</p></speech>

Was it dealing with anti-dumping duties?  I am not sure I remember the question of the Deputy's colleague, Mr. MacManus MEP.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Santini know the status of that review, has it commenced and is there a timeframe for completion of it?</p></speech>

A review of this could work.  I explained to Senator Lombard that the exchange of information between the parties at stake is, I hope, finished, but I am not sure.  The last submission of data from the parties was last Friday.<br/><br/>I do not know what this answer to Mr. MacManus MEP refers to.  I am not aware of another exercise on this.  For the Deputy's information, we know that some member states have invoked the idea of suspending the duties themselves, not the anti-dumping duties, which are 6.5% <i>ad valorem</i>.  This is a commonly existing procedure.  You can ask a certain custom committee for a certain procedure - a not normal suspension of duties for a variety of reasons.</p></speech>

In relation to the exercise that Mr. Santini describes, my understanding is that it is the same exercise.  What timeframe for a response is anticipated?</p></speech>

My understanding is that it will be once we will have a completeness of the submission of data, which is not yet the case, according to what I know.  What has been submitted last Friday, five days ago, may become the reasons for it to become complete.  Then the formal investigation will comment.  I do not have the timing, but it is not a question of days.  It is a question of weeks to assess this.  This is very thorough.  We have important procedures to respect so that the voice of everybody is heard.</p><p>This investigation back in 2019 took a lot of time to be sure that there were grounds to decide on anti-dumping duties.  It is the same kind of caution, evidence and certainty that we need before suspending; the same elements.  Again, we are facing a duty of being credible versus any appeal that could be done to courts on this.  We are strictly following the procedure and it is not a matter of days, as the Deputy said, it is a question of going through all of the elements.  The regulation does not stipulate deadlines but, of course, the Commission is doing its best to do things as fast as possible.  If this was the question of the Deputy's colleague, Mr McManus MEP, on anti-dumping duties -----</p></speech>

I talked to colleagues in customs who are doing this.  At the moment, nobody has asked for a suspension of duties for fertilisers.  If it is to happen, there is an exercise every six months in which somebody can request it with the evidence that there is a need to suspend the duties autonomously for these products.  Again, it is something that is framed by some procedures and people need to demonstrate, again, by evidence that there is a case for this kind of suspension.  Again, this is not something that you decide for one month as an exception.</p> <p>  Fertilisers are not agricultural products.  For agricultural products, we, as the Commission, have a legal base to suspend duties in case of an emergency, but not for fertiliser.  Fertilisers are not in themselves agricultural products.  We could do this for milk, for example, but we have never done it.  Members can imagine what the reaction of the meat producers would be.  For this, we have a legal base.  The work of the Commission is framed by what the co-legislators, the Parliament and the Council, decide.  In the case of agricultural products, there is a legal base to suspend duties; not for fertilisers.  For fertilisers, it has to go through the general procedure of autonomous suspension of duties for any products.  That procedure is a bit lengthy.</p></speech>

We see the procedure for the tariffs and we see the procedure for the anti-dumping duties.  On the current basis, nothing has been done in either of those two areas.

By the way, the Deputy mentioned in his opening statement that the gas price has increased less than fertiliser.  That is not correct.  The gas price in Europe has increased more than the price of fertiliser so far.  That is just a correction.  Compared with the situation in the US, I can understand his mistake.  However, as the Deputy knows, but natural gas is a commodity that has very different prices.  It is not easy to transport.  A pipeline - a <i>gazoduc</i>; I do not know that in English - is needed to transport liquid gas.  We have a situation where the price of natural gas in the US is much lower.  It has increased also but it much lower than the price in Europe.  A differential that can explain that.</p></speech>

I wish to broaden out the issue a little bit if I can and to ask why we are so dependent on this fertiliser.  I represent the Green Party.  We have a particular view in that we would like to see a very significant increase in organic farming where these artificial inputs are not used.  We need to go down that road to a greater extent than we currently have.  Approximately 2% of our farms are organic and we are going to aim for about 7.5%.  Other countries are quite ahead of us.  We had a session in this committee in the past few months, and most members of this committee would agree that we probably can and should be going much further in organic.  The Austrians and Danes are doing quite well and  I see no reason why we cannot do as well as them.</p> <p>  The reality is that these artificial fertilisers are having a devastating effect locally on watercourses.  According to our own Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, approximately 43% or 44% of our rivers are in a condition of poor quality and there is a correlation with the use of artificial fertilisers.  </p> <p>  There is the climate impact as well.  There is the climate impact because there is the nitrous oxide, which is 200 or 300 times more potent as a gas than carbon dioxide.  When the fertiliser oxidises, this gas is produced and it is very harmful.  In addition, using these inputs allows us to grow more grass and have higher stocking rates in our farms.  That has a knock-on increase on the methane that we produce.  All in all, it seems to make sense to drive the organic angle as much as we can for environmental reasons, and to protect farmers as well from this significant volatility they are experiencing at the moment.  </p> <p>  Mr. Santini mentioned the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan.  This is very significant.  We should be using the CAP strategic plan to drive the organic farming agenda in Ireland.  Our Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is developing a fertiliser alternatives strategy.  We will try to go from 410,000 tonnes in 2018 down to less than 325,000 tonnes.  That is about a 33% decrease in artificial fertiliser within the decade.  </p> <p>  Can Mr. Santini comment on that point on organics?  It is a difficult thing to do.  Farmers cannot switch to organics overnight.  I accept that it is not easy.  However, it makes sense in the longer term.  Some farmers are going down that road and are managing to eliminate significant input costs.</p><p>They are producing as much food as they were beforehand but with reduced labour costs.  There will also be an expected improvement in the local environment.  Perhaps Mr. Santini could comment on our ambition in organics.  Is it something we should drive as much as we can?</p></speech>

Within the farm-to-fork and biodiversity strategy, the EU is following conduct to make our food systems more sustainable.  There are two aspirational targets that are relevant to the issues the Deputy has raised.  The first is in the organic sector.  We aim to reach to have 25% of the area of the EU covered by organic farming. Many member states are far from that level and I am sure Ireland is one.  It is not the only one because many countries still have progress to make.  There is a need to engage on this matter and use the CAP strategy plans.  There has been a controversy between the member states and the Commission as to whether the member states themselves should decide on its targets.  The overall goal for the EU is to reach an increase of organic farming in terms of area.  If there is such an increase, production will also increase, as will sales.  Organic farming has been very successful recently on the markets but we also need to boost demand further so the benefits we expect from the farming itself in biodiversity, climate change and many other elements are also picked up by the market.  If we are producing organic food when there is no demand, there is no point.  That is why the Commission last year adopted an organic farming action plan.  There are many elements to that, one of which is that we are trying to beef up the demand for organic products.  That is definitely a way forward.</p> <p>  There is another target of relevance in these documents, an important one which I mentioned in my opening statement, and that is the specific target for fertilisation.  As the Deputy mentioned, artificial fertilisation and organic farming can have similar problems and a detrimental impact on the environment, in particular on water quality and climate change.  As the Deputy said, nitrogen fertilisation is a source of greenhouse gas emissions within the agricultural sector.  We are committed to a net zero economy by 2050 so we had better prepare ourselves.  Carbon farming will offer a possibility to offset but the improvement of fertilisation practices, in terms of quantity, losses, recycling and using more organic fertiliser, is important.  That is why one of the aspirational targets in the farm-to-fork strategy, repeated in the soil strategy, is to reduce by 20% the use of chemical fertilisers by 2030 to reduce nutrient loss.  Nutrient loss is probably not Ireland's worst problem but it is a deep problem in other areas of the EU.  We have an EU model, and I am not talking about Ireland, whereby we are importing nitrogen, turning it into animal production, exporting it and keeping the nutrient loss in the EU.  That is a major issue.  I am French, as the committee understands, and we have a region that is culturally of a like mind to Ireland, namely, the Celtic region of Brittany.  There are terrible problems there with green algae because of nutrient loss.  These are the kinds of things that have led to the aspirational target of reducing by 20% the use of fertiliser.  That is something we will follow.  If we have overall targets, we will monitor the measures that each of the member states adopts in its CAP strategy plan.  We will discuss those measures with the member states and agree on a pathway to reducing these nutrient losses in every member state, depending, of course, on the urgency of the problem in the member state.</p> <p>  I will take another example.  We will have more discussions about increasing the levels of organic farming with Ireland than we will with Austria, which already has organic farming in 20% of its area.  France's level of organic farming is also quite low.  That is the good of this reformed CAP.  We are adapting.  We will allow member states to adapt their instruments to the real priorities and overall objectives.  One of the objectives is clearly to increase the level of ambition in our policies in terms of our climate and environment.</p></speech>

I will say to Mr. Santini that, as a frequent visitor to Brittany, I do not think agriculture is that adversely affected by the challenges.  I see a vibrant agriculture community there.  We are envious when we visit.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Mr. Santini.  I will go back to what Deputy Carthy raised about the issue of duties.  I was struck by the point Mr. Santini made.  Urea coming into Ireland could not be classified as an agricultural product, as we see it.  I appreciate its main component is nitrogen, which can be used in a multiplicity of other products, but with 46% nitrogen, there is not an awful lot more that can be done with urea when it comes.  Have efforts been made to have it classified as an agricultural product?  Strictly speaking, there is not much more to be done with a big bag of urea, other than spread it.  That is my first question.  I will come back in with my other questions, if that is okay.</p></speech>

There is an annex to the original treaty that explains what are agricultural products.  Apart from seeds, all the other inputs, including fertiliser, pesticides and barbed wire, are not agricultural products according to the treaty and, frankly speaking, we cannot change that.  A legal basis is provided by five or six articles in the treaty which state what the EU should aim at in terms of agriculture and fisheries.  What is meant by agricultural products is listed in an annex to the treaty and there is little we can do about that.  The Commission cannot change that.</p></speech>

Urea and nitrogen have taken over from ammonium nitrate as a fertiliser.  What is the difference?  Are both equally as guilty in terms of creating greenhouse gases or would ammonium nitrate be less of an offender?</p></speech>

I do not have the answer.  I know that, in general, nitrogen fertilisation has a big impact.  I do not think I am wrong when I say that one third of the direct greenhouse gas emissions of agriculture relates to fertilisation.  Half of that relates to animal products and half to crops.  Two thirds of the emissions relating to crops is due to the fertilisation.  I am not especially sure of the role of ammonium nitrate and urea in that regard.  I would not dare to give the Deputy a reply without doing a little investigation and estimation.</p></speech>

I have a final question, similar to one that Mr. Santini side-stepped earlier.  We will see how we get on this time.  There has been a significant consolidation in terms of the ownership of companies supplying urea products in agriculture.  There has been a major shift in the ownership of these companies in recent years.  Would Mr. Santini agree that urea and agricultural fertiliser has now obtained commodity status on a par with paper and oil and is being treated in that way by these companies to the detriment of farmers?</p></speech>

If you look at a dashboard of commodity prices in general, clearly, there are products that are viewed as commodities, meaning that they are traded widely and there are people who are building future markets on it.  There are financial operators that are taking the risk for them.  It is the same for oil, gas and the energy markets.  Fertilisers are treated the same.  There are similar instruments for metals and minerals.  Definitively, they can be treated as commodities.  It is not necessarily only due to the fact that the sector is concentrated.  I am not judging the fertiliser industry specifically, but the agriculture inputs in general are characterised by the same elements as the food processing industry and retail.  They are more concentrated than the farming sector.  In general, there are actors that have more power and there is an asymmetry of power in the chain in respect of the weaker link.  There are no small producers of fertiliser in Europe.  They do not exist.  There are some small retailers, but the big market is among the big retailers.  There is also some concentration in the food industry.  There is much less concentration in farming.  One of the indicators of concentration that we use to assess this economic structure is the concentration ratio.  For example, CR5 measures how much of the market share the five biggest companies represent.  Looking at retail, food industry or inputs, it is very often above 50% or even more in some cases for some markets.  Looking at what share of the market the five bigger farms represent,  in some eastern countries that have inherited the socialist structures, it is below 0.1% of the market share.  There is a real complete setting.  That precisely explains why, in the treaty and in the work of the Commission, there are many possibilities to derogate to traditional competition rules in the farming sectors to compensate for that.  That is why there is the possibility to establish co-operatives and producer organisations that agree on prices and quantities.  It is also why interbranch activities can be developed and the conclusion of agreements is permitted, to a certain extent, including with the rest of the chain that are derogating to competition rules.  This would not exist if it were not for the asymmetry between the concentration of the partners in the food supply chain and the farmers.</p></speech>

Much of what I wanted to ask has been asked already.  If it has, perhaps Mr. Santini can let me know.  I was in and out at other appointments.  I come from a constituency where there is quite a lot of agricultural activity.  Farmers have been feeling the pinch in recent times.  The very produce that dairy, suckler or other farmers need, namely, the manure to continue their practice, is now quadrupling - not doubling or tripling - in price.  This has upset them.  I would not like to say they are angered.  It has made them fearful of how they are going to survive.  Many of them feel that they are being squeezed by an existing Government that is against many of the farm practices that are there at present.  The farmers are under a severe amount of pressure.  Mr. Santini has said that the supply might be there later this year, and that it will be up to what it should be.  What good is that if the farmers cannot pay for the product?  That is what they are facing.  The farmers who have spoken to me are feeling the pinch and are worried about the bills they are going to face in their local co-operatives.</p> <p>  Mr. Santini talked about the suspension of all tariffs on nitrogen, which would reduce the price of nitrogen in the EU by several tens of euro per tonne.  By how much would that reduce the cost of nitrogen for the farmer in this country?  Is it going to happen and is it going to happen immediately?  If it is not going to happen, it will be catastrophic for many farmers here.  Those with a different agenda who would like to see a lot of farmers wiped out might have a smile on their faces.  This is a backdoor way of destroying the agricultural way of working that many farmers whom we know are working at the moment.  At the end of the day, if they cannot pay for their product, it is the same as anything.  If we are all buying something today for &euro;100 and it costs &euro;500 in the space of less than 12 months, something has gone wrong somewhere.  Surely to God, somewhere in the political system, whether in Europe or in this country, it needs to be rectified immediately, before farmers face the edge and many of them face being wiped out?</p> <p>  I would appreciate if Mr. Santini could shed some light on the future of Irish agriculture.  It is probably a European issue, but I am talking about the Irish farmers who are currently squeezed to the limit.  They find that every time they on the radio station or turn on the television, they hear and see anti-farming sentiments.  There is nobody willing to help those who are trying to pay a bill at the end of the month in the local co-operative.  If Mr. Santini goes on the airwaves today with no hope, how does he expect a politician like me to give hope to people who desperately need it at this time?  I would appreciate it if he would address the issue.  How can this issue be resolved, and resolved immediately?  Is it going to be resolved immediately?  Are the farmers going to be left in the nightmare situation in many cases?  I do not think many politicians realise what is happening in rural Ireland.  Farmers are losing their farms.  Co-operatives are taking over their farms because they cannot pay their bills.  That is what it comes down to.  They cannot pay the bills.  There is a desperate situation here, where the price of a product to the farmer, which was not cheap in the first place, has quadrupled.  It is putting a lot of them under pressure and many of them are facing a very bleak future.  I thank Mr. Santini for being here today.  I would appreciate it if he would enlighten us as to whether there is any light at the end of the tunnel.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.54" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fabien Santini" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022011900002#H00600"><p>I am not a politician, so I may give a bit of a technocratic answer.  I will try to adapt the message because the Deputy's question is important.  Even though we are an administrative service or an administration, our client is the EU farmer.  One of the five objectives of the CAP is to ensure a reasonable farm income level and livelihood in rural areas.  That is a clear objective.  There are others, which may be contradicting.  We also need to ensure food supply, affordable prices for consumers and increased productivity for the farming sector.  I do not remember the fifth one.  The equation is complex, but clearly, farm incomes and farm livelihoods are important.  It is the objective of the CAP to ensure a farm income level.</p> <p>  I said in my opening statement that we are in a situation where there are increases in one production cost of farmers, which is not the whole cost, but a significant one.  It is a very sharp increase.  The Deputy said that the cost has quadrupled.  Even if it is only doubled, that is a significant increase and something which is difficult to adapt to.  First, I would not say that we are not doing anything.  We have a policy which has been in place for 60 years, namely, the CAP, and for 20 years we have had a format which is similar to the current one, based on the big amounts of what we call decoupled direct payments that are there to provide a buffer for the viability of income from one year to another.</p><p> The viability of income can come from an increase in the cost of production.  In the past it came from other elements.  Members will remember the 2015 and 2016 crisis relating to milk prices.  That is also something that direct payments normally provide a buffer against.  I understand that it is not sufficient to rely on this element, but we should not forget that it is in place.  If we look at other similar economies such as the US, for example, with similar levels of revenue, the volatility and fluctuation of income for US farmers from one year to another - I am not talking about the big ones, I am talking about all US farmers, there are many small US farmers also - the volatility for these US farmers is far more acute than it is for EU farmers.  Still, there is some volatility for us to absorb and members are right to point this out.</p><p> Where is the light?  In this case, we are depending on energy markets.  The expectation of energy specialists - I am not an energy specialist but I read the projections - is that there should be a moderation of these price trends on the energy markets in the coming year, probably not to the point that we will return to the previous level, the level of two or three years ago, but they will not be at the level we have now.  There is a problem to go through this year.  That is why I mentioned these different elements.  We have these direct payments that are there to act as a buffer.  For 20 years, we have had this possibility.  It has probably not been taken up enough by farmers or by member states into their mix of policies.  They have looked to risk management insurance.  Under the income stabilisation tool, you can dedicate part of your rural development envelop to a mechanism that would compensate even more than direct payments do for fluctuations in income.  In fact, this instrument has only been implemented by three member states, despite all the incentives that the Commission gave to try to do it.</p><p> In the new CAP strategic plan, there should be a specific section describing what is the risk management strategy.  I have not read what has been written in Ireland, but I hope this is taken seriously by all the farmers who are contributing to this CAP strategic plan and by the Government, which is presenting this CAP strategic plan.</p><p> If this does not prove sufficient, there is always the possibility to try to trigger exceptional measures as we did at the beginning of Covid.  Members might remember that in the context of Ireland, when there was much uncertainty relating to Brexit for the beef market, we took a little measure.  This implied that there is a budget.  As members may know, the budgetary framework of the EU is constrained by the member states.  As a result, if we need to find money, the EU budget is not open-ended.  We also need to find a way to reduce the expenses somewhere else.  That is always a tricky debate.  There is a financial reserve - this has been agreed by the co-legislator - of &euro;450 million that can be mobilised for this kind of element but we have to collectively decide where the real need is for these elements.</p><p> As some members mentioned, there is a framework for state aid that allows each member state to target one or other of the particular elements.  This has been actively implemented by the member states in the Covid situation.  Many state aid mechanisms have been decided by the different member states.  We have a more relaxed approach from the Commission because of this particular situation.  We are still in this situation.  This temporary framework for state aid will be in place until June so we are covering the situation up to then.</p></speech>

Why is there such a lacuna there?  As a result of the price of fertiliser, is there a concern in Europe about both animal welfare and food shortages?</p> <p>  From what I understand, and I may need to be corrected, Mr. Santini stated that the customs authorities in Europe have not been contacted about the problem from the different bodies affected.  However, he also state that COPA and some cereal organisation were talking about it.  Are there two or three different sections involved?  Are Mr. Santini's section, the customs section and some other section involved?  Have they met?  Are they aware of the situation?  From what Mr. Santini stated, I understand under state aid rules countries would be allowed to subsidise the price of fertiliser in an emergency for one year, particularly as the price has gone up.  Am I correct in saying that?</p> <p>  If we look at Europe today, we can see that it has got rid of steel.  Mr. Santini talked about America.  American cereals are important.  The cereals imported into Europe to feed cattle or make bread come from Canada.  Does it suit Europe, with the new green agenda it is driving, that if there is a shortage of fertiliser, food production will obviously be down?  Is Europe going in a direction which means that we are becoming the salespeople of the world?  As stated, steel is gone.  Steel production is done in other countries or on other continents.  The position is the same with fertiliser.  In the context of gas, we are solely reliant on others to produce it.  Are we becoming like the birds in the nest, waiting for some other country to do something on our behalf?  If the price fluctuates in such circumstances, then we are in trouble.  Why have Europe and the Commission not progressed the idea of being self-sufficient in all of the situations to which I refer?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fabien Santini" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022011900002#J00600"><p>I thank Deputy Fitzmaurice.  In regard to the first question, I will repeat myself.  It is a convention.  In the context of what we call agricultural products, there is a fixed list under the treaty and we cannot expand it.  I agree with the Deputy that, on a commonsense basis, fertilisers are used in agriculture.  The treaty states that we can only do things according to what the CAP sets out.  Agricultural products are listed in an annex to the treaty, but fertiliser is not listed.  I cannot do anything about that, but I understand that it does not look like common sense but that is how it is.</p> <p>  The Deputy inquired about concerns in Europe regarding animal welfare.  I suppose he is referring to animals having sufficient fodder and feed for animals in that regard.  He also asked about concerns relating to food shortages.</p><p>As I said in my opening statement, given we only have estimates for the relative prices of fertiliser and agricultural outputs, we do not expect there to be major concern about food security, which includes feed security.  This assessment indicates we do not see a concern.</p><p> I will take the opportunity to go straight to the Deputy's last question.  If we do not have this kind of concern, it is because the EU is a very big net exporter of agrifood products.  We are producing much more than we are consuming.  We are exporting a lot of dairy products, meats and cereals.  We are more than self-sufficient in most of the commodities, with some exceptions we aware of and are looking at.  That is also a reason we are not fearful about EU food security.  This situation is much more delicate in countries or regions of the world that are not net exporters like we are.  In respect of food, we are not at all in the same situation as that for energy.  We depend on imports for energy but not for food.  The rest of the world depends on us for food.  That is why, even with a modest decrease in production because of less use of fertiliser, temporarily, this year, we do not expect any major concern, but we will be attentive to this.</p><p> The Deputy asked if state aid rules would explicitly authorise a subsidy for the use of fertiliser.  I did not say that.  I said there was a framework that authorises member states to take some actions, given the current situation.  I do not think I have seen any subsidy to fertilisation businesses in the schemes that have been adopted.  I would guess they are probably too operational to be eligible for these kinds of scheme.  I am not a specialist on this, but at least the people who are imagining state aid for a member state should reflect on what could be done.  There are many other ways to support farmers in this situation that would strictly subsidise mineral fertilisers directly for a certain time.  There are a lot of other ways that are less distorting and perhaps even more efficient than just offsetting the simple increase in price.</p><p> I will come back to the Deputy's last point.  I told him we are largely self-sufficient, but there are still some areas of the agrifood chain where we are not, namely, plant proteins that are mostly, though not only, used for feed, such as soya beans, of which we are large importers.  Looking at the other plant proteins used in the EU, we only produce 30% of what we consume so we have a strong dependency on these products.  There are some other elements on which we are dependent.  We have started to map our dependencies a little, and our abilities, in the agrifood supply chain.  We are also dependent on certain additives, especially those used in feed, such as vitamins and mineral seeds that are introduced in feed complements.  We depend on a very small number of sources for those.  We are also dependent on tropical products, but that is something it is difficult to compensate for.  We are rather self-sufficient regarding the rest.</p><p> Looking at fertiliser, I said we are dependent on phosphate rock, which we are not producing in Europe.  In respect of the rest, nitrogen fertilisers are largely produced in the EU from the base of imported natural gas, while potash is partly produced in local areas of the EU and partly imported, but from a very wide diversity of areas.  There is a possibility to diversify.  The real dependency is on energy markets.  That is clearly something that goes above the need to look at whether the markets for energies are working well.  That is part of the toolbox that has been adopted by the Commission, which includes checking we do not have any competition distortions in these markets, that the pricing is working well and there are sufficient buffer stocks, because we have regulation at EU level for buffer stocks in energy.</p><p> The last issue is the transition of these energy markets and fertiliser markets.  One of the long-term visions for the fertiliser industry, if we read the press, is to go to green ammonia.  This means the ammonia that is produced will not depend as much on fossil fuels we do not have.  We simply do not have fossil fuels in the EU.  The idea of getting rid of this dependency is also on the agenda.  It takes time and will not be something that will be solved for the next harvesting year for sure, but it is on the way.  It is part of the overall goal of the EU's trade, industry and agricultural policies to achieve what we call an open strategic autonomy.  This is not complete self-sufficiency by banning the trade, but having reasonable autonomy in this framework to restore our capacities and not depend on the kind of accidents we have now.</p></speech>

The Commission depends on the powers the treaty gave to it, or to the co-legislators, the Council and the Parliament, which decided to give further powers to the Commission.  In these kinds of matters we are discussing, I would not know what to include in my submission, dated last Friday, if I did not talk to my colleagues this afternoon to be sure I had the most recent information for the committee.  I would not know that nobody asked for suspension of duties in the Directorate General for Taxation and Customs, DG TAXUD, if I did not ask them, as I do every week, in fact, when checking something.  We are a single Commission but we have to respect procedures.  The procedures are given to us by the treaty, but the Commission decides according to the duties given to it as competencies.</p></speech>

I am thankful to Mr. Santini for hearing us, but I am worried he does not understand the seriousness of the situation faced by the farmers we are elected to this House to represent and nor does the European body.  Four or five years ago, farmers here were told to increase production of milk and milk-based products.  They were told that milk was the new white gold; that is a fact.</p></speech>

In one fell swoop, all these fellows put their shirt, everything else and every bob and copper they had into their farms, including new machinery, more cows and all the cost involved in dealing with manure and other waste.</p><p>They have spent much money on that end as well in order to be environmentally friendly.  They did their level best.</p><p> I am only delivering the message.  The farmers down the country whom I represent are saying this is suiting the green agenda.  As the Mr. Santini knows, we now have a Government that is driven by the green agenda.  When the Green Party says jump, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste ask how high.</p></speech>

I do not where the options are for that, all of a sudden, or how farmers can supplement.  As it stands, many of them will not have fertiliser of any kind because they cannot afford it.  Those who can may try to, for a short time.  The big question I have is how long this price increase is going to last.  The witness is here to tell us and I am here to take the message down the country to the people I am representing.  The increase is savage.  It is a double increase of 50% or more per product whether it is urea, pasture sward, nitrogen or whatever it is.  The milk men will try for a while to deal with this problem and try to carry on because, like I said, they have so much put into it but then what is going to happen the beef fellows with suckler cows who are down on the poor land?  They do not have much good ground and need to ensure they have fodder for the winter and that they have enough grass to drive on the cows.  We were told to feed them on grass and believed we were doing better than other countries that were feeding their animals inside, in system units, all year round.  I have seen them myself over in America.</p> <p>  In case anyone thinks this is just a farmer's problem, it is going to be a consumer problem.  How is that going to be dealt with?  We were told at the very start and all along that the farm-based payments farmers were getting were to make up for not being paid properly for their produce.  What is going to happen now given consumers will not be able to buy the food they were used to buying because the price of it is going to go up?  Do people think the farmers are going to get up every morning to milk cows and give up half their night when cows are calving only to have nothing left?  As was rightly stated by the Chairman, many of these are on fixed-price contracts.  Given the position we are in, we should be asking the Government to ensure none of these contracts can stand because this was totally unforeseen.  That is the other question.  The witness may be saying that we are over-producing but who is going to step into the breach?  Is it Brazil or Argentina?  I did not hear that there was any food or produce being dumped anywhere.  It was all being used.  Are we going to leave people hungry somewhere?  Is that going to happen?  I believe there are already over 700 million people going hungry.</p></speech>

How long does Mr. Santini think farmers can keep going?  They will not be able to produce as much if they cannot afford the fertilisers, namely, the nitrogen and the urea.  How long does he think these poor, honest, hardworking people can stay at it?  Does he think they are going to keep producing food?  The record over the years is farmers might have one good year out of five.  They break even for three and they lose out in perhaps two of the years as well.  However, the cost of keeping going now, with the fuel and everything, is too much.  Mr. Santini is talking to us on behalf of the European body.  How long is this going to last?  Is this happening worldwide?  Is it only happening in Europe?  Is it to blow us out of it altogether to suit the green agenda?  Is that the way production is going to be cut because we have been getting hints of this-----</p></speech>

Making projections is always difficult but we are trying.  The Commission is trying and so are our counterparts in major countries.  The United States Department of Agriculture, USDA, is trying to make estimates.  Everybody is trying to project and plan about what will come.  The difficulty is we are depending on another area, namely, the energy markets.  There is a really tight link between both of them so we must also make projections about the energy markets.  If one looks at the main estimates that are floating around private agencies and public agencies, they all consider the supply bottlenecks, the logistics difficulties due to Covid and the fact we are also paying the price of past events should result in more reasonable price trends this year.  It is difficult to say when but during this year.  If one looks at the curves one can find in some specialised editions, one can see the prices are going down.  The fertiliser prices are not going down to the level they were at before this event but at a lower and more reasonable one.  Of course, these are projections.  Given other events that are occurring - we are living in an uncertain world with more risks in general - one never knows what will happen.  However, overall, this is the expectation.</p> <p>  As I said, there are price transmission mechanisms in the food supply chain that when the costs increase, they are passed little by little to the next stage.  This is not necessarily reassuring but it is reassuring for the farmers that not everything is on their shoulders and that processors, retailers and consumers will have to take part of these costs on board.  This means there will be a tension due to the increase in food inflation for consumers.  Of course, we are talking of an element, if we take it globally, of 6% to 7% of the cost of production for agricultural products which themselves come to perhaps 10% to 20% of the final costs of food.  There are many others costs.  There is the transport, the processing, the electricity in the supermarket and plenty of logistical costs.  Thus, with the fertiliser costs specifically, we are not dealing with something that can create a doubling of the price of food but it has an impact and it will be passed on.  There are other impacts because the energy price is not only affecting fertiliser.  It is also affecting the electricity bill of supermarkets and the food industry.</p><p>This surge in energy price has a global impact on the economy and will result, and we have seen it in the press already, in some inflation including for food, hopefully with a limited time span, and that is the expectation.  This is worldwide.  It is not only in Europe that energy prices have increased and there is such an impact.  If we look at the headlines in the US about food inflation, the prices of food for all regions, not only for energy but also for much more bottlenecks in the US supply chain than in the EU as they were probably less prepared than our food sector.  More people were absent from the suppliers and companies and they had more disruption.  There are other reasons that explain food inflation in the US and that is a whole problem in the US.  Of course this means higher food prices have economic consequences for consumers especially for poorer ones.  Food poverty is at risk of increasing and that is a political problem for sure.  That is why it is something that is carefully looked at.  The impact of energy prices on food prices and on the rest of the economy is a real challenge for EU economies right now and we have to look at that.  Hopefully the people who are projecting that it will smoothen and relax in the coming year are right.  </p></speech>

They are very welcome to today's proceedings and on the behalf of the committee, I would like to particularly welcome back Mr. Tony Murphy who was with us last year.  He will be representing the European Court of Auditors, ECA, today.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege and address some housekeeping matters.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue the remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, on criticise and make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member who is partaking via MS Teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  Without further ado, I call Mr. Tony Murphy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am hoping that we are slowly but surely moving back to the usual situation whereby we could give this presentation physically in the committee room.  Hopefully that will happen near future.  Among the work that I would like to cover today is the annual report, which is the main product of the European Court of Auditors.  I am here today in my capacity as the Irish member, dean of chamber V, which relates to financing and administering the Union and the ECA member responsible for the annual report.</p> <p>  Before I outline the main findings of our annual report, I would first briefly like to set out some key information and figures relating to Ireland in the EU.  As members will be able to see on the slid on-screen, revenue for 2020 totalled at &euro;174.3 billion.  Ireland's contribution to this figure was &euro;2.6 billion.  Most of the contribution from Ireland is based on GNI.  In fact, &euro;1.9 billion of this contribution was GNI-related in 2020.  The rest, more or less, comes from customs contributions and VAT-based contributions.  Expenditure, on the other hand, totalled &euro;174.3 billion.  Ireland in this case received &euro;2.2 billion in EU funding in 2020.  To put this into context, while this figure of &euro;174.3 billion is an awful lot of money, it represents only 1.1% of EU GNI.  As we always say, that works out at approximately &euro;385 for each EU citizen.  As members will see, based on the figures of &euro;2.6 billion and &euro;2.2 billion, we have a net budget transactional balance of approximately &euro;360 million.  However, as we always reiterate, this transactional balance does not reflect all of the other membership benefits that Ireland has from being a member of the EU, with access to the Single Market obviously being the main one.  </p> <p>  The next slide relates to the findings in our annual report.  We basically gave a clean opinion of the reliability of the 2020 accounts.  This has been the normal opinion for many years by the court.  The novelty in this year's accounts was that the Brexit bill was specifically included.  As members will be able to see on the slide, the liability of the UK was estimated at &euro;47.5 billion.  We gave a clean opinion on revenue.  For the second year in a row now we have given adverse opinion on expenditure.</p><p>The level of error has basically stayed the same at 2.7%.  As we explained in our previous presentation, the first thing we have to check is whether the level of error is below or above our materiality threshold of 2%.  Obviously in this case it is above.  The second question is whether it is pervasive, and in 2020 some 59% of our audit population was what we consider to be high-risk expenditure.  Because of this we consider it to be pervasive, which leads us to give an adverse opinion.<br/><br/>Our audit population in 2020 was &euro;147.8 billion compared with &euro;126 billion in 2019, and 40.8% of this referred to natural resources.  Cohesion is catching up at 32.8%.  The reason for the increase as I said earlier is the 59% of high-risk expenditure in our population is linked to this increase in cohesion expenditure.  To a large degree, for natural resources, direct payments are considered to be low-risk because they are entitlement based and we find very few errors there, whereas in cohesion, we have many issues such as procurement and state aid, infrastructure projects and so forth, and they are not entitlement based.  Generally, there are some small areas where we have simplified cost options or lump sum payments.  However, in general, they are costs and reimbursement related.<br/><br/>To give a quick overview, I have said our overall error rate was 2.7%.  This varies from 3.9% in competitiveness, 3.5% in economic, social and territorial cohesion and around 2% in natural resources.  Within natural resources we have direct payments which tend to be around 2%.  Then we have rural development expenditure, which is equivalent in a way to the cohesion expenditure, and there we would have a rate higher than 2%.  The overall average works out at around 2%.<br/><br/>There are different error types we find on the ground in member states.  Some 45% of the error contribution is due to ineligible costs followed by ineligible projects, activities or beneficiaries.  As I said earlier, we always have issues with procurement and state aid, so they comprise 19% of the error.  A particular problem in 2020 was that lack of supporting documents became a bigger issue, because obviously we could not travel on the spot to member states because of the pandemic.  We had issues in some cases getting enough documentation to support our conclusions.<br/><br/>In regard to Ireland specifically, on natural resources there are payments of &euro;60.6 billion across the EU, and Ireland has received &euro;1.6 billion, which is the tenth highest amount of funds from natural resources.  Because of this it is quite a significant player in the natural resources field.  It was part of the sample.  We had 218 transactions from 19 member states on natural resources.  Ireland represented four transactions.  There was one finding from this sample relating to stock density requirements that led to a quantifiable error.  For cohesion, there was no actual sample for Ireland.  Proportionately, the money involved is quite small compared with other member states.<br/><br/>To look at how we compare, we come up with our figures, and through its discharge procedure the Commission also comes up with its own error rates, which it calls risk at payment.  These are error rates based on payments the Commission has made that have not yet been subject to the control framework.  They are still to be audited <i>ex post</i>.  Generally, the Commission reports lower error rates than we do.  We have 2.7% in 2020 whereas it has around 1.9%.  There are reasons for these differences although it can be confusing at times.  Our objective when giving an error rate is to give a representative indication of the level of error across the EU budget, whereas the Commission's objective is to try to identify corrections that may be due from member states.<br/><br/>As auditors we must have what we call professional scepticism, so while we are not fraud investigators, within the Commission, the European anti-fraud office, OLAF, is responsible and has now been supplemented by the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, in Luxembourg.  Where we are auditing transactions, if we find anything we think is suspicious, we forward it to OLAF or, in future, to the EPPO.  We are not fraud investigators and we would not want to compromise any potential future investigation.  Based on our audit work, between 2011 and 2020 OLAF has recommended the recovery of a total of &euro;536 million relating to 37 cases that we have forwarded to it.  We now have an administrative agreement signed with EPPO in Luxembourg, and that commenced in June 2021.<br/><br/>On the annual report side, we had a clean opinion on the reliability of accounts and for revenue.  The estimated level of error is material at 2.7%, which is the same as in 2019.  The same issues arise in that nothing much has changed, as weaknesses in the <i>ex post</i>checks remain.  This is what leads to the errors being found.  There is a high-risk subpopulation of expenditure which concerns 59% of our audit population.  Because of this level of high-risk expenditure, a substantial amount of the expenditure is affected by this material level of error which leads us to an adverse opinion on expenditure.<br/><br/>The annual report is the main product of the European Court of Auditors, but in addition to that we carry out audits on selected topics across a broad range of EU activities.  In 2020, we published 26 such special reports covering topics such as food safety policy, renewable energy, e-commerce and border controls.  In 2021, we published 23 special reports out of a provisional 34 that were planned.  There have been delays linked to the closure procedures because of the pandemic.  For the 2021 published reports, Ireland was specifically covered in four: milk and dairy production; long-term unemployment; Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and climate; and cross-Border programmes.  Ireland featured as a sampled member state in four of the 23 published reports.<br/><br/>In regard to upcoming reports, GNI verification is one where Ireland is covered.  One which will be of general interest is the procurement of vaccines for Covid-19 throughout the EU.  Another which will be of very general interest will be fraud and the CAP.  The one which will be published in September 2022 and which it is hoped will comprise some interesting information for Ireland because of the so-called the leprechaun economics, which we spoke of previously, will be the issue of how research and development expenditure is covered in national accounts.  The idea is that the audit will cover the Commission's management and control systems for the verification and assessment of the GNI data transmitted by member states.  This is important in calculating the GNI contribution that is subsequently payable to the EU budget.<br/><br/>Globalisation was a particular issue, which concerns the treatment of globalisation in national accounts.  We have repeatedly made observations and recommendations in our annual reports.  For example one is recommendation 3.2 of this annual report.  In terms of how the process works, the ECA can set reservations which, if a reservation is made, leaves that aspect open for a number of years subject to the finalisation, and that can have an impact on GNI.  It can set a transversal reservation concerning all member states and it has done this with a deadline of September 2022 for the globalisation issue.  We will have to wait and see what the impact of globalisation is on the GNI figures for 2018 to 2021, if and when they need to be revised.</p><p>This is depending on the figures that are reported by the various member states.  If they are revised, there would be recalculations due for GNI.</p><p> Another thing of interest is that there are many funds and programmes being launched by the Commission and available to member states.  The main one is the recovery and resilience facility, RRF, under which Ireland is due to receive &euro;915 million between 2021 and 2026.  The plan includes three priorities: the green transition, digital reforms and transformation and social and economic recovery and job creation.  Ireland has not yet requested pre-financing under the RRF.  Normally, 13% of a country's total allocation can be drawn down as pre-financing once that country's plan has been agreed.  The first instalment is due in quarter 3 of 2022.</p><p> Another relatively new source of funding for Ireland has been the support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, SURE, financial support.  This, again, is a crisis instrument.  It is &euro;100 billion at EU level.  The objective is to protect jobs and incomes during the Covid-19 pandemic.  As shown the presentation slide, in October 2020 requested &euro;2.47 billion to address the Covid-19 outbreak, which was disbursed in March 2021.  This was split as a &euro;1.27 billion five-year bond and a &euro;1.2 billion 25-year bond.  The idea of the regulation is that the average time span for the borrowings will be 15 years, so the mix of five and 25 comes up with the average of around 14.8.  </p><p> Another fund that is more important than the RRF in terms of monetary value is the Brexit adjustment reserve.  There was a slight revision compared to the original proposal, and under that revision will receive approximately &euro;1.165 billion in grant form over the period from 2020 to 2025.  The objective is to mitigate the impact and the adverse economical, social and territorial consequences of the UK withdrawal.  For Ireland, the Commission has already approved a total of &euro;920.4 million in pre-financing.  This pre-financing is not like standard pre-financing, where it is basically given up front; it is paid in three instalments over three years.  In fact, Ireland is the biggest beneficiary of the Brexit adjustment reserve and will be the first member to receive its pre-financing.  It was to have received the first instalment of &euro;361.6 million on 15 December 2021. </p><p> That is just a flavour of the different funding that has become available or been disbursed to Ireland in addition to the traditional multi-annual financial framework, MFF, sources for natural resources and cohesion and competitiveness.  I thank the committee for its attention and we are open to answer any question, comment or observation that they may have.</p></speech>

It gives us a great idea of Ireland's contribution and responsibility.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  The first is a general one that is not necessarily specific to the court, but it is in the whole general area of EU jobs and how to encourage Irish people to take up roles in the European institutions.  Drawing not just on the position that Mr. Murphy holds now, but the decades of experience he has had across both the ECA and the Commission, what insights might he have in terms of how we can continue to potentially address the slide of Irish people taking up these possible roles.  </p> <p>  I have three specific questions on the annual report.  Mr. Murphy referenced the latter ones but I will go straight to my first one.  He said that this year 59% of EU spending is considered a high risk.  That is up from 53% in 2019.  Can he elaborate on that?  Is this something that needs to be addressed? </p> <p>  I have two questions on my old hobby horse of Brexit.  Many others will have questions on Covid response and vaccines, so I will stick true to form, if that is all right.  In the so-called divorce bill, the UK is due to pay the EU an estimated &euro;47.5 billion.  Can Mr. Murphy give clarity on that figure?  Is there a timeline for receiving this and is it a suite of payments or something else?  Is this budgeted for it?  </p> <p>  Mr. Murphy has no concerns on the Brexit adjustment reserve.  This is obviously something that is hugely important for Ireland.  It is very important that we receive the almost &euro;1 billion.  We see the areas that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is working with a whole-of-government approach.  There are quite obvious areas that will need assistance such as the agrifood sector, and logistics and access to the island.  Could he elaborate on the concern that it could be spent on ineligible or suboptimal measures?  We discussed this much, both at this committee and at various stages through the budget discussion and when we have line Ministers in and through parliamentary questions.  Just before Christmas, both Deputy Howlin and I raised questions in the context of Rosslare Europort.  The argument that I would make is that out of all the 27 member states, Ireland is the most prepared for Brexit.  I do not think there will be any suboptimal measures budgeted for in that reserve, but perhaps an abundance of caution - a term we like to use in many areas - is the theme here.  </p> <p>  On that note, I once again would like to thank Mr. Murphy and his team for coming before us and their continuing work.  I look forward to having him in Dublin again sooner rather than later, and also getting to Luxembourg in due course.</p></speech>

I was not sure if I would answer or wait for more questions.  I thank the Deputy for his questions.  As he knows, I am constantly trying to encourage and get Irish applicants and successful applicants into the EU institutions.  We promote it wherever we can.  I would definitely welcome the Department of Foreign Affairs jobs strategy.  The strategy is in place and now it is about implementing that strategy to get real results.  I fully agree with him.  In terms of the Commission especially, we need people's bums on seats there because we really need people who are in there who are helping to shape policy and bring perspective to the table.</p> <p>  The European Court of Auditors is a small player in this.  It is one of the smaller institutions but, nonetheless, we have been quite successful in attracting trainees proportionate to the other big member states.  This year we successfully got three seconded national experts from the Irish Civil Service.  There were 12 posts and we got three of them, so we were quite happy with that.  Unfortunately, in the end, the third one got an offer to work in the Deputy's favourite field in the embassy in London, working on Brexit and agriculture, which I am sure is a very interesting job.  Unfortunately, that meant we lost one.  However, we still have a possibility to fill that if we can find another official who would be willing to come. </p> <p>  Another big influx out in the past few months has been in terms of Irish speakers.  The derogation on Irish ended in January.  For instance, in the court we have three new translators and another on the way; there will be a full team of four Irish translators in the courts.  I am very happy to see that happen.  Speaking of Irish, language skills is one of the big challenges.</p><p>We need to encourage more language learning.  Now, it is almost the case that three languages are needed to get through the competitive process.  Irish counts as an official language now, and there is English, generally, so usually one more is needed at a good level.  The strategy is a start but it is very focused on the public service.  We also need people to come from the private sector, if we can attract them.  There is probably a lack of awareness.  We need to promote the possibilities more in the universities and so on because many people do not know anything about them, which is problematic.<br/><br/>The increase in expenditure is down to one simple reason.  Cohesion expenditure is increasing proportionately.  It was slow to start off and now it is catching up.  Cohesion expenditure by its nature is inherently risky because it is big projects involving state aid and procurement.<br/><br/>The Deputy asked about the Brexit bill.  It is quite mathematical.  It is &euro;47.5 billion, most of which comes from something that we did not mention in the presentation.  The EU has what is called the <i>reste &agrave; liquider, </i>appropriations which have been made and are yet to be paid.  There was &euro;303 billion of that at the end of 2020.  I often found it strange that it was called the Brexit settlement because these were obligations, commitments that were made for projects in all the member states.  The UK had a 12.36% share of this.  The bulk of the &euro;47.5 billion comes from that mathematical calculation, basically &euro;36 billion.  They have discounted it by &euro;1 billion because based on past experience, there is a certain amount of commitments which do not materialise and are cancelled.  The vast bulk of the rest of the money is its share of pension obligations for officials.  These were obligations that were due at a point in time, December 2020, which were calculated based on their GNI contribution rate.  There is a very complicated payment schedule.  The payments for 2021 have happened without any issue.  If the UK would like to pay it all off in one go the possibility is there but otherwise the payments are scheduled over quite some years.<br/><br/>We had discussions yesterday about the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, and where Ireland is.  We would hope to utilise fully the available funding through eligible projects.  I would imagine it should not be too much of a problem.  We are probably the most impacted.  There is probably some uncertainty because there are still outstanding issues, the impact of which has not yet fully materialised.  They need to be addressed if and when they happen.  On the other hand, an issue we raised in our opinion on the BAR was that if we are looking at big infrastructural projects, they can take some time.  They will not be finished in a year or two, they can take quite an extensive period.  If we discuss developments in Rosslare, for instance, these things will not happen in six months.  Someone asked last time how we will audit this.  It is one of our issues with how the funding is set.  There are three prepayments, as we said and the claim is not made until 2023.  We will not see anything until September 2023.  I presume the Commission is in constant contact and discussions with the member states on how they are progressing and that there is some toing and froing on the eligibility of projects.  I would be hopeful that we will utilise it to the full.</p></speech>

Deputy Richmond has probably asked at least two of my questions.  I will try to stretch Mr. Murphy as before.  He had told me last time that he would have to give a very political answer so he was unable to do so.</p> <p>  I refer to the suspected fraud detected in the audit.  Mr. Murphy spoke of OLAF's work between 2011 and 2020, which recovered &euro;536 million.  As that involved 37 cases, some of those must have been substantial.  It might not be possible to get into the six instances of suspected fraud in the 2020 audit but what detail can Mr. Murphy give about this?  Are we talking about a major level of criminality?  Where did that happen?  I accept there are limits to what Mr. Murphy can say.  He is smiling.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022011900002#G00400"><p>Hopefully I am smiling most of the time.  Fraud, as the Deputy knows, is a very sensitive issue.  We are not a big player in this game.  We have to use our professional scepticism.  If we see something we report it.  That is why six cases is not a huge amount.  That is out of about 750 transactions that we audit in a year.  We have a fraud team in-house which would do an initial screening based on the auditors' initial feeling.  We identified 12 cases from our audit work and then eight from third parties.  We have denunciations from third parties as well.  Of the 12 suspected cases from our audit work, we forwarded six to OLAF because our legal service felt there was some value in six of the cases.  I think that was justified by the fact that OLAF did open an investigation in all six cases.</p> <p>  The six cases cover France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Romania.  Five relate to agriculture and one relates to cohesion.  They emanate from three different funds.  There were three in the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, EAGF; two in the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD; and one in the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  That is probably as much information as I can give to show that it is spread across a number of member states and across a number of different policy areas.  </p> <p>  If we do a specific audit, that would be different.  Let us say we pursue fraud in the CAP, for instance, as I mentioned earlier.  If that is published in 2022 and we find particular instances, they may be given as specific examples as part of an audit work or weaknesses in a member state if we find them.  OLAF has its own reporting requirements and it also has some restrictions.  That is as much as we can say on that although I believe I can say the type of thing that arises.  It might be a grant that is used for a purpose other than that intended.  There could be the artificial creation of conditions to obtain funding, which would probably be the main reason that ties in with fraud, that it is deliberate.  We have errors that are not deliberate but the artificial creation of conditions is obviously a deliberate act and therefore we would view that as a fraud case.  </p> <p>  That probably does not answer the Deputy fully but I hope that it is adequate.  </p></speech>

It is just to get a general run-down.</p> <p>  Mr. Murphy spoke about the audit and the question of GNI.</p><p>We have spoken previously about the fact that Ireland has lost out on an element of funding because of the way things are calculated.  What is the process and the likely outcome?  What will the determination be in relation to any changes?  What is possible?</p></speech>

It would be better for the Deputy to ask all of this questions together rather than going back and forth.</p></speech>

I do not want to take liberties.  I am interested in hearing about the BAR and the RRF, and the draw down of the money.  Mr. Murphy spoke about the fact that a certain percentage of the RRF can be drawn down in quarter 3 of 2023.  I am trying to understand the free flow and whether it will have an impact on the projects.  Beyond that, the question that I usually throw in is the push question.  In terms of the issue of fiscal constraint, there is some talk about changing that.  We all accept that the rules had to be bent during the Covid period and beyond but I am interested in the outworking of that, combined with whatever major moves states will have to make in relation to doing real business as regards climate change.  We will have to look at this whole field.  Can Mr. Murphy comment on the conversation that is happening in Europe on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022011900002#H00400"><p>On the GNI, it does have an impact.  First, it affects the contribution we are required to make.  The GNI is a total so if there is a revamping and it is determined that we have paid too much, other member states would pay in accordingly, proportionate to their rate and we would get a refund.  I do not know what the final impact will be.  What we have ascertained is that Ireland considers that its figures are correct so there is no question there.  They do not envisage that they will be changing their figures.  The issue then is the impact of any change to the figures of other member states.  That would have an impact on the contribution that should have been made from 2018 to 2021.  The Commission made a decision that it would not go back any further than 2018.  Some member states wanted to go back to 2013 but there was a consensus that it would be too difficult to get the information for such a long period.  Obviously, it would have been more interesting for Ireland if 2013 to 2018 was also covered.   The fact that the way that the GNI is calculated is different and results in a higher figure would have also had an impact on the funding we received from the RRF, because that was also linked to GNI.  I do not know what the outcome will be.  This is the exercise that EUROSTAT is currently undertaking.  Documentation has to be provided by the member states by September 2022 and it will probably be another year before EUROSTAT finalises its work and comes up with revised figures.</p></speech>

GNI is the main source of funding for the EU budget, in fact.</p> <p>  The drawdown under the RF is done by way of predetermined instalments and they are linked, in a way, to the achievement of milestones or targets.  It is laid out in the plans that different steps will be met by particular dates and they are linked then to the instalment in some way, although not fully, in terms of costs, let us say.  That is an issue that we have, as auditors.  It is a totally different delivery mechanism which is very far removed from what we see, for instance, in cohesion funding.  It is completely different.  A plan is adopted at the start to establish a cost for the plan and then, in a way, the costs do not really matter.  The issue is basically whether the milestone has been reached or the investment target has been met.  If, for instance, the pre-financing of 13% is drawn down by Ireland, it will just be deducted from the first instalment, which is due in 2022 in any case.  I think it is &euro;320 million or thereabouts.  That is the mechanics of it.  It is very much linked to the progress made with the implementation of the plan.  </p> <p>  In terms of fiscal change, as the Deputy said, general discussions are ongoing.  We are there to audit the decisions taken and are not part of the political decision-making process.  </p></speech>

I thank Mr. Murphy for his, as always, very comprehensive submission which is a mine of information that we can use into the future.  It will not surprise Mr. Murphy that I want to start with the BAR.  We tried to get information on the specifics of this from the chief of staff of Commissioner Ferreira at the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy, REGIO, who appeared before this committee last year.  We know that the first instalment was paid in December.  This is expected to be a short and sharp expenditure period so as Mr. Murphy rightly says, for capital works we need to be up and running now because the final payment will be made in 2025, with three significant payments paid before that.  I am interested in Mr. Murphy's steer on this but it seems to me that it will be problematic from an audit perspective to talk in terms of reimbursing abstract losses as opposed to something that is specific.  In terms of Rosslare Europort, temporary measures have been put in place in preparation for Brexit which basically have sited customs, custom checks and immigration checks outside the perimeter of the port, which is something the Commission would never normally accept, for obvious reasons.  Bringing goods, cargo and people outside of the port and up the road to be checked, from an audit perspective, is not perfect.  The idea now is to rebuild those checkpoints within the confines of the port.  It strikes me that this would be an ideal project for funding.  Has any pre-clearance request for that come past the Court of Auditors yet?</p> <p>  My second question relates to how things are going to work into the future.  Mr. Murphy seemed to imply in his presentation that the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, will be the new oversight prosecution authority for fraud but in terms of the legislation to partake in that in this jurisdiction, Ireland is not part of the EPPO.  A total of 22 of the 27 member states are part of the EPPO but we are not and part of the explanation for that is our common law jurisdiction.  How will that fit?  Is it expected that in the future we will be part of the EPPO or will there be a different prosecution service for fraud in relation to this country?  I am not sure how that would function.</p> <p>  My third and final question relates to - I love the euphemism - errors that Mr. Murphy instances in terms of accounting.  We are used to looking at public auditing through the Comptroller and Auditor General and there will always be underestimates and mistakes made.  Any business, never mind any State, will have to endure that.  Cohesion funding will continue to grow in terms of the volume of money that is spent.  I am very supportive of cohesion funding.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I was responsible for cohesion funding and I chaired the cohesion Council during the Irish Presidency.  One of the things that struck me at the time was that unexpended cohesion allocations were not reallocated to eligible projects.  The total budget package in the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, that set the expenditure for cohesion funding was not sacrosanct.</p><p>Unexpended funding was rebated to member states as opposed to being reallocated to eligible cohesion projects.  That struck me as odd.  Is that still the case or is all of the allocation for cohesion funding expected to be expended in its totality?  </p><p> I will make one final observation with regard to the GNI calculation referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  It was extraordinarily unfortunate that the period of economic collapse for Ireland was excluded and the calculation was made on our economic recovery.  I will leave it at "unfortunate".</p></speech>

The difference between the BAR and the RRF is that the payments are not actually linked to implementation.  They are pre-finance instalments and are not linked to implementation in the same way as the RRF.  In terms of pre-clearance with us, we had some concerns about the way the BAR was constructed, one of which was the fact that we will not see the expenditure for three years or more.  We do not know what is actually going on.  We got some assurances from the Commission that there would be ongoing correspondence between it and the member states to check how things were progressing.  It is one of the issues that we raised in our opinion.  We said we were worried because it is not like the MFF, where we have OPPs and everything is approved upfront.  Here, there was a certain amount of leeway or flexibility given to the member states, which is good.  What we were saying was that we were worried there could be some legal uncertainty as to the eligibility of the projects when ultimately they are claimed because there was no pre-approval process.  That is more a question for the Commission and the Deputy was right to address it to the chief of staff of the Directorate-General for Regional and Urban Policy, REGIO, as to how it is monitoring and managing that.  We can only intervene when the expenditure is claimed, in a way.</p></speech>

I am just saying that projects like the one at Rosslare are so eminently eligible that they should be prioritised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022011900002#J00400"><p>Yes.  I would not have expected that there would be too much trouble finding a total of &euro;1.1 billion of eligible projects, regardless of where they are or their merits.  The point the Deputy makes on the European Public Prosecutor's Office is a good one in terms of common law, the UK and so on.  As the Deputy said, 22 member states are part of it, which means a couple of other member states are also outside the confines of EPPO.  I do not have a concrete answer on how it is going to work in the future because EPPO is still finding its way.  It is in the very early operational stages and the same is true for OLAF.  As some of the OLAF functions have transferred to EPPO, there is a little bit of reshaping going on there so the full playing field is not fully determined yet.  I would imagine that there will be some pressure to integrate all member states into EPPO at some stage.  I presume that would be the objective.</p> <p>  On the issue of errors, Brian Murphy and I both worked previously with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and aware that it has the luxury of not having to do what we have to do at the Court of Auditors.  We are required under treaty to give an opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying expenditure, which is very unusual.  No one else does that, apart perhaps from the Government Accountability Office, GAO, in the US which does something similar.  It is a very unusual and specific thing which emanated from the Maastricht Treaty.  I believe it was the UK that brought the concept to the table.  We are where we are and we have to do it.  </p> <p>  On cohesion funding, during the previous programme and period the Commission set up a task force to help member states to absorb the funds.  The objective is full absorption.  States are given their allocation at the start of the MFF period and the objective is to try to spend it because ultimately, if it is not used, it would revert to the EU budget.  That is what would happen.  Member states obviously do not want to lose that funding.</p> <p>  I cannot really comment any further on the Deputy's comment regarding the GNI.</p></speech>

How would he suggest the EU should go about tackling non-compliance with the state aid rules by member states that are in receipt of cohesion funding?  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to fraud and we are talking about a very significant amount of money, totalling some &euro;536 million.  What does Mr. Murphy suggest the EU should do to tackle non-compliance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022011900002#J00700"><p>State aid is a very complicated area, as the Senator knows.  It is a very complex, technical issue.  Within the Commission, we have the Directorate-General for Competition, DG COMP, which is ultimately responsible for ensuring state aid rules are respected by member states.  What happens for us is that if we have a project where we think there is a state aid involvement, we check the compliance with the rules but we do not set those rules.  Basically, we see if the rules are being correctly implemented.  This is being managed on a continuous basis by DG COMP.</p> <p>  In terms of fraud, &euro;538 million is a lot of money, especially given that it does not involve many cases.  It is only 37 cases, which is a very small number in comparison to the number of cases being handled by OLAF, for example.  There are also cases that are referred by the audit divisions in the different DGs and they are much bigger than us.  There are country desks in a lot of the DGs that follow specific member states.  They would be more aware of things in individual member states.  The Commission has implemented anti-fraud strategies but they obviously do not work fully.  Fraud, by its nature, involves people who are very clever and very good at getting around the rules.  It is very easy to have a paper trail which looks perfect but the reality behind it may not be the same.  There are lots of anti-fraud initiatives at Commission level, including the Arachne database, which tries to check for inconsistencies between beneficiaries.  There are anti-fraud strategies in place in the DGs.  Also, under the RRF, every payment claim that comes from member states includes a management declaration which basically says that the EU budget is protected and that the national and EU rules are respected.  This puts the onus on the member states to ensure that happens.  That is an issue for us in terms of how we are going to audit the RRF because the Commission has made the member states responsible for the money they receive.  Member states are the beneficiaries and it is up to them to make sure that proper fraud prevention measures are in place.  The amount of money involved, with the emergency response to Brexit, the RRF and the MFF from 2014 to 2020 still being completed up and the MFF for 2021 to 2027 already up and running, is enormous.  There is a lot of funding available and the rush to spend funds obviously increases the risk of fraud, which everyone must be aware of and keep an eye out for.  </p></speech>

My questions have been touched on already but I will try to drill down a bit further into the issues of the GNI verification and the whole globalisation process.  Ireland contributes &euro;2.2 billion to the EU.  Mr. Murphy said that he cannot predict the likely outcome of this process but why does he think the process was set up in the first place?  What were the reasons for commissioning this investigation?  Does Mr. Murphy think that Ireland, as a member state, has anything to fear from the process?  Was Ireland first and foremost in the thoughts of those who came up with this process initially?  I am interested to learn a little bit more about this whole GNI verification process and why it was established.</p><p>Mr. Murphy also touched on the difficulties with auditing the Brexit adjustment reserve in that he will not be able to see the expenditure for three years.  There has, however, been a huge increase in expenditure generally by the EU and unprecedented measures have been taken because of Covid-19 and so on.  Mr. Murphy has much work ahead of him in respect of the recovery and resilience facility, RRF, the SURE financial support and the Brexit adjustment reserve.  Is he satisfied he has all the processes in place and resources to do that, and he is on top of what is about to land on his desk, so to speak?</p><p> With regard to errors and irregularities across the board in all schemes and across the EU generally, which I do not believe Mr. Murphy made reference to or was referenced in some of the contributions, where does Ireland as a member state fit into the table?  Are we average, above or below average in the number of errors and irregularities?</p></speech>

In terms of the GNI, as I said, I do not think we can anticipate the result but I do not think we have anything to worry about as such.  I would not like to fully say it but it is not likely that we will have to pay more because our figures are the ones that are higher than anyone else in terms of this particular issue.  Our investigation is not just linked to globalisation.  It is looking at the GNI verification process as a whole, and globalisation was a very topical issue within that process.  That is why they have decided to look at that as a specific component of the GNI audit.</p> <p>  Effectively, what we are auditing is how EUROSTAT, which is the central statistics office for the EU, is verifying these figures.  As we said, those figures are very important in that they ultimately lead to the contribution of member states to the EU budget.  We are, therefore, looking at it from a more global - not globalisation - aspect.</p> <p>  As I said, it is particularly interesting for Ireland because of all the different articles and issues over recent years with regard to the particular aspect of the GNI calculations.  To be honest with the Deputy, it is in our chamber but we have deliberately stayed away from being directly involved as the reporting member, for instance, just so there is no potential conflict of interest, let us say.  It is the standard policy that we would not audit our own member state in such a situation.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct.  In terms of the workload, we have a lot on our plate and we will have more.  The multi-annual financial framework, MFF, is already a much-increased level of expenditure.  The big unknown is the RRF, however.  As I pointed out earlier, the scope of our audit and how far we will be able to go, because of the way it has been set up, may not be the kind of assurance we can give it.  I will probably have responsibility for the statement of assurance on the RRF as well.  It looks like that is coming my way.</p> <p>  As I said, however, in terms of legality and regularity, because it is a payment to the member state, from a pure first level compliance point of view, if the milestone or investment target has been reached, then the payment is due.  That is the condition for payment.  We will be checking that and then other things like protection of the EU budget etc. will probably be done by separate compliance or systems audits.  The Deputy is right, however.  We still do not know exactly the scope of it.  There are roughly 40 RRF payments due this year and we will have to look at a lot of them.  It is not like a policy area where we get an idea or take a representative sample for a policy area.  Here, there are specific member state claims that are all different with no homogeneity between them.  We will have to have a broad audit coverage in that regard.</p> <p>  We have been approved for 20 new posts.  As members are all aware, negotiating with budgetary authorities in terms of additional staff is always a difficult process.  I think we may have looked for 40.  I am not exactly sure of the figures.  We got 20 with an option to have a review, say, at the end of a year or so to see how it develops and if we have a better idea of the work we will have to do.</p> <p>  In terms of errors, as we said, because of the nature of the expenditure and Cohesion, we do not really feature very much.  We were not included in the sample at all.  As we stated in the presentation, we had four transactions audited for agriculture and we had one error because the stock density requirements were not met.  As I said, most of the Directorates General, for instance, DG REGIO and the DG for employment, have big audit units and country desks where they follow member states.  We would be looking at how they classify the control systems in the member states and I would say Ireland would generally be very favourably ranked.  That is what I could confirm.</p></speech>

We still have a bit of time in case anybody has a final supplementary question.</p> <p>  While Mr. Murphy is thinking, I will go back to his point regarding the challenge around attracting expertise on the language front across the range.  He mentioned that we can do more in the universities.  Is there something we can be doing in the secondary schools as well in terms of people looking at their own career paths and potential jobs?  I am specifically thinking on the Gaeilge requirements and competency as well.  The standards are very high when we are talking about translation and the skill set required for that.  Is there something we can be doing in the secondary schools?  I am interested to hear Mr. Murphy's opinion on that.</p></speech>

A Blue Star programme is run that addresses exactly that in secondary schools where they try to raise awareness of the whole EU project, let us say.  There is work being done.  The earlier people are exposed to this possibility, the better.  That is a good thing.</p> <p>  When people move from secondary level to university, the whole focus is on the big four or the big law firms.  There is probably a perception that we are all accountants in the Court of Auditors, but we actually have very few accountants.  We obviously need some because we have to audit the EU accounts, but as I said, for many of the other reports we referenced earlier, we have many different requirements in terms of competence and expertise.  We need lawyers, economists and people from a variety of different backgrounds. Something is being done at both levels.  There is work being done at university level, but I do not know whether it could be perhaps more co-ordinated or focused or something like that.  It is not easy.</p></speech>

The European Court of Justice has responsibility for that and it crosses a huge number of subjects.  How exactly are these carried out by the ECA?  It obviously has to take in in-house expertise and so forth.  Will there be some sort of reckoning?  I get that some of this is easier to do state by state with regard to the impact of Brexit and the change, let us say, in what has happened here in that we have a greater amount of North-South trade.  We obviously have a substantial number of people who have looked to Europe and bypassed Britain because of obvious difficulties.  I wonder whether this will appear at some point in one of these special reports.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy could give a bit of information on those issues.</p></speech>

For instance, we have a natural resources chamber, a cohesion chamber, a competitive list chamber, external aid, let us say, and then we have our chamber, which is financing the EU.  Obviously, we need input from all these chambers.  The idea is he people in the chambers do the audit work for us and we co-ordinate the plan.  We tell them what we expect from them.  They carry out the work because they are the experts in these particular fields and we see a value.  There is also a synergy with the performance reports they would do in those policy areas.  In all the chambers, there would be an element of performance work and this sort of compliance, legality and regularity work.  That is just how it works in practice.</p><p> In terms of Brexit, I am not sure whether it will feature as an audit.  To me, it looks more like it should be an evaluation of the impact by the Commission.  I think the matter would fit better there.  We will do some work on the costs because that is our main focus.  I do not know whether we would do an audit on the impact of Brexit on particular member states.  That is maybe more a thing for evaluation by the Commission. </p></speech>

I offer best wishes to everyone on the committee for the new year.  I thank the committee for its invitation to attend.  I will make some opening points on the reasons for the invitation.  I will not go through my statement in full but pick out a few key points so that we can move to a discussion.  I am joined by my officials Mr. Joe Cullen, principal officer with responsibility for income tax and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS,, and Mr. Brendan O&rsquo;Leary, principal officer with responsibility for insurance and pensions policy.</p> <p>  On the Covid-19 supports for businesses, the committee will be aware of the importance and value of the EWSS, and its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS.  Together, they have involved the expenditure of almost &euro;10 billion.  In the case of EWSS alone, more than &euro;7 billion has been provided.  This amount comprises direct subsidy payments of &euro;6.12 billion and PRSI forgone of &euro;956 million.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, has provided support of &euro;713 million to over 25,000 businesses.</p> <p>  The EWSS legislation places the administration of the scheme under the care and management of Revenue.  The key metric for access to the scheme was a decline in turnover due to the impact of the public health restrictions.  Revenue has been rigorous in its structured programme of checks to ensure the eligibility of businesses for subsidy payments under EWSS and will pursue any instances where a business fails to qualify for the scheme for whatever reason.</p> <p>  On the matter of companies that were in receipt of such support and subsequently paid dividends to their shareholders, I would state at the outset that I am not at liberty nor would it be appropriate for me to comment on the affairs of individual taxpayers.  While the question of what dividends a company may or not be in position to pay to shareholders is a matter outside the current legislative remit of the scheme, I will keep this matter under review and assess whether it would be appropriate to introduce any further conditionality.  However, I am strongly of the view that it would be important that any changes are proportionate and would not undermine the overarching policy rationale underpinning the scheme, which is to maintain employment.  More than 700,000 employments have been supported by the EWSS and it is important that we do not lose sight of this important end goal.  I stress that the overwhelming majority of companies which have participated in the wage subsidy schemes did so because they genuinely believed they would need support at that point based on the effect of the pandemic on their business.  In the overwhelming majority that proved to be the case.  Some companies subsequently had a strong financial year and ultimately considered that the State support was not required by them and returned the support received to Revenue.  I would strongly encourage other companies who are in a similar situation to consider their actions.</p> <p>  On the broader issue of the future of supports, as the committee will be aware, in light of the necessity to reintroduce public health restrictions last December, the higher rates of EWSS were extended for a further two months across December and January.  The EWSS was also reopened from 1 January for certain businesses who otherwise may not be eligible.  These enhancements are beneficial to all sectors of the economy and in particular those sectors most severely impacted by the pandemic, including the hospitality, arts and entertainment sectors.  The CRSS was also extended to 31 January 2022 so that businesses that have been significantly restricted from trading can now qualify for the scheme.  The turnover reduction criteria was also increased from no more than 25% to 40% of 2019 turnover, and new businesses established between 13 October 2020 and 26 July 2021 are now be eligible to apply for the scheme.  These changes were made in recognition of the challenges facing businesses in the sectors directly impacted by public health regulations.</p> <p>  I and my Government colleagues have always committed that there will be no cliff edge in respect of supports for businesses while accepting that such supports cannot continue indefinitely.  In that vein, we continue to monitor developments, particularly those of the coming days and weeks, and consider options for the future of supports for impacted sectors.</p> <p>  Turning now to the issue of business interruption insurance I should begin by noting that the majority of such policies in place did not provide business interruption cover in relation to Covid-19.  Ultimately, this is a legal, contractual matter between the relevant counterparties and in some cases has been the subject of litigation.  Nonetheless, for the smaller number of policies that did provide such cover, it became apparent that some insurers deducted the value of state supports from claim settlements.  Such deductions would appear as having been justified as being in line with the established insurance principle of indemnity.  However, the Government was concerned that such action could be seen as representing a subsidy for insurers and furthermore, was not in line with the prevailing spirit under which these extraordinary supports were provided.  My Department examined this issue firstly in terms of the prevailing relationship between state supports and insurance claims.  It appears that in most instances, this issue does not arise because well-established measures already exist whereby state supports are not provided if losses are already covered by insurance, or where they are, they can be refunded to the State through official channels.</p><p>Consideration was then given to whether the Government could legislate to ensure that the Covid-19 moneys retained by insurers were returned to the State.  Having received legal advice, it was determined not to enact legislation seeking to retrospectively recover the amounts deducted by insurers.</p><p> There is a lack of transparency around this general issue.  For this reason, the insurance (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is currently being drafted, includes as a clear, practical response two provisions directly linked to this.  The first will clarify that the Central Bank may collect, for the purposes of the National Claims Information Database, NCID, data on any State supports deducted from final settlement amounts.  This enhanced transparency, building on the positive impact of the NCID, will enable us in the future to make better, evidence-based policy decisions to help ensure that this situation does not arise again, thus protecting the public interest.  The second pro-consumer provision will require insurers in the interests of transparency to inform policyholders of any such deductions of public moneys from final settlement amounts.</p><p> I note there has been some discussion about the approach taken in the UK.  The Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, there advised that insurers should make a case-by-case assessment as to whether it is appropriate to make such deductions, considering the nature of the support and the terms of the policy.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s general approach is aligned with this FCA advice.</p><p> It is important to recall that at the start of the pandemic, a core aim was to provide payments to the many businesses that needed them as quickly as possible.  I think we can agree that this was achieved.  However, there are lessons to be learned about deductions by insurers.  Accordingly, the insurance (miscellaneous provisions) Bill of 2021 will provide a new framework to provide information on this practice.  This, along with the policy learnings from this crisis, will enable the Government, if we are developing new supports, to help ensure that this does recur.  I also note that the test cases related to this issue are ongoing and the courts are currently considering issues of quantum, with a judgment expected soon.  Accordingly, I am unable to comment further on these cases at this time.</p><p> Insurance must take a "customer first" approach to these matters, in line with the Central Bank's guidance on resolving issues around business interruption insurance.  There will be a further implementation report due soon on the Government's action plan for insurance reform.</p><p> Moving on to the sale of AIB shares, on the AIB trading plan, I announced to the market on 21 December 2021 my intention to sell part of the State&rsquo;s 71.2% directed shareholding in AIB over the next six months by way of a trading plan.  This will be managed on behalf of the State by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The Government believes that banking is an activity that should be provided by the private sector and that taxpayer funds which were used to rescue the banks could be better used in other ways.  My announcement on AIB is further progress in the Government&rsquo;s policy of monetising its remaining stakes in the banks and returning them fully into private ownership.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, a total of &euro;29.4 billion was invested in AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB over the period 2009 to 2011.  Some &euro;19.5 billion has been recovered in cash by way of disposals, investment income and liability guarantee fees.  In the case of AIB, the State invested &euro;20.75 billion and has recovered &euro;10.62 billion, leaving a deficit of &euro;10.13 billion.  As at 10 January 2022, the State&rsquo;s remaining equity stake in AIB was valued at &euro;5 billion.  I have instructed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to target that up to, but not more than, 15% of the expected aggregate total trading volume in AIB is to be sold over the duration of the trading plan.  This is to ensure the State, as seller, does not disturb trading in the price of the shares on any given day.  The number of shares sold each day will depend on market conditions, among other factors.  </p><p> The trading plan which has been designed to handle volatility in the share price.  Only a small amount of shares will be sold each day and a floor price, below which shares cannot be sold, has been built into the plan.  The important outcome is not the price on a particular day but what on average is achieved over the duration of the plan.  This is the first activity since 2017 for AIB.  I expect the pace of share sales to be slower than what we have seen in the Bank of Ireland but it is important that we make further progress on what will be a journey over many years.</p><p> I will keep other sale options open, including larger block trades or directed buybacks from AIB itself, should these opportunities present themselves.  With regard to usage of the sales proceeds, it is important to highlight that no new income will be generated from the plan and the transaction should be viewed as a switch in State assets from shares to cash.</p></speech>

In my view, I and every other member of this committee and the Oireachtas consider that the supports put in place by this Government and the previous Government were absolutely necessary and have been very successful to date.  We can clearly state that had those supports not been provided, many businesses would have gone to the wall by now.  Hopefully, once they are weaned off State supports, those businesses will continue in the future.  The same applies to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which was absolutely necessary from the point of view of employees.</p> <p>  Having said that, I will ask a question about the dividend payments.  The spirit of the supports put in place by the State and objective of the Oireachtas was to ensure that businesses could survive through a very difficult business period because of the pandemic.  None of us ever envisaged that businesses in receipt of State support would pay out dividends to shareholders.  Certainly, I did not envisage that and I raised the matter with the Minister in October 2020.  I am also sure the Minister did not envisage it happening.  Under the equivalent scheme operated in the UK, the Covid corporate financing facility, there is a requirement that no dividends be paid and there be no buyback of shares.  Did the Minister or his Department given consideration to a similar condition being introduced for the supports put in place by this Government and the previous Government?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#B00400"><p>We gave consideration as to whether further conditionality would be merited for access to the scheme, beyond where we were with turnover and tax compliance.  I decided when we were introducing the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, that this would not be appropriate.  The reason was that I anticipated a very low level of dividend payments, if any, being made across the period.  I also had a number of concerns regarding the execution of such conditionality, were it to be brought in.  My principal concern was that if limitations were put in place regarding the non-payment of dividends in the period in which a company is participating in the scheme and a company made a profit during that period, for which, in normal circumstances, it would either be required to make a dividend payment for tax reasons or would make a dividend payment because of an expectation of shareholders or private owners, it would simply raise the prospect of dividend payments being made after the scheme came to an end where that company had a level of profit that gave it reason to believe that dividends were appropriate.</p> <p>  Those are the reasons I did not have such conditions in place.  As I indicated, I will monitor this issue when I consider the future of these schemes.  It is important to be transparent and open with the Deputy.  I will not make any changes that undermine what I believe is the central objective of this scheme, namely, the maintenance of employment and giving every chance for employers to be viable.</p></speech>

Would that be a fair comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#B00600"><p>No, it was for different reasons.  The first one was that at that point in time we had the reasons the Deputy might well imagine.  There was a very low expectation of dividends being paid in the first place.</p><p>This is because at each point we revised the EWSS we were doing so at moments of great economic difficulty.  We moved the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, into the EWSS because of what was happening with the economy and we extended the EWSS, again because of the impact of very demanding public health regulations.  Thus, there was an expectation of it not happening for many and I had many concerns about how it could actually be executed.  Generally, it is to be expected that companies that were on the employment wage subsidy scheme continued to be profitable but at lower levels than they would have had in the absence of a pandemic.  From my point of view, if I look at the retention of employment and creating new jobs in the future, a certain degree of profitability is both understandable and in many cases can be positive.  It means that when we get to a point where we are changing the economic supports, companies are approaching that moment of change while already having a degree of profitability.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#C00300"><p>As I have said before, it is not in the spirit of the way in which the scheme was both launched and the way in which the overwhelming majority of employers have been complying with it.  However, I will only make changes with the scheme if I am confident it does not interfere with the retention of employment, and profitability is important for the retention of employment given my intention to remove these supports at the right moment.</p></speech>

Is that something the Minister gave consideration to?  Does he have any concern that that, though not a condition here, is being breached by businesses in Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#C00500"><p>I do not currently have any evidence of this being breached either in a conspicuous or very broad way.  Again, it is possible there would be businesses that were on this scheme that may have given some wage increases to some people who work there during the duration but it is unlikely.</p></speech>

I move to the business interruption issue to which the Minister referred.  I note what he said about the advice he received that he could not introduce laws that were retrospectively going to require insurance companies to pay back moneys gained by way of State support.  I understand that.  However, was any consideration given to introducing a prohibition on that happening prospectively?</p></speech>

I await the outcome of the hearing the Deputy has made reference to before I give any further consideration to what could be done at that point.  The measures I am committed to bringing in are ones that overall will increase transparency and information on the matter.  I will consider whether further action is needed at the conclusion of the court hearings on this matter.</p></speech>

If he looks at the EWSS, at the moment one worker in 12 in our country is now on that scheme.  At the same time, we have many employers that cannot get the staff and the workers they need.  Again, I should be open with the Deputy that more than the conditionality of access to payments being a key issue for me - and this is something I will monitor - for me, what it is now appropriate to consider is the future of the payments, full stop.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#C01000"><p>Okay.  I am glad the Minister is going to give consideration to perhaps introducing a provision because the ones in the insurance (miscellaneous provisions) Bill at present are really just an ability to accumulate data.  There is no requirement on an insurance company to deduct from business interruption claims the amount of State supports the business has received.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#C01100"><p>That is correct and a fair summary of it.  That goes back to the Deputy's earlier question to me on whether further action would be merited in relation to it.  As I have said, it is not the intention of these supports that were brought in to subsidise the level of insurance payments that are being made.  However, these are issues that need to be considered in the context of the point he opened up with, namely, that these payments and their execution have saved the domestic economy.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.  If it were possible for the Minister to communicate with my office when he has the information, either to say he is not in a position to give it out or that he is and then what it actually is, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

Deputy Barry and other Deputies very frequently put parliamentary questions regarding legal and professional fees that are paid for the provision of services to the Department of Finance.  Once we move beyond the period of any commercial sensitivity reasons for not sharing that information we share it.  If there are no commercial reasons stopping me from sharing the information with him now then I will.  If there are, we will do so at a later point.  That will be done through the committee and directly to the Deputy, as requested.</p></speech>

On the same issue, the taxpayer bailed out AIB with a very large sum of money.  It is important the steps that are taken are beneficial ones for the taxpayer.  The sale of the shares is a step in the direction of the privatisation of this bank.  Clearly, when the shares are sold the bank will still have a majority State holding but it is without question a step in the direction of privatisation.  I do not believe moving towards a for-profit bank is in the interests of the majority of ordinary people.  It would be not just a for-profit bank but a for-profit bank within the framework of a for-profit banking system at a time when the State has a need for a powerful State bank that can intervene in the economy in appropriate ways.  What I mean by that is the State clearly needs to have a programme of investment in housing, health, climate action, education and other areas.  It does not make good sense to move towards increased for-profit banking when there is a need for State investment.  AIB is not run in such a way at the moment that it is fully kitted out to do so but changes could be made to it within the framework of State ownership to make it a powerful driver of State investment.  I put it to the Minister that is the way we should go rather than taking steps in the direction of privatisation.  I am interested in his comments on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#D00100"><p>The Deputy's description of what the Government is doing, in some ways, is correct.  It is not my intention that the State would remain the largest shareholder of AIB in the long term.  My view is that we should be in a position where the bank is privately owned.  Before we get to that point, we need to be in a position where the State is no longer the majority shareholder.  We will have different political and ideological reasons regarding why that should be the case.  The most pressing point is that we are in a situation where the wealth of the State in owning a share in a large bank is dependent on what happens with movements in share prices.  Overall, I believe those who should own a bank and those who should be investing in a bank and taking the risk of owning a bank should be private citizens and the financial markets, not the State.  Precious taxpayer resources are better served in the provision of public services rather than in the ownership of a bank.  Some of the policy objectives Deputy Barry and I would agree on are better achieved through regulation rather than ownership.  The Central Bank is an independent regulator of the bank.</p></speech>

It is not new or breaking news that the Government favours privatisation of this bank.  It is also not breaking news, I suspect, that I am opposed to privatisation of this bank.  The Minister mentioned two milestones, namely, majority private ownership of the bank and full private ownership of the bank.  When would the Minister hope to have achieved those two milestones?</p></speech>

We still own in excess of 70% of AIB.  There are quite a few bridges to cross before we get anywhere near the State no longer being the largest shareholder in the bank.  There will be many more decisions required after that before the bank is in private ownership.  It is very difficult for me to put a timeframe on that.  It depends on so many variables such as what would be the price of the equity of the bank in the future and what future Ministers and Governments may decide to do.</p></speech>

It is possible that further decisions could be made that would lead to a reduction in the shareholding of the bank.  As to whether we would get to below 50%, I prefer not to speculate on that for now given that we are currently involved in a slow and gradual process of selling shares.</p></speech>

Those arguments and policy differences have been well ventilated and well rehearsed.  There is one thing that we do agree on, namely, that companies which evidently did not need this level of State support through the wage subsidy schemes should pay it back.  Does the Minister have any sense of how many such firms have voluntarily repaid at this point and how much in total has been recovered in this respect?</p></speech>

As to whether any companies have indicated an intention to do that again in the future, I am not currently aware of it.  I should emphasise - I know the Deputy will be aware of this - that would be something they would indicate to the Revenue Commissioners rather than to me.</p> <p>  I now have the information.  To date, 402 employers have repaid all of the subsidies in full.  The value of that is &euro;52 million.  Some 3,331 employers have made partial repayments, which is approximately &euro;54 million.  Overall, &euro;106 million has been repaid, with 3,500 employers involved.</p></speech>

It would be some employers who repaid the subsidy due to ineligibility, that is, they either reached a view that they were ineligible or, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, that view was reached, and some employers who voluntarily repaid the subsidy.  For example, there are employers that continue to meet the Revenue threshold of being 30% or more down but did find themselves in a position where they were profitable due to the changes that may have happened in their operating model.  There are two reasons the money would have been returned.</p></speech>

Some firms have returned some money and others have gone public stating that they do not require it and have returned it to the State.  Am I correct in saying that other firms, through the Revenue compliance programme, have returned significant sums?

It may not be available because when employers made a decision to return a payment, they were not required to indicate to the Revenue why they did so.  I will inquire as to whether I can shed any further light on the question, but my expectation is that I will not be able to do so.  When money was returned to Revenue, employers were not required to say why they were doing it.</p></speech>

That issue has been well debated, especially over the past few weeks.  It would be important from a public policy point of view, and it is in the public interest, that Revenue would be asked to undertake an audit of firms on the schemes that have paid out dividends.  That information would be available in the normal course of Revenue's work and the records that it has access to.  That would be evident as well in the annual company accounts filed in the office of the CRO.  Has the Minister considered asking the Revenue Commissioners to undertake an audit to establish which firms on the scheme have paid out dividends and the value of that money?</p></speech>

We have to remember that when we set up this scheme, the key threshold that we put in place was business turnover.  We did not have an indication in relation to profitability or dividends because of the expectations that we had regarding what a difficult period it would be for employers.</p></speech>

I have argued over the last two years, along with my colleagues in the Labour Party, for the attachment of significant labour, social, economic and environmental conditions and it would be important for the Minister to continue to reflect on that.  He has said that it may be the case that a form of short-time work scheme will evolve out of the EWSS to support sectors that may be impacted over the next year or two.  Inevitably, for some sectors the recovery will be uneven and supports will be required.  In that context, it is important for the Minister to keep this entire question under review because we need to ensure that we get value for money from these kinds of State investments and that we use these huge transfers of public money into private hands to drive better outcomes for working people and society more generally.</p> <p>  At the outset, in his response to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, the Minister said that he anticipated low levels of dividend payments in the case of firms that benefited from the wage subsidy schemes.  The truth is that we simply do not know how many firms have decided to pay out dividends to their shareholders and how many have decided not to do so.  It would be very useful for the Revenue Commissioners to undertake the kind of audit I suggested and if it is the case that the Minister is considering keeping under review the question of attaching forms of conditionality to any successor schemes that might emerge, then from a public policy point of view and in the interests of the taxpayer, that would be important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#E00300"><p>I differ strongly from Deputy Nash in one respect.  He referred to the transfer of public money into private hands but that was done with the purpose of keeping people in work.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who have a job today who would not have one without the EWSS.  In fairness to Deputy Nash and the Labour Party, they have recognised that by their support for the legislation.  Deputy Nash has acknowledged this at other points.  However, the description of it as a transfer of public money into private hands needs to be completed with an acknowledgement that it has worked in keeping people in jobs.  When we put the various schemes in place, it was with the reasonable anticipation of very low levels of profitability occurring during a pandemic.  It is an open question as to whether it would be appropriate to put in place further conditionality at a time in which the very viability of employers was threatened.</p> <p>  I wish to make two concluding points on this topic.  If a company is profitable enough to make a dividend payment but we put in place a restriction to say that when a company is participating in the EWSS, it cannot pay that dividend, then the profit will just stay on the company's balance sheet.  When the company exits the EWSS, a dividend will be paid at that point.  If we are going to have a debate about dividend payments, we must also have a bigger debate about what kind of profit, if any, an employer should make when on the EWSS.  Finally, for employers that have got through the pandemic and are about to exit the EWSS entirely in the coming months, having a degree of profitability will, in general, help with the retention of jobs.  If we have employers who, in general, are on EWSS and are already at a loss or just about breaking even and then the supports they are on go, as the public health crisis recedes, then the jobs that Deputy Nash cares about and that the Labour Party has protected through supporting this legislation, will be further threatened.</p></speech>

This is taxpayers' money and, in many respects, borrowed money and we need to drive better outcomes.  The Minister and I have discussed at length over the last two years the singular and absolute importance of the two wage subsidy schemes as an intervention for saving viable jobs and supporting businesses.  It is an unprecedented investment and I make no apologies for ensuring that we get the best possible outcomes for the taxpayer, the public and citizenry more generally.</p> <p>  I have a question on AIB.  What consideration, if any, has the Minister given to rewarding staff employed at AIB for their professionalism, commitment and loyalty to the organisation in the context of any future sale of AIB shares?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#E00500"><p>The level of pay or recognition that AIB staff receive is a matter for the board of AIB rather than for the shareholder.  Whether it is a bank or any other organisation, how the staff are paid is a matter for the board of the company.  That said, I want to acknowledge that those who have worked in the front lines of our banks have played a really valuable role during this pandemic.  Lots of customers were going through a harsh and difficult time, including those who were not as used to accessing digital payments as others.  Those bank workers who kept branches working provided a very valuable service to their local communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#E00700"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening statement and for his responses to colleagues thus far.  To follow on from what has been said, I have three questions I wish to raise with the Minister.  The first relates to the EWSS and is somewhat retrospective at this stage.  I refer to the conditions that companies had to meet in order to qualify for the scheme and, in particular, the 30% drop in turnover condition.  The point was made to me by a number of hospitality businesses in my constituency that while they had a relatively good trading period between 1 and 19 December, when the 8 p.m. curfew was introduced, business dropped off.  They had to take into account their turnover between 1 and 19 December but the curfew continued into January.  A lot of businesses simply pulled down the shutters when the 8 p.m. curfew was announced.  I can think of three pubs and one restaurant in my village of Stepaside that did that because they did not want to run the risk.  Is there a lesson to be learned there in terms of flexibility so that the supports are most effective in keeping people in work?  What can be done for those businesses that kept the lights on and the doors open as much as possible?  A lot of businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, simply could not afford to close because customers would get used to not going to them.  It is a volatile sector and we knew that long before the pandemic hit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#E00800"><p>I understand and accept the point Deputy Richmond makes.  When we pick any performance threshold for being able to move on to what is a very valuable subsidy programme, there will always be some businesses that are just outside that threshold.  I know that at the end of last year there were companies that traded very well from September into December.  Things changed at the end of December but they were still trading better in terms of their turnover not being down by 30% in comparison with 2019.  I am not sure how many businesses were in that category but we have heard about some of them.</p><p>Unfortunately most companies in the hospitality sector did not have too much difficulty meeting the -30% performance level because of how tough trading was last year but there were a few outside of it.</p><p> On what could be done about it, I did not give a lot of in-depth consideration to changing the -30% level to make it easier for companies to come in because the 30% decline figure has been in place for over 18 months in the different wage subsidy schemes we have had in place.  I am aware that the longer we maintain these schemes it can create perverse incentives whereby it is safer for some employers to be on them than it is to continue trading because they have a guaranteed payment of up to &euro;350 per employee.  I am aware of that as a risk.</p></speech>

In many cases that was compounded for the businesses that attempted to stick it out, while we had issues with staff shortages and so on due to isolation periods.  It is something worth bearing in mind and I would hope there is an agreement that this year we might see the end of the EWSS or will be in a position to end it based on the roll-out of the pandemic.</p> <p>  I have two questions on AIB and timelines.  On the announced trading plan, can the Minister give any indication of what the duration of that might be or when he thinks it could be brought to a close?  On the trading plan for Bank of Ireland, the Minister said before that the target was extended to May 2022.  Is that still the case or is that under review?</p></speech>

It was also in recognition of the kind of issues the Deputy is referring to that we changed the CRSS.  I would expect that some or all of the businesses the Deputy is referring to that were not in a position to trade after 8 p.m. or that had their business significantly impacted by public health regulations could then move onto the CRSS, whereas a year ago they could only have moved onto that scheme if their premises were fully closed.  It was also in recognition of the issue the Deputy is raising that we maintained the subsidy rate at &euro;350.</p> <p>  I refer to the other two questions the Deputy has put to me.  Was the first question on AIB?</p></speech>

We learned from RT&Eacute; in the last week that the entire Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal resigned <i>en masse</i>in October.  Nobody in this committee was aware of this to my knowledge and Members of the Oireachtas were not aware of it.  This was seven months after the board met the Minister and told him about their dissatisfaction, that they could not stand over this scheme and criticised the lack of progress.  Now we have a scheme that is up in the air so the Minister needs to present himself before the committee on that.  Hopefully the committee will make time to have a proper and dedicated session on that.  I know that matter is not on the agenda for today but I wanted to raise it given the importance of this scheme and the fact that a whole board resigned and the Minister did not tell anybody.  That is a serious problem for a committee that is supposed to oversee the work of the Department and there are serious issues here.</p><p>I will start with the dividends and I think the Minister is wrong on this.  This should never have happened and it is taxpayers' money.  The EWSS and its predecessor are valued and welcome schemes and without them we know the impact there would have been on companies and jobs; that goes without saying.  However, in March 2020 before the scheme was ever envisaged, I wrote to the Minister and spoke about how we needed to bring forward a scheme to support employers and employees.  As part of that communication I said it was crucial that this could not be a subsidy to shareholders through dividends.  The Government brought forward a scheme and rushed legislation through.  We know the importance of it and why it was rushed but the Minister&rsquo;s counterpart in Britain ensured that dividends could not be paid out and the ECB ensured that banks could not pay dividends out.</p><p>If one takes O&rsquo;Flaherty Holdings, for example, which is involved in Mercedes-Benz, it received &euro;1.8 million in taxpayer support to its company and it paid out dividends to its Isle of Man shareholders of &euro;1.8 million.  That was a transfer of taxpayers&rsquo; money to shareholders in the Isle of Man and that should not have happened.  The Minister should recognise that there was a mistake and flaw in the design of that scheme.  To say we are keeping this under review is just political speak which seeks to get over this hump.  That should never have happened.  The Minister is suggesting that if it did not pay out the dividends this year it would have done so in two or three years&rsquo; time but that is not necessarily the case.  For example, nobody knew how the pandemic would continue.  Why did the ECB place a ban on all Irish and European banks paying dividends for 2020 and up to the third quarter of 2021?</p></speech>

The answer that I imagine it would give is that it did so in recognition of the liquidity support it was making available to those banks.</p></speech>

Likewise, those companies should not have been allowed to pay out dividends at a time when they were receiving important money that the State needed.  The Minister allowed that to happen and others did not.  The Dutch Minister of Finance put in a ban, as did the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Other Ministers across Europe did the same but the Minister has allowed this to happen.  Does the Minister accept at this late stage that this was a mistake?  Did any official in his Department give the Minister advice or guidance that this ban should be in place?</p></speech>

A big feature of why our schemes have worked in the way they have is the only two features for accessing them have been where a company is with turnover and where it is with compliance.  Behind that the company will have been impacted by public health regulations.  The low level of cases in which dividends have been paid in a way that is of concern to the Deputy and to the committee indicate that few companies were able to do it across this period.  The Deputy has named a taxpayer, which I will not do.  Can the Deputy tell me how many people that taxpayer employs?</p></speech>

That taxpayer has been named by <i>The Irish Times</i>and its accounts are public.  On the number of people who were retained in employment because of the EWSS, the answer is zero because all of the &euro;1.8 million that went into that company through the EWSS was paid to the Isle of Man parent company in dividends.  It is nearly the same amount; &euro;1.76 million, which is nearly equivalent to what was paid in State supports.  The Minister could have introduced this here because the furlough scheme was successful and the Dutch scheme was successful.  Does the Minister know how many companies used this money to pay out dividends to shareholders?</p></speech>

He stated the issue is in the public domain.  That is a taxpayer who employs people.  There are people working for that company.  My first priority and objective during the pandemic with the employment wage subsidy scheme was to retain and create work when this pandemic hit.

The Minister asked a question.  I pointed it out to him.  If he wants to blame me for his failures as a finance Minister, he can go ahead.  I wrote to him stating that the scheme should be designed in such a way as to ensure the supports would not go to dividends or shareholders.  I also raised the issue of profitable companies hoarding this money.  If he is satisfied with the idea that a company can avail of scarce taxpayers' money and pay it all out in dividends, that is okay.  I recognise that Sinn F&eacute;in called for a scheme such as this.  We supported the scheme because of its value.  However, that does not justify the fact that the Government did not do what many other governments did, which was to introduce a condition preventing this money being paid to shareholders.  The Minister can argue that they wanted to keep it simple.  If some people decided not to go into the scheme for that reason, so be it.  They got valuable State support and all they had to do was not pay it out to their shareholders.</p></speech>

That is not a luxury that was open to me when I was dealing with the threat of a mass unemployment crisis.  At no point in the exchange we had did I seek to attribute to him responsibility for failures I may or may not have.  The case I am robustly making is that by any independent evaluation of the employment wage subsidy scheme, it has played a massive role-----</p></speech>

He is creating an inference that I am seeking to prioritise the wealthy in any scheme that I bring in.  The reality, however, is that this scheme was brought in to save jobs and it has been successful in doing so.  I refer to the assertion I made and stand over - it is my view that if we brought in a criterion relating to dividend issues, dividend payments could be deferred at a point in the future.  It is also my view that having an access condition for the scheme that is based on profitability would have been inappropriate and would have undermined the operation of the scheme.  When some companies exit the scheme, they will have a low level of profitability or might be making a bit more profit than they expected.  They will need that when they exit the scheme and its supports are removed.  The Deputy cannot state how many people are working for the employer in question.  It is to the people who are working for that employer that I have primary responsibility.</p></speech>

The Minister cannot say how many companies actually paid out dividends.  He cannot state how much money allocated in State support was paid out to shareholders through dividends because he never asked for that information and it is not a condition.  This has nothing to do with profitability.  What Britain and the Netherlands did was not about profitability; it was a ban on paying out dividends.  I am just saying the Minister made a mistake on the facts.  The annual accounts of companies show that in some cases 100% of the money they received through the pandemic payments went to shareholders offshore.  That was never the intention.  I am sure it was not the intention of the Minister.  I am just trying to point out that he made a mistake.  We pointed this out in written correspondence and on Second Stage.  It was a mistake and it needs to be dealt with in the context of any supports going forward.</p> <p>  I refer to the issue of business interruption claims.  The Minister stated that he had received legal advice that he could not reclaim this money from insurance companies.  Was he personally involved in this?  If so, from whom did he get that legal advice?</p></speech>

I am, however, in a position to tell him the number of employers that returned money to the scheme due to decisions they made or because they were not able to comply with the criteria of the scheme I set up.  The sum in question is &euro;104 million.  That shows that the design of the scheme and the reaction of many employers to it did work.</p> <p>  As regards his point in respect of from whom we received the advice, it was from the legal unit within my Department.  As to whether I have been made aware of the advice, I have been made aware of it.</p></speech>

I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, state on a radio programme that he wanted to find out how British insurance companies were not deducting these payments.  The Minister is aware that it was not even 2021, but 2020 when the Association of British Insurers wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury and announced that 12 insurance companies, many of which operate here, would not be deducting certain pandemic payments from business interruption claims.  These companies include Allianz, Zurich, Aviva, RSA and Axa.  They are all operating here.  What has the Minister done?  Has he asked any of these companies why they are not deducting these grants and supports from business interruption claims in Britain, and in Newry, Derry, Belfast and the Bogside, but are doing so in Donegal, Dublin, Kerry and Cork?</p></speech>

As regards communication we have had with them directly on this matter, this has happened through Insurance Ireland.  The Minister of State and the Department contacted Insurance Ireland to make clear our concerns on this issue.  That happened last year as this issue developed.  The Central Bank has issued guidance on the general matter of the operation of business interruption schemes.</p></speech>

That legislation only asks the Central Bank to give the Minister a report on how much the insurance companies have pocketed in pandemic unemployment payments.  That is all it does.  It is a report to find out how much they took of the pandemic unemployment payments.  It does not deal with the issue.  We had an issue many years ago in respect of bankers and bonuses.  There were contractual obligations between the financial institutions and the employees such that we could not step in and disrupt that contact between the financial institutions and the bankers.</p><p>We could not stop bonuses being paid to them but we were able to, in effect, stop the bonuses being paid to them by introducing a surcharge on tax.  Why do we not, for example, use that same mechanism and place a surcharge on the insurance companies to the value of the amount of pandemic payments they have deducted in regard to business interruption claims, thereby, de facto, recouping that money to the State?</p></speech>

Earlier, the Deputy asked me what action I took.  When I tell him what the action was, he dismisses it as a joke.  He had already decided to dismiss it as a joke before I gave him my answer.  In regard to what more I am going to do, the Deputy is interested in a headline.  If I make a commitment in regard to action, it is action that I have to take.  As a Minister, it is appropriate to see how this matter concludes in our courts first.  As to my view in regard to this money, I do not want to be in a position where taxpayers funding is in any way being used to subsidise payments in the way I have described but, equally, the guidance I received on this matter is that I can only handle it in a prospective manner and I cannot do it retrospectively.</p> <p>  The Deputy has made the case that we should be taxing these insurance companies.  If we were to do so, we would be one of the few jurisdictions that are making the decision to tax the insurance sector more.  This is the same sector that we want present in our country, providing coverage to employers at lower prices and providing coverage to all parts of our economy.  Can the Deputy not see the tension between the two objectives?  Can he not see the tension if someone is running a large insurance company globally and they have made the decision to headquarter a business here in Ireland, providing hundreds of valuable jobs?  Does he not see that if the reaction to an issue that a Government may have is to tax that company more, it could have other consequences?</p></speech>

If I was in the Minister's seat, I would not have let the last year and a half pass without meeting a single insurance company or Insurance Ireland about business interruption.  I would not have allowed that to happen.  I would have asked them directly why their companies are taking some of our pandemic payments here when they are not taking them in the North, in Wales, in Scotland or in England.  I would ask those questions.  I would say to them that they need to hand that money back or, otherwise, we will bring in a pandemic surcharge only on that money in order to get that money back for the State.  That money was given to those companies to keep other companies afloat.  In fairness to the companies, they are not saying they want cover from the insurance provider and from the State.  They are saying the money should go back to the State.  The Minister is just taking a hands-off approach here, and that is the problem.  A year and a half later, asking for a report that is going to be delivered next year on how much money they took is a joke.  I have made my mind up on that.  It is a joke.  It is a waste of this committee's time.  I am sure that if the Minister wrote to the Central Bank, it would give him that information.  Having to go through five Stages of legislation in the D&aacute;il and another five Stages in the Seanad for that is a joke and a waste of our time.  Does the Minister want the insurance companies to hand this money back?  I ask him that simple question.</p></speech>

Of course, I want to be in a position so that, if taxpayers&rsquo; money has been used in a way to underpin a payment that has been made, that money is returned to the State.  As I said, however, in my view, that can only be done legally in a prospective manner.</p> <p>  What I find extraordinary about the outburst from Deputy Doherty is that he referred to my appearance as being a waste of his time and he said the answer I am giving is a joke.  Every time I am invited to come to this committee, I come in at the first opportunity, every single time.  I am here now having received the invitation from this committee just last week, no doubt at Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s request.  I will continue to come in and do this because it is my obligation as a member of Government.</p> <p>  As I do that, it is equally important that I point out the inconsistencies and risks that the Deputy is bringing forward.

This has to go both ways.  In the exchange I had earlier, I made the point to the Deputy that a Government deciding that our answer to an issue we are facing is that we are going to tax the employer more brings risks to it.  The Deputy acknowledged that to me a moment ago when he said it does.  He acknowledged there are risks.  If we have large global insurers that we want to provide more insurance here in Ireland, it is a risk if the answer to a difficulty that is there at the moment is to tax them more.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#H02000"><p>It is consistent.  Deputy Doherty is against the data centres and does not seem to acknowledge the point that data centres play a role in employment in our country.  He does not have a good word to say about any bank but when two banks leave Ireland, he is the first to criticise that.  Then, when we are here on the insurance companies, he wants more insurance at better prices with more insurers here in Ireland, and I do too, but his reaction to a difficulty with them is that we will tax them more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#H02100"><p>No.  I will move on but let me make this point.  The Minister is being completely misleading because he has no record to defend himself, and that is his problem.  I am not talking about a broad tax on insurance companies.  I am saying that the portion of profit they have deducted due to the pandemic payments should be recovered by the State and, on that, the Minister should be meeting them, he should be asking them and he should be talking to them face to face.  If they do not hand it over, then the other option is to do it in the exact same way we did with the bankers' bonuses, which is just on that unique amount.  That is what I am saying.</p> <p>  By the way, the Minister had no problem retrospectively taxing every Tom, Dick and Harry who lost their job during the pandemic and was in receipt of the &euro;350 pandemic unemployment payment but, by God, he has got plenty of legal advice to hide behind when it comes to insurance companies pocketing tens of millions of euro of the same pandemic payments.</p> <p>  We are pressed for time.  I would not be selling AIB.  The last time AIB paid dividends, in 2019, it was &euro;329 million and it was &euro;232 million before that.  There is a value in keeping the shareholding in AIB and there is still a value in the shareholding itself.  Why now?  Why did the Minister take the decision now compared with 2017, for example, when the share price was twice as high as it is now, or 2018, when it was 70% higher?</p></speech>

The record I have to stand over is being Minister for Finance at the moment the pandemic hit and at the moment at which our country was dealing with Brexit.  Across that period, we have grown and maintained jobs in our country and we have protected the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I could go on to all of the other legislation that the Government has brought forward, for example, the guidelines with regard to personal injuries, and the other things the Government is also doing to respond to the issues we have with the insurance sector, but maybe we will leave that to another day.</p> <p>  To go on to the Deputy's question regarding AIB, I did so because it is my view that, across the medium term, there will be opportunities for us to regain money we have invested in our banks because of changes I anticipate happening in the valuation of banks and the general economic conditions of the country.  For this reason, I believed it was important to begin by selling a small share in that bank.</p></speech>

I understand that we have the right to raise questions and I compliment him on his responses.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether the issue that I want to raise is appropriate at this time.  It concerns banking in general in the sense that I, and I am sure that the same is true for everybody else, have received expressions of concern from constituents about the extent to which banks remain available to their customers and the public.  We have moved from a situation where during the Celtic tiger era the banks were in their customers' ears advising and encouraging them to go further afield and go overboard, in terms of borrowing and spending unwisely, to a situation where the banks have withdrawn and now exist behind screens.  So there are now many closures of banks up and down the country and customers seem to have difficulty accessing a person of authority in the respective banks.  I am not certain that such a situation is a good thing and it could be a dangerous practice as time goes by.  Is it appropriate to raise this matter with the Minister now and for him to raise this matter with the various banks or should I wait until representatives of the banks are before the committee again?</p></speech>

I am very much aware that there are concerns regarding customer access and ability to access the kind of local decision-makers.  This is something that we are considering in the context of the banking review.</p> <p>  In terms of the engagement that I have had with banks directly on the matter, I have had engagement with the banks on the matter when I have met the CEOs.  The issue that I have brought up is around access to local services and local decision-makers, particularly for SME loans.</p></speech>

The banks complain from time to time about the reserve requirement with which the banks in this country must comply.  How does the reserve requirement in this country compare with that in banks across Europe?</p></speech>

The reason they are higher is because of the requirement that our Central Bank has, and the ECB has, for our banks to hold a high share of capital in the context of the consequences of the banking crisis a decade ago.  So they are higher and the reason for that is that the level of capital one is required to hold is judged by looking backwards over a number of years, and that number of years lens includes the aftermath of our banking crisis.</p></speech>

I agree and understand the reasons.</p> <p>  I am concerned lest the practice continues indefinitely and for too long a duration on the basis that it could impact on the efficiency and efficacy of the banking system here for an unnecessary long period.  Is it evident that our banking system here has learned from its mistakes in the past and is willing to ensure that there is no repetition of what happened during the Celtic tiger era?  Can the Minister, in any way, extract from the banks an indication that what happened in the past was wrong, is not going to be repeated and does not require the reserve in terms of the ECB and the Central Bank of Ireland?</p> <p>  We accept the fact that we had to be punished and the people, banks and businesses were punished.  There were huge losses all over the country in almost every sector and the following questions now arise.  Is it wise to continue that attrition into the future?  More importantly, how long will the punishment continue?</p></speech>

What we are discussing here, and what the Deputy is questioning me on, is how much capital the banks are required to hold and why.  As I said, they do hold a higher level of capital than their European peers.  In fairness, to describe that as punishment, if that is what the Deputy is doing, is not a term I would use.  While I do accept that the level of capital that they are holding does have other consequences, we have also just gone through an extraordinary economic shock and our banks and financial sector did have the resilience to withstand that shock due to the level of capital they held combined with the employment wage subsidy schemes that we put in place.  While I think there is a debate ongoing regarding the level of capital that our banks hold, I believe we saw the value of higher level of capital at a time in which we shut down our domestic economy at so many different points and it did not travel into a big difficulty in our banking sector.</p></speech>

Let me put it on record that my family business has benefited from nearly every scheme that has been mentioned today.  I am one of the 51,000 employees and one of the 25,000 premises that have availed of these schemes.  Without them my family business would not be alive today and would have folded.  I acknowledge the supports that have been provided to businesses.  They have kept a significant number of businesses afloat through a very challenging time.</p> <p>  Before Christmas, myself and Senator Maria Byrne raised an issue with the Minister related to businesses that operate on a seasonal basis accessing the EWSS.  They had to de-register from the EWSS and could not re-register in January.  I acknowledge the changes that the Minister made to the scheme to allow seasonal hospitality sectors to re-avail of the EWSS and changes were made to turnover.</p> <p>  My company has lodged money into the tax warehousing scheme and we borrowed significantly more money over the last period to keep afloat.  Many small family businesses will have built up an historical debt, which will be an ongoing challenge into the future.  What is the level of debt now?  How many businesses have availed of the warehousing scheme?  Perhaps the Minister can give me the information.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022011900002#K00100"><p>Rather than having questions, I have a concern about the viability of many businesses moving forward as we emerge from the pandemic because of built-up debt and so on.  The viability of the hospitality sector has changed significantly.  Some 300 or 400 pubs have not reopened their doors and might never do so.  It is a very challenging time for us as a sector to survive and get back to where we were in 2019.</p> <p>  I was going to get into the debate on the dividends issue but I will tie it in to the insurance debate.  We eventually proved we had a claim for business interruption and, a year and a half later, we are still going through the process, which is frustrating.  I can understand the frustration out there.  I am not fond of the insurance companies but there has to be a balance.  Some businesses, luckily, had access to the business interruption loan scheme, which allowed them to make a claim, but others did not have that available.  The EWSS, to a certain extent, brought a level of support in all sectors.  If the insurance companies are going to deduct the State supports from my claim, I will accept that because the State supported my company.  If it had not done that and an insurance company had paid my company the equivalent of the State support &ndash; I return to the issues of profitability and dividends - should I then pay back the State the support it gave me?</p> <p>  There is a lot of roundabout stuff.  My greatest concern, as a business operator whose insurance has increased by 250% in six years, relates to what impact this will have on my renewal premium in respect of my claim and how it will affect that, as well as on the other businesses it will affect.  This is not about dividends but rather profitability, if we are going to measure it on anything.</p> <p>  This was a huge roll-out of State support, as the Minister said.  What we are looking for moving forward is a scheme that is much more flexible and specifically targeted.  Perhaps, if the scheme had been targeted before, some of these larger companies that probably did not need it might not have been in a position to avail of it.  Will the Minister comment on that?  We are not yet out of Covid and restrictions could return in the summer.  It was difficult before Christmas to target the EWSS to the sectors directly affected by the Government's decision.  Does the Minister foresee a more flexible and targeted scheme?  If that had been in place, perhaps some of these larger corporations would not have availed of it.</p></speech>

The answer is &euro;2.9 billion, relating to 98,000 individual businesses.  It comprises &euro;1.36 billion in VAT and &euro;1.4 billion of employers' PAYE.  Clearly, the warehoused sum is large.</p> <p>  On the future of supports, as I have said many times in the Oireachtas, we have to get to a point where the change in public health regulations will allow us to exit these schemes entirely.  I reiterate the point I made to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  The State is now paying the wages, or a large share of the wages, of one in 12 workers in the economy.  At the right time, and still in a careful way, we will have to bring that to an end.  It is not tenable for us to be in a position whereby there are many employers that cannot get the workers they need while, at the same time, we are paying a large share of the wages of other employers, particularly at a time when public health regulations could be at a very low level in future.</p> <p>  Insofar as the public health regulations allow it, therefore, we will continue with our plan to exit the employment wage subsidy scheme.  The first lower payment will issue on 1 February and we will have to see where we are next week with regard to the advice we get from the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, and how the Government responds to it.  Beyond the future of the EWSS, as for what the future could hold, the Senator makes a fair point, namely, that while we all hope it will not happen, we have seen the way in which this disease can return quickly.  We are aware of how circumstances may change in future.  My short to medium-term priority relates to how, when public health conditions allow it, we will exit what we have at the moment.  We will then give consideration to whether better schemes are available for the future that will build on what we have done well and that will allow us to build on the insights and learning we have developed in order that, if we find ourselves in a position in future whereby new public health measures are in place and parts of our economy are very adversely affected due to public health regulations that are in place, we might have more agile ways of responding.  That is something we will consider.</p></speech>

I thank him also for the supports that were provided.  While I am not directly involved in our family business and have nothing to do with it, I am very aware from small or niche businesses that have availed of these supports, which have certainly helped to keep them afloat.  Many of the questions I had prepared are similar to those asked by Senator Casey and I will not repeat them because the Minister answered them.  The current legislation allows for the supports to be in place until the end of January.  Does the Minister envisage they will end then or will they be phased out?</p> <p>  Two banks have left Ireland within the past 12 months or are in the process of doing so.  Are there plans within the Department to create competition in the financial markets to ensure consumers will be better served in light of the fact two banks will have left?</p></speech>

We are not going to move to a position whereby the payments will fall from &euro;350 for some workers to zero.  The plan we have, as it is currently legislated for, although I do have the ability to vary much of it by ministerial order, is that we will move from &euro;350, to &euro;203, to &euro;100, at which point the payments will be phased out.  We are scheduled to do that all the way up to April.  While I very much hope the public health conditions will facilitate us in implementing that plan, we will have to see the advice from NPHET and the consequential Government decision on that.</p><p> The Senator's second question was on the presence of banks and whether new retail banks would enter Ireland.  At the moment, the overall trend among European and global banks is not, in many cases, to move into new markets.  For the foreseeable future, I anticipate any new financial service that is provided in Ireland to come through non-traditional financial service providers, that is, companies providing services through the use of technology as opposed to branches.  The Senator is aware that some companies began doing this in recent years.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for listening to us on the day.</p> <p>  There is a requirement that business be down 30%.  Traditionally, the months of January and February are quiet for many businesses.  Will the 30% decrease be compared with the same week in 2019, for example?  Some businesses might be down just under the 30% but their turnovers are low because January and February are traditionally quiet months.  Is there any way for this to be considered?  Some businesses might be in trouble if there is not a degree of flexibility.</p></speech>

I will impart a key message regarding the future of these schemes across 2022: as public health regulations allow and as we get to a point where our economy is able to normalise and businesses are able to have more normal trading conditions for longer, the Government will have to decide how to conclude these schemes, not how to continue them.  I will give the committee a sense of scale.  In December alone, the EWSS was in excess of &euro;400 million, the direct employer payment part of it was just over &euro;372 million and the PRSI forgone element was &euro;54 million.  In December, the EWSS received &euro;426 million in taxpayer funding.  That money was needed and had a positive impact.  While we do not want anyone to have to move on to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and we hope that people can stay in work, the Senator will be aware that the number of people who moved onto it was lower than we expected, which shows the value of the EWSS.  As opposed to thinking about how more employers can get onto it, though, we will have to move towards continuing the conclusion of the programme at the right time and when the public health regulations allow, just as the Government has tried to do with the PUP.</p></speech>

Throughout the Covid crisis, there has always been some section of enterprise that has been left out of Government supports.  At one stage, it was the taxi drivers.  At another, it was barristers because they did not have business rates.  Last year, circuses were left out.  What about the pantomime sector?  The Liberty Panto does not tick all of the boxes that the Government has created.  For example, it does not have two years of history.  Nonetheless, it has made investments.  Now, it is making a loss as a result of the Government's decision.  Surely it should be getting supports, too.  Does the Minister agree that it is wrong that the Government would stop businesses like Liberty Panto from functioning in order to recoup their investments but then not provide them with proper support?</p></speech>

The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland has stated that approximately 40,000 jobs will not exist in 2022 that did exist in 2019.</p> <p>  The elephants in the room are the 8 p.m. closing time for hospitality and theatre and other performance arts and the Covid pass.  When will these measures come to an end?  The Minister is likely to say "When NPHET says so", but when does he believe they could come to an end?  Thankfully, Omicron has not been as damaging as projected and all the key indicators are falling, yet we have a Government saying that it will probably be 31 March before these restrictions are lifted fully.  For many who are warehousing their taxes because they cannot pay them fully, who have lost their jobs or who have had their incomes radically reduced, the idea of only being fully clear of restrictions on 31 March is hard to take.</p></speech>

The legal ability is there for some of them to be in place up to 31 March but I hope that, if the trends of the past number of days continue over the coming days, we will be in a position to act on many of these regulations before then.  As to when that will be, I will wait to say.  We will probably have a Cabinet meeting on this matter on Friday and we will have NPHET's advice before then.</p></speech>

That takes us up to the end of March 2023.  The Revenue Commissioners will then put in place plans to agree with taxpayers as to how those warehoused taxes can be paid during that period.

I apologise that I was late; I was attending another committee meeting.  I understand the Chair will want to ask questions as well, so I will stick to asking one question.</p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, has rules with regard to mergers, the level of concentration they cause and how they affect competition.  This measure of market concentration is called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, HHI.  According to this index, in a highly concentrated market, a post-merger increase of less than 150 is unlikely to cause concern.  Obviously, therefore, a figure of over 150 would cause concern.  By their own measure, if there were to be a merger of Bank of Ireland and KBC, it would increase this index by 600, or four times the passable threshold.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on whether that would be compliant with the CCPC's own rules?  Would it be an issue of concern?</p></speech>

I categorically cannot make any assessment of or offer a view on that matter, while the CCPC is evaluating a very important commercial transaction.  That is a matter for another day and one for the CCPC to answer.  It would not be appropriate for me to give a view on it.  It begs a question of Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and her party, however.  If they are not in favour of AIB or Bank of Ireland owning KBC or the loan books that will become available as KBC exits the market, who do they support owning them?</p></speech>

We received a submission from the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the VAT being charged between principal dentists and associates.  It has to do with the VAT on services.

That comes into play now in terms of those standards and the sale of AIB.  Will the Minister ensure that when AIB is reporting its financial position to the potential shareholders, the information will align itself with the law and not with the current interpretation of the international financial reporting standards?  This issue has cropped up from time to time as to how these standards are interpreted.  I want to get the Minister's view on this relative to the AIB sale.</p> <p>  I have a final question that I hope the Minister will address.  The State owns 71% of AIB.  Recently in the courts, AIB and EBS settled a case with a tied agent.  There is a confidentiality clause, I presume, attached to the outcome of that case and the settlement involved.  Some 20 witnesses on the side of the tied agency were to come forward in that case.  They would have had similar circumstances and experiences.  If this court case had been heard and its outcome had been a successful one for the tied agents, it would have stood as a baseline for others to be tested against.  That now cannot happen because of the confidentiality issue and because AIB and EBS have closed down and dealt with only one of the agents.  However, there are many more agents.  Is the Minister not concerned that, in informing stakeholders of legacy issues in particular, this matter will probably not even be referred to and, also, that there are, or were, tied agents who have still not had their grievance heard in an open way by EBS and AIB?</p> <p>  I have always endeavoured to try to get the banks to the point where they would at least mediate in some way.  However, that has not happened.  While the case did not come to trial, now that the sides have seen the case and have all their documentation and so on, does this not provide an opportunity to look at how this settlement was reached on the steps of the court, assess each individual case of the tied agents involved and come to some resolution?  It has gone on and on.</p> <p>  The committee have raised this case with AIB, which insists that it represents EBS and will not let the principal people in EBS appear before us.  I can partially understand that but I fully understand the side of the EBS tied agents.  The public gallery was full of these agents at one of our meetings.  Since then, their numbers have dropped because some members of the group have died.  That is the way life is.  However, for those who are left, surely something must be done?  I am not asking the Minister, with the State's 71% shareholding, to influence the outcome.  However, surely to God, as the main shareholder, the State should at least request the bank to be open and transparent about that legacy issue which is causing so much pain and grief for the people involved and their families.  Now that the court case is finished, let us see if EBS will do it.</p></speech>

By way of conclusion, I listened to the debate around the Covid cover from insurance companies.  The companies funded the test case.  Here, we have a similar situation in that a group in this case is at odds with EBS and AIB and there has been a case.  Can it now be examined and measured against each of the individual agents concerned to see if some form of settlement can be mediated with each one?  I think that is fair.  That is all I am asking.</p></speech>

At this point, however, given how long this has been going on and some of the difficulties involved in it, I again acknowledge his involvement and interest in it.

We have a unique position with regard to the Gaeltacht in that we are an urban authority and do not have legislative discretion to ring-fence specific areas, housing or aspects such as that, specifically for Irish speakers, because we would be challenged with other groups which would claim a right to live in the city and be cross-subsidised in that manner as well.</p> <p>  We alluded to the aspect on land use.  We provide for land-use zoning for housing and it is open for all.  It is not a case of what one would have in a rural area where there are restrictive policies on housing. That may be a challenge for Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht, because of the limitations and restrictive policies by virtue of which there are few opportunities for acquiring housing.</p> <p>  If Deputy Calleary is asking about our ideas on expanding the language in a social, education and community context, we suggest we continue what we are doing, which we do quite well, especially with regard to the educational institutes.  We enabled both Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh and Col&aacute;iste na Coiribe to find schools and good sites that accommodate a school population of up to 650, in the case of Col&aacute;iste na Coiribe, and the same with Gaelscoil Mhic Amhlaigh in terms of allowing for the extension of that school.</p><p>We went further than we would have on a lot of occasions in the sense that we went as far as the material contravention process, which is over and above the standard planning consent process.  That school is not actually located in the Gaeltacht.  It is located outside of it but it has a catchment area in the Gaeltacht, so that is a recognition of the bilingual aspect.</p><p> We would welcome more grants and an increase in the number of grants available for protected structures and things that truly reflect the cultural aspect of the city.  We have 700 protected structures in the city but the number of conservation grants we get for their maintenance is quite limited.</p><p> I think we are doing a very good job with the placenames' committee of the council, on which our colleague Ms Coleman sits.  That endeavour has been going on since 1992 and would have spearheaded other such initiatives throughout the country.  As a result of that, 90% of residential developments within the city have an address solely in Irish.  That is commendable from the planning side as well.</p><p> We are doing the maximum we can within the body of the land use plan but there are limitations.  We go outside that with regard to our partnership with Gaillimh le Gaeilge in particular, and many sections in the council, including our own, have very good relationships with Gaillimh le Gaeilge.  The city council itself subsidises elements of that organisation, and as a result of the recent plan, it has now attracted a significant amount of money to engineer its actions.  What we can do with respect to that is enable it as much as possible through the planning process.  In the city there are mediums for sustaining and encouraging the extension of the language, including cultural and educational aspects, as well as through the community element with regard to provision of facilities or subsidies so they can sustain themselves.</p><p> With regard to institutions such as &Aacute;ras na nGael and An Taibhdhearc and maintaining their existing buildings, it is great they have buildings with historic status as it sends a message about the cultural aspect and are in appropriate locations.  However, they need to be modernised and brought up to standard with regard to digital communication and the capacity to teach Irish on a digital platform.  There are other innovative ways technology can accelerate or broaden that process.</p><p> Investment in infrastructure may be an oblique way of supporting the Gaeltacht.  This has been vindicated in the work done by Gaillimh le Gaeilge in its document "The economic benefits associated with the Irish language which accrue to Galway City and to the Galway Gaeltacht".  That demonstrates that a lot of the services and infrastructure, particularly with regard to transport, which would allow people to have a reasonable, sociable commute to the city and do whatever business they like, are a regional provision.  Many of the services we provide cannot be provided in a lower density population, but if people can access them quickly and if they are housed in appropriate institutions, then that of itself would reciprocally sustain the Gaeltacht area and allow people the liberty to live within either the city Gaeltacht or the county Gaeltacht, which, as has been noted, is the largest Irish-language speaking place in the country.  Other than that I do not have any brilliant ideas, I am afraid.</p></speech>

I get all that and I get the need for extra grants to protect the 700 structures, but Galway has a unique status.  Galway is the capital city of the Gaels.  It is a regional city but it is also the capital city of Gaeilge and an Ghaeltacht.  It is all very well to encourage and facilitate commuting, but let us also have the ambition to encourage people who use Irish as their daily language to live in the city.  If Galway City Council led on that, it would give courage to other cities to do similar.  It is all very well to depend on the county Gaeltacht but that faces different planning challenges, as we have heard from witnesses from the county council.  What we as a committee are trying to do is look at the blockages with regard to the Gaeltacht, Gaeilge and its daily usage.  Planning has been identified as one of those blockages.  We need the city council of the capital of our Gaeltacht region to be ambitious and push the boat out to facilitate, encourage and go the extra mile.  I know it has done that with Col&aacute;iste na Coiribe and other educational projects, but let us go over and above that to allow people who use Gaeilge as their daily language of choice to live in the city.  Let us go over and above and push the boat out to be the city council that wants a predominantly Irish-speaking city.  Of course, every other culture would be part of that as well.</p> <p>  How many planners on the city council have Irish and use it as their daily language when engaging with potential clients?</p></speech>

We have to remember the city is the most multicultural location in the country, so I do not know how we could do that constitutionally with regard to housing, for example.  We are open to ideas and it is the Legislature that would make the provision for that.</p></speech>

That is the work this committee is doing.  The witnesses are the ones dealing with this issue day to day.  They are engaging with developers in the case of the city council, and their colleagues in the county authority are dealing with potential homeowners and so on.  Based on their day-to-day interactions as planners, if they have the ambition to do this, they must have ideas as well.  I am sure the Chairman and the clerk will facilitate them forwarding those ideas to us in writing.</p></speech>

We have an e-portal site that the draft plan will be on.  It is the first time we have used an e-portal and we use dual language in that regard.  If anyone wants to avail of services or conduct their business in Irish, we have that capacity and that facility.  We also receive applications in Irish and responses and decisions are given in Irish.  I am not saying that is tokenistic but it is done on that basis.  Galway city is embedded as a bilingual city and it is not unusual for us to hear that in a commercial capacity.  There is a certain pride with regard to it.  That is outside a planning context but we labour to get it more there in the visual aspect.  That is very important.  We want to normalise it, as we said in our documentation.  People being able to respond as to where they live geographically with an Irish address is a very strong overture which has been achieved through language planning.  There is a lot of co-operation based on that with regard to work with NUI Galway and Gaillimh le Gaeilge.  It is about taking up more of the language, heritage and the embedded historical legacies from those geographical areas as well.</p></speech>

There is no legal capacity on restricting housing for a special class of person, as there is in other areas.  Lands are zoned for housing predicated on a national direction under the national framework plan and not the regional spatial and economic strategy, RSES.  That is how urban plans are done.  There could be an argument that 10% of our population are persons with disability as well.  We have overtures from various persons making justifications about their right to housing, but there is a difference in an urban area and we are doing our best when it comes to land use.  The other point to remember is that not all of those areas in the Gaeltacht are zoned for housing either and a lot of them are quite sensitive in terms of the environment.  The geographical spread they have would attract other types of zoning, particularly if they are adjacent to areas of conservation etc.</p> <p>  The draft plan is due to go on public display by the end of the month.  It will be out for ten weeks for anybody to make a submission, either written, on the portal or whichever way suits them.  There will also be capacity to have an outreach and public consultation process, if it is possible with Covid.  When we do that in the Gaeltacht, we do it bilingually.  Knocknacarra Community Centre is usually our outreach place for that side of town.  Submissions can be made for ten weeks and then it will be back to the members of the council to deliberate on it.  If they have any other changes, those changes go back on public display.  The plan will be adopted towards the end of the year, but at the moment there is a ten-week period for anybody to make a submission.</p></speech>

We are quite restricted.  We have the national planning framework, NPF and the regional spatial and economic strategy, RSES, which is a new national regional spatial framework and we have to align with the requirements of those frameworks.  The development plan's policy is largely evolved from those two national and regional frameworks and section 28 guidelines issued by the Government.  We have been given significant direction as to what we can and cannot put into the development plan, but, certainly, if we allocated policy directly for Irish house inhabitants, we would not be able to do so in the current land-use zoning we have.</p> <p>  With regard to section 7.4 of the draft city development plan on bilingual cities, which seeks to "support and facilitate the development of infrastructure", we would have a two-year progress report, once the development plan has been adopted, which would outline how we have met that objective.  That could be through our cultural strategy of implementing projects or we have implementation of our public realm strategy, part of which is promotion of use of public realm spaces in the city for various projects.  We looked at some of those projects being for people who are resident in the Gaeltacht and come into the city centre for festivals such as the arts festival and that those would be Irish or bilingual.  It is a range of cultural projects we would have over the year.  We would monitor it through the two-year report on the implementation of the development plan objectives.</p></speech>

The function of the development plan is to facilitate and be a catalyst.  Our prime function is not to monitor the usage of the Irish language.  It is a shared role as well.  No single body can deliver it and that comes across from publications.  It is shared between education, arts and culture and between Galway city, as a Galway city corporate body, and even our chamber of commerce.  There is a very receptive environment to promote it as much as possible within that realm, because it is also seen as quite attractive economically.  It gives us a distinctiveness from a tourist viewpoint.</p> <p>  The other point is sustainability.  It is not just for function as the Gaeltacht main service town.  It is very important for us to continue and maintain the success and expansion of the city.  One of the main projects, which was brought at a previous meeting attended by my colleagues Liam Blake and Ailish Bhreathnach, was the cross-party support for projects such as the N6 in terms of accessibility.  That was one of the projects taken out.  That is a strategic objective within the development plan.  The logic behind that was not to alleviate congestion within the city, it was also to give access to the greater County Galway as well, and access in both directions.</p> <p>  Having strategic objectives to provide for, we have certain zones for community and infrastructure as I said, previously, with regard to education.  We have policies that promote education and especially with regard to NUI Galway.  We have a facilitating policy environment that allows for sustainability, as opposed to the idea of monitoring.  The point is about how the language is sustained and expanded.  There is a multiplicity of actions that make that happen and a multiplicity of challenges with respect to that.  It is not the exclusive realm of the land use plan to do that, but it is the objective of the plan to facilitate and sustain the heritage associated with it.</p> <p>  As Ms Coleman has referenced, with regard to the environment for facilitating culture and arts, we deal with events licences for various things such as Macnas, which has an aspect with regard to Irish culture embedded in it.  We facilitate other festivals by providing facilities, as Ms Coleman said.  We provide park and ride infrastructure, etc., for all the festivals that happen through the year.  Many of them are embedded in our own distinctive culture on that basis.</p> <p>  We can measure to some degree, such as the additional visibility of signage that is there with regard to the Irish language.  We can measure that in terms of how many developments are constructed per year and it is a given that all of them are in the same language.  Our colleagues in Gaillimh le Gaeilge are probably better at the bilingualism and the commercial aspect as well because not all of it comes within the realm of coming in for planning consent.  They can create an encouraging environment and also have the translation capacity as well.</p></speech>

Don t&eacute; a bh&iacute;onn ag dul &oacute; cheann go ceann na cathrach, is beag comhartha a chuireann in i&uacute;l go bhfuiltear ag dul isteach n&oacute; amach as an nGaeltacht.

An bhfuil aon tionscnamh ar leith t&oacute;gtha ag an gcomhairle chun teacht i dt&iacute;r ar an st&aacute;das Gaeltachta sna ceantair sin?  Is d&oacute;cha go bhfuil daoine ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; i gceantair Ghaeltachta sa chathair agus b'fh&eacute;idir nach bhfuil a fhios acu fi&uacute; gur ceantar Gaeltachta &eacute;.</p><p>B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur cheart breathn&uacute; air sin, mar shampla chun br&oacute;d agus mar sin a mh&uacute;scailt i ndaoine.

It is a good idea.  The plean teanga for cathair na Gaillimhe has just been adopted and has a lot of actions in it.  Ms Bhreathnach will confirm that a specific co-ordinator is to be appointed for that.  The expectation for the land use plan to deliver is broader than its remit in some ways but I do not think that excuses Galway City Council.  Issues are being raised and we are working in conjunction with Gaillimh le Gaeilge because we are lead partners in that as well.  Many actions come out of that plan and it is much more cross co-ordinated.  There is a bigger focus with regard to what the Deputy is saying about looking at opportunities where the language can be sustained, expanded and made more visible.  We have to respect the fact that the plan has only recently been adopted and we did not have a great year last year.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about student accommodation.  The most recent accommodation has been granted under An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s strategic housing development, SHD, process but we still had a role in that.  We did not ask for any of that accommodation to be reserved specifically but maybe that is something that the universities or institutes should take on as part of their idealism and vision with regard to the Gaeltacht, as opposed to having it come through the planning process.  In that way, it would not be so coercive.  In some ways the language plan will make it a more consensual advancement.</p> <p>  According to the economic study that was done, 91% of people surveyed saw huge benefit in the Irish language, not just economically.  It is also a matter of ownership and willingness.  That exists in the city but it is a cross-partnership thing.  Ms Bhreathnach might be more privy to those aspects of the language plan.  Some of the things that have been raised can be remedied easily enough.  Even the signage issue could be remedied through better communication and willingness.  There are requirements anyway for signage in the Gaeltacht but it is also about psychologically feeling you are going into a Gaeltacht area.  I appreciate that is not apparent or overt but there is capacity for it.</p></speech>

In reality, I do not think that we could disagree with the Deputy that, rather than having a tokenistic bilingual city or Gaeltacht, we should make some gesture that is going to strengthen it.  Not everything should happen legislatively in respect of incentives or obligations because the idea of doing things by rote and making people legally obliged to do something that is personal is not necessarily the way forward.  There has to be a balance where there is a willingness there also.  There are many modern versions of this.  We saw yesterday in Baile &Aacute;tha Cliath with Conradh na Gaeilge how it said it was reflecting what was happening with Gaillimh le Gaeilge where there are means and ways in which it can be done in a modern manner that makes it attractive.  With the university, in particular, there are very significant opportunities.</p> <p>  There is an increase in the number of Gaelscoileanna which is, to some degree, an open door.  How does one perpetuate this outside of the school environment and normalise it in a greater way which can be done either by legislation or incentivisation with grants, as the Deputy has said, or consensually.  That is a mixture of the three approaches to some degree.  The point in respect of the Gaeltacht is that many of the boundaries are there because of the extension of the city out to that area.  Do these need to reviewed?  Each of the Gaeltachta&iacute; were put into categories of A, B and C, as the Deputy is aware, and there was a resolution with regard to policy attributed to that.  Galway is in category C because of the 2% to 3% who speak Irish daily.  In other words, one size does not fit all.  I agree that probably a mixture of all three approaches is required: coercion, incentivisation and a certain consensual aspect.  Those three together might remedy and lead to a better situation in respect of the whole Gaeltacht area.  The justification for the Gaeltacht, I believe, was relative to the percentage of people who spoke Irish daily and used it as a primary language in a social context.  We should do something when it is right to do it.  I cannot answer that question as it is one for the committee to deliberate upon.  If we are reflecting 2% to 3%, are we being legitimate in saying the entire city is a Gaeltacht?  It is not that it lacks foundation, but it is an approach based upon more realism.</p> <p>  On the designation of an area, if one refines this and if there is a higher percentage than that 2% in a certain location, perhaps it is justified to give that area a certain status.  I am not a linguist or an expert in this area, so I can only give an opinion and it is limited in respect of the land use.  If the committee believes that would be successful, some work should then be done on it beforehand to go into the finer grain of what that 2% is.  Is it those who are predominantly in that location?</p> <p>  We must also bear in mind it is an unserviced area with restrictions in regard to development, so the potential for a population there would also be quite limited.  It might perhaps be better to go to a higher density area in some ways.  Looking at the household profile, are these people also in the early stages of family life?  These are the things that must be borne in mind.  Is it worthy to do something where one is investing in the future which will be a higher population and a justification on that basis.  That is a study in itself.</p> <p>  I have no personal thinking or position on land use.  If the legislation is there, we will comply with it and it is not that we have an inherent objection, or any such thing, to it.</p></speech>

I am not privy to any other nationally accredited census survey for Irish speakers.  It asks a number of questions.  As the Deputy knows, one of the competencies asked is whether a person can speak Irish and the second is whether it is used on a daily basis.  That is reflected in the plan.</p></speech>

If that analysis has been done, it will show either that there is no difference, or that there are differences and therefore there are different policies in different areas.  Will she make that available to the committee?  I am not just talking about taking a global figure.  Parts of the city are designated a Gaeltacht.  Have the small area statistics been done on all the areas that are designated and not designated to see how they compare and how there would be nuanced policies for the areas with stronger Irish?  In addition, will she give us the conclusion of the linguistic analysis of the city on which the council formed its draft city plan?</p></speech>

We do not have any forensic statistics.  The objective is to protect the linguistic and cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht, including the promotion of Irish as a community language.  I am not sure if any other local authority has gone into that detail.</p></speech>

We have taken the city and laboured that with regard to the policies.  It is the bilingual city.  We have been promoting Irish throughout the whole geographical area where the predominate population live.  I referred to two areas, both of which contain huge swathes of rural lands and protected lands also.  Although they may represent a significant geographical proportion within the area, much of that area, as the Deputy knows, beyond Castlegar etc., is not zoned for housing or settlement on that basis.  To answer the Deputy's question, we did not analyse where the 2% was distributed.  It may have been a disadvantage, if anything, because I presume it is distributed throughout the city as opposed to being exclusively in our most populated area, the Barna area, which includes all the new housing that has led to an influx of people from outside the city.  I am making a presumption that it was probably better to assume the 2% was widespread throughout the city rather than concentrated-----</p></speech>

If the conclusion was that there is no difference there, perhaps the council should have considered looking to get rid of that status because it is a total nonsense, to seek a status as a bilingual city on a statutory basis and to have a more honest debate about the real situation of Irish in the city.  It seems to me that in drawing up the plan, there was an absolute legal obligation to examine the Gaeltacht area within the city and to draw up appropriate plans accordingly.  If that was not possible or feasible, the council should have said to the Department that it was not possible and that it needed to be looked at in an holistic way.  We need a totally different type of legislation to make what is to me just an honorary title of "bilingual city" into something real and meaningful that actually delivers for the Irish language.</p></speech>

We viewed it much more laterally in taking the whole city and any capacity for expansion of the use of the language within the whole city, as does the language Act for the city in that it is not exclusively relevant to those two geographical areas.  In addition, it is not the place of a planning authority to eliminate Gaeltachts, for starters.  The other part of that is the cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht: it does not reside exclusively within those geographical areas either.  As was said, institutions such as &Aacute;ras na nGael and Gaillimh le Gaeilge are located within the non-Gaeltacht areas.  There is a whole physical legacy and music legacy etc. throughout the whole city.  It would have been remiss and reductionist of us to reduce it to electoral divisions within the city to find that 2%, hunt them down and give them a label.  We view it much more laterally.  We also embrace the culture associated with it.  That is what the statutory objective states; it is not exclusively linguistic.  It includes the cultural heritage of the Gaeltacht.</p></speech>

If one were to include music, hurling and any other cultural feature, on a hurling basis Kilkenny is probably the strongest Gaeltacht in the country.</p></speech>

It is not what the Gaeltacht legislation is about.  The planning legislation in regard to the Gaeltacht flows from the Gaeltacht legislation of 1926, 1956 and 2010.  It is purely linguistic.  It has nothing to do with music, hurling, football or anything else.</p></speech>

With regard to that, the activities that happen in &Aacute;ras na Gael are part of the Gaeltacht legacy.  The legislation refers to cultural heritage.  I believe it is broader than linguistic.  From our perspective the obligation is broader, and it is healthy that we think that way.</p></speech>

How can you call your city bilingual when it only has 2%?  I wish to come back to the point I made at the beginning of the meeting.  The council seems to be confining itself to a planning authority.  It is more than that.  It is the prime development body of the city, the prime development body of my regional capital and the prime development body of the principal city in our Gaeltacht region.  Surely that 2% figure should drive you on to increase that figure, to do an awful lot more, to be far more ambitious, to be willing to push the boundaries and to make us push the boundaries to give you a bilingual city and thereby lead the way for other cities.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to other cities.  Let us look at the work going on in Clondalkin in south Dublin.  They are hungry to develop an Irish speaking culture within their community.  Maybe I am getting it wrong - perhaps it is due to these horrible Zoom meetings or whatever you call them - but I am not getting any sense of ambition from you guys.  I know it is there, but I do not get it.  I look at the screen and I see heads shaking.  We need the council, as the lead development and planning authority, to challenge us to do more as a legislature to encourage the Gaeltacht, and not to be afraid to encouraging it.  I know it is a multicultural city - I get that - but a unique part of Galway is our Irish-language part of the city.  I am not hearing from the witnesses that they are ambitious or hungry enough to do more to develop that.</p><p>Perhaps I am wrong, but I just do not get it from our witnesses.  I am in and out of Galway a great deal.  I see it on the streets and in all of the bodies our witnesses have mentioned: Gaillimh le Gaeilge, An Taibhdhearc agus gach rud mar sin, but I am just not getting it here today.</p><p> Perhaps after the meeting our witnesses can put their position in writing to us.  As I said earlier, if our city council witnesses were the Ministers for the Environment, Climate and Communications or for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, what would they do?</p></speech>

N&iacute; fios dom gur tharla s&eacute; sin agus fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in luadh &aacute;iteanna ina leith sin ag an am, mar shampla, Cnoc na Cathrach.  N&iacute;l go leor eolais agam faoi cheantar na Gaillimhe arb &eacute; sin an &aacute;it is fearr ach n&iacute; cuimhin liom aon tuairisc &oacute; shin faoi east&aacute;it tith&iacute;ochta a bheith t&oacute;gtha n&oacute; plean&aacute;ilte laistigh den chathair do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.</p><p>T&aacute; dualgais eile ar chathair na Gaillimhe maidir le plean&aacute;il agus mar sin de agus is iad sin dualgais maidir le comhartha&iacute; b&oacute;thair.

If you lives in a city, your interactions will be very frequent.  If you lived in an estate that was exclusively Irish speaking, that in itself would not save the language.  What other methodology within a land use plan does the Chairman see as saving it?</p> <p>  On the reference to the overture, that may have been in the housing programme of the local authority, that may have been an overture from a councillor at that stage about having one exclusively for Irish speakers.  It did not come up during the duration of the previous development plan, for which period Cathal &Oacute; Conch&uacute;ir was around.</p> <p>  There seems to be just one solution to salvaging the Irish language and it seems to be predicated exclusively on having single housing estates within an urban area.  Looking at linguistics globally and peripheral languages that are challenged, the platform for sustaining and extending those is not exclusively based elsewhere on housing.  I wonder what other areas the Chairman sees in the development plan.  We see it for the cultural aspect, communication and business and the Gaelscoileanna, which have been a total success in the city.</p></speech>

I welcome officials from the broadcasting and media division of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Unfortunately, they will only be joining us in committee room 1 remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I welcome Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, assistant secretary, and her colleague, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Shanley, senior policy analyst.  I also extend a warm welcome to the officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who will be joining us remotely as well.  We have Ms Sabha Greene, principal officer with the digital economy policy unit, and her colleagues, Mr. Eoin Cuddihy and Mr. Mark Dugdale.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite the officials attending on behalf of their respective Departments to make their opening statements, which will be followed by questions from my colleagues.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish their opening statements on its website following today's meeting.</p> <p>  Before I invite our witnesses to deliver their opening statements, which will be limited to five minutes apiece, I wish to explain some of the limitations in terms of parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses regarding references that witnesses make to other persons in their evidence.</p><p>The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses today are giving their evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts does.  Witnesses may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p><p> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name, or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the person or entity's good name.  If a witness's statement is potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, he or she will be directed to discontinue the remarks and it is imperative that he or she would comply with any such direction, which I know you all, of course, would do.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House campus to participate in our public meeting today.  I cannot permit any member to attend if outside that constitutional requirement.  Any member who intends to attend from outside of the precincts of the Leinster House campus will be asked to leave the meeting.</p><p> I ask members and witnesses to please identify themselves when contributing.  This is for the benefit of the Debates Office staff in preparing the Official Report.  I also ask everyone to mute their microphones when not contributing to avoid background noise and feedback.  When witnesses and members wish to contribute I ask that they use the raise hand facility.  I remind those joining today's meeting to switch off their mobile phones or put them into silent mode.</p><p> After all of that housekeeping, which I am sure attendees found riveting, I will move on to the most important part of today's meeting.  I ask Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill to deliver her opening statement.</p></speech>

The recently published online safety and media regulation Bill is an important milestone in the regulation of media and online services in Ireland and across Europe.  I hope today&rsquo;s exchange will be of assistance to the committee in further scrutinising its wider EU legislative context, including in relation to the EU's proposed Digital Services Act.</p> <p>  I would first like to reiterate the appreciation of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, for the thorough pre-legislative scrutiny work carried out by this committee.  A significant number of the committee&rsquo;s recommendations are addressed by the Bill and the Minister intends to address a number of others as the Bill passes through the Oireachtas, including in relation to an individual complaints' mechanism.</p> <p>  The Bill has a number of key features.  It will provide for the implementation in Irish law of the EU&rsquo;s revised audiovisual media services directive.  This forms the foundations of much of the Bill and provides that Ireland will regulate for the whole of Europe certain online platforms and media services established here.  The Bill will also provide for the dissolution of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the transfer of its remit and staff to be part of a new multi-person media commission.  The Bill provides for the provision of a modern and robust suite of investigative, enforcement and sanction powers to the commission, and the creation of a new regulatory framework for online safety, to be overseen by an online safety commissioner.  This will allow certain categories of harmful online content to be addressed through risk-based systemic regulation and binding codes.  The Bill provides for the updating of the rules applicable to television broadcasters and video on-demand services to reflect changes to the way we consume these services.</p> <p>  A key driver behind the online safety and media regulation Bill is the implementation of the audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive, which requires the establishment of a new, robust and adaptable regulator.  As committee members are aware, the Digital Services Act is currently being negotiated at European level and will address a wide range of issues, from illegal and harmful online content to consumer rights issues such as the availability of illegal goods on online platforms.  Negotiations are being led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on Ireland&rsquo;s behalf.  The Digital Services Act is, of course, not yet finalised and it is important to note the audiovisual media services directive will not be replaced by the Digital Services Act.  Rather, it is explicitly recognised in the proposed text of that Act as complementary to it.</p><p>Therefore, the requirement to transpose the AVMS directive remains and it is important that this is done as soon as possible through the enactment of the OSMR Bill, in light of the infringement proceedings that are currently under way.</p><p> The Digital Services Act, DSA, envisages the creation of networks of digital regulators at both EU and national level.  These will provide the framework for enforcing both the DSA and the raft of digital legislation that is currently under development or coming down the tracks over the next decade to safeguard European citizens and support European enterprises.  Work is ongoing in scoping out the appropriate regulatory structures in Ireland to implement the DSA and this too is being led by our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p><p> As a horizontal legislative instrument, the DSA overlaps with the remit of a wide range of existing regulators and laws, including aspects of the OSMR Bill.  These overlaps will need to be worked through when the DSA is finalised and is being implemented into Irish law over the coming years.  In this regard, we will continue to work with our colleagues from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to monitor the regulation as it moves through the EU legislative process.</p><p> To conclude, I reiterate my hope that today&rsquo;s meeting will assist in the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the Bill in its wider EU legislative context.  I look forward to answering members' questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sabha Greene" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for this opportunity to update them on the EU digital services package.  As the package comprises of two proposals for new regulations, the Digital Markets Act, DMA, and the DSA, I am accompanied by my colleagues who have led the Irish position in those two negotiations; Mr, Eoin Cuddihy is on the DMA and Mr. Mark Dugdale is on the DSA.</p> <p>  The negotiations on the two proposals are advancing in Brussels.  The Competitiveness Council adopted its general approach on each of the proposals at its meeting on 25 November last and Ireland supported those two general approaches.  Meanwhile, the European Parliament adopted its amendments on the DMA last month and is scheduled to vote on its DSA amendments tomorrow.  Trilogue negotiations on the DMA started last week, while those on the DSA are expected to begin shortly after the vote tomorrow, probably early next month.  While the EU legislative process is moving fairly fast, it should be borne in mind that the text of both the DSA and the DMA is still evolving.  Adoption of both proposals is a priority for the French Presidency and we expect to have final instruments in the course of this year.</p> <p>  The committee has asked us to provide information for an assessment of the potential interplay between the digital services package and the OSMR Bill.  As the committee&rsquo;s report on that Bill points out, the DSA is the most relevant of the two proposals in the EU package when it comes to scope and provisions.  With the committee's permission, I will focus my remarks on that proposal, although we are here to answer questions on both.</p> <p>  The Council&rsquo;s general approach maintains many features of the original Commission proposal, notably, the horizontal approach, whereby the DSA must be read in tandem with sectoral legislation, such as the AVMS directive.  Clearly, therefore, there are provisions in sectoral EU legislation that are specific to those sectors.  The DSA's text names many of those sectoral laws, but it is not an exhaustive list, and allows for additional sectoral rules in future.  The text is still a general framework with a systemic approach requiring providers to have certain systems in place with respect to content.  The general approach also maintains the country-of-origin principle, where the applicable law and regulators are those of the country in which a platform or service provider is established.  This supports the smooth functioning of the Single Market.  It also retains the focus on combating illegal content, on the principle that what is illegal offline should be illegal online.  When it comes to moderation of harmful content, this continues to be the responsibility of intermediary services providers, but is subject to risk assessments for the very large online platforms.</p> <p>  One of the main changes introduced in the Council&rsquo;s general approach last November is to the enforcement model.  The text now extends the powers of the Commission for the supervision and enforcement of the regulation with respect to the very large online platforms and very large online service providers.  National digital services co-ordinators, DSCs, retain their enforcement roles with respect to the smaller sized platforms and providers, and will still have a role in working with the Commission in respect of the very large operators.</p><p>The DSC will also work closely with sectoral regulators in Ireland and with its counterparts across the EU.  As a result, there are new elements to reinforce the co-operation between national digital services co-ordinators and the Commission to ensure a robust and co-ordinated approach to enforcement. </p><p> This significant amendment was agreed just last November and, therefore, the full practical implications are still being assessed by the Commission and the member states.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is preparing a regulatory impact analysis, RIA, to assess the best way to meet the obligation to designate and equip a DSC here.  Given the number of operators established in Ireland, this will be a significant role.  As I mentioned, the Parliament is adopting its own amendments this week to the DSA, and we are still examining those. </p><p> In conclusion, while many features of both the DMA and the DSA are clear now, they are still subject to the trilogue negotiations change is likely.  Since the publication of the original proposals in late 2019, our Department has engaged with colleagues in all relevant Departments, including the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and that will continue as we each progress the EU regulations and the online safety and media regulation Bill.</p></speech>

I will now move to my colleagues.  A speaking rota has been circulated and I am sure they have noted that and know when to come in.  I remind members they have ten minutes for both questions and answers.  I would appreciate if they could stick to that as much as is possible.  To begin, I would like to invite Senator Warfield to speak.  He is not on the call, so we will move on to Senator Malcolm Byrne.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#D00300"><p>I thank Ms Quill and Mr. Shanley for their work on the OSMR Bill.  It has been a difficult process and there has been much debate on it.  I am certainly happy that the Minister has taken on board many of this committee's recommendations from our report.</p> <p>  I would like to focus on two key issues that the witnesses may be able to respond to.  One is the timeframe linking the Bill and the outcome of the trilogue with regard to the DSA and our final objectives.  What will the final picture look like?  In the context of the timeframe, Ms Greene mentioned the fact that the European Parliament is voting this week on the amendments and that it is a priority for the French Presidency.  We should work on the basis that we will probably see the DSA by the end of June.  Obviously, at the same time, we are here dealing with the OSMR Bill.  </p> <p>  The Minister has indicated, which I welcome, that she will set up a panel to look at the possibility of an individual complaints mechanism, because that will inform the debate here for the online safety commissioner.  I am keen to find out from the Department's media side the timeframe that would be followed with regard to this expert group looking at the individual complaints mechanism being examined and reporting back, and then when we may consider the Bill as a Legislature.  When it will come before this committee again, the D&aacute;il and Seanad?  Is it still reasonable - and I certainly hope that it would be - that the Bill could be enacted before the summer?  I would certainly be disappointed if it is not, but that timeframe could be followed.</p> <p>  In terms of the DSC, I envisage that given we are now setting up a new architecture around a media commission and an online safety commissioner that those roles, as envisaged within the DSA, would form part of that new media commission.  It does not make sense to set up a new structure when we are already setting up a new structure.  Given the scale of what it will have to oversee, what kind of staffing arrangements will be required to ensure that it can operate effectively?  I appreciate the DSA has not been finalised yet.</p><p>I believe the media commission, when it is set up, will be one of the most powerful regulators in the State and I want to ensure it will be adequately resourced.</p><p> Given this will be a dynamic space and we do not know what technology will deliver for us over the next number of years, is it the witnesses' view that we will probably come back regularly, if not annually, to update our legislation in this area?  We will probably be giving the new media commission additional statutory powers to deal with new technologies, be they artificial intelligence or algorithmic decision-making.  In all those spaces, decisions will be made at national and European level.  Do the witnesses envisage that we will have to add statutory powers regularly to the media commission?  I will stop at this point to allow our guests time to answer.</p></speech>

On the timeframe, I know the Minister is anxious that the Bill would progress as soon as possible.  She has indicated publicly that the expert group she is setting up should report back within 90 days.  That would allow for any amendments that may arise to be taken on Committee Stage in the Oireachtas.  We will be working with our colleagues in the Whip's office and with Oireachtas staff to see how the Bill can be progressed in the most efficient way possible.  I know the Minister is anxious this would happen as well.  It is difficult to give a precise date.  We have to work out some of the variables, but I know the Minister is ambitious to get this done as soon as she can.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sabha Greene" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#E00400"><p>On the scale of what the digital services co-ordinator, DSC, will oversee, I will ask Mr. Dugdale to give a quick summary of exactly what its functions and role will be.  Its main purpose is to implement the obligations that are in the Digital Services Act, which are due-diligence obligations on platforms and service providers, thereby putting systems in place.  When we say a "systematic approach" that is what we mean.</p> <p>  On staffing, we are engaging most directly with the European Commission because we are trying to find out exactly what kind of skills the new DSC will need.  It is already clear it will need data analysis skills, economists, lawyers and enforcement specialists.  The Senator is absolutely right that we want to make sure it is adequately equipped.  A key objective of the Government in implementing the digital services authority, DSA, is that the DSC is properly resourced and able to meet its obligations.  One of the concerns is that there are several regulators in Ireland who will be looking for similar skills.  At the same time, now that the Commission will have a role in enforcement, it may also be looking for the same skills, and it is probably a very tight labour market.  We are looking at all those issues at the moment.</p> <p>  As to who will perform the DSC functions, our Department is conducting a regulatory impact analysis, which is due to be ready soon.  This is to assist the Government in deciding where the DSC should be, whether we should start from scratch with a stand-alone body or whether we should assign the functions and additional resources to an existing body.  Perhaps Mr. Dugdale will give a brief outline of what the DSC will do.</p></speech>

The DSA itself sets out a number of due diligence obligations that are applied on a phased approach according to the reach of the platforms.  They will also be responsible for assessing a number of bodies such as the trusted flaggers.  These bodies would be responsible for having priority attention for the intermediary service providers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#F00200"><p>Crucially for us , given that we are establishing a media commission that is going to deal with many of these issues anyway, does it not make sense that to leave it to the commission rather than looking at setting up an entirely new agency?  My question related to the scale of the operation, particularly given the companies that are based in Ireland for which this regulator will have responsibility.  The media commission will have a couple of hundred staff.  I think we are going to be looking at several hundred, or more, staff, to be able to ensure that this operation functions effectively.  We do not want to see a Data Protection Commission-type of situation.</p></speech>

The commission is being examined in the context of the regulatory impact analysis.  There are clear overlaps or similarities in the functions and in the type of people these bodies will be regulating.  There is a lot of sense but without prejudging the outcome of the RIA, I would not say more than that at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#F00400"><p>I have a quick question for Ms Quill.  I appreciate the Minister said this expert group on the individual complaints mechanism will report back within 90 days.  When will that 90 days start?  When will we see that expert group appointed.  Second, and I am not asking for members to be named, but what type of person is envisaged and where will the membership of that group be drawn from?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#F00500"><p>The Minister has indicated that she expects to set up the group in the coming days.  It should be very soon.  She will announce it certainly within the next week.  Expertise will include legal expertise and expertise in managing complaints systems in other sectors, and knowledge of dealing with the platforms themselves, for example, with issues around children's rights.  There will be a wide range of skills in the group.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#F00600"><p>I suggest the group engages with the Australian e-safety commissioner.  Our committee is very favourable to the model operating there.  It is something that would be useful for that group to explore.</p></speech>

I will move now to Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan as it seems there is nobody present before him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#F00800"><p>I thank the Chair and the witnesses for coming before us today and informing us on what is happening in regard to the DSA in particular.</p><p>I have two questions.  The first relates directly to the DSA.  It might potentially mirror what Senator Byrne asked about.  Ms Quill stated, "The Digital Services Act, DSA, envisages the creation of networks of digital regulators at both EU and national level."  In terms of what we are doing with the OSMR Bill and the online safety commissioner, how will they work and will they work in tandem?  Could that be an opportunity to support and bolster the potential workload of an online safety commissioner, as Senator Byrne outlined, in particular if we go down the road of individual complaints mechanisms?  Is there an opportunity to dovetail the systems and for them to complement each other or is there a danger of conflict between the two?</p><p> I apologise if this is a bit out of left field.  I understand if neither of the witnesses has an answer to this, but I am thinking in particular of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media.  It relates to an incident I feel I have to bring up that happened during the week.  I was contacted by a constituent who organised an event, which was an online vigil to commemorate the loss of Ashling Murphy.  Unbelievably - I just cannot fathom how this could happen - the event was sabotaged by a man who managed to hijack the details of one of the panellists and joined the panel online.  He exposed his genitalia and proceeded to masturbate.  It was an horrific experience for all involved.  This is the first opportunity I have had to bring this up.  In many ways, this is the right place.  Have we gone far enough in terms of the scope of the online safety media regulation Bill?  The people in question spent hours with the Garda talking about the issue.  In many instances the Garda was almost left powerless in terms of how it could address this.  I understand if the witnesses do not have the answer, but perhaps it is something that could be brought back to the departmental officials.  Does the OSMR Bill have the scope to deal with that type of disgusting, despicable behaviour, and will the online media regulator have the power and the clout to be able to clamp down on that type of thing?  They are my two questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#G00200"><p>In terms of the network of regulators, as my colleague, Ms Greene, pointed out, the DSA is a very wide piece of legislation.  It is what is called a horizontal measure.  It deals not just with content, as such, but also with issues of consumer protection like illegal goods being for sale online etc.  I imagine a number of regulators need to be considered in round C.  It may not be one single regulator that has any responsibility under the DSA.  Those are the sorts of issues our colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are teasing out to see what regulators have any role under the DSA and who will ultimately be the digital services co-ordinator.  A number of regulators will be involved in one way or another in the DSA and future legislation.  Increasing co-operation across regulators is going to be an important feature in future for us all to look at.</p> <p>  In terms of the issue raised about the Zoom call, the Deputy will understand I am not familiar with the detailed circumstances but, in general, services like Zoom can potentially be designated by the media commission to be regulated.  As the Deputy is aware, the framework is that video-sharing platforms automatically come within the scope and then the media commission can designate other platforms based on their risk profile.</p><p>Something like a videoconferencing platform is potentially in scope there.  There will always be a role for the Garda.  If a matter is criminal in nature, it will primarily be for the Garda to address.  Our legislation will provide additional tools that are available to ensure platforms are doing all they can to minimise illegal or harmful content on their services.  At a systemic level there are things within the scope of the legislation that would be helpful.</p></speech>

Does Ms Greene have anything she would like to add to that?</p></speech>

There are different kinds of illegal content.  There is stuff that is criminally illegal like terrorist content, which is enforced by bodies such as the Garda, and then there are matters that are civilly illegal like defamation, defamatory material or the infringement of copyright.  Each one of those is assessed and enforced in its own way.  In bringing forward the proposal for the DSA, the Commission was aware there could be gaps as a result in people working together within a member state.  A very important role for the new digital services co-ordinator will be to develop relationships with all of the sectoral regulators and ensure there is good exchange of information and co-operation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#H00400"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  My first question is to Ms Quill who was with us during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  She outlined that the European Commission initiated infringement proceedings.  Will she provide the committee with an update on the proceedings against Ireland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#H00500"><p>We are at the stage where the European Commission has given a reasoned opinion that Ireland may be in breach, so the next stage, should the Commission so decide, would be to go to the European Court of Justice.  It is not the first step towards fines, but it is to initiate the process that could result in Ireland being fined.  We are concerned.  We have been in contact with the Commission in regard to where we are in the legislation and the progress being made, but we are conscious that it really wants to see Ireland transposing very soon, and that is a factor that brings an additional urgency to progressing the Bill through the Houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#H00600"><p>In terms of the importance of this next legislative session, I am sure the Minister has prioritised it as part of the Government's work.</p> <p>  It was interesting to listen to what Ms Greene said about digital service co-ordinators in Ireland and how they will be established and funded through the European Commission.  Is that correct?  Will she give us some more information around their establishment and also how they will work with sectoral regulators in Ireland?  In addition, will she give examples on how we currently regulate service providers, how this directive will allow services that are established in Ireland to be overseen by Irish regulators for the whole EU, and what type of infringement proceedings we can pre-empt once this directive is enacted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.404" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sabha Greene" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#J00100"><p>On the funding, again, that is something we need to scope out.  In conversations with the Commission, it has not ruled out that the digital services co-ordinator, DSC, could be funded by a levy, a little like as is proposed for the media commission, provided, obviously, there are proper safeguards in place to ensure the DSC is entirely independent.  I may not have entirely understood about how we regulate at the moment.  The Digital Services Act, DSA, is, of course, premised on the country of origin.  That means the DSC will have responsibility for dealing with any platform service provider that is established and has its headquarters in Ireland.</p> <p>  As I have said, there has been a slight change in the enforcement model, which means the Commission will have a role in investigating and enforcing against the very large online platforms.  Clearly, some of those platforms will be the ones that are in scope or that are based in Ireland.  That does not mean the national DSC will be out of the picture.  It will still have a role in supporting the Commission, for example, perhaps, organising search warrants and things like that.  There will be a co-ordination role there, so there is still a good piece of work the DSC will have to do here.</p> <p>  The DSC will have some functions it must carry out itself, including enforcing the due diligence obligations in the DSA, investigating all of that, and, of course, receiving complaints that come from users in other member states.  Once the complaint is against a platform or a service provider that is established here, our DSC will be in the frame for that.  As I said, it will have to establish connections almost immediately with all of the sectoral regulators that deal with different aspects of illegal content, be in a position to ensure it is aware of any action that any of those sectoral regulators are taking, and be able to pass that information on to the DSCs in the other members states.  There is going to be quite a bit of information sharing across the network of the EU member state DSCs.  That, in itself, will probably be quite a job.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.  Perhaps he was looking for more aspects.</p></speech>

How does that compare with our EU counterparts in terms of the volume of work that will have to be undertaken by the digital service co-ordinator here?  I know a regulatory impact analysis is being undertaken.  Will that feed into how this is put together?  I ask Ms Greene to provide some information on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.406" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sabha Greene" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022011900002#J00300"><p>I should say that because the text of the DSA is being negotiated, the actual breakdown of what tasks will fall to the national DSC and what tasks will fall to the European Commission is not entirely clear.  We cannot say with certainty at this stage exactly what the allocation of duties and responsibilities is there.  It is clear the amount of work that will fall to the Irish DSC will be greater than to any other member state DSC by virtue of the fact of what we have based here.  That is fair to say.  I should also say the regulatory impact analysis is going to take the traditional iterative approach, that as we know more information, we will factor it in.</p><p>In the first place, we are trying to get a decision about the most appropriate home for the DSC so that we can work on equipping it.  Obviously, it will make a difference on whether we are assigning functions to an organisation that is already in place or, as is the case with the media commission, one that is not in place but is planned, or if we are starting from scratch.  I am afraid to say that all of those things are still to be worked out.</p></speech>

I know the painstaking work they have done.  It really is painstaking.  Some of it is mind-boggling.  I have a few questions.  I presume there will be a lot of crossover between the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, DMA, and our own online safety and media regulation Bill.  How confident are the witnesses that the big platforms can be reined in?  They spoke about a level playing field with small businesses.  I looked up some of the figures.  We are dealing with the likes of Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, which have market values of $2.62 trillion, $937 billion, $1.93 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively.  They are very powerful platforms.  Will the regulation really get to them?  These guys have super legal teams.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  Second, do we have a list of gatekeeper companies in Ireland?  What is our definition of that?  Third, Article 33 of the Digital Services Act is intended to grant researchers access to key data on the operations of the very large online platforms.  Who are the researchers here?  Do we know if this will be done country by country?</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' observations on the protection of whistleblowers.  It is very important.  The transparency of meetings with gatekeepers should be on show as well.</p></speech>

We still have to transpose that, and that is what the online safety and media regulation Bill is doing.  The European Commission sees them as complementary.  It is not to say that there will not be some areas that will need to be teased out to provide absolute clarity about how they are being dealt with, but if something comes under the AVMS but not under the DSA, it does not mean it will suddenly stop having effect.  They are intended to be complementary systems.</p> <p>  I would also say that we have sought to design the online safety and media regulation Bill so that it is as flexible as possible.  As the Deputy is aware, it sets out the framework, but a lot of the detail is going to be worked through online safety codes the media commission will put in place.  The designation of services other than video-sharing platforms that are automatically in scope will not happen until the media commission is established.  It means there is a bit of flexibility in terms of the online safety and media regulation Bill to allow for changing circumstances so that codes and designation can reflect changes that happen over time.</p> <p>  I would say that some of the syncing between some of the different pieces of legislation will happen in implementation by the media commission and by other regulators rather than necessarily all through primary legislation, for example.  There will have to be close working together between regulators and various regulatory regimes, but the devil will be in the detail.</p><p>The question of the other platform, gatekeepers, data and whistleblowers might be more for Ms Greene.</p></speech>

It also highlights the importance of the co-ordination role of the DSC because it will be important that when it is dealing with other regulators on the sectoral side, there is easy flow of information.  This is likely to need to be supported by statutory provision.  We must also bear in mind that the Commission has a role in enforcement in the DMA and the DSA.  It is not just our national body.  We have the heft of the Commission as well.</p> <p>  I know there is horizontal legislation in Ireland and at EU level on the protection of whistleblowers.  This is something of which we must be mindful as we implement the DSA and the DMA.  Mr. Cuddihy can give the committee a quick update regarding the definition of gatekeepers while Mr. Dugdale will speak about the vetted researchers.</p></speech>

This is in chapter three of the DMA proposal.  If a company meets the selection criteria, it is duly obliged to notify the Commission that it meets them and the Commission designates it as a gatekeeper and publishes this list on a yet-to-be-determined Commission forum.  The Commission has indicated that it believes that there will be ten to 15 gatekeeper companies operating in Europe.  The Commission did an exercise and knows which companies will be designated as gatekeepers but it has not informed member states publicly which companies will be among the ten to 15 gatekeeper companies designated under the DMA.  The Commission and the companies themselves have a good idea but we are not in a position to name check ten to 15 companies until that official list is published.  Until that list is published, we will not know with any degree of certainty.  We have an idea of which companies will be designated but, again, we will not know until that list is published by the Commission.  That list is due to be published within six to nine months of the regulation coming into effect so we will know very shortly.</p> <p>  Regarding the obligations, the objective of the DMA is to make digital markets more contestable.  Nineteen obligations will be placed on companies designated as gatekeeper companies.  We believe these 19 obligations are a very good place to start to ensure there is more competition with digital markets but also competition for digital markets.  Hopefully, that addresses the Deputy's concerns.</p> <p>  Regarding whistleblowers, as Ms Greene mentioned, trial negotiations are under way.  One of the amendments being proposed by the European Parliament is that the DMA directly reference the whistleblower directive.  Again, it is not a proposal we would have discussed at Council level but we will discuss it with relevant colleagues overseeing this directive regarding its compatibility with the DMA.  It does feature in the European Parliament amendments on the DMA, which we should know more about in the coming weeks.</p><p>Hopefully, that addresses the questions on the DMA.  I might pass back to Ms Greene.</p></speech>

Disinformation can, or should, be dealt with through that process, although it is not directly involved.  The auditors will not necessarily have the power to force the intermediary service providers to include that, but if they are able to show that those risks are present, it would be up to the DSC, in supporting the Commission under the new arrangement, to begin infringement proceedings on that basis.</p><p> The Digital Services Act also provides that issues can be dealt with by codes of conduct.  At European level, there is already a code of conduct on disinformation.  I do not have a huge amount of detail on what that is, but it is dealt with in that respect.  When I say it is not dealt with directly, it is dealt with indirectly through these other means, which the Act sets out in this sort of systemic or general framework approach it has.  I hope that helps.</p></speech>

I am on track now.  There is no individual complaints handling mechanism, in which the DSC would be involved.  There is a due diligence obligation that applies to platforms of a hosting service nature and above; therefore, hosting services, online platforms and very large online platforms, VLOPs, would be required to have in place an internal complaints handling system.  The DSCs would be responsible for ensuring those systems were working.  They would not be responsible for dealing with individual complaints.</p> <p>  The one area where the DSA gets involved with individual areas of illegal content is through a provision, which states that competent authorities in the member states in which something is illegal can act and here one needs to bear in mind that the definition of "illegal content" in the DSA is anything which is illegal in any member state or under European harmonised law.  If a particular piece of hate speech was illegal in Germany and being disseminated by Facebook, the German authorities would be able, under the Act, issue a notice to Facebook to take down that material.</p><p>Facebook would then be obliged to respond to that notice.  This is an area in which the company has to strike a balance between the rights of the provider of the information and the right to freedom of expression, and it would then decide whether to take that down and would have to notify the German authorities; first, as to whether it had taken it down or, second, that it had not taken it down and did not intend to do so.<br/><br/>The German authorities would then have the responsibility under their law to take legal action in Germany to have that content removed, and there would be very specific territorial scope to do so.  If something is illegal in Germany, but not in the vast majority of the rest of the Union, it would not need to be taken down elsewhere.  I hope that helps with regard to the way the DSA deals with individual areas of illegal content.  However, the Act does not allow for individual complaints to be made to digital services co-ordinators <i>per se</i>.</p></speech>

The Bill sets out a Schedule of the criminal offences by which harmful content can be spread.  That includes the recently updated offences under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020 on image-based abuse, harassment and the like.</p> <p>  There are also three to four categories of other content that relate to the promotion of eating disorders, suicide, self-harm and cyberbullying content.  That content is not related to criminal offences and as such, is subject to a risk-of-harm test, which relates to threat to life or reasonably foreseeable risk of harm to a person's physical or mental health.  That is the content and scope of the OSMR Bill and this relates to the content and scope of the AVMS directive as well.</p> <p>  On top of that, the media commission will devise online safety codes, which will set standards and obligations for how the regulated online services, including video-sharing platforms, deal with this kind of content, including preventing its availability and when it does become available, how the commission deals with it, how complaints systems work and how it reports on this to the regulator.</p></speech>

Through the online safety codes, online services will be obliged to take action on these categories of harmful online content.  It is not suggestive.  This can range from the commission identifying an issue with the availability of certain content and the platform having to take appropriate measures to deal with it or the commission setting down that the platforms have to take very specific measures and handle complaints in very specific ways.  It can go from the commission obliging best efforts, to it saying a specific thing must be done in certain instances.</p><p>This allows for the development over time of different measures and changes.</p></speech>

Those officers have significant powers, including the power to seek search warrants and the power to take information under oath from individuals.  The authorised officer then reports to the commission and the commission considers whether on balance it believes a breach has occurred.  If it believes a breach has occurred, it can pursue the imposition of a financial sanction of up to &euro;20 million or 10% of turnover.  On top of that, if it believes the breach continues to occur after that, it can issue a notice to end the breach.  If the breach still occurs, it can pursue criminal sanctions against senior executives of the platform and can seek court orders to block access to the platform.  It is a graduated approach which can potentially reach fairly high financial sanctions.  If the same breach continues, it can reach the point where the service is blocked.  That is a very blunt instrument, but when that stage is reached the platform will have been wilfully non-compliant for a long time.</p></speech>

I apologise that I was in and out of the meeting and might have missed some questions which were asked already.  Will the staff to be put in place for the DSA be sufficient?  The Digital Markets Act proposes to establish a level playing field across the Single Market and globally regarding innovation and growth.  Are businesses in Ireland ready for this?  If jobs are displaced due to the advancement of artificial intelligence, AI, in the industry, it is important for us to upskill and re-educate any of those people who lose jobs.  Are we ready for this?</p> <p>  Unfortunately, we have not yet received recommendations from the Future of Media Commission.  We need to get assurances that the implementation of those will be copper-fastened by the national digital strategy as they cut across each other.</p> <p>  On the possibility of legislation being introduced, it was said that at EU level there are codes of conduct relating to disinformation.

Our RIA process, which will be ongoing as the two European texts evolve, is looking at resources and ensuring we have the right skills and adequate numbers.</p> <p>  The Senator asked if businesses are ready for the DMA.  Mr. Cuddihy might correct me if I am wrong.  My understanding is that the objective of it is to open up markets so that small and medium-sized businesses can compete with the larger service providers.  The idea is that more jobs would be created for those businesses if they can compete more and scale up.</p><p>From the moment these proposals were put in place, there has been ongoing consultation with businesses.  I hope they consider that they are being informed and prepared for the impact of these.</p><p> I think the Senator may have had a third question which I missed.</p></speech>

Has enough been done?  Are our firms IT-ready for this so that we can be competitive in the EU market?</p></speech>

The terms of reference of that are being scoped out at the moment but the idea is that it will help businesses to make the transition to digital either in their own processes or however else they need to do digitalise.  That is being looked at and there are other schemes.  We can get the Senator more information on all the relevant schemes such as the trading online voucher.  We can follow up on that.</p> <p>  I may leave the question on the recommendations from the commission to Ms Quill.</p></speech>

It is recognised that disinformation is probably one of the most challenging types of harmful content to regulate effectively for because it involves so much rights balancing.  People have the right to freedom of speech and there are other concerns that must be balanced against the undoubted harm being done by widespread disinformation.  The view across Europe was that something should be done at European level to take a unified approach on it.  Mr. Cuddihy has set out the mechanism under the DSA where this might be addressed.  It is a matter of seeing how effective that regime is in practice over time and seeing what additional measures might be required at European level.</p></speech>

I apologise to the witnesses for the delay in commencing the meeting and thank them for their forbearance.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. John Fulham from the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA; Mr. Tim O'Mahony, CEO, and Ms L&eacute;an Kennedy, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind; and Ms June Tinsley, Ms Lorna Fitzpatrick, advocacy and engagement manager, and Ms Joanne Murphy, service user and advocate, National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it might apply to the evidence they give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House campus in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm prior to making their contributions that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Fulham to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We do this to address matters that are important to their lives.  Our voice is here to represent that community on what is a matter of concern.</p> <p>  In recognising the advent of e-scooters and their increased usage in our society, we also recognise that e-scooters could contribute to addressing climate change and traffic congestion issues as part of a broader strategic approach.  However, critical to this is the necessity that e-scooter use be implemented in a safe and practical manner and that the required legislation, regulation and practices not place disabled people or those with limited mobility in a vulnerable position and compromise their independence.</p> <p>  In advance of the draft legislation being published, the IWA created a position paper highlighting our concerns and, given the shared nature of our concerns, worked jointly with the NCBI and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind to create a joint paper to raise awareness and support us all in having informed debate on this issue.  Both papers have been submitted for the committee's attention.  Having reviewed the legislation, a number of the issues previously raised are not addressed and amendments are required to ensure the safety of disabled pedestrians and those with limited mobility.  This afternoon, committee members are hearing from all three organisations on issues of shared concern, including reduced speed limits, prohibited use on footpaths, usage controls, parking infrastructure and management of behaviour in both private and scheme-managed ownership.</p> <p>  The two areas that I will address are those of parking infrastructure and private e-scooter use.  As a wheelchair user, I have a lived experience of bicycles and scooters and of how badly planned and managed parking can severely impact and significantly impede the day-to-day lives of disabled people and those with limited mobility, including the elderly and parents with buggies.  The impact of unmanaged and careless parking of micro-mobility vehicles blocks pathways and places obstacles that result in disabled people being unable to proceed with their daily tasks or placing themselves at risk by going out on roads to circumnavigate the blockages, should they even be able to do so.</p><p>Added to obstacles such as illegally parked cars, wheelie bins, etc, we cannot compound the issues and place an additional obstacle to this list.  My own experiences will testify to this challenge.  When out on my own, or with my son in his buggy, I have frequently faced blockages from badly parked cars and bikes, forcing me to turn home as I have been left with no alternative.  Unless addressed, e-scooters can, and will, add to this challenge.  Legislation does not mandate designated parking areas or prohibit free-floating, lock-to parking.  Feedback from our membership experience from both home and abroad is that free-floating, lock-to parking must be prohibited and that designated parking bays-areas are a necessity.  Placement of designated parking bays must take into consideration the recommended circulation spaces with pathways and approach routes remaining unobstructed.  </p><p> The other significant area of concern is the management of private e-scooter ownership and behaviour.  Having spoken with several e-scooter scheme providers, use of e-scooters operated though a scheme structure can offer technologies and controls which can help manage driver behaviour.  While such technologies are not a silver bullet for all issues, they will not exist on those vehicles that are privately owned.  Therefore, it is important to address key concerns in this area.  Given the potential growth in private ownership, the proposed legislation makes it an offence to supply an individual under the age of 16 with a e-scooter.  However, it is essential that this provision is coupled with a minimum age requirement for the use of e-scooters.  Maturity and the ability to behave responsibly means we must ensure we are consistent and appropriate in the age requirements that we set.  Alongside reduced speed limits and prohibited use on footpaths, this is an important provision, among a suite of others, for the safety of all concerned, e-scooter users, people with disabilities and the general public.</p><p> As always, subsequent to the important first step of creating the right regulatory framework will be the implementation of those controls.  The reality is this a global trend and that e-scooters are becoming a growing presence in Ireland.  However, in all the key areas to be mentioned today by me and my colleagues from NCBI and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, there are lessons to be learned which have been made elsewhere in other countries, ones that can be avoided.  Ireland has the opportunity here to lead the way with safety at its core.  People with disabilities are not vulnerable.  It is the constructs of the society around us that creates the vulnerability.  I am here today to urge the committee to act upon our representations by proposing and supporting necessary amendments to the Bill to ensure that we do not create the circumstances where disabled people, yet again, are adversely impacted by the environment created around them.  I again thank the committee for the opportunity to present to it today.  I am happy to address any questions members may have and to hear the contributions they wish to make on this issue.</p></speech>

NCBI welcomes the opportunity to discuss with the committee its position on the regulation of e-scooters in Ireland as proposed within the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021.  Together with IWA and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, the NCBI has areas of common concern that we seek to highlight to ensure the legislation is robust and can guarantee the safety of disabled pedestrians and those with mobility issues.</p> <p>  NCBI works with people who are blind or vision impaired from across the country.  According to census 2016, there are 54,810 people living with sight loss in Ireland.  We provide practical and emotional support, rehabilitation services and other training designed to help people with sight loss live independently and confidently.  In our view, now is the time to get the legislation on e-scooter usage right as their popularity is growing every day.  It is an opportunity to learn lessons from other countries as this legislation will govern both private ownership and shared public schemes that will operate in cities. </p> <p>  E-scooters have a role to play in improving our carbon footprint and increasing transport options for people on short journeys, but guaranteeing the safety of both rider and pedestrians must be paramount.  To achieve this, a suite of minimum safety standards must be enshrined in law.  These include a prohibition of usage on footpaths or shared spaces; a requirement for specific parking bays; the installation of a universal sound solution, which is robustly tested and researched to allow pedestrians to hear them approaching; and a maximum speed limit of 12 km/h on foot of the issues highlighted by my colleagues from IWA and Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind.  The legislation as drafted allows for maximum speed limit of 25 km/h and allows for local authorities to reduce this to 20 km/h in certain areas or on particular roads.  However, we believe this is still too high.  We are calling for this maximum speed limit to be reduced to 12 km/h.  This would help to reduce risk for pedestrians and e-scooter riders.  We are also calling for additional consideration to be given to lower speeds around certain areas such as schools, with the speed limit in this area being reduced to 6 km/h.  Go-slow zones via geofencing in shared schemes may be one element to consider, perhaps, in subsequent legislation.  The key issue is enforcement to ensure there is adherence with the speed limit.  </p> <p>  On the sound alert system, given the silent nature of e-scooters, people who are blind or vision impaired will have no way of knowing e-scooters are approaching until they are extremely close and unless there is a sound omitted from the e-scooter.  Since July 2021, under EU regulation all manufacturers are mandated to equiptheir new electric and hybrid vehicles with an alert vehicular acoustic system, AVAS.  While this regulation does not cover e-scooters, itpresents an opportunity for Ireland to lead out onlegislation in this area. NCBI recommends a universal sound solution that has been tested in the local context and scientifically proven to be effective.  Such technological research is currently under way and while it will not be ready when the legislation is passed, provision should be made in law to allow for it.  </p> <p>  Given the legislation applies to both private ownership and shared schemes we believe the installation of an audio into the design of the e-scooter would be raising the standards of safety.  Shared scheme providers are already looking at this, but it needs to be robustly tested to guarantee there are no unintended consequences and it is complementary to the sounds applicable to electric cars.  In addition to this sound, we believe that shared scheme operators should offer e-scooters with bells which are easily accessible tothe driver without them having to move their handsfrom the handlebars. </p> <p>  I would like to give the committee a flavour of the experiences of some of our service users.</p><p>We conducted a small survey and found that of the respondents, 75% reported incidents on footpaths, 62% of respondents reported incidents on multiple occasions and 57% of respondents reported electric scooter usage reduced their confidence to get out and about safely.  This is the prevailing view not just in Dublin as responses were secured right across the country, which illustrates that there is a genuine concern about the increased use of electric scooters and they should be appropriately regulated.<br/><br/>I will conclude by relating what an individual said to me:</p><blockquote>	I had a collision with an electric scooter around eight months ago on my way to work.  Thankfully, I was not injured but the rider was knocked to the ground.  I am very grateful this collision occurred after I had done extensive mobility training and was confident going on my usual route.  If it had happened to me six months earlier it would have severely set me back, knocked my confidence and therefore stopping me travelling independently to work. </blockquote><p>I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

We are partnering with the National Council for the Blind and the Irish Wheelchair Association in our position paper.  As part of my opening statement, I will focus on two key areas of concern for our clients and members.  The first is the need for clear and absolute restrictions to be placed on the use of electric scooters on footpaths, shared space and dual walking and cycling paths.  There is a clear need for insurance requirements and age limits on the use of electric scooters.<br/><br/>In our more than 40-year history, we have worked to change lives.  In the past year we have provided 34 guide dogs to people who are blind and vision-impaired and 43 assistance dogs to families of children with autism.  These highly trained, reliable, sociable working dogs help improve the independence and mobility of their owners.  As one client said, the dog &quot;allows me to live my life on my terms&quot;.  As a guide dog owner, I understand completely the positive impact my guide dog, Higgins, has had on my life.<br/><br/>Guide dogs are a mobility aid for people who are blind or vision-impaired and they help their owners to avoid obstacles and help them when changes in floor surfaces are approaching, such as with kerbs and steps.  They also help to locate doorways to buildings, buses and trains.  Assistance dogs help keep children with autism calm and stop them from bolting and endangering themselves.  Guide and assistance dogs work really hard and concentrate to keep their owners safe but they can be startled by electric scooters due to their silent nature.  It can be difficult for dogs to pre-empt danger as a result and react appropriately.  These dogs may be forced to stop guiding and walking their owner in such cases as it is their only way to communicate to their owners an obstacle or hazard.  This can be disorientating and confusing for people who are blind and vision-impaired and for children with autism.<br/><br/>Guide dogs and assistance dogs help people with disabilities to move about more freely and independently in their communities.  They help their owner to participate fully in their community, get to work and socialise.  In a recent survey, we found 89% of clients are concerned about their safety with regard to the use of electric scooters.  Clients have said that electric scooters on footpaths will completely destroy their mobility, while some will find they will be more reluctant to go out and about independently if electric scooters are in their environment.  Some are concerned about the anxiety caused to children with autism and that family outings will be made more difficult.  The survey indicates that 53% of our clients have already had a negative encounter, including near collisions, with an electric scooter.  One assistance dog owner states:</p> <blockquote> 	Riding on footpaths will cause problems.  We have already had two collisions, riding off road, leaving my daughter crying on the footpath. </blockquote> <p>The survey indicates 90% of clients and members believe electric scooters should not be allowed on footpaths or in any pedestrian or shared space areas.  We are asking the committee to review the Bill and ensure it can be amended appropriately so the people who use guide dogs and assistance dogs can have the confidence and ability to get out and about without the worry of colliding with electric scooters or any potential danger of personal injury.<br/><br/>We call on the committee to ensure the Bill is amended to allow clear prohibitions to be placed on electric scooters and to make it an offence for those scooters to be on footpaths, using pedestrian crossings or using dual cycle or walking paths.  They should also be prohibited from encroaching on people who are out and about with their guide dogs and assistance dogs, as this makes it almost impossible for people to get out and about safely and independently.  We are also asking for the Bill to be amended so that appropriate insurance requirements can be put in place.  This will include the requirement for a provisional licence so that people using electric scooters have to undergo an appropriate training course in road safety and the use of the vehicles.  This would make them more aware of the people around them.  We also ask for the minimum age limit to be enforced appropriately.  Currently, providers of electric scooters are only prohibited from selling them to people under the age of 16 but we must ensure there is a requirement for a provisional licence and insurance under the Bill.  This would ensure people under the age of 16 would not be able to use electric scooters when out and about in public places, potentially endangering other people out and about who are trying to walk and travel.<br/><br/>I thank the committee for its time today so we could voice our concerns and convey the results of our recent survey.  There is a strong need for the Bill to be amended so that people who are blind and vision-impaired, along with children with autism, can move freely and confidently through the environment without being worried about being encroached upon by these scooters that would force dogs to stop guiding and walking because of being startled by the electric scooter.  It is very disorienting for them in trying to move freely through that environment.</p></speech>

I also thank the NCBI for its work on this.  I might not be able to stay for the entire meeting because I am caring for my son and he has needs that may need attending to.  I just wanted to give my own experience of somebody living with sight loss and also as somebody with a son with autism and an assistance dog.  I am lucky my sight loss is not huge at the moment but even so, it still has a major impact on life every time I go out.  Once I step outside the door it is into a dynamic, ever-changing environment and one needs a very high level of confidence to negotiate around the environment if one has a disability.  We rely on footpaths being maintained and clear, audio signals at road crossings, contrasting steps and people observing traffic lights.  All of these are essential to our independence.</p> <p>  The footpaths are our space and the only space we have to get around our community.  If electric scooters are allowed to use the same space as us - the footpath - our space will be compromised.  There is no other environment where we would expect a person to interact with an electric device that has the potential to move at a great speed, expecting to share that environment safely and in an unrestricted way.  It is important to remember that throughout the country not all footpaths are the same.  In smaller towns and villages with medieval centres, footpaths can be quite narrow and they are a problem in any circumstances, even to ordinary pedestrians.</p><p>Adding an e-scooter into those environments compromises the pedestrian entirely.  I emphasise that when pedestrians are on the footpath and there are e-scooters, bikes or anything else there as well, then the pedestrian is compromised.  Similarly shared spaces such as parks are greatly important for us.  They allow us time to socialise and to enjoy time together.  E-scooters should not be allowed in parks without restrictions.  We have had several incidents of near misses with them locally, and it is a recipe for disaster.  </p><p> To give an outline of the situation when we are out walking with our assistance dog, and the committee may not understand this, the dog is always looking for a route that runs in a straight line.  When people are weaving in and out of our environment, criss-crossing with e-scooters, bikes, or things like that, that throws the dog off and it has to continually recalibrate where it is going.  The dog regards itself and the person it is assisting as one unit, so there are two people involved in our case and the dog it is trying to work out things in the context of our position in the space where people may be weaving in and out.  Equally, as Ms Kennedy said, the dog cannot hear the e-scooters, and neither can I.  I also cannot see them.  E-scooters can come right up next to me, right in front of the dog, and then it is thrown completely.  I argue strongly for speed limit restrictions on e-scooters and the use of geo-sensing mechanisms to ensure that there are some restrictions put on them in some areas for everyone's safety.  I say that because there is an issue here with the safety of those using the e-scooters as well.  The balance on those machines is not great, so I imagine there would be some impact if the riders knocked into someone.  </p><p> Equally, on several occasions in the last two years bikes and e-scooters have come close to the assistance dog and passed by very quickly, and that has stunned her and stopped her from working.  In one incident, an e-scooter went into the back of the dog.  It was not a huge impact, but it was enough to stop her and she would not work.  She refused the jacket for two months.  That was an enormous setback for us.  Not only was it not possible for us to go out, but my son's safety was compromised when we were out because he did not have his assistance dog.  There is also the issue for us concerning whether it is possible or safe to rehabilitate the dog.  There is also the worry about whether something like that might happen again.  It was that incident that really motivated me to have an input on this legislation.  There is also a massive financial cost incurred by the charity if it is necessary to replace the dog.  In addition, it is impossible to know if the next dog will bond or how much work will be involved in that respect.  There is much uncertainty.  An incident like the one I described could, therefore, change someone's life dramatically.  In that context, I reiterate that e-scooters should be banned from using footpaths, speed limits should be imposed on them and their use should be restricted in areas of mixed use.  </p><p> The other aspect that should be considered is that incidents like the one I spoke of bring people into personal conflict with complete strangers.  There is a risk of injury to people from being bumped into by the e-scooter and, indeed, a risk for the rider of the e-scooter as well.  Equally, that raises the question of whether such a conflict is what people might be able for or wish to involved in on a given day.  We have experienced a great deal of such conflict in the past two years, but before that as well.  People might sometimes shout when the dog is taken in somewhere, and we must consider the impact such experiences have on people.  It is hugely wearing psychologically on me as the carer, and the significant impact on the people with autism means that it can completely throw them.  It can have a huge impact on their sense of well-being and their interactions with the local community.  </p><p> That is where I am at in this situation.  My questions on this matter concern who is going to implement this and how it is going to be implemented in the context of the Garda and enforcement.  I thank the committee again for the invitation to contribute.</p></speech>

He is seven years of age so he is a very well established guide dog and has good experience and confidence getting me out and about.  I also have a one-year old daughter who I have to bring with me and carry with me on the buggy at times.  The guide dog is guiding me and helping me get my daughter from A to B.  My experience is that the e-scooters do rush up on the footpath.  All you can do is stop.  Often the people on the e-scooters think that we are doing it to be polite and to accommodate them.  They often whizz by saying "thank you".  They think it is great that we stop.  They do not realise that it is completely disorienting to us and startling to the dog.  I have to settle my guide dog again and refocus him because he is under a lot of pressure at times to ensure that not only am I being safe but that my daughter is safe as well.  That is the issue and the concern.</p> <p>  I have worked with Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind for a number of years and have also been vision impaired since 13 years, so it is for a good number of years.  I am finding that pedestrian access is becoming more and more difficult.  Our experiences with e-scooters have become even more common in the recent months and weeks because people are trying to be more climate friendly and there being less traffic.  We have been making compromises.  Traditionally the kerb edge of the footpath was 120 mm.  That was the best height to stop cars from going up onto the pavement and the best height for people who are visually impaired to know when they are stepping off onto the road.  Kerbs have been being lowered since the 1980s to help calm traffic and to make drivers feel more at risk of causing an accident in order that they will drive more slowly and be more aware of other road users.  That is a compromise that we have been making.  It has gone from 120 mm down to 80 mm and to 60 mm and it is going even lower than that.  The absolute minimum requirement we can take is 40 mm.  It is making urban areas very difficult.  We do not even know we were on the road half the time because the kerbs are going so low.  Some people believe that tactile paving to mark the difference between the footpath and the road is the optimum solution to ensuring that blind or visually impaired people are safe and know we are on the footpath but it most certainly is not.  The kerb is what we need.  We have been working hard and we have been compromising.  Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind has been adapting its training and the work of our dogs.  We have been training our dogs to recognise tactile paving and so on.  You can appreciate the stress we are under.  This is one more thing that is happening to accommodate the mainstream and the move towards less traffic in the street and so on but what it is doing is pushing people with disabilities out more and more.  We are really concerned and worried about this.  The risk of colliding and getting into an accident with an e-scooter is highly likely.  It has been happening.  For myself, blind with a guide dog, getting out and about with my one-year old is difficult enough as it is but it will become almost impossible if e-scooters will be up on the pavement and getting in our way.</p></speech>

Can she tell us about what happened and the circumstances?  Can she tell us how it is impacting on a day-to-day basis?</p></speech>

Therefore when e-scooters, bicycles and things like that come along, it does seriously knock people's confidence.  In this case, the individual was walking on their way to work on a route with which he was very familiar because we walked with him and trained him on this route to be familiar with certain junctions and roads.  He felt genuinely confident after beginning to accept his sight loss and adjust to his new sight.  That individual did not hear a thing.  The e-scooter came up on the kerb.  Thankfully the individual was not injured but it did knock the driver off the scooter.  Only for the fact that this person had built up the confidence in navigating his way safely and independently was he able to keep going on his journey.  Had he not undergone that training, it would have genuinely set him back in his ability to get out safely.</p></speech>

The Irish Wheelchair Association's submission sought that there would be two sides of the coin both in ownership and the use of e-scooters, so that they would be confined to those over 16 years.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.488" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fulham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#F00700"><p>Yes.  The legislation addresses the supply of e-scooters and their sale to those over 16 years but there is no provision in the legislation addressing their usage.  That is something that is key to be addressed and it must be consistent in respect of both sale and usage.  Let us be brutally honest.  At 16 years we are looking for maturity in behaviour.  These are not toys, they are mobility devices.  Our concern would be to address that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.489" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#F00800"><p>The Irish Wheelchair Association is looking for reduced speeds.  Could it be done on a zonal basis so that certain areas would have higher speeds than others?  Is the association looking for designated parking for e-scooters in various locations, perhaps within designated areas?  Are they the two things being sought?</p></speech>

With pedestrian areas or pedestrian-only streets they can be kept out or the speed of the scooter can be brought down but that has to be enshrined in regulation and law.  We require and request designated parking areas.  Lived experience is that free-floating or locked-to parking where scooters can be left on stands just parked anywhere or are locked to poles or railings or fences are inevitably badly parked and they fall over and get in the way.  Our experience is based on precedents and facts, so that is why we are looking for designated parking areas.</p></speech>

I think the Chair summed it up when he spoke of their lived experience and understanding.  What is needed is interaction with the Department particularly when we get closer to what we are proposing.  People might have expected that the Bill would include more detail on how these e-scooters were to be used but much of it will be left up to regulation.  We need to get into the nitty-gritty of that.  I accept the difficulties that the witnesses are outlining.  Some of it is about the townscapes and planning and our road infrastructure.  Like the reply to the person asking for directions in Kerry, I would not start from here.  We just do not have wide enough roads or sufficient space in some places and that creates its own difficulties.  I will go through some of the points made by the witnesses and will seek their ideas on some notions I will throw out.</p><p>I will also refer to some of the general conversations we have had with regard to people who have been proposing schemes and the like.  Everybody accepts we cannot have these dumped everywhere and that there must be rules about some type of parking.  If we were having a conversation about accessibility and so forth, I imagine it would be about the fact that people parking on pavements has created huge obstacles for the witnesses and the people in their organisations.</p><p> On the question of insurance and licensing, we all accept there has to be an age limit in respect of usage, but it is a fact that one does not need insurance to cycle.  The idea with some of these schemes, similar to the Dublinbikes scheme, is that one does not need a licence or a helmet so that makes it relatively easy for people to use it.  That is accepting the argument that has been made about geofencing, that there are shared spaces, that pavements might not be the place we want this to happen and that there is peaceful coexistence, for want of a better term.  However, I will just deal with insurance and licensing.  Again, we can put things in and we can want them, but they might not necessarily be deliverable.  I have no skin in the game in this regard.</p></speech>

E-scooters are battery operated.  I do not want to get into the technology of wattage and power because I am not qualified to do so, but for the purpose of looking at that, at what point does it move to a moped?  Looking at the insurance, and Ms Kennedy and Ms Tinsley might have other comments on this as Ms Kennedy addressed insurance as well, it is about who has the liability and who is in the right and the wrong in an accident if somebody is impacted by a scooter.  E-scooters are not on footpaths if there are speed limits.  If we have a number of other controls, perhaps there can be some discussions about what the insurance would be.  That is my comment on insurance.  I do not have the answer, but they are my thoughts and it could be discussed with the Department.</p> <p>  As regards the age limit, we all have addressed it.  This is very specific.  We are moving into battery operated, so where does the knowledge for the user of the e-scooter come from?  If we want maturity, it is the older one sets the limit.  One would hope one would have the maturity, although it is not a given.  From that point of view, it is understanding that and that dynamic.</p></speech>

Some type of training has to be involved, whether that is for buying, using or using a shared scheme.  There may be a simplified way to do it.  Then if there are limits relating to the speed of the vehicle combined with those other mitigations and protections with regard to where one can and cannot use it, that should address some of that.  We probably should look into best practice as regards the sound system, to move on to the next matter.  I am also interested in where the 12 km speed came from.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.497" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#G00600"><p>That was from me.  The Deputy is correct.  We need to learn from best practice and from other jurisdictions where these e-scooters have been operational for a longer time than they have been here.  To add to the point regarding insurance, one consideration would be to make sure that where there is an operator of a shared ownership scheme similar to the Dublinbikes scheme, any person joining that scheme would have to undergo some rider training provided by the provider so the person would be aware of the needs of both pedestrians and individuals with mobility issues.  It is imperative they are conscious of that.  Appropriate training should be provided by those providers.</p> <p>  As regards the speed limit, this was considered by multiple other countries and they have reduced their speed limits to about 20 km.  It has already been reviewed in other countries.  The rationale for 12 km was to instil an element of best practice and to be mindful of the vulnerability of the rider if he or she is going at top speed and is not wearing a helmet and so forth, as well as the pedestrians we are very concerned about.  If it is operational on footpaths, that obviously increases the risk of collision.  Reducing the speed reduces the risk.</p></speech>

It is about seeing what works, what has not worked, where the dangers are and, as Ms Tinsley said, what is even being reviewed at this time.  To some degree the genie is out of the bottle in the sense that, in the past year, we have seen very many more of these things.  To be honest, and I am on the record about this, I arrived home one day to find one in the house, unfortunately.  My 17-year-old had decided it was a good idea to get it.  He managed to break the battery within two days and I have not offered to fix it.  I am sure he is like every other teenager one sees on them in Dundalk.  They are wearing black tracksuits and there is no evidence of lighting.  The only sound one will hear from them is when one of them crashes into somebody.  However, I also see that it has taken root as a means of active travel.  It is how we can wed that with the witnesses' needs.  That will mean a great deal more interaction.  On one level there is a requirement on us to do work, but there is also a requirement on the Department and the Minister to come forward with a discussion space for looking at these speeds, at a training scheme, for want of a better term, and then what is and is not doable.  That has to be done as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I have probably used up most of my time.  I will put a request to all the witnesses.  There are obviously the specific requests contained in their submissions and opening statements.  I have had a number of submissions locally from accessibility activists, people who are dealing with their own issues or other people within their organisations who have come to me about difficulties they have where I come from.  They talked about the difficulties of getting buses, especially as regards wheelchairs, and buses not picking them up, being told lifts do not work, the design of pavements, which Ms Kennedy spoke about, and the fact new estates are not suited at times for bus pick-up points and so forth.  We basically have a difficulty with town planning, particularly as it relates to transport in general.  Would it be possible to get a submission from the witnesses on that?  I know it is a lot to ask and I am sorry about that, but it is a piece of work we have to do ourselves.  That will add to our conversations when we are dealing with issues relating to taxis, bus, rail and so forth in the future.</p></speech>

Throughout Second Stage many Deputies raised the issues that are encountered with this mode of transport.  There has not been any level of engagement with these groups so I propose that we follow up on that.  I ask the Chairman to give me guidance on what he intends to do, as Chairman of this committee, to secure robust engagement with officials in order to get the changes that are needed and for Department officials to listen to these groups?</p></speech>

I am referring to the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and the National Council for the Blind Ireland.  I will state that they have made submissions to the Department and that we have noted that the submissions have been acknowledged.  I will ask for constructive active engagement.  I will ask for a meeting with the representative bodies to discuss the specific items that they have raised.  I will ask how they will be addressed and for a meeting to be arranged as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Such behaviour will become commonplace if it is not dealt with in this Bill.  A person with a disability is entitled to walk with her dog and daughter on a footpath as footpaths are for common use.  A joint submission has been made and I am disappointed that only an acknowledgement has been received to date.  I strongly support the call for robust engagement on foot of this meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee whereby the officials from the Department, the Minister and Minister of State would sit down with these groups to iron out some of the issues.  I thank all of the witnesses for their submissions today and assure them that we, as a committee, will follow up this issue.</p></speech>

What engagement have the witnesses had with representatives of e-scooter companies and providers?  In the last number of months since this e-scooter legislation has been in gestation, and First Stage has been published, there has been a proliferation of e-scooter companies seeking to speak to politicians.  What level of engagement has there been with the organisations?  How have the engagements gone?  I do not wish to betray any confidential aspects of meetings but how receptive were the e-scooter companies to their cases?  What did they ask the companies to do in terms of this legislation?</p> <p>  I want a further explanation of geo-fencing.  From a technical point of view I am interested in learning how geo-fencing works.  The information would fill a gap in my knowledge of same.</p> <p>  I made a submission on the greater Dublin strategy to the National Transport Authority last week.  Central to my submission was to ensure that we disability-proof all transport infrastructure and provision.  It is one thing saying that in a submission but it is legislation like this where we need to see the proof in the pudding.  Everything that has been asked for today in terms of making shared spaces and pathways safe for people with disabilities is fundamentally fair and needed.</p> <p>  I was struck by what Ms Kennedy, I think, said about making legislation for the mainstream.  This is not how this legislation should progress and I hope that it is not seen like that.  We need to ensure that this legislation is as disability proofed as possible.  What has come through in the papers that were submitted previously and in the submissions and contributions that were made today are very fair and something that we need to strive to include in the legislation.  I am interested in hearing answers to my first set of questions and I hope that someone can answer my question on geo-fencing.</p></speech>

Our principle of engagement with them is equal and we gave them the same information with the purpose of ensuring the safe implementation of e-scooter usage in terms of the people whom we represent.  That is the premise on which we engaged with each company.  We shared the same information but we worked with each of them in a way that was specific to them.  We sit on safety boards that they may have, or they look for position papers or they question us on various pieces of safety information.  Most of the e-scooter providers have been very interested and open to engage with us around this, which I would expect given that they seek to move their business into the Irish market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.508" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms L&eacute;an Kennedy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#H00900"><p>Similar to the Irish Wheelchair Association, some companies have contacted us.   They have told us that they were open to hearing our concerns, that they wanted to know what changes they could make to make e-scooter use friendlier and safer around people with disabilities and other people using walkways and so on.  They stated that they really feel strongly that smart technology will be a big factor in helping to improve safety and more but we have not been convinced of that yet.  The companies have offered to show us examples of how the technology has worked in different countries and how well it has been implemented.  In our research we have found that an awful lot of countries, especially EU member states, are pushing back because they have had so many issues with legalising e-scooters in terms of personal injury claims and so on.</p> <p>  Our research does not show this technology works.  Yes, the companies have been in touch and expressed a desire to do projects.  They want to do testing and conduct studies with our service users.  We are not convinced that there is a solution beyond what we have asked for in our positional paper.  As a starting point, the Bill needs to be amended as we have asked, in terms of the points that we have raised in our paper, to make it in any way workable for people with disabilities but in its current state it is not workable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#J00100"><p>From an NCBI point of view, similar to others, we have been approached by multiple providers in the last 18 months, all seeking to learn more about the issues and concerns that will affect people who are blind or vision impaired.  Some of them have been more proactive in trying to resolve some of these concerns and showcasing what they can do as providers.  Some of them have asked us to sit on safety boards, as mentioned by other speakers, but, all in all, we have been very explicit in the concerns we have with e-scooter provision.  As I said, some of them have been quite proactive and one of them was keen to show us the work it is doing on the installation of an audio signal on the e-scooter it is designing.  While we were happy to give some initial feedback, as I said my presentation, it is very important that those sounds that could be attributed to an e-scooter are robustly and scientifically examined so it is not a rush job just to meet a commercial need, but rather it is fully scientifically underpinned with evidence that this is the best sound to include on an e-scooter.  That is a bit of a work in progress.</p> <p>  My understanding is that geofencing is a digital tool which can be inserted in an e-scooter that will enable the shared scheme providers to map where each of their suite of e-scooters is when in operation.  It can be used as a tool to prohibit their usage on pedestrianised zones or that kind of thing.  It is not a silver bullet because there are a number of flaws with it.  If it is a GPS-based system, it can often be the case that where the e-scooter says it is and where it actually is are slightly different.  As a result, it might not be in its designated parking bay where it should be and may be a couple of metres away, which could mean it is not parked properly and could cause an obstruction.  Likewise, if they were introduced on e-scooter shared schemes, there is no guarantee it would be operational on private e-scooters, which is a concern for us.</p></speech>

I apologise as I had to leave for a time and I hope I do not repeat the questions.  I read the opening statements and I recognised the issues raised as I was in Brussels for a while.  Brussels is one of the examples of how not to do e-scooters because the system there means e-scooters are just dumped on the road and people are paid in the gig economy to bring them in and charge them in their houses.  Trying to navigate the streets of Strasbourg or Brussels is a complete nightmare if people are visually impaired.  It is important we get this right and learn from the mistakes of other countries which are now trying retrospectively to regulate e-scooter use.</p> <p>  My questions for the witnesses are around the insurance issue in particular.  I listened to Mr. Fulham, who pointed out that these are battery-operated and they are not the same as a bicycle.  Are there examples where this has been introduced in other jurisdictions and has worked?  Some e-scooters are very powerful and some have small batteries.  Could we have a graded system so that if they go over a certain speed, people would fall foul of having to get car insurance?  Are there good examples of best practice in terms of insurance in other European countries?</p> <p>  It is the same with regard to sound.  Will somebody be enforcing that or would that have to be done at an EU level because it is the Single Market and has to be enforced?  While this might be dealt with in national legislation, the products might be produced within the Single Market.  Is that going to prevent us introducing those regulations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fulham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#J00800"><p>I thank the Senator for the questions.  Yes, there are examples of various practices across Europe in regard to insurance and the requirements, even on the broader spectrum with regard to safety such as the use of safety helmets and the requirement to wear a high-viz jacket.  For example, in Germany, it is necessary to get insurance.  As I said in my opening statement, there are examples of best practice out there and we can learn from the mistakes.  Even in looking to parking, Paris had a similar problem to the one in Brussels and the authorities contacted the e-scooter providers and brought them in.</p> <p>  The one point I would make in addressing all of this is that the scheme providers are one element but we need to emphasise Ms Tinsley&rsquo;s point that the legal framework is so important.  We have some mechanisms to work with the scheme providers and they are the ones with the technology, so we need the potential insurance schemes to cover their operations.  In private e-scooter ownership, that does not exist and, therefore, the legal framework in terms of legislation and regulation is critical to cover what is a gaping hole in what is being proposed at the moment.</p> <p>  As was said, there is also the issue with buggies.  I am a dad and I have had both, although it is an unusual sight to see an e-scooter and a buggy coming along the path.  This is about vision impairment but it is also about limited mobility.  We are talking about people who are getting older and while they may not have an impairment now, they might have one when they are older.  We always say to people that while they might not need us now, they may need us in the future.  In the scope of who needs to be included in this conversation, it is important to remember that.</p></speech>

One of the reasons behind our ask in the paper is the hope that putting an insurance policy system in place would deter bad behaviour by people using e-scooters, such as going up on footpaths when it is prohibited, and so on.</p> <p>  People who are blind or vision impaired like me have an extra concern in terms of how we would identify someone who is using an e-scooter that has had a collision with us.  We need to ensure there is an accessible plate on the e-scooter and we also need a system in place whereby we can identify the e-scooter user.  The hope is that this would come under a good insurance policy.  There are asks, and how we explored and examined it was by looking at how we could encourage better behaviour from people using e-scooters when the law is implemented.</p></speech>

In regard to the insurance requirement, it is mandatory in some of our European neighbours, for example, Germany and France, whereas it is optional in other countries, so that is something we need greater consistency on.</p> <p>  In terms of the sound, again, taking the learning from the EU, there is a clear EU regulation that mandates that sound needs to be inserted on all electric and hybrid vehicles from July of last year.  Using that as a model, we can translate it into something similar for the e-scooter sector.  I know that, for example, some countries such as the UK and Australia had installed sounds on e-scooters but they were not robustly tested or scientifically proven, and it was done in a rushed manner.  The feedback they got from pedestrians, providers and users was that the sound was not effective so they have withdrawn that pilot.</p><p>There is plenty of scope to improve the research and the evidence base to make sure we arrive at a sound that can be used and can be consistent across Europe.  As I said, if we use the model that applies to electric vehicles, it could be a solution.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  The whole insurance thing is the most difficult part of this.  It is something that we really need to address.  As Ms Tinsley and Ms Kennedy stated and as I set out in my written submission, if a person has an impact with us, there is potential for an injury that you would not get over easily.  There could be long-term effects.  There is no comeback or way of identifying the person unless the e-scooter is registered.  All of those things may need to be considered for the safety of people with disabilities as well as the general public.  There is a need to view it as being on a sliding scale because there are people who have an impairment but not a disability.   They, too, will be impacted if there are many e-scooter users on footpaths.  Even if they are not injured, an awful lot of people will be deterred from being independent.  If an e-scooter suddenly appearing in your central field of vision because you have not detected it in your peripheral vision, you get a terrible fright and are really shaken.  I have experienced that.  It does not take many such experiences to shake your confidence in being able to go out.  It is certainly an issue for me when I go out with my son attached to an assistance dog.  When an e-scooter went into the back of Polly, I was faced with the situation of having to get the dog and my son home safely.  It is a complex situation.  If we tackle it now, we can put in measures to address this.  We hope insurance and registration would cause to people to take note of the need to be responsible in the ownership and usage of e-scooters.</p></speech>

On the issue of audio, if there is an EU directive in respect of electric and hybrid vehicles, I suspect a similar directive would be needed in respect of e-scooters, rather than being able to do it nationally.  That does not mean it is not worth pursuing.  It may be worthwhile for the organisations represented here today to get in touch with their MEPs and lobby them to push for it.  It is an excellent suggestion.  Only this morning, I was spooked by an e-scooter that came up behind me while I was out for a run.  They appear out of nowhere.  It is a very practical request to have the sound but I am just flagging that it may fall foul of the Single Market, which is unfortunate.</p></speech>

I will direct my first question to Ms Tinsley and Mr. Fulham.  We know there are many issues that are not dealt with in the legislation and we understand the Minister intends to bring in regulations to address those issues.  Do our guests have a perspective in terms of what should be included in the legislation and what can be adequately addressed in regulation?  Does it make a difference?</p> <p>  My sense from the Government is that, largely, these vehicles are to be treated as being comparable with bicycles.  A requirement for registration and insurance might be perceived as a barrier to access.  Of course, the Government wants to realise the opportunity of these vehicles to get people out of their cars, ultimately, and for them to be part of the greater mix.  If the issue of the sound was addressed - I am hearing clearly the concerns in that regard - and these vehicles were properly regulated in terms of where they can travel, the speeds they can go and the age restrictions, would that mitigate or address some of the issues relating to insurance and registration?  Specifically on insurance, is it needed across the board?  Is it just needed for the providers of shared schemes or for individuals as well?</p></speech>

As regards his point that e-scooters will be treated in a manner similar to bicycles, if that is to be the case, we need consistency.  Bicycles are not currently allowed on footpaths.  It is most unsettling to see a bicycle or an e-scooter coming at you on the footpath, but there is a common perception in terms of public behaviour that cycling on the footpath is frowned upon.  People may become aggressive and vociferous about it, but that is not necessarily so in the case of e-scooters.  In terms of consistency, what needs to be brought into the equation is the fact that an increasing number of scooters are battery-powered rather than manual.  If there were to be consistency with the requirements for mopeds and motorbikes, a person would need to be 16 to start learning how to use them and would need a licence and insurance.  Should e-scooters be placed in that category?  I am not here to present solutions because there is far more work to be done.  We are here to advocate on the issues.  Those are my thoughts.  If there is to be consistency, it must be consistent.</p> <p>  On the issue of regulation as compared with legislation, my concern with regulation again relates to consistency.  For example, there is the potential for different speed limits in different regions of the country such that there would be different limits in Limerick, Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford or wherever.  If these issues were addressed in legislation, that would provide a more robust framework.  I think the key to all this is discussion, which probably has not taken place to date.</p></speech>

On the issue of regulation versus legislation, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Fulham regarding the need for clear parameters to be put into the legislation.  For us, these are very basic minimum standards that need to be applied to ensure consistent regulation.  Those standards relate to speed, clear prohibition of usage on footpaths, the insertion of the sound, clear designated parking bays and a minimum age restriction.  For us, those are the basics that need to go into legislation.  If they are not clearly set out in legislation, problems will arise in the context of enforcement.  It is unclear in the legislation as it stands who will be fully enforcing it.  Will that fall to the Garda or to local authorities?  There needs to be greater clarity in that regard because without clear enforcement this legislation will not become live or will not be fully abided by.  We need clear enforcement in order to manage pedestrian and wider behaviour and to ensure the whole environment is safe for everybody.</p> <p>  As regards whether having these basic minimum safety standards would mitigate against the need for insurance, that is a bigger debate.  There is a big difference between private ownership and shared scheme ownership, yet both models are being placed within this legislative framework.  We need to be clear.  One does not necessarily want to have distinctions.  At the end of the day, e-scooter riders are e-scooter riders, so the same parameters need to apply.</p></speech>

I have a follow-up question on the broader point.  I echo the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; regarding the broader issues in respect of accessibility, particularly in terms of public transport.</p><p>I want to take the opportunity to address some of those issues today.  I will raise a couple of measures the Government has taken in recent times.  There has been a doubling of fines to try to tackle the issue of parking of footpaths.  What is our guests' sense of that and the effectiveness of that response?  Some people are pointing towards the need for enforcement.</p><p> Other issues were the standing down of the board of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and the issue around primary medical certificates.  This goes back a long time.  There have been issues about definitions and criteria, as well as the exclusion of individuals from those schemes.  Will each of our guests comment on their sense of those changes and what needs to be done to improve?  Perhaps Ms Kennedy would start.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.529" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms L&eacute;an Kennedy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  With regard to illegal parking and the issues it causes for clients and members of the Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind, enforcement is the issue.  It can vary regionally and county by county.  During the day, in most areas, it is a matter for the local authority traffic warden to implement fines and to do the work of being vigilant about illegal parking.  In the evening, it falls to the Garda.  Enforcement depends on the time of day, which means that people with a disability have to think about who to contact and to whom to submit a complaint, depending on who is enforcing the rules.</p> <p>  I will give an example of the issues and experiences of our clients.  I know of a blind woman who uses a guide dog and lives in a town.  When she gets off her bus coming home from work, she is forced into the middle of the road, in the midst of cyclists, because there are cars parked beside the bus stop.  Those cars are being parked there because the drivers have decided it is the best place to park when they are shopping in the local Aldi.  This is the type of issue people are having.  We need to make sure that the rules are tightened and enforced more appropriately around e-scooter use, parking bays and all of that so we can stop this type of behaviour.  It really does put people with disabilities at considerable risk.</p></speech>

I think we would all echo what Ms Kennedy has said.  The introduction of the increased fine is welcome as a measure because there is nothing that influences behavioural change than a hit in one's back pocket, to be honest.  That is what people react to.  However, the key to that is implementation so if the rules are not enforced, the change, while welcome, will not be effective.  The key to delivery is enforcement.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about the primary medical certificates.  We are all probably in agreement that a major review of primary medical certificates needs to be undertaken.  As to the question on eligibility, the resignation of the board will in all likelihood mean a public raising of the concerns and frustrations around the primary medical certificate issue.  I say that without any inside information about the board and it was not a matter I was coming here to address today.  We must remember, alongside that issue, the mobility allowance and transport grant were stopped nearly a decade ago and have not come back.  The committee knows there is a broad suite of issues.  A review is required of the primary medical certificate.  It is as simple as that.  The sooner it can get under way, the better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.531" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#L00400"><p>I totally agree with what has been said about a review of the primary medical certificate.  I would like it to include people with intellectual disabilities or autism, people who, in the severe category, will definitely never hold independent employment.  They definitely need preferential parking for ease of access for their carers and themselves.  That needs to be looked at and there are probably other issues around that and conditions that would need to be included.</p> <p>  Illegal parking is a continuing issue.  People are regularly forced into the bus lane because a driver has randomly decided to park in the way.  When one goes out on a journey, one does not know if that is going to be an obstacle unless it is a regular occurrence, in which case one can get the Garda to deal with it.  There is still a lot to be done in terms of public awareness in that regard.  Some of that is down to the fact that, in our local communities, we need to be visible and active in raising our rights, concerns and issues in order that people understand where we are coming from.</p> <p>  I do not meet the requirements under the eye test for driving but, equally, I am not registered blind.  If I were in employment, I would seriously have to consider giving it up because I would get more free travel.  We should look at that and other areas like it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.532" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#L00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  In connection with the increased fines that are going to be applicable from 2022 onwards, enforcement is crucial to changing driver behaviour and would result in greater public awareness.  Those things go hand in hand and I support my colleagues who mentioned that earlier.</p> <p>  On primary medical certificates, the Deputy is right that blindness is not regarded as a criterion so a review of that is required.  To Mr. Fulham's point, it needs to be regarded in the context of the full suite of supports available to empower people and ensure individuals can travel independently.  As Ms Murphy rightly said, there is a bunch of individuals who are not registered blind and are ineligible for free travel.  That can seriously compromise their independence so it needs to be looked at as part of a suite of measures.</p></speech>

As we try to craft legislation, one of the advantages of sitting on a committee is the opportunity to bring in experts and people with experience in an area.  That assists us to get the legislation right and to try to get it right first time.  We do not always succeed in doing that but we are going to make an attempt this time.</p> <p>  We are dealing with a lot of new technologies here, including electric vehicles and, in particular, scooters.  I want to put some questions to our guests, the first of which I will direct to Mr. Fulham and Ms Kennedy.  It relates to what they referred to in their opening statements.  My experience is that much of the time, our footpaths are a battle zone for pedestrians, vulnerable users, schoolchildren, people in wheelchairs, elderly people and all of us.  We are all crammed onto footpaths.  We have given over masses of space to motorised vehicles.  There are some good graphics on this issue.  If one looks at the space left for vulnerable users, pedestrians and cyclists, all of us who are vulnerable to cars, compared to what cars get, it is completely unfair and inequitable.  This has been planned.  We have planned for the dominance of cars for the past 60 years in the way we have designed our towns and the way we have allowed planning to sprawl.  We have created car dependency.  That often has impacts for air quality as well, which impacts all of us.</p><p>Some very vulnerable people are impacted by the air quality created by the disproportionate space that we give to motorised vehicles.  In terms of the unmanaged and careless parking to which Mr. Fulham referred, I often see cars parked on footpaths, cars not displaying a disability badge parked in a disability bay, and cars almost abandoned on double yellow lines.  It does create a real difficulty.</p><p> I also accept that I have seen bicycles locked to railings or locked around a pole that have fallen down and that are covering the entire footpath.  I completely accept that it is very difficult for somebody to manage, especially somebody with visual challenges or mobility challenges.  Most cyclists and users of EVs will accept that if they had allocated parking bays they would use them because they do not want to chain their bike to a railing and they want to put it in a proper bicycle stand.  Most people do, but we still do not have enough of them throughout towns and villages.</p><p> What we need to look at here is proper road space allocation.  We must ensure that we have the proper road space allocation in order that people on electric bikes, bicycles or scooters have a safe carriageway to travel along.  Footpaths need to be addressed.  Local authorities require better funding to make sure that footpaths are kept repaired and that they are not uneven, cracked and damaged with holes.  We see trees removed and stumps left; all sorts of carelessness goes on.  That is what we need to address, instead of pitching various footpath users or active travel users against each other.  The concentration needs to be on winning back that space that we have given over to cars in recent years.</p><p> In the Bill we are going to look at the opportunity for local authorities to trial these road allocation spaces.  In devising the Covid mobility measures we looked straight away at the allocation of footpath space to tables and chairs.  If we expect people to walk on the road, we must ensure it is a safe space.  When space is being allocated, we must maintain accessibility at all times.  We must consider that.  Does Mr. Fulham agree that more spaces need to be allocated to active travel and pedestrians while ensuring that the standards are high to maintain accessibility for all users?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.535" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fulham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#M00200"><p>I accept the principle.  To me as a person, use of the shared space and allocation of same is common sense, or uncommon sense, as it may be.  Key to all of this is consultation and the inclusion of the voices that need to be heard, which are the voices of people with disabilities, the elderly, those with visual impairments or whomever the audience is.</p> <p>  To go back to the point about opening up after lockdown when we put tables and chairs on footpaths, the question is where we expected people to go.  That is a primary example of where opening up after Covid and welcoming the opening up and businesses being able to re-engage and earn their living was not done in consultation.  As a disabled person, it felt that we went back 20 years in consultation.  What was put in place was not done in consultation.  The impact was that everybody - wheelchair users like me, visually impaired people and people with buggies - was discommoded and put out into a space where they should not have been.  It is perfectly acceptable in principle, but not the way it was done.</p></speech>

Did Ms Kennedy refer to that as well in her opening statement?  I refer to support for the proper road space allocation for users.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.537" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms L&eacute;an Kennedy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#M00400"><p>Yes.  That is a valid point.  We need to make sure that it is addressed.  We have been losing our pedestrian pathways bit by bit.  They have been getting narrower and narrower.  Ultimately, what is needed to facilitate people so that they can easily pass each other by on a footpath is to have 2 m, so that, for example, someone using a wheelchair can pass by someone with a guide dog.  That is a minimum requirement.  We should aim for a wider space than that.  We have been losing our space and, as the Deputy described, it has become the case that we are all fighting for a space.  That must be looked at.  We must also look at how people live in spaces in towns and what is the best way to ensure footpaths, road spaces and cycle lanes are put together side by side so that everyone can move freely and safely pass each other.</p> <p>  In recent times local authorities have tried to increase pedestrianisation on city streets.  Cork city is a good example in that 18 streets are now pedestrianised.  Street furniture is scattered all across the street and there is no space wide enough for people with disabilities, in particular someone with a guide dog or an assistance dog, to get past the tables and chairs.  There are trip hazards everywhere and it has become really dangerous.  We must change our thinking and get the planners to change their mindset and look at what we can get that works for everyone.  At an absolute minimum, pedestrian pathways must be 2 m in width.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.538" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#M00500"><p>I thank Ms Kennedy.  I did notice that in many cases where tables and chairs were put out there was no requirement for a section 254 licence, which would generally put management in place, or else the process was speeded up.  I cannot remember.  We did see a lot of creep in respect of tables and chairs.  I am not sure how often that was done by the establishment or by customers sitting there and moving them to chase the last of the evening sunshine, but it is something we really have to manage.  With Covid, we have had an opportunity to experiment with creating outdoor spaces.  It was experimental and mistakes were made, but we can improve that incrementally over time and, taking into consideration what Mr. Fulham said, take into account that there must be full consultation with user groups and everybody who needs to use that shared outside space.</p> <p>  I wish to raise the clutter in general on footpaths on bin day when the bin gets dumped right onto the footpath.  I see it on most bin days in my area and it drives me bananas.  I have written to both waste collection companies in my area.  It would take one second longer to put back bins either against the wall or on the roadway and to leave the footpath clear.  Why is the footpath always the place that takes the hit in all of this?  Car drivers feel they need to leave the roadway clear, so they put two tyres up on the path and take the scarce bit of space there is.  Ms Kennedy referred to 2 m, but often it is not 2 m, it is less than that, yet a car parked on the footpath can take half of that away.  We have utility boxes and a whole clatter of stuff on pavements that comes from restaurants, cafes, newsagents and shops.  There is all manner of stuff and very little of it is licensed.  I walked the main shopping street in my town a couple of years ago and I counted an amount of signage and clutter.  Everything possible was pushed outside to advertise businesses.  I do not mind businesses advertising their wares but they need to do it considerately.  I counted approximately 150 pieces of street clutter.  When I searched for section 254 licence applications, I could not find an application for any of them.  I have tried to chase up on this.  It is done under the planning regulations, but it is often granted by a roads section.  It is often the case that matters fall between two stools in local authorities.  That is something we definitely need to address.</p> <p>  Ms Tinsley referred to speed limits.  She suggested a 12 km/h speed limit and a 6 km/h speed limit.  Could she please clarify the position?  We graduate speed limits for motorised vehicles depending on the size of the carriageway or if it is in an urban centre it might be 30 km/h.  Also, if it is a residential area it might be 30 km/h.  If it is slightly wider or a regional road there are different speed limits.  Is Ms Tinsley suggesting graduated speed limits for the use of scooters, depending on the type of road space or street space that we are in?  Senator Boylan referred to European standards.  Is Ms Tinsley aware whether there is a speed limit throughout Europe?</p></speech>

My understanding is that it is common throughout Europe to have a 15 km/h limit.  At present the figure in the legislation is 25 km/h with the option for local authorities to reduce it to 20 km/h.  Our recommendation is that Ireland should reduce it further to 12 km/h in the interests of safety for both riders and pedestrians.</p><p>There is a rationale for reducing it even further to 6 km/h in the more designated zone places outside schools or in clear pedestrianised zones.  In our view, it should be prohibited in those areas, but if not, it should at least be 6 km/h limit.  The recommendation is that it would be on a graded system depending on the zone.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Tinsley.</p> <p>  Ms Kennedy raised the issue of tactile paving.  Does she believe that the design manual for urban roads and streets, DMURS, is being implemented correctly?  Do improvements need to be made to that?  Are local authority staff and contractors working on behalf of local authorities implementing DMURS correctly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms L&eacute;an Kennedy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#N00700"><p>No, it is not being implemented correctly.  We have been asking for consultation on it.  All disability groups should be included.  Tactile paving was developed back in 1998 for the sole purpose of ensuring people using wheelchairs and people who are blind and visually impaired would be able to use pedestrian road crossings.  The reason for it was that the curb was being flattened to the level of the roadway so that somebody using a wheelchair could pass and cross over a road safely.  However, when the footpath is flush with the roadway there is nothing to indicate to a blind person where the road begins and ends.  Tactile paving was implemented and a study was successfully conducted to develop the standard for the blister tactile paving that we are all familiar with.  Other standards came along, such as having warning paving to warn people when there is a step or when they are approaching externally outside buildings and so on.  There are other types of tactile paving.</p> <p>  This has been under review in other countries.  For example, the UK Department of Transport has just published a new manual.  We are looking at that to see what we can learn and improve for our own design manual.  We would be happy make ourselves available to work with the Department to ensure the manual is updated.</p> <p>  Regarding how it is being implemented, local authorities with the best will in the world try to follow it, but mistakes are being made and standards are not being adhered to which is causing issues for people who are blind and visually impaired.  In some cities the surface used for the tactile paving is a steel metal-type surface which is very slippy in wet and rainy conditions.  It is extremely slippy and hazardous for people who are blind and visually impaired and for all pedestrians.  We need to look at what kind of material needs to be used and what the recommendations are.</p> <p>  Warning tactile paving is specifically there to warn people of hazards.  It is being implemented haphazardly and it is confusing for blind and visually impaired people.  It gives them the wrong message as to what the purpose of the tactile paving is and it is causing big issues for them to orientate themselves safely.  It needs to be reviewed and we will make ourselves available to work on that.</p></speech>

Which is the most urgent?  If the DMURS were being implemented 100% correctly would it reduce many of the other problems Ms Kennedy mentioned?</p></speech>

It is not being implemented correctly based on the current standards.  The DMURS is quite old now.  It was developed a few years ago.  Using the pedestrianisation of streets as an example we have had during the this pandemic that we have all been working through, the way that our streets are being planned and developed is changing.  We need to ensure that the urban manual is updated and comes into line with how town planners are moving.  Both need to happen side by side.</p></speech>

With the advance in electric vehicles - I am talking about e-bikes and e-scooters - it widens the scope for a lot of active travel.  It has also given improved access and mobility for people who may have mobility issues.  A person can cycle further on an electric bike than on an ordinary bike.</p><p>Chairman, are there be other user groups that we might invite in?  We also need to look at that aspect.  We want to get this right and ensure that when the Bill becomes law it addresses everybody's concerns - the concerns we are hearing today, but also the active travel concerns and road space allocation concerns.  Can we also consider that?</p><p>My final point relates to on enforcement.  In my experience, garda&iacute; are so stretched in respect of other matters that they do not have the scope to deal with enforcement on a daily basis.  They can do a sweep of a street when they see it.  After hours, when traffic wardens have gone home, people park all over the footpaths.  At schools, people believe it acceptable to park any way they want when dropping their children off or picking them up.  In a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, churchgoers suggested they should be able to park in active travel spaces because they are going to mass on Sunday morning.  All sorts of groups feel that they have a right to park where they wish.</p><p>To rely on garda&iacute; for enforcement is too much of a stretch.  Local authority engineers are also extremely stretched.  It probably just depends on where people live.  We need some common courtesy and decency from people to be aware of other vulnerable users and to use that shared space in a manner that does not impact other people.  We can all get around if that shared space is used in a courteous manner.</p><p>I thank the witnesses for their assistance on this.</p></speech>

I wish the committee members and the witnesses a very happy and healthy 2022.  I thank the witnesses for their opening statements and for their contributions so far.  I have been following the meeting all the way through.</p> <p>  I refer to something the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, said in the D&aacute;il Chamber when this matter was last discussed.  This does not give full context, but it needs to be referenced.  She stated that it does not need anything more by law than a bicycle.  I know that does not give the context because as others have intimated much regulation will be added here.  It is right that our committee is having this more in-depth committee today.  I firmly believe that e-scooters will be a positive force in our lives.  I love to think that teenagers in particular will be able to travel to events in their lives, including going to friend's houses, the cinema or hurling training and that they can do so independently and safely away from the taxi of mum and dad.  While it will be very positive, it needs much more regulation than the pedal bike does.</p> <p>  The entry-level e-scooter that I have been looking at can do an average speed of 24 km/h.  New models are constantly coming on the market.  One of them is called the RION RE90 hyper scooter.  It has a top speed of 120 km/h.</p><p>Imagine that.  That is the speed cars on the motorway from Limerick to Dublin were doing this morning.  Can you imagine someone on an e-scooter keeping up with your speed or possibly passing you out on a motorway?  That probably is not even realistic.  That may not happen, but we have deal with a spectrum of stuff here.  If e-scooters are getting faster, and they are, we need to grasp that in the very beginning and ensure that they are not on the same space as pedestrians and people who have an array of disabilities.  We have to keep pedestrians and those who use e-scooters apart and we need to keep both groups safe.</p><p> I have met with the NCBI.  I had a Zoom meeting with them before Christmas and I have listened to many people on this.  I am fully committed.  I do not have too many questions because I am fully committed for the argument we are hearing today.  I am convinced there should be a sound-emitting device so that we know when one of these vehicles is approaching.  The thing with electric cars is that they creep up on you quite silently.  It is the same with e-scooters.</p><p> There are a few questions I would like to ask.  My colleague Deputy Lahart, who is a Deputy here in Dublin, has suggested many times over that there should be some form of geofencing, particularly with the public realm e-scooters.  We had a lot of larger groups on to us saying that they want to bring e-scooters into Ireland's towns and cities, but that, in itself, will create various problems.  In a city such as Dublin, where we are today, on Grafton Street, for example, you would want some way of predicting those on e-scooters coming along that pedestrian street and integrating with pedestrians.  That is my first question, in particular, for Mr. Fulham.  Does he believe that there is a role for some form of geofencing to ensure that e-scooters, particularly public realm e-scooters, stay out of certain spaces?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fulham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#O00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  There is a role for technology.  We referred to geofencing earlier on.  It is the ability for technology to limit or prohibit the use of e-scooters through share scheme providers in certain areas.  Notwithstanding, as I say all the time, that technology is not a silver bullet, and there are gaps and flaws, as previously referred to by Ms Tinsley, in relation to geofencing, as part of the solution I believe it can be there but it still does not address the gap of the privately owned e-scooters that do not have that technology on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.554" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#O00300"><p>That is good to hear.  We all saw that "Prime Time" special a few weeks ago on e-scooters.  It was screened a few weeks before Christmas.  A lot of these e-scooters have a restricter on them that inhibits the speed one can travel at.  As the witnesses may recall, it was shown on "Prime Time" that a few clips of wire can be used to reset that restricter and enable those scooters to do much higher speeds.  We need future-proofing legislation that would cater not only for the first iteration of e-scooters but also for the faster ones that will inevitably come subsequently.</p> <p>  I will put the next few questions to Mr. Fulham and Ms Tinsley.  The first of them relates to a matter that was touched on by a colleague a few months ago.  There is a general specification given to local authorities throughout the country as to the width of footpaths and the widths and lengths of parking spaces.  There is one lot of specification and, normally speaking, it works well.  When you see a new-build project, we would typically see a 1.8 m wide footpath and it generally allows someone in a wheelchair, pushing a buggy or in a mobility scooter to pass by a pedestrian safely.  I have sometimes found that 1.8 m fine in a new-build scenario but it is sometimes prohibitive.  In towns such as Ennis, the county town in Clare, the streets are medieval.  In many towns around the country, such as Killaloe, County Clare, we have local authorities telling us that the specification is 1.8 m but they cannot fit that in in their area and, therefore, they cannot have a footpath.  This happens repeatedly.  Normally, the NCBI would tell us that it has to be 1.8 m for safety and for safe passing, but does the NCBI believe that there should be some form of derogation or whatever for local authorities?  I would hold the view it is better to have some form of footpath, narrow and all as it might be, in these towns than none.  That was the first point.</p> <p>  The second point I wish to make relates to the width of parking spaces in Ireland.  I know well a wheelchair user who would say that when you can get to a wheelchair space - that is a problem in itself - there seems to be generally enough separation distance to the left and right of the car to get out of the car, into the wheelchair and move off.  If you move elsewhere in the car park, the specification in Ireland is generally that spaces should be 2.5 m wide.  That is at significant variance with the United States where the average car parking space is 2.7 m.  One will often see someone trying to put a child into a car seat in a car and struggling in a big way not to drop the child and contort himself or herself around car doors to get in.  I was wondering if the witnesses have any ideas on that.</p> <p>  Lastly, I cycled again to the D&aacute;il this morning.  The Luas rail system is fantastic in Dublin but I have seen many people using e-scooters and, indeed, bicyclists, like myself this morning, encountering difficulties.  If you try to cross over those Luas rails and you get the alignment of your wheels wrong, you are jammed on that rail.  It will throw you off.  It will smash you off the road.  We have had scooters, e-scooters and bicycles interfacing with the Luas for many years but there is no signage to warn anybody that your wheel is just wide enough to get stuck in a Luas rail and it will throw you off.  The committee should at least write to Dublin City Council that something be done to the Luas rail to provide warning signage along the city.</p></speech>

The Deputy might provide the appropriate wording and we can clerk to the committee can send that off.  Has the Deputy concluded or does he wish to make any concluding comments?</p></speech>

I merely would ask that Ms Tinsley and Mr. Fulham comment on my questions.  There were many questions in terms of the widths, etc.  I find that some of these guidelines become more than guidelines.  They become overly prescriptive to the point that in practical terms they do not work as well as they were intended to.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.558" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#O00700"><p>I thank Deputy Crowe for the questions.  The Deputy is correct.  There are clear standards for accessibility on the built environment.  Many of them probably need to be updated and reviewed.  Some of them are now out of date given the different modes of micro-mobility that are quite common on our streets.  NCBI is very engaged with many local authorities in providing submissions to them on ways that they can improve the streetscape.  If they are doing a revised townscape or development plan, we will definitely be contributing to that discussion to ensure adherence to these standards.  We find that in many instances they are not being fully abided by and as a result there are routes that are becoming inaccessible for people who are blind or have impaired vision.  Likewise, if there are changes to routes, for example if routes now have vehicles on them when they previously had pedestrians on them, that can be very disorientating.  As the Deputy can imagine, someone who is blind or vision-impaired becomes set in his or her ways with the route that he or she knows because that is where he or she feels confident.  When the routes change, it can knock their confidence and limit their ability to get out and about.</p> <p>  The reality is there has to be a footpath in a situation, even if it is of a narrow width.  The other side of the coin is, if there is no footpath and we always give way to cars and vehicle access, you are forcing individuals who are not only blind and impaired but also disabled, and also individuals with buggies, or any pedestrian, out on the road which increases the risk of accident or injury or collision with cars and other vehicles.  Footpaths have to be provided.</p> <p>  I appreciate that some of our towns are over 1,000 years old and the streetscapes can be challenging in that regard.  However, if we want to make Ireland as inclusive as possible, we need to bear in mind the needs of different members of the community and to be cognisant of the challenges that getting out and about poses to them.</p></speech>

If Mr. Fulham has any views on the same questions, I would appreciate them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.560" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Fulham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#O00900"><p>I do.  We always have views.  In relation to the footpaths, in particular, I would echo what Ms Tinsley is saying.  There is a reality here that we have legacy towns.  We cannot create footpaths where there is not the space to do so.  In focusing on the provision of something rather than nothing, there is an imminent danger of the compromise taking hold as the norm.</p><p>We need to look at alternatives.  Is the footpath the only way?  Through consultation with the people on whom this impacts the solution will, more probably than not, come to mind.  There are different specifications throughout different local authorities so there may be an issue to be addressed regarding standardisation.  A willingness to engage with people with disabilities is very important.</p><p> I am with the Deputy on parking bays.  To be quite honest, 2.5 m, 2.7 m or 20 cm will not address the needs of disabled people getting in and out of their cars.  The point is that spaces are there and created for the reason that people with limited mobility need to have nearer access to where they need to be.  There is a point there.  The IWA has a best practice guidelines document in which we mandate best practice rather than minimum compliance.  We need to look at what is best practice rather than what is minimum compliance.  We often see this in the housing world, which is well beyond the remit of the committee, but is very relevant to building houses and design.  The same principle can apply to access.  The parking bays are there for that specific reason, but moving the general spaces available to the general public from 2.5 m to 2.7 m will not address the access needs of people who use wheelchairs or have limited mobility.  I cannot speak knowledgeably as to whether this would make a significant difference to people with children.  I know it would not for me, at least not now because my child is five years old and can get in and out of his own accord.  I could not speak beyond that. </p></speech>

That has been very constructive.  The guidelines I referred to, as have others, were devised at a time when the Ford Fiesta, which was a small hatchback, was the bestselling car in Ireland.  We have very narrow parking spaces set down and prescribed by local authorities when planning permissions are granted and new developments are happening.  It is happening all over the country.  That does not reflect the needs of society at the moment or the type of cars that people are trying to get in and out of parking spaces.</p> <p>  It would be a great body of work for our committee to at some stage invite Department of Transport officials to examine issues such as footpath widths, widths of car parking spaces, and the ratio of wheelchair spaces to parent-child spaces and regular parking spaces.  It would be a great body of work if we were to bring them in for a week or two to consider a revision of some of those figures, although not the document itself, which is quite good.  The figures need to reflect everything that Ms Tinsley, Mr. Fulham and members have said today, in addition to everything we see in our local supermarket car parks where people are struggling to get in and out of cars, and are wedged in and cramped up.  As a society, people are probably not getting smaller.  We are probably all getting a little bigger, as are the cars, but the measurements have not changed one bit and they are restrictive.  It would be great if our committee could do some work on that in 2022.</p> <p>  My questions are finished.  I again thank all our witnesses.  I did not get to all of them, but I have followed them during the meeting.  I thank them for everything.</p></speech>

It would probably also connect with active travel in respect of footpaths and so forth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.564" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1696" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#P00400"><p>I thank all our contributors.  I read all their opening statements in advance and have been listening to all of them and to committee members.  I am afraid I do not have many new points to bring to the table.  I was previously chairman of a transportation strategic policy committee on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and, therefore, I am familiar with issues such as  mirrors, footpath widths, parking and so on.  Dundrum Town Centre is very close to me.  When it was being built - it was probably opened in 2005 - much bigger car parking spaces, and much bigger everything, were deliberately provided.</p> <p>  What we are talking about today relates to e-scooters, legislation and how e-scooters impact, in particular, on the people represented by the witnesses and the organisations they are involved with.  I thank them all for everything they do.  I do not think any of us could replace the personal contributions that were made and brought forward by them today.  It is very important for us and for anyone involved in drafting the legislation to realise the lived experience of people who are in wheelchairs, who have sight impairment, who are blind and who use guide dogs.  That is why the witnesses are here.  It is very important we appreciate that a guide dog that has had a bad experience may not want to go back out.  People who are using wheelchairs, or who have sight impairment or sight loss, are obviously a little concerned about any new technology, especially technology that I was not aware could go at 120 km/h.  Even 20 km/h, 30 km/h or 40 km/h is very high in an environment where people are not expecting it to be.</p> <p>  I picked up on the fact that the witnesses all had very common themes.  By all means correct me if I am wrong.  They do not want any scooter use on footpaths or any free-for-all in people being able to abandon shared service scooters anywhere and everywhere; there needs to be designated places for picking them up and depositing them.  There is also an issue with the speed of scooters and the fact that they need to emit a constant sound, which is something I never thought about before.  I appreciate that the witnesses brought that point forward.</p> <p>  In respect of the issue around shared areas, there are very large parks in my own area, such as Marlay Park and Cabinteely Park, in addition to the Phoenix Park, where there would be appropriate scope for shared areas.  That is not to say that we can have scooters on every pedestrianised area in Dublin or anywhere else, but scooter use will happen whether any of us like it or not.  I was surprised to hear the NCBI figure of 53% of its members suggesting that they had an encounter with a scooter, either a close encounter or whatever.  This is at a time when scooters are not even legalised yet and are not supposed to be on the road at all.  They are coming and we need to do the very best, from our perspective, to make sure that we can address the concerns.  I presume that, over time, as people get more used to them, including those using them, pedestrians and the people the witnesses represent, we will all get a little better at interacting with each other.</p> <p>  Ms Tinsley gave us a list of six points.  Will she give us the exact six points she had again?  I think I have addressed most of them.  It is very important that when we deal with officials regarding this legislation we make sure that those six points are addressed.  I would not like to see a situation where scooters being used by 16- or 17-year-olds are prohibited from all public parks and we then find them in other places where they are more vulnerable to cars.  There are parks that would have the capacity to absorb usage by pedestrians, those who have a level of sight loss or are in a wheelchair, in addition to other pedestrians and scooter users.  Will Ms Tinsley bring back those six points?</p></speech>

I will clarify that in our survey it was actually 75% of the respondents who said that they had experienced either a near miss or a collision on a footpath.

Exactly so.  It behoves us all to make sure that the legislation is as robust as possible to ensure the safety of pedestrians.  The minimum we think needs to be enshrined in the legislation is a prohibition on footpaths, a reduction of the speed limit, the installation of sound as a safety feature, clear designated parking and a minimum age.</p></speech>

I appreciate that nobody here, either committee members or any of the witnesses, are necessarily technological experts in how e-scooters work or how they can be geofenced and so on.  I think Mr. Fulham referred to geofencing more than anybody else.  An operator implementing it can put in rules and so on, but do we know if there is a way of geofencing people who buy a scooter in a shop?  Can geofencing be implemented by a local authority or is the technology in the scooter?  Is anybody aware of that?</p></speech>

It is a question first of who would get the technology into the privately purchased scooter and then who would manage and implement the technology to deliver the oversight of that.  If that were to fall on a local authority I do not know how that would be structured.  Therein lies the challenge.  It is a practical problem with regard to private e-scooter ownership.</p></speech>

It is in the interests of these companies hiring scooters out per minute, hour or as some kind of subscription service to be bound by all the rules and they would have to make sure of that because otherwise their licence would be taken off them.  The bigger challenge for all of us is how we ensure that people who are using scooters they bought do not abandon them, although maybe they would not want to abandon them anywhere because they might be easily taken away or stolen and used somewhere else.  The challenge for us in the legislation is how we deal with people who buy scooters.  The geofencing may work for shared scooters and could slow them down, limit their speed and stop them going into pedestrian areas and onto footpaths and so on.  It is harder when it comes to privately owned scooters.  Do the witnesses have any experience of other cities, or an example of best practice?  We seem to have lots of examples of worst practice, such as in Paris, Brussels, Strasbourg and other places.  Are there any places where this system seems to have worked better?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-19a.572" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms June Tinsley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022011900002#Q00300"><p>I do not know of any city that has operationalised the geofencing system and where that has worked effectively.  There are certainly cities where there are clear designated parking bays.  When people become members of a shared scheme they have to use their parking bays or, similarly, they have to send a photo back to the company to verify that they have parked it in an appropriate space at the end of their rental.  Those tactics have been used.  I am not familiar with whether that requires a geofencing model.</p></speech>

If somebody buys a scooter and decides to abandon it in the middle of Grafton Street, those tactics will not cover that.</p> <p>  On the speed limit, 12 km/h seems quite low.  Maybe it is an appropriate speed.  Did that figure come from anywhere?  Is there any empirical reason that NCBI chose 12 km/h, rather than 15 km/h, 9 km/h or 20 km/h?</p></speech>

Some European countries have chosen 15 km/h or 20 km/h.  We wanted to highlight the fact that if riders are not obligated to wear helmets and so on, that increases the risk to them should they collide or fall.  The rationale of lowering it again to 6 km/h is in recognition of more congested areas where there would not be scope for free reign of scooters speeding through those very congested areas.</p></speech>

For example, as I alluded to earlier, areas outside schools would be 6 km/h zones, whereas on a housing estate the scooters could reach 12 km/h.  It would depend on making sure the rider is well lit with high-vis and lights and things like that.  The speed feature is not to be taken in isolation.  It needs to be considered as part of a suite of things.</p></speech>

If somebody is coming into the city centre on a scooter from Blackrock, Stillorgan or Kilmacud and they are going on a road surface, the maximum of 12 km/h seems to be very low for that kind of journey.  That is, as opposed to people travelling down Dawson Street or other built-up urban environments where there are Luas trams, buses, heavy goods vehicles and deliveries and so on and such a speed would be more appropriate.  A blanket maximum speed of 12 km/h seems incredibly low when we are allowing cars to drive past schools at 30 km/h or even 50 km/h in some cases.  We all know the size of cars now.  As others have said, a car outside a school would cause an awful lot more damage at 20 km/h or 30 km/h to anybody it hits, whatever about its user, than a scooter.  That is not to say scooters should behave wrongly.  Of course, they should not but I would like more evidence as to why the 12 km/h limit is good.  Maybe there is evidence that it is a good idea and needs to be 12 km/h.  Maybe cars should also be driving at 10 km/h or 12 km/h outside schools at school times, or 6 km/h or whatever figure is suggested.  That might not be necessary at 11 p.m. on a Saturday when driving past a primary school that has been closed since Friday afternoon but perhaps that should be the case during the opening and closing of schools.  Ms Tinsley is saying that some places have chosen a limit of 15 km/h and some have chosen 20 km/h but nowhere has chosen 12 km/h.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Some cities had a limit of 25 km/h and reduced it, and that reduction seems to fluctuate between 15 km/h and 20 km/h.  The rationale for the 12 km/h is to put a gold safety standard on Ireland to try to make sure it is appropriately regulated throughout the country.</p></speech>

We are right to be cautious as we introduce it.  Over time we will hopefully discover that it is going to bed in relatively well and we will ask why we did not have people on these scooters years ago because they are removing SUVs from a lot of places and helping with parking and visibility.  When going past many schools now there are so many SUVs outside that it is very hard to see pedestrians coming out between the cars, let alone trying to negotiate a potential scooter as well.</p> <p>  Do Ms Kennedy or Ms Murphy have any particular take on the speed limit?  If there were two or three measures they wanted over everything else, what would those be?  I presume the footpath issue would be number one.  I ask them to rank the things they would like to see in descending order.  I totally get that the thing they want most is for scooters not to be allowed on footpaths.  They are almost silent and can sneak up behind people very easily, even on ordinary pedestrians who do not have any issues with mobility, sight or visual impairment.  They can be quite scary if they appear behind you.  I cycle sometimes and when a scooter comes up in the cycle lane I do not hear it until it is past me.  I totally get that.  Do any of the witnesses have a hierarchy of provisions that they really want to bed into the legislation, like A over B or B over C?</p></speech>

The second would be the audio system on e-scooters.  It is not just a matter of having a bell on scooters that someone can ring when they are encroaching on someone with a guide dog or using a long cane.  There has to be a consistent sound coming from the e-scooter so that people will be able to hear it, wherever they are on the street, if they are in the vicinity of an e-scooter.  It is important that there be something on the e-scooter all the time vibrating or emitting a noise that is loud enough to be heard over heavy traffic and so on.  Our third priority would be the speed limit because e-scooters are so fast they whizz by.  As I explained earlier, guide dogs do not have time to pre-empt the danger or react before an e-scooter comes up.</p><p>According to our survey, 53% of members, who are people using a guide dog or assistance dog, have already had encounters or near collisions with people using e-scooters.  I know of one assistance dog family who have had two collisions already with an e-scooter.  In each case the user has ridden the e-scooter up onto the footpath then back off onto the road, leaving the daughter with autism crying in the street.  This is the impact they are having currently.  The top speed-----</p></speech>

Given the magnitude of the presentations today and the myriad of issues that have been presented to us around the management, ownership and behaviour of those who use e-scooters, I think that as part of our private meeting this week or next week, we should have a discussion on how we can take forward the presentations made today.  It is not acceptable that a letter of acknowledgement is given to people who put forward a very insightful presentation.  I have received emails from people who are able-bodied who have complained to me in the context of the illegal manner of e-scooters on footpaths.  In one case, a gentleman was involved in a very serious accident with an e-scooter where he had reason to go to the local Garda station following an encounter with an e-scooter rider who followed him, assaulted him, then got back on his scooter and sped off.  That case concerned an able-bodied person.  Taking the presentation today about our citizens who are visually impaired, have sight loss or are disabled in some capacity, as we heard, they experience very different types of encounters.  My best contribution is to ask the members to take today's presentations and to park them in the context of an overarching strong approach by the committee.  Quite clearly, the advent of these scooters is one that has been supported by many of us, including the members of this committee, but there are clear difficulties that need to be addressed not just by us, but across Departments and by law enforcement and city and county councils.</p> <p>  I thank our witnesses most sincerely for what has been a very strong presentation and perhaps one of the best presentations we have heard in our committee to date.  We have a lot of work to do around the regulation of e-scooters.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

This was a very worthwhile piece of work today.  Obviously, there is a huge amount of interaction that needs to happen, particularly between the Department officials, the committee and the organisations represented by the witnesses.  We need to come to a solution that is workable.</p> <p>  I reiterate the point I made earlier in relation to a wider submission.  I think there has been some conversation on the interventions around the general difficulties that relate to town planning, transport and road infrastructure.  I do not need to repeat any of that.  As I said, if we could get submissions on that from the organisations represented by the witnesses, it would be worthwhile.</p> <p>  I also believe there is a wider piece of work we have to do.  It is probably beyond what Deputy Crowe mentioned when he spoke about dealing with some of these regulations as regards width, etc.  Again, that work would not just be for our committee.  The issues relating to transport companies are within the remit of this committee.  There are some of the rules that relate to local authorities and certain things will relate to building.  In fairness, the issue of primary medical certificates has been dealt with.  It is an obvious issue that has affected a substantial number of people with disabilities who are not able to get what they should be able to get in the area of transport.  Beyond that, I know, as I am sure many others do, that there is an issue with disability housing, whether it is dealing with a local authority, or the difficulties around housing adaptation grants.  There are parents dealing with children with severe disabilities.  Sometimes they have changed the nature of the type of work they have to do.  They may be a carer, which means they have less money coming in.  An adaptation grant is not going to cut it in the context of what needs done.  It is about bridging that gap.</p> <p>  I know I have outlined multiple issues, but I think on some level we need to start a serious piece of work in addressing them.  That is more of a commentary than a question.  Perhaps some of the witnesses may wish to comment on that.</p></speech>

Ms Murphy had to leave the meeting.  She told us previously her time was limited.  In terms of what we can do practically, the witnesses are very familiar with the legislation.  For us, as a committee, we were, to say the least, dissatisfied the legislation did not cover e-scooters.  A lot of it will only come to the fore when the legislation is published.  We will only get down to business when it comes to Committee Stage.  There is a window of opportunity between now and Committee Stage.  There must be serious active engagement between the Department of Transport, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the organisations represented by the witnesses.  There is no substitute for accounts of personal experiences.</p><p>All the witnesses have practical stories to tell.  We could not understand what they are going through.  At the end of the day, it has a significant practical impact on their daily lives.  Obviously, anything to do with active travel is to be welcomed, but if we are to bring in e-scooters we must get it right.  Mr. Fulham referred to best practice.  Best practice must be underpinned by robust legislation.</p><p> What we will do as a committee is consider the witnesses submissions again.  In essence, we will be writing to, and are sending out a strong message today, the Department of Transport and the Ministers to meet with your good selves immediately.  We will go through how we can get this right in terms of footpaths, speeds and general safety.  We cannot have a situation whereby people who are visually impaired, on their own or with a guide dog, or people who are disabled feel threatened as a result of a measure that has been introduced that should be a positive measure.  The witnesses' submission was sent to the Department in early November.  On foot of our meeting today, perhaps the witnesses will collectively come together to see if there are further updates they can make to their submission.  That should then be sent to us.  It should also be sent to the Department.  We will look to ensure that they get a meeting with immediate effect.  This matter is too important.</p><p> We thank the witnesses for coming to this very important meeting.  Starting with Mr. Fulham, then Ms Kennedy and Ms Tinsley, I ask them to provide their concluding remarks and, if they would like, to add to what I have just said.  We also thank Ms Murphy for her meaningful contribution.</p></speech>

I again reiterate my thanks on behalf of the Irish Wheelchair Association for the opportunity to talk to the committee.  I refer to what I said earlier on.  People with disabilities are not vulnerable.  The constructs of the society around us is what makes us vulnerable.

On behalf of Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and our clients who are blind or vision impaired and families of children with autism, we are happy to have the opportunity to speak with members and we are encouraged by the reaction we are getting today.  The committee has listened to us thoroughly and came back with concrete critical questions so that we can have an open discussion on it.  I am very invigorated and look forward to us progressing this.  Let us not leave it at this meeting.  Let us look forward and progress this as quickly as possible to ensure the Bill is amended to ensure the needs of people with disabilities are included and incorporated.  We understand that e-scooter usage is happening.  We must be sure of the ultimates that need to be put into the Bill so that their use does not inhibit or prohibit people with disabilities, particularly people who are blind or visually impaired with a guide dog or a long cane, and families of children with autism getting out and about safely.  As I said earlier, we have been compromising for a number of years and pulling back on situations such as curbs being removed to facilitate traffic-calming measures and so on.  We now need to ensure we step forward and do not compromise to the extent that people feel they cannot go out and about anymore.  I thank the committee and look forward to future engagement on this matter.</p></speech>

Yes, we have been in touch the Royal National Institute of Blind People, RNIB, our equivalent organisation in the UK and it is something we can gain further alliance on to make sure the submission we resubmit is as updated as possible based on the experiences of our sister organisations across Europe and beyond.  I am sure the IWA will do likewise.</p> <p>  I wish to conclude by thanking the committee for a constructive meeting.  I firmly believe there is a clear agenda, which we asked the committee to follow with us, so that minimum sets of safety standards will be enshrined in the legislation.  By doing that, it ensures there will be enforcement and shared-ownership schemes, people at private-owner level, throughout local authorities and garda&iacute; can follow clear guidelines that are set out in legislation.  I wish to reiterate those measures again.  They include: a clear prohibition of the use of e-scooters on footpaths; the installation of a sound system; clear designated parking bays and infrastructure; a reduction in the speed limit; and the introduction of the minimum-age requirements.  I genuinely look forward to working with the committee again and am happy to work further with the Department on this.  We will resubmit our submission very shortly.</p></speech>

We will then follow up immediately with the Department.  We will look at the specific issues raised by the witnesses and Senator Buttimer.  We will consider that at our private meeting.  Two or three months have elapsed.  I would like the witnesses to build precedent and experiences from elsewhere into their submission.  Other countries that have introduced legislation have had to change a lot of the system to deal with the flaws in it in terms of dealing with people with disabilities.  If they could incorporate that into their submission, we would look for an immediate meeting for them with the Department and the Ministers.  We will interact with the witnesses on a continual basis regarding the legislation that is coming before us.  We will be doing a substantive body of work on Committee Stage on this legislation.</p> <p>  With that, on behalf of all the members, I thank Mr. Fulham, Mr. O'Mahony, Ms Kennedy, Ms Fitzpatrick, Ms Tinsley and Ms Murphy for attending and engaging in such thorough fashion with our committee.  We look forward to our continued debate.</p></speech>
