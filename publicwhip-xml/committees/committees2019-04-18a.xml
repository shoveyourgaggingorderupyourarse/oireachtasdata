He is joined by Ms Orla Duane, deputy director of audit.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting of 27 April have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  There are no particular matters arising from the minutes, but any matters that arose can be raised as the meeting progresses.  </p> <p>  We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories.  Category A consists of the opening statements and documents in connection with today's meeting.  Nos. 2105A and 2117A are from the office of the director general of the EPA and are contained in our briefing document and opening statement.  We will note and publish those.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  The next item is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers in follow up to previous meetings of the Committee on Public Accounts.  The first item is No. 2092B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the Health Service Executive dated 27 March 2019, providing documents relating to the national children's hospital development board.  This item was circulated, referred to and discussed at last week's meeting, but we have to formally note and publish it at this stage.</p><p>There is other correspondence connected to that, to which I will come in a moment.<br/><br/><b></b>On related correspondence, No. 2115B is from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, Health Service Executive, dated 12 April 2019.  It provides the information requested at last week&rsquo;s meeting on PwC's role in regard to the decision-making process to proceed with phase B of the new paediatric hospital and its subsequent role in carrying out a review of the escalation of costs.  We will note and publish that but I want to comment on it because it is the issue I raised at the previous meeting.<br/><br/>We sought clarification from the HSE on this matter, which I want to deal with now publicly.  It is a matter that surprised me when we saw this item of correspondence on the previous day and it is one that has not been sufficiently highlighted even though it was hiding in plain sight.  I will call Deputy Cullinane shortly to outline the situation but the position is that we had a briefing note on the previous day which we noted and discussed.  The report was entitled The New Children's Hospital Programme: Options Going Forward.  In November 2018, to support the decision-making process for the next stage of the national children's hospital capital development project, the HSE, at the request of the Department, considered the three options which we have all discussed, namely, giving it to BAM to remain on site, putting it out to tender or the third option which it did not want to pursue.  It sought specialist, high-level input from a range of health, construction and procurement specialists in regard to providing information on this matter.  When this report was produced it was a decision of the Government, not of any of the people directly involved, which was made in December 2018, to proceed with keeping BAM on site.  Obviously, none of the people who provided information were at the Cabinet table and involved in the decision but they had a fundamental role in providing information to the decision-making process, which resulted in the Cabinet decision to move forward.<br/><br/>Inside the cover of the document given to us on the previous day entitled The New Children's Hospital Programme: Options Going Forward, prepared in November of last year, which we discussed, we see that the HSE, at the request of the Department of Health, had sought input from a range of advisers, including PwC.  We sought clarification on that.  We have it verified here now from the HSE in the document we are publishing today, which is No. 2115B, that PwC was engaged in the process advising the HSE on the Government decision in regard to what option to take as a result of the gross maximum price report that had been considered at that stage.  We then find that in January 2019, PwC was commissioned by the HSE on behalf of the Government to conduct a comprehensive review of the escalation of costs at the national children's hospital and the contributory factors associated with that.<br/><br/>My view, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, is that it was inappropriate of the HSE to request PwC to carry out that report given that only two months earlier PwC, at the request of the HSE, was involved in the process reviewing the gross maximum cost and providing its professional and specialist input from a financial point of view to the HSE, which led to the decision being taken by the Government that the project would proceed with BAM.  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I alluded to that last week.  We sought confirmation on it.  The HSE has confirmed now that PwC was engaged by the HSE in regard to the options going forward and, two months later, the same company was engaged by the HSE at a cost of approximately half a million euro to examine the cost escalation.  That is a gross conflict of interest as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>The HSE was very wrong to commission PwC to do both reports.  The HSE knew about the conflict.  I do not have the full report in front of me but I recall that in that report, and Deputy Connolly highlighted this on the previous day, PwC was not requested to give conclusions as to the best options but it has one page of conclusions in the report, at page 8, at the end of its executive summary.  It was not asked to do that.  It made a number of recommendations on the options going forward but the conclusion it arrived at was that at that point, the best option was to proceed with the option the Government decided on.  We have PwC drawing a conclusion in a report and stating that the decision that was made as a result of its previous professional input to the earlier decision-making process was the correct one in regard to proceeding.  I find it extraordinary that the HSE commissioned a report which facilitated PwC giving a conclusion that the earlier decision to proceed with the option of leaving BAM on site was the correct decision, given that PwC were the professional advisers who led to that earlier decision being made.  <br/><br/>When the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board witnesses come before the committee in a couple of weeks after the break we will have the people from the HSE and the Department of Health before us also to discuss this conflict of interest.  We know there is only a limited number of companies.  They said they were on a procurement framework but they should have had the knowledge to not appoint the same company two months apart to engage in different aspects of the same project.  I think I have made my point clearly.  Deputy Cullinane indicated first and he will be followed by Deputy Connolly and Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#B00200"><p>First and foremost, I would agree with the Chairman's observations.  The first comment I would make is that it seems that PwC was paid twice for the same advice, and the taxpayer paid for it.  There is a contradiction in the briefing note we got from the HSE.  It states that advice was given and that the advice was specialist, high-level input.  That is not low-level input.  That is very specialised, high-level advice and input that was given by HSE estates, which it is obliged to give, PwC and the Northern Ireland health and social care system.  It was one of three pillars that were giving very high-level specialist advice on the three options.  That involved construction, procurement and many of the issues that subsequently were at the heart of the cost overruns.</p> <p>  The last line states that the HSE is satisfied that there is no conflict of interest.  I am not satisfied.  I do not believe the Chairman is satisfied.  Other members of the committee can make their own minds up but for me there was a clear conflict of interest in regard to it.  It states that following the Government's decision in January 2019, PwC was commissioned by the HSE on behalf of the Government to conduct a comprehensive review that looked at contributory factors, associated responsibilities and potential weaknesses.  As far as I am concerned there is a breathtaking conflict of interest in that.  On the one hand, it can give that high-level input into a process and then be the organisation that comes and gives the so-called independent analysis.  That is a worry.  </p> <p>  If the Chairman recalls, we had asked them very clearly when they were before us if there were any conflicts of interest.</p></speech>

I would want to know exactly the nature of this specialist high-level input.  It is not good enough to just give us a paragraph stating it provided high-level input.  What was the nature of it?  How much did the advice PwC gave cost?  On what exactly was it advising?  At what senior level was it in PwC?  We do not know the volume of work PwC did but we can only take at face value what is here, namely, specialist high-level input.  We need a much deeper breakdown of that because we need to be fair to the organisation as well.  It is being disingenuous in saying it was not involved in the subsequent decision making.  Of course it was not.  The Government makes the decisions.  That is a clear sleight of hand and an attempt to try to pull the wool over our eyes.  No consultancy firm is involved in decision making but they are involved in compiling reports which help the Government make decisions, and the Government relies on that advice.  Without a doubt, at a level PwC was involved in-----</p></speech>

To say that is the justification is a bit much.  We need to go back to PwC, thank them and say that we do not agree there were no conflicts of interest.  That is not my view.  We will hear from other members, and the committee will have to form a view, but we need a further breakdown of the costs, what exactly PwC did and the input it had into the process.</p></speech>

There was no evidence justifying the conclusion reached, and it certainly did not relate to the terms of reference.  I am subject to correction on that but I could not see where it related.</p><p>We asked previously whether there was a conflict of interest, as the Deputy has said.  We were told there was no such conflict of interest in the appointment of PwC.  I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il last night.  It is worrying that the Minister repeated that the Government is relying on the conclusions reached by PwC.  It has been careful to say that the PwC conclusions concur with its own, but it is relying on the PwC conclusion that there is no option but to proceed with the build.  That conclusion is quoted <i>ad nauseam</i>, and it is worrying.  </p><p>What was PwC paid?  Was there a written report when it was asked for high-level input?  Was the Government aware, when it commissioned PwC for this report, costing over &euro;500,000, that it had already completed a report?  In general, I find this type of response most unhelpful.  When we get a line to say that the Government was not involved in the decision making process, that is an insult to the Committee on Public Accounts.  It would never happen that it would be left to make a decision, otherwise we would be in even more trouble that we are in.  Things get more difficult when this is the example being set, on a repeated basis, for governance.  There are general implications from this.  Was there a written report?  Was PwC paid?  Was the Government aware that PwC was involved before it was commissioned again at a cost of over &euro;500,000?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#C00400"><p>I agree completely with the point made about conflict of interest.  It is not only the fact that there was a double payment, but also the fact that that information was relied on to make a decision.  Anyone making a decision will want expert advice in order to ground that decision.  If that expert advice is in conflict it causes a corruption of the process, as I see it.  It is really important that we get the correct people before the committee, namely, those from the HSE who made the decision.  We have been told about Chinese walls.  I am fairly sick of hearing that being offered as an excuse for why the same companies can be relied upon.  We have to know whether it was the same arm of this company that carried out both pieces of work.  I suspect that it was, because a body of work had already been carried out.</p> <p>  It strikes me that there should be some procurement rules, and if there are none we have to look for gaps in the commissioning of work.  It is not just a box to be ticked.  Corporate culture will help to avoid those kinds of conflicts.  We have to find out whether there are procurement rules involved and how they consider it and manage it.  We need to hear that from the HSE.  We have to have the correct people here to discuss this matter, because this is of enormous importance.  Only this morning there was a news item concerning the over-dominance of the four big accountancy companies in the UK.  It is exactly the same here.  There is also a question, wider than the remit of the Committee on Public Accounts but which might find its way into a report at some point, around whether we design rules which do not allow other entities into that space.  I suspect that we make it much more difficult for middle-ranking firms to compete, and we need to look at that, because it could have a bearing on value for money.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#C00500"><p>Deputy Catherine Murphy hit on a very important point.  If individuals in PwC were involved in both processes then there is a problem.  It would be problematic if someone who was involved in giving high-level specialist advice was also involved in assisting, preparing, signing off on or writing the other report.  It is correct to say that there are arms of these organisations that specialise in certain areas, but there are also individuals involved here.  The question of whether there was an overlap and whether any individuals from PwC were involved in both processes should be asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#C00600"><p>We have discussed the issue, and we are going to write to the HSE raising the following specific points.  We want to deal with the issue of conflict of interest.  There was much public commentary about possible conflict of interest from the BAM side, but the Department should have been aware of this issue because it was very much in the public domain.  We want clarification on what steps were taken around potential conflict of interest.  We also want to know the nature of the specialist high-level input, and how much PwC was paid for that and for the report, and whether any staff involved were involved in both reports.  There may have been a different person signing off on the reports, but there may have been crossover.  We have to know what the HSE did to ensure independence.  We need a copy of that written report.  The HSE is to get PwC's consent for that report to be sent straight to us, rather than going through that rigmarole for another fortnight.  Were the Minister, the Department and the Government aware of the fact that PwC was involved in the earlier process or was the Minister kept in the dark?  If so, why was that the case?  We also want to know where in the report is the evidence to back up the conclusion reached in the report to the effect that the option taken was the best option.  The conclusion just lands on page 8, and we need to know-----</p></speech>

We saw from the letter we received that PwC is being very vague.  We need to know exactly what is meant by "high-level input".  They need to be very comprehensive about costs and precise definitions of what "high-level input" means.  Deputy Connolly asked if that means written reports, and I imagine that it does.</p></speech>

Was PwC saying that it was making a conclusion or was it referring back to the original decision that was made, where it was concluded that completing the work at St. James's was the only option?  It was not clear to me, but it is clear that it has been stuck into this report again.  I am not sure whether it is saying that the conclusion reached is its categorical conclusion or whether it is referring back to the previous conclusion.

I read it, and there is a different tense used.  It is saying "at that time", which is past tense, and the sentence says that it is the right decision.  The tense changed, which is extraordinary for a professional report.  The first half of the sentence is past tense and the second half is the present tense.  I find it unclear, and Deputy Connolly spotted the same thing.</p></speech>

I understand that, like many public bodies, it has a procurement framework in place.  Local authorities have them; if they have to get work done they have a group of people who are pre-approved as part of a tender framework and who can be called at short notice because of that.  We want to know how many companies were approved on that framework in terms of the health issue?  Was there only one or were there several?  If there were several why was this one, which was already involved, chosen again?  </p></speech>

The key people from the HSE will have to be here as part of that process.  We just find that the paediatric hospital board is well down the pecking order in terms of where the decisions get made.  That was the main item of correspondence.</p><p>The next item is No. 2101B, from Ms Rhonda Evans, communications manager, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, dated 10 April 2019.  This is in response to our request to publish the Mazars report on the preliminary observations on the construction of the national children's hospital.  The board has published this document and it is available on its website.  We have discussed it before.  It is just a matter of allowing us to publish it formally.  PwC was involved in November and a Mazars report on costs was issued in December.  PwC is to report again in February.  Professional consultants are being brought in month by month at this rate.</p><p>The next item is No. 2102B, received from Mr. Cr&oacute;nan Goodman, Office of the Secretary General, Department of Justice and Equality, providing material on the <font color="#2F2F2F">Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the </font>Reception and Integration Agency.  This was provided in hard copy at the meeting last week.  We discussed it at length at the meeting.  We are just formally noting it.</p><p>The next item is No. 2103B from Mr. John Conlon, assistant secretary, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, providing an evaluation of the JobPath scheme.  At our meeting on 29 November 2018, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection undertook to forward the report to the committee when it was completed.  The evaluation, which was a collaboration between the Department and the OECD, concludes that the JobPath scheme has been successful in helping jobseekers not only to secure employment but to improve earnings in employment.  We will note and publish this.  We referred to the JobPath issue in our interim report.  The two documents we are publishing may well be in the public domain at this stage.  Members may comment as they see fit.</p></speech>

We are told an unemployment rate of 5% is really close to full employment.  Obviously, there is a bit of movement among people and so forth.  We are paying quite a large amount of money for the scheme.  People from around the country, not only members' constituencies, do not ring about this for no reason.  When one starts hearing the same things from different places, one notes a pattern.  I am deeply unhappy with the scheme.  The OECD may well look at it at a high level but I am referring to how it is functioning in reality.  I am not sure that much of what is being done actually assists people in getting work.  I am hearing that people are routinely coming in - maybe the routine is part of it -  and are told to look up material they could look up at home on websites.  Matching people to employment sometimes results in matching them to kinds of employment to which they are not suited.  I have come across people with pretty decent education who are being matched with security work.  It is not the right fit and it will not be sustainable in the longer term.  If we are to rely on the scheme or if we are to renew the process, much more is needed.  I am very concerned that a responsibility is being outsourced that should properly be the responsibility of the Department.</p></speech>

The total cost was &euro;163 million.  The number of participants in full-time employment for more than 12 months was actually quite low.  That was the issue we had raised with those concerned.  The other point that needs to be put into context when we are given the figures is that there was a recovering economy.  People were getting jobs naturally.  It is hard in that case to establish how effective JobPath was or what additionality it resulted in, even for those who may have gone through its programme.  There are many, with whom we are dealing in our constituency offices, who had very bad experiences.  This is only one element.  We were looking at it more from a cost perspective.  I do not believe we were getting value for money.  I am all for labour activation programmes that work and add value, but it is very difficult to conclude, in a recovering economy, that we got value for money.  I argue we did not given that there were more jobs being created naturally in the economy and given the very small number in sustained employment under the scheme.  Some of the individuals went through the programme a second time.  This also has to be noted.  Obviously, the organisations will defend their expenditure and themselves but I would not subscribe to the view that we got value for money.  Given, however, that I have called for JobPath to be scrapped, that should be noted as well.</p></speech>

I am not sure how we can deal with them at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We all have our opinions.  I happen to agree with my two colleagues.  How do we achieve value for money?  The scheme does not result in value for money.  Two weeks ago, I met representatives of the Local Employment Service Network in Galway.  There are serious problems on the ground in respect of this organisation.  The quality of the services offered is not measured.  I refer to the quality of the services offered on so many levels that have nothing to do with filling out a CV.  The skills are empowering people - people who will perhaps never hold down a full-time job but who do other things as a result of the network on the ground helping them.  They must be included in the equation when valuing.</p> <p>  Consider the gobbledegook language.  There is a conclusion referring to some disimprovement in the number of clients completely agreeing.  There is agreeing and completely agreeing.  That is on page 23.  More than three out of five clients agree that training courses were of good quality.  Therefore, two out of five do not.  Three out of four, or more than three quarters, agree.  The language is being used in a way to justify a scheme that is not indicating value for money.  It is a misuse of language.</p> <p>  Those are my comments.  I am obviously not here to make personal comments but I would not be reassured that value for money is being achieved.  Ultimately, that is what we are about.  If we are to consider value for money, all the other criteria have to be taken into account in respect of what the organisations on the ground that are not for profit are imparting to people on the ground, thereby saving the State a fortune.  That is value for money.  I refer to where skills are imparted to help people live an independent life.  Those concerned might not hold down a job but they can do many other good things.  Perhaps with the help of the Comptroller and Auditor General in due course and the Chairman, we might examine how value for money is measured and what should go into the pot.  What the Local Employment Service Network is doing is not put into the pot to measure.</p></speech>

I will ask the secretariat to go back through our recent periodic reports immediately.  We have received the formal response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding our previous communication.  I do not think we have received a response from the Department regarding some of our previous periodic reports, however.  We want to have that response when we are back here in two weeks.  I am referring to the earlier periodic report which addressed this issue.  I am sure the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will refer to this issue and that it will consult the line Department.  When we get that note from the Department, we follow up on the recommendations we made in our second last periodic report.</p> <p>  I am stressing that I want the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to get its replies back to this committee in a timely manner.  There have been unacceptable delays in replying to us, and these include a response to recommendations made last year about matters being considered in the Estimates.  The Department took so long to respond to our report on that occasion that it stated the Estimates process had concluded when it did eventually reply.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is taking too long to respond to these reports.  I know it is a busy Department but this concerns public accountability.  It should be a key function of public accountability that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would respond to the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts in a timely manner.

We asked for an update regarding compensation paid in cases of prisoners who died from self-inflicted injuries in custody since 2017.  We have been told that there have been no payments.  We also asked about potential claims or claims lodged in respect of an outbreak of tuberculosis within the Irish Prison Service.  The response from the Department of Justice and Equality advises that the State Claims Agency has stated that it has received 100 claims.  Of those, 66 were concluded on 25 January 2019.  Further information has been requested.</p> <p>  We will write to the State Claims Agency asking it to supply information regarding the sums of money involved and the estimated cost for dealing with the remaining cases.  We will also request information on whether any confidentiality agreements were attached to the conclusion of those 66 claims.  I have not seen reference to that in public.  Representatives from the State Claims Agency will appear before this committee in due course.  More importantly, we also want to know the learning process for the Prison Service to ensure health issues such as this are prevented in future.  In this instance, there was not just a lack of prevention but the disease spread to 100 people.  We need a response on this issue.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 2116B, dated 12 April 2019, is from Ms Susanna Lyons, head of regulation with the Housing Agency, and provides the clarification requested by the committee regarding the number of housing units and a breakdown of the roles performed by the 10,000 staff in approved housing bodies, AHBs.  It is stated that housing is only a small fraction of the work undertaken by many of the organisations that are approved housing bodies.  Some of those bodies are charities and many deal with several other issues that are primarily funded in the context of the health service, such as patient care, health and social care, professional support day services, respite services and management of administration.  The correspondence also gives a further breakdown of the information.</p> <p>  I will pick one as an example.  The Irish Wheelchair Association has 2,638 staff but only 46 houses.  The way this information was presented the last time we dealt with this matter could have led to an interpretation that there are 10,000 people in these charities dealing with housing.  It is stated that the actual number of staff directly involved with housing is 1,236.  A further breakdown of the information stated that 85% of the previous figure was given in respect of 12 or 13 major charities and it went on to give the number of staff in each charity involved with housing.  Only 1,236 of the 10,000 staff in all of those organisations are involved in housing.  That is important.  We are doing a periodic report on housing shortly and that is an important clarification of information.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 2093C, dated 8 April 2019, is from an individual requesting the committee to pursue an investigation into a matter raised with this committee almost 20 years ago.  The correspondent is seeking the release of precedential test cases used by the Social Welfare Appeals Office to determine issues in respect of employment, self-employment or bogus self-employment.  The individual concerned has been in touch with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  He has also asked for the precedent from the High Court.  I am not sure if the precedent being used is internal or is based on a court decision.  If it is a court decision, then is it in the public domain and I do not see any issue with that.</p> <p>  We will write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and ask for the rationale being relied on regarding these test cases.  We are here to protect the taxpayer.  There might be a good reason it is in the taxpayers' interest to not publish all of the information the Social Welfare Appeals Office uses to arrive at decisions of this type.  It might perhaps be the case that if it was known how these decisions were arrived at, it might be possible to navigate a way around potential issues at a cost to the taxpayer.  We do not want to bring about the release of any confidential information that could be used against interests of taxpayers.  We do, however, want to see the rationale being used.  We will see what response we will get and then determine if we want to pursue this matter further.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 2099C, dated 9 April 2019, is from an individual alleging a waste of public moneys by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, in the production of a compact disc, CD, for people with disabilities.  The amount involved is &euro;35,000.  The correspondent states that the CD could have been produced at a much lower cost through the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI.  We will write to the RSA, including correspondence from the individual and the NCBI, regarding the manuals and, in particular, people with dyslexia who are taking tests.  We will forward this correspondence to the RSA and ask for a detailed note in response.</p> <p>  No. 2109C, dated 8 April 2019, is from an individual who has previously written to the committee regarding the election observer roster.  The correspondent believes that the information provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is defamatory.  The secretariat has reviewed the paragraph and no individual is mentioned.  I propose we advise the correspondent to raise the matter directly with the Department.  If the Department wishes to take its own legal advice on the matter and the result is a desire for the committee to have a correction inserted in the record, we will be happy to do so.  We did not, however, identify anybody.  The person concerned may feel that he or she was identified but he or she was not identified by this committee.  If this matter comes back to us through the Department with a recommendation to re-examine it, we can note what is requested at that stage.</p> <p>  No. 2113C, dated 11 April 2019, is from an individual alleging fraud and criminality in Meath County Council in respect of public contracts and alleged conflicts of interest.  We had similar correspondence on this matter but the local authorities do not fall within the remit of this committee.  We will write to the correspondent to state that this matter is not within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts and to suggest that he or she writes to the local government auditor or the appropriate office that carries out audits for local authorities.</p> <p>  No. 2118C, dated 15 April 2019, is from Deputy Catherine Murphy with a query for the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding grant payments from the reconciliation fund.</p></speech>

It was very helpful and I thank Ms Lyons for sending the information, which was very instructive.  With regard to value for money, on the housing assistance payment, HAP, we are aware that &euro;431 million was the projected figure this year alone, and that is rising.  The rental accommodation scheme, RAS, is long-term and short-term leasing.  I see from the Housing Agency figures that the Cope Foundation has 960 staff and just 57 units.  I am aware of another Cope organisation in Galway, but I am not commenting on that, or on Ability West, which is very good, and I am not choosing any specific projects, but I am looking at the Cope Foundation figure of 960 staff.  I thought this was to deal with homelessness but it has only 57 units while also having 960 staff.  Let us consider that the city council is struggling in this regard.  Last week we received a letter from the council to say it could not meet us with regard to housing because it does not have enough staff and no place to meet.  In the middle of all of this, I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General where we deal with value for money in the context of 10,000 people who are homeless in a housing crisis and a listing for an organisation of almost 1,000 staff?</p></speech>

There are glossy documents and a million things.  Obviously we need organisations working on the ground and I am not commenting on that.  I am commenting on the use of money and value for money, with a crisis that is intensifying.  Where is the balance between straying into politics and looking at value for money in our housing programmes? The figure of 960 staff in the Cope Foundation jumps out at me.  There are 600 staff in Ability West and 433 in KARE, but I do not know who they are-----</p></speech>

In addition we have the Ombudsman talking about no value for money in relation to the modular homes - he might not have used that language - and no assessment being done on what they are giving.  A figure used for modular homes was &euro;100 million.  It would be remiss of me not to say something here about no value for money in what is happening given that the crisis is intensifying.</p></speech>

Charities are doing work that should be done by public services.  There is a problem in that we are finding it hard even to get a coherent map of who does what and where.  It is very difficult to test value for money when there is that kind of fragmentation.  It is not that there is not very good work being done by all of these organisations but they are doing the core work as opposed to additional work and there is a fragmentation of services.  If there is good organisation embedded in one location, a person may get a different outcome.  The lack of coherence is part of the problem and a value for money issue is part of that.  A big reform piece is needed.</p></speech>

The issue of those working on the housing side of things will come up in a report that we will try to do on broadband and housing, before our periodic report, to deal with these two big issues that we have been dealing with over recent months.  We want to flag this issue for the HSE when it comes into the committee.  It is clear from the schedule that most of the employees of these organisations are paid for through the HSE and they would be section 39 organisations.  There has been much discussion around section 38 organisations but I am aware that the section 39 organisations have improved their corporate governance and that service level agreements are in place across the board.  We are, however, back to a situation with the HSE's policy of not providing services such as home help, for example.  Everything is done through agencies.  Sometimes there are houses with three different agencies providing different levels of home help over the course of one week.  Sometimes the agencies cannot recruit staff.  The HSE appears to have divested itself of one of its core activities.  This is a policy of privatisation, full stop.  The HSE has consistently reduced the number of its home help staff over the years and has outsourced the service.  Regardless of whether it is policy for the HSE, we will put the value for money issue, in the context of all the outsourced services, onto our agenda for the meeting with the HSE when it comes into the committee before the summer on its annual financial statement.  We will have an opportunity to come back to this value for money element though those section 39 organisations.  I thank the Deputy for bringing us back to that item.</p> <p>  There is one account to be noted that was laid in the Oireachtas over the past week - members will see that on screen - which is the National Gallery of Ireland, and it is a clear audit opinion.  It is very straightforward and we do not have to discuss it.  This is noted.</p> <p>  There are no significant changes to the committee's work programme since last week so we will discuss it again after the break.  I note that we have agreed to do a report on the broadband issue and the housing issue.  I ask the secretariat to have documents sent to members before we return after the Easter break so we can move immediately to clear those, if possible.  We can discuss them when we see them.  The plan was to get those two sections out of the way and we will then resume our normal periodic report.  I am just confirming an earlier decision.  The committee will just do its best to clear both of those as early as possible after the break.</p> <p>  There are no other items so I propose to suspend the meeting briefly.</p></speech>

We joined from the EPA by Ms Laura Burke, director general, who is accompanied by Mr. Gerard O'Leary, Dr. Tom Ryan and Mr. Dan Harney.  The representatives from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment are Ms Caroline Lyons and Ms Aoife Byrne.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones should be switched off entirely or put on airplane mode, as merely putting them on silent will interfere with the recording mechanism.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee - that means me - to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee should refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, a Minister or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The EPA merged with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in August 2014.</p> <p>  The EPA is governed by an executive board consisting of a director general and five directors, who are appointed by the Government.  While the EPA operates generally under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, it also has a relationship with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which has responsibility for drinking water, urban wastewater and water quality. </p> <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s 2017 financial statements record total income of almost &euro;71.2 million.  State grant funding for the year totalled just under &euro;50 million.  Deferred retirement benefit funding recognised in income was a further &euro;9.2 million.  The EPA&rsquo;s operational activities, including licensing, enforcement, radiological and other activities, generated income of &euro;12.3 million, or approximately 17% of income for the year. </p> <p>  Expenditure incurred by the EPA in 2017 totalled almost &euro;69.6 million.  Approximately 50% of the expenditure incurred related to salaries and retirement benefit costs.  The agency reported an operating surplus of approximately &euro;344,000 for the year.  I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the financial statements for 2017.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Gerard O&rsquo;Leary, deputy director general, Dr. Tom Ryan, director of the office of environmental enforcement, and Mr. Dan Harney, finance officer.  As requested, I have provided a briefing statement in advance of the meeting and, therefore, will keep my comments short.</p> <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency is an independent public body under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  As has been indicated, the agency has a close working relationship with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government due to its role in protecting and improving water resources.  The agency&rsquo;s role operates across a number of important strategic priorities for Ireland.  We have a wide range of functions, under the broad headings of regulation, knowledge and advocacy.  We perform a diverse range of activities, including environmental and radiological regulation, the regulation of greenhouse gases through the EU emissions trading scheme, the provision of national greenhouse gas inventories and projections to the EU and the UN, environmental research, environmental monitoring and supporting the circular economy.  The agency&rsquo;s scientific expertise is recognised as a significant resource, both nationally and internationally, and our work provides the scientific evidence that enables informed decision making, better policy and better information for the public.</p> <p>  The directors and I take our responsibilities for corporate governance seriously and I can confirm that the EPA is in compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  We have developed and use a framework of assurances that includes an audit and risk committee, internal audits and an executive risk committee.  Since the EPA&rsquo;s internal audit structures were established in 2003, 38 audits and value-for-money reviews in a broad range of operational areas have been undertaken.  Annually, I receive a report from the chair of the audit and risk committee, who is external to the EPA, which is also presented to the board.  I take significant assurance from this report and the role of the committee in providing assurance that the EPA&rsquo;s risk management processes and its system of internal controls are operating effectively, that the major business risks are being managed and that the governance processes are working well.  As director general, I also take significant value and assurance from the unqualified audit opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the EPA&rsquo;s 2017 accounts and for each year&rsquo;s annual financial statements since the EPA came into existence in 1993. </p> <p>  As the committee will see from the EPA annual report, the total budget available to the agency in 2017 was &euro;71.2 million.  The funding for the agency comes from a number of sources, including Exchequer funding, the environment fund, the water services programme and earned income.  Using the funds and resources available to us, the EPA had significant achievements in 2017 in delivering on our mandate and I will comment briefly on these.  On regulation, during 2017, the environmental licensing programme issued 108 decisions on environmental licensing and over 70 technical amendments covering, for example, large industry, waste facilities, dumping at sea and wastewater discharges.  In addition, the team dealt with over 600 statutory consultations.  In 2017, the EPA was named European leader in providing online access to licence and permit information, which is an acknowledgment of the importance we attach to public participation in our decision making.  With regard to radiation protection, the EPA issued just under 300 licences.  Over 1,500 visits to industrial and waste facilities took place in 2017, while there were 320 inspections of urban wastewater sites and 57 drinking water site inspections.  In addition, 29 prosecutions were heard during the year, resulting in fines and costs of &euro;390,000. </p> <p>  On knowledge, the EPA continues to deliver on our key roles in supporting the implementation, monitoring and assessment of climate action through collating national greenhouse gas emissions and projections for the EU and UN, regulating emissions, providing the secretariat to the Climate Change Advisory Council and through climate research.</p><p>In 2017, the EPA funded &euro;11.2 million in new environmental research projects, including many on climate issues.  In 2017, we continued our very successful public climate lecture series, while more recently we have taken on a key facilitation role in the national dialogue on climate action.</p><p> In 2017, the EPA issued a number of reports on water quality, including a national assessment of water quality and reports on bathing water quality, private drinking water supplies, urban wastewater treatment, the national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems and drinking water quality.  We issued a report on air quality and developed a new national ambient air quality monitoring programme with the ambition of significantly increasing the availability of localised real-time air quality information.</p><p> With regard to advocacy, the EPA plays an important role in raising levels of awareness and supporting initiatives that increase citizen science engagement with environmental issues.  The global learning and observations to benefit the environment, GLOBE, programme is an international science and education programme that provides school students with the opportunity to participate in data collection and to contribute meaningfully to the understanding of the earth system and global environment.  GLOBE was relaunched in Ireland in 2017 and this two-year pilot programme is managed by An Taisce in partnership with the EPA.   </p><p> The national waste prevention programme, led by the EPA, works to foster the circular economy in Ireland, including advocating for waste prevention and using resources more efficiently.  During 2017 initiatives were promoted to homeowners, businesses and other sectors, which include the EPA's Stop Food Waste programme and the Food Waste Charter, which is a collective commitment to reduce food waste along the entire supply chain, and five major retailers signed the Food Waste Charter in 2017.  </p><p> The matters I have referred to illustrate well the broad range of programmes and activities for which the agency had responsibility in 2017.  Ireland has a precious and unique resource in our natural environment and it is something of which we are rightly proud.  Our environment, however, faces significant threats and we in the EPA will continue to prioritise valuable resources to address these threats.  </p><p> I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge during today's meeting. </p></speech>

We do it in different ways for different companies.  In terms of the figures, for the enforcement charges, we are up at around 95% to 96% for cost recovery.  The Deputy can imagine that particularly with enforcement, issues can arise where there is unanticipated work at a site during the year.  With regard to licensing charges, these are the fees for applications coming into the agency, the cost recovery is a lot lower.  It is probably around 10% to 15%.  Those are charges for applications that were set back in 1993 and 1996 and they have not been increased since then, and so the cost recovery is much lower.</p></speech>

That is for Water Framework Directive monitoring.

It is money given to the agency to monitor the Water Framework Directive.  It is separate from the Irish Water side of things.  It is to perform monitoring on the water environment.  Part of that is a subcontract to the Marine Institute to do work and it has asked us to do that.</p></speech>

Regarding the more than &euro;8 million incurred, is that accounted for by the EPA subcontracting or outsourcing work that it is not in a position to do itself?  With respect to the reference to contractors and external service providers, the obvious question I have is why the expertise is not available in-house.  Why must we outsource that level of cost and spend?  Is there an issue regarding the skills within the EPA to do this work or is it that it is considered better to get an external service provider to do it?  What is the rationale for it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#H02800"><p>As I said, &euro;1.2 million was for the Marine Institute and that is separate.  With regard to the others, it is for things, for example, such as funding under the national waste prevention programme.  That, by its nature, is an outsourced model in that we identify key items to be done and we work with the local authorities and others to do that work at local level.  We also work with other companies, for example, to do some work on waste characterisation.  That was one of the big projects  identified in that year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#H02900"><p>I understand what the agency does but the issue is why it is done and why it is done in that way because we consider the value for money context.  If we are spending millions of euro and Mr. Burke's organisation is subcontracting work to be done by outside organisations, I would like to know why that is being done.  Is it for the purpose that the agency wants to get independent outside analysis or views or is it that there is not the expertise within the organisation to do it or is it both of those?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.103" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#H03000"><p>We certainly have expertise.  We have 411 staff with expertise.  There are a few different models.  One of the models is for once-off types of work, such as the waste characterisation which is the reason I mentioned it.  In a value for money context, that is something we would do only once every large number of years.  To get the resources to do that into the agency on a temporary basis and then to have that work finished would not represent value for money.  It is a better use of money to outsource that.  In other areas, it is not a question of not having the resources but it is more appropriate that things would be done, for example, through the local authority or the county councils with regard to resource efficiency.  It is a deliberate model in order to do that.  Were the Deputy to ask me whether we have enough staff to do all of the work we have to do, like every other public service body I would say, "No", in all honesty. </p><p>We currently have a workforce plan with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to resource new work as it comes down the track.</p></speech>

Ms Burke is the head of the organisation and oversees a spend of more than &euro;8 million on outside contractors and external service providers.  At a strategic level, has the EPA examined whether there might be better value for money in getting in-house expertise to do some of this work in the future?  I understand that one-off projects might require very specialist work and it might make more sense to undertake them using the current model.  Has the EPA examined this?  Ms Burke notes that every organisation, Department or subsection of a Department would say that it wants more staff.  The overall spend on external contractors is quite high relative to the EPA's overall spend.  Has the agency reviewed the possibility of saying to the Department that providing more money for the EPA to do this work in-house would be more cost-effective?</p></speech>

We use a different model to govern the money we spend on external resources in different areas of the organisation.  I am certainly satisfied that this model is fit for purpose and we are satisfied with it.  There are areas where outsourcing is suitable.  Again I would cite the national waste prevention programme as an example.  There are other areas where we will not outsource, such as our core licensing function or our inspection and enforcement functions regarding industrial facilities.  We look at that on a regular basis.</p></speech>

I am curious about the breakdown.  Perhaps Ms Burke could provide the committee with a detailed breakdown of these contractors and external service providers.  Who are they?  What work do they do?  Perhaps we can have a look at that ourselves.</p></speech>

The first of these is our use of radiological consultants.  As I said during my opening statement, since our merger with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, we have had a function in regulating radiological facilities.  There is an example in Leinster House.  The device that screens visitors as they come in must be licensed by the EPA.  However the technology used in hospitals and other businesses changes all the time.  We use consultants to support and advise on that radiological function.  That accounts for around &euro;75,000 of the &euro;305,000 the Deputy identified.</p> <p>  My opening statement also mentioned the importance of communications.  In 2017 we spent &euro;60,000 on a complete review of our website.  That is a substantial sum of money but as our main tool of communication with people, it is important that our website is as user-friendly as possible.  The EPA website gets 1 million hits.  That is suitable for an external view.  If we look at our website we will have a particular view.  If others with expertise look at it-----</p></speech>

I was reading the report on urban wastewater treatment in 2017, which in many respects is quite a damning report on wastewater infrastructure.  In my own county of Waterford we are very lucky to have wastewater infrastructure of a very high quality.  Is that the most recent EPA report or has there been a subsequent report?  I know that some improvements have been made since.</p></speech>

An awful lot of money obviously needs to be spent and a lot needs to be done.  From the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is concerned with value for money, I note that the EU Commission also commenced infringement proceedings against this State for our failure to meet obligations.

That process is managed by the Department.  My understanding is that there will be further engagement with the Commission and ultimately there may or may not be daily fines.  The Department itself is engaging with the Commission in that regard on behalf of "Ireland Inc.".  We provide scientific information on the status of wastewater treatment.  The Department looks after the policy end of that.</p></speech>

It points out the places where we are not meeting our obligations.  Are the reports that have been given to the Department ignored?  Have the investments simply not been made?  If things have got to a point where the EPA has consistently been pointing out that we could end up being taken to court and fined by the European Union, then it would make more sense to make the investment rather than having to pay fines.</p></speech>

We are in complete agreement on that.  To be clear, our report is to "Ireland Inc.".  The report on urban wastewater treatment is a national report.  It feeds into the Department, but it is not addressed to the Department as its only audience.</p> <p>  With regard to pointing out the failures, yes, the role of the agency is to describe the situation based on scientific evidence.  We have highlighted non-compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive.  As I have indicated, more recently we have highlighted that although there has been significant progress on the drinking water side of things, we have seen less progress on urban wastewater and the pace of investment is not fast enough.</p></speech>

It strikes me that this is a long-running issue.  It also strikes me that maybe investment was cut during the austerity years, which potentially had an impact.</p> <p>  My understanding was that previously, in housing committees, &euro;620 million was made available from 2017 to 2021, which was a reduction from the originally intended &euro;1 billion.  Is there an interdepartmental group that looks at the investments which are being made and whether we are now making sufficient investments to ensure we can satisfy the framework and directive in order that we do not end up with fines?

That includes a number of bodies, not only ourselves but also the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which is the economic regulator of Irish Water.  There is also a recently-established committee that was a result of the report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future Funding of Domestic Water Services on water charges.  It is chaired by Mr. Paul McGowan of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and the EPA sits on that committee.  It is also looking at delivery by Irish Water because there is a combination of things involved.  We are saying we are not seeing delivery, particularly in urban wastewater, quickly enough.  The other aspect is to ensure that money is spent efficiently.  The money is needed but it needs to be delivered in the right areas.</p></speech>

I can speak from the point of view of the agency and what was stated in the report.  To answer the Deputy's question, there has been no dramatic change since then.  Are we satisfied that legacy issues and historical underinvestment in urban wastewater have been addressed?  We still say it is not happening at a fast enough pace and if Irish Water is to meet its commitment to invest an average of &euro;326 million per year on urban wastewater infrastructure, it will need to invest approximately &euro;1 billion in the period 2020 to 2021.  We are following that as well.</p></speech>

The EPA's remit involves the monitoring of intensive agriculture practices and makes specific mention of pigs and chickens.  What sort of data is the EPA collecting?  Many of the antibiotics that go into pig and chicken feeds are powdered.  Is the EPA looking at distribution in the local air or at the waste produced by pigs and chickens?  Is that waste being used as fertiliser on land?  Really what I am getting at is the pathway of antibiotics into drinking water.  That is where I am going with this.  Could Ms Burke elaborate on exactly what the EPA is doing when monitoring chicken, poultry and pigs?  What is the specific role of the EPA and what is it specifically measuring?</p></speech>

It is looking at intensive agriculture where there is a large number of chickens or pigs of different types all contained within a specific area.  Our role is specific to looking at emissions at the site where the intensive agriculture is happening.  For example, the EPA looks at things like ammonia emissions and the potential impacts on water quality in the area.  It is concerned with emissions of environmental pollutants.</p> <p>  In the context of regulation, it is ensuring-----</p></speech>

Is the EPA monitoring powdered antibiotics in the air and which are falling out of the chicken's trough, or however one feeds a chicken?  Is the EPA monitoring the waste produced, the pig slurry and whatever happens to chicken waste?  Is the EPA monitoring the product being produced that I suspect has high levels of antibiotics and is perhaps being spread on land near water supplies?  I am specifically asking if the EPA is monitoring those antibiotics.</p></speech>

However, we would feed in on antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance.  There is a specific national plan on antimicrobial resistance into which the agency has fed.  The EPA is on the working group for that plan, identifying the environmental aspects involved and has done research in the area.  Industrial emissions, however, are not within the remit of the EPA.</p></speech>

In London, eels were behaving bizarrely in the River Thames at some point.  I am being deadly serious.  There are a number of European countries in which drinking water has been found to have a quantity of drugs, be they illicit or otherwise.  I am concerned about that in terms of foetal development and regular development.  Have we data for that in any of our urban centres?  Is the EPA looking at that in the light of other findings in other European cities?  I think four cities were mentioned, from memory, with London and Amsterdam being among them.

Each board member is an executive and it is a full-time job.  The first thing I should say is that all travel and subsistence is paid in accordance with the Department of Finance codes.  On where board members would be going, for example, we have five regional offices around the country so board members would be going to those offices and meeting up with their staff.  As each of the teams has a staff complement of approximately 100 people, they have to meet them and visit them.  At an international level, there are EU meetings, there are meetings of the European Environment Agency where the EPA is very active, in the context of Brexit in particular we meet our UK colleagues to ensure consistency of work and we also meet other EU colleagues.  It is in the normal course of their everyday work, which, as I said, is different.</p></speech>

We have a combination of our own premises, such as our headquarters in Wexford, which is owned by the State and the EPA.  We also have our own facility in Monaghan, and then we lease our Castlebar office from Mayo County Council, which is a long-standing arrangement.  The State also owns our building in Kilkenny.  On our buildings in Dublin, we have a licence agreement with University College Dublin, UCD.  We are based on the Richview campus and that is also long-standing, probably around 15 or 20 years old at this stage.  When the merger between the EPA and the RPII took place, the RPII rented a building on the same campus so we continued on with that rental agreement.  We did go out last year when the term of the rental agreement was up for renewal and we got advice on the status of the amount we were paying for rent and we got assurance from an independent estate agent that the amount we were spending was not in excess of what we should be spending.</p></speech>

Mergers are notoriously difficult but having all of the staff within two minutes of one another makes life an awful lot easier.  What we have also done there is move people from building to building so it has meant that there is not really a disruption for staff and it has meant that there is a much better integration of staff across the agency.</p></speech>

However, what I would say is that in the context of the merger, we have identified a number of opportunities through simple things, such as having only one receptionist in the Dublin campus, rather than the two receptionists that we would have had, which is a saving in itself.  On the water and laboratories side of things, we now have one manager for the water and radiation laboratories in the Dublin office, whereas there would have been more than that, at least two.  We also now have a single multi-site accreditation for our laboratories, which is also an efficiency and an economy of scale.  The water and radiation laboratories have come together.  There have been a number of efficiencies in those and the other aspect that was identified by a peer review of Ireland's response to radiological emergencies was that the RPII itself was based in Dublin and did not have a regional presence, whereas we are now using our laboratories across the country to be able to provide an emergency response to and be prepared for a radiological issue.  Staff in the laboratories are now trained to do some of that monitoring as well, so that is providing an additional service at no additional cost to the State.</p></speech>

I used to read a lot of the EPA's stuff as a child in libraries back in the day.  There was limited material to read in Westmeath and without divulging my age, I was of the first generation of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.  On the EPA's practices and what it feeds into the school's programme, does the EPA have a comprehensive method of self-auditing?  For example, the slogan used to be Recycle and now it is Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, so things change over time.  My point is that I have a serious concern about who gets in at our children's psyches in school and is about the remit and clearance for ideas the EPA or An Taisce might have, as well as for laying those ideas in front of young children in school.  Many times they are very good practices and children seem to lead the way on different types of recycling and on the conservation of water but what sort of barriers and protections are there for parents who would not naturally have expected that the EPA or An Taisce would have any involvement in their children's educational curriculum?</p></speech>

On the GLOBE project itself, this is a programme that has been in operation for many years.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, have been involved in it.  This is not about telling children what to do; it is about taking measurements of one's natural environment and then comparing those measurements with other countries and being able to see what the difference is in air quality in Ireland versus Germany versus Israel.  It is about developing one's scientific skills but there is a common benchmark of how one goes about it.  As I said, it is not telling them something, it is about bringing children together from the age of eight to 18 and doing citizen's science and measurements.  As I said, air quality is the one we started off with.  Some 49 different countries came together in Kerry last year in July for the GLOBE project.  For me, it was inspiring to see children from Ghana talking to children from India and America about science, the importance of science and the importance of the natural environment.  They went out and they took measurements in Killarney National Park and looked at the environment there.  To answer the Deputy's question, because that is an international programme, it is very stringent and it is all about science and scientific measurements so that is what gives us comfort.</p><p>That is really important in the context of engaging with schools.  We are not engaging directly.  We are engaging through this internationally-recognised programme.</p></speech>

Do we have a protection in place there for what is entering the curriculum in a school?  As a parent, I would have thought that was solely under the remit of the Department and that I did not have to worry about anyone else.  In light of recent reports, I was quite concerned.  I am wondering about the protections there in terms of who has the final say on what gets into our schools and is on the curriculum in our public schools.</p></speech>

I am thinking of the one in Kerdiffstown that cost a fortune to remediate.  Where does the EPA come in on something like that, or is that primarily a local authority function?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Laura Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019041800002#M01500"><p>Like everything, the Kerdiffstown issue is a little bit complicated and I am going to have to be slightly careful because there is an ongoing criminal prosecution there.  If I divide it into old and new, there are a lot of legacy sites around the country.  The waste management plans identified around 500 legacy landfill sites around the country.  The EPA's role in that area is primarily around regulation, technical advice and support to the local authorities.  The Kerdiffstown site the Deputy mentioned was a legacy site, which was in operation from the 1950s, and by the 1990s it had around 2 million tonnes of waste in it.  It came into the EPA then for licensing, so this is one that transferred from the old system to the new, and we licensed that site to bring it into a regulatory regime.  It was operated between 2003 and 2010, when it was abandoned, and to be blunt about it, it was a very difficult site.  We had numerous complaints and took numerous legal actions, including three civil actions against the site, and a criminal action through the Director of Public Prosecutions, which is ongoing.  I believe there is one case in the Supreme Court and one in the High Court at the moment.</p></speech>

In her opening statement she talked about the national waste prevention programme.  That is very good work and I do not want to be negative about it, so I just want to say that in advance of what I am going to say.  It strikes me that our waste policy is daft, in that we have an incinerator in Ringsend, and all our licensed landfills are now in Leinster.  The one in Galway is either closed or is about to close.  Does the EPA have a remit in relation to that, because rubbish is being collected in Kerry and being driven to Dublin, Kildare, or Carlow to be disposed of?  What role does the EPA have in relation to waste policy?  We can do things to prevent waste but we ultimately have to dispose of it somewhere.  Where is the remit there?</p></speech>

Waste policy is the responsibility of the Department.  With regard to where sites go, that is a combination of planning, as I am sure the Deputy can imagine.  The local authorities are responsible for waste management and waste management infrastructure in their regions, but anybody can apply to the EPA for a licence to operate a facility.  We have that regulatory role, and a regulatory role over those licensed sites, but we do not determine waste management policy.</p></speech>

However, because we report waste generation and treatment of waste, that provides the national statistics in order to support waste policy.  What we are doing, and it is all on our website, is saying how much waste is generated, where it is being treated, what is being landfilled, etc.  The other piece on that is, when one looks at the dependence on landfill, we have gone from a situation of having 200 landfills in the 1980s, down to four licensed lined landfills now.  The local dump is gone, and our role is to ensure that the landfills that are being operated are being operated properly.</p></speech>

I want to deal with the large-scale industrial activities.  We received a report some months ago when we had the Department in about Aughinish in Limerick, and I know the EPA is a totally independent agency, but it has a responsibility in relation to integration, pollution control, and licences.  We were told in relation to that report that work was done in July 2014 on getting a financial provision package of &euro;28 million in place to cover clean up and things like that.  That is the financial aspect, but there is a longstanding issue in relation to human health, and an investigation was done on that, which cost somewhere in the region of &euro;5 million.  That is going back some years.  Essentially, there was concern about public health, and this is what I am coming to in relation to contingent liability and where the EPA's remit is.  Some blood samples went missing, for example, and that is an outstanding issue.  I visited the area in 2016 and I was quite appalled about what I heard from people there, including the burning of skin, cancers and things like that.  Would the EPA have a role, for example, in advising the likes of the HSE, or is it the reverse in relation to whether or not it is just financial provision that is required, or is there a health component that the agency has a role in advising on, to avoid liabilities into the future, and to make sure this licence not only covers the clean-up and any subsequent activity, or if it ceases to trade that there would be sufficient funds to deal with that?  Where does the health aspect come into that?</p></speech>

I will address the health issue first and then go back to deal with the existing licence.  Aughinish Alumina started production in 1983 and has been licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, since 1998 under the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  There was a multi-agency investigation in the 1990s.  It had commenced prior to the EPA being established and concluded in February 1995.  That multi-agency investigation was led by the then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and included Teagasc, the then Mid-Western Health Board and the EPA.  It covered all health and environmental aspects.  That investigation concluded there was no evidence that environmental pollution contributed to an increased incidence of animal disease or unusual human health patterns.  I want to be clear that there was that report.  Since then there has also been an EU pilot case with regard to this site.  That case was opened in 2011 and closed in 2014.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on how the health and environment aspects interlink, when the EPA licenses facilities the HSE is a statutory consultee of the agency and gives advice to the agency on our licence applications.  In addition, we do modelling on air quality against standards, for example, and when a facility is up and running we then do monitoring.  There is a combination there looking at health.  The EPA also has a health advisory committee, which was established in 2011.  We also had very strong engagement with the HSE and health boards prior to that.  The advisory committee also gives the agency advice on health.  The HSE is a consultee specifically and site by site and was also involved in that previous multi-site investigation previously.</p> <p>  On the financial provision aspect, we get extensive legal and financial expertise, as well as our own technical expertise, to ensure that the moneys set aside will cover whatever sums of money are required for the closure of a site. </p></speech>

Sometimes I come across an issue that has a real effect on me and this is one of them.</p> <p>  When the EPA visits a facility that is licensed, is the visit notified or is it made on spec?  It is a little like when the cigire scoile visits a school and everybody is dressed in their good clothes.  What is the ratio of announced to unannounced visits?</p></speech>

One of the key premises of the industrial emissions directive is that it is not one size fits all.  It is about the type of site and where it is operating.  When the EPA looks at the closure remediation after-care management plans submitted from the licensee, we look at them from a technical aspect and, based on our expertise, identify if the appropriate things are covered.  A transfer station would be different from a big industrial facility or pharmaceutical plant.  Each is different.  We have that technical expertise but we also pull in expertise as necessary.  For example, we will use a mine specialist if we are concerned about a particular type of industry.  It is not only about identifying the risk but also identifying what would be the cost of addressing that risk.  This is where we would also pull in financial expertise and, depending on the type of site, legal expertise.</p></speech>

The EPA can only monitor and advise and it is up to Government to determine policy.  Ireland has been missing its climate targets.  Does the EPA advise on the emissions trading scheme?

I knew the figure was around 90% but I can now confirm that.</p> <p>  On climate change, the EPA has a number of different roles, one of which is the emissions trading scheme to which the Deputy referred.  This is a European Union scheme and the EPA is a competent authority to ensure compliance with the scheme.  Each of the approximately 100 facilities in Ireland is allowed to emit a particular amount of carbon.  We control that and each facility has to report in to us.  If they emit more, they have to buy allowances.  If they do not buy allowances, they are then subject to enforcement action.  We have taken enforcement action as necessary.  That is the emissions aspect.</p></speech>

The whole idea of the emissions trading scheme is that trading is allowed and if a company has not engaged in trading and has not been compliant, the fine is very high.  It works at a cost assumption for carbon at around &euro;100 per tonne, which is not discretionary.  The EPA does not have discretion on that.  If a facility is not compliant, the amount is set at European Union level.</p></speech>

One fine was &euro;210,000 and the other was &euro;51,000.  That is on the emissions trading side of things.  It is a stringent regime.</p><p> On the broader issue of inventories and projections, which cover the science and the evidence that can be stood over and investigated, the UN and the EU have looked at how we calculate those inventories and projections.  What we have highlighted is perhaps not dissimilar to the urban wastewater issue.  We have highlighted this issue over a long number of years, including during the recession.  During the recession, when emissions were going down, we highlighted that emission-induced reductions were not sustainable and that as soon as the economy took off again, emissions would go up.  We have definitely seen that happen, particularly in areas such as transport and agriculture.</p><p> With regard to our role, we provide scientific and technical advice to the Government and other bodies.  We have seen that emissions are only projected to decrease by 6% by 2020 under what we call the "with additional measures" scenario, meaning all existing policies and additional policies and measures included in the national development plan for 2018 to 2027.</p></speech>

We have to look now at 2030.  At the minute, we are seeing a 13% reduction by 2030 in a best case scenario, with additional measures, meaning that we would be exceeding our compliance obligations by 7 million tonnes.  This means that around 7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide or equivalent will have to be made up in that time period.  We are saying that we have to look across all sectors and decide where those 7 million tons can be made up, be it in transport or agriculture or another area.  We have to look at the big hitters.  Transport and agriculture make up around 70% of the non-ETS emissions.  Therefore, we have to look at those areas.  Residential and other areas could also be looked at.  The key is the all-of-Government climate plan that is being prepared, which should look at addressing that gap.</p> <p>  Through the Exchequer funding we get, we fund environmental research which then supports potential changes that can be made, for example, the potential for carbon sequestration.</p></speech>

Two weeks ago, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Central Statistics Office appeared before this committee.  I would place the EPA among them as together they make up the trinity of organisations that are most important to the country in terms of trust and accountability.  I welcome the accounts.  I believe it is the first time that a clear audit has been achieved.  No issues around procurement have arisen either.  In my three years on this committee, there has always been an issue.  I welcome the EPA on that positive note.  It is important to believe in the Central Statistics Office, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Environmental Protection Agency.  We are utterly reliant on them.</p> <p>  The briefing document notes that the EPA identified a shortage of skills in its work plan for 2019.

The agency has been asked to carry out a number of new functions, for example, water abstraction licensing, regulation of medium combustion plants and review of urban wastewater licences.  Although we had temporary staff when the urban wastewater licences were originally issued, those staff are now gone.  Article 27 and 28 decisions are now under our remit as well.  They concern by-products and end of waste, which are particularly important in the context of the construction sector in terms of what happens to waste and whether something is waste or a by-product.  We also have a backlog of licence applications.  We have 17 staff doing assessments of licence applications across industrial emissions, waste and a variety of other things, and we have more applications coming in than we can get out the other side of the door.  These are very complex applications.  We have to consider environmental impact assessment, appropriate assessment, etc.</p> <p>  That is one area.  The other main area is enforcement.  We are currently engaging with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to see how we can better support local authority waste enforcement and drive further rigorous enforcement in waste in Ireland.

Could we have a note on those sites?  We would all be interested in seeing them.  Perhaps the EPA could outline how many there are, which had licences and if they were compliant.  We are being left with a legacy.  We had a brilliant system in Galway.  When I hear about dialogue and helping enforcement, it reminds me that Galway did not have problems.  We rolled out recycling a long time ago.  The response was that the Government took power from the local authorities.  We wanted our own plan in Galway city and county and to be able to manage waste locally.  We were very proactive and achieved 70% recycling rates in a pilot project lasting six weeks.  As I have said repeatedly, to the point of boredom, that the solutions have been in place for a long time.  Ms Burke will forgive my impatience at the use of the word "dialogue" and the language of encouraging people.</p><p>People are leading us.  They want action.  They wanted it in Galway and the official response was terrible.  I am not asking Ms Burke to comment on that.  We will examine the landfill in east Galway.

I will first comment on landfill in general because it would be bad to not mention this point.  Regarding where we have come to in Ireland, about 90% of our municipal waste was going into landfills in 2000 but that has reduced to 26% in 2018.  There has been significant progress regarding dependence on landfill and local dumps or unlined landfills.  That is the history.  On east Galway-----</p></speech>

We were doing things very well in Galway city but the official response was not good.  It was not an example of not in my back yard, NIMBY, syndrome.

The licence was granted in July 2004 to accept 100,000 tonnes of municipal waste annually.  The licence was held between 2004 and 2013.  Greenstar went into receivership in 2013.  The then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Galway County Council and the EPA were the guardians of the site in the interim.  To be clear, financial provision was in place for this site.  Money was set aside in the accounts for the closure, remediation and aftercare of the site.  The banks, however, did not honour those arrangements at the time.  The EPA initiated legal proceedings against the Greenstar Group, the Bank of Ireland and the bank appointed receiver to get the money that had been set aside to be used solely for the purposes of the closure, remediation and aftercare of the site.  We brought that case to the High Court, which ruled against the EPA.  It was a question of company law versus environmental law.  We then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.  We were not satisfied that the money set aside for environmental remediation could be removed in the way that it had been, leaving the arrangements in place not honoured.  There was, ultimately, a settlement in which the bank did not admit liability.  A sum of money was paid over, however, that could then be used by Galway County Council for the closure, remediation and aftercare of the site.  That site is now a landfill operated by Galway County Council, as Deputy Connolly stated.  The closure of that landfill site is now being sought.</p></speech>

That is my understanding.  To reiterate, financial provision was in place for the closure, remediation and aftercare of the east Galway site.  We were disappointed with events in 2013 and we took significant legal action against the bank and the receiver.  As a result of that case, requirements on licensees have become much more onerous.  We have led development at a European level on what is acceptable for financial provision.  We are not alone in Ireland in having experienced a situation such as this.  Other countries have experienced similar issues, for example, the United Kingdom.  That is why there are now onerous requirements and the key issue is to ensure that money is sufficient, secure and available.  That is why we now have stringent requirements, such as bonds for landfills to ensure the money is available and the State does not end up paying for such sites.</p></speech>

A technical assessment has to be done first to identify what is required, as Deputy Catherine Murphy has indicated.  There then needs to be an examination of whether the costs are appropriate.  That is the costing.  The issue arises then of how to protect the money.  From the perspective of the EPA, the money has to be sufficient, secure and available.  We accept a number different types of financial provision, namely, a secured fund, an on-demand performance bond, a parental company guarantee, a charge on property or environmental impairment liability insurance.  I should, however, be clear that we do not accept every type of fund for every type of liability.  We would not accept a parental company guarantee or environmental insurance in the case of inevitable closure, for example.  It would have to be a secured fund, an on-demand performance bond or a charge on property in that case.  It all depends on the liability.</p></speech>

On 16 January 2017, a figure of &euro;28 million was mentioned in a letter from the EPA or issued via the Department.

However, I will park that.</p> <p>  I will turn to buffer zones, sewage treatment plants and radon.  I do not wish to be parochial but an issue arose with a treatment plant in Spiddal and it has a general application with regard to guidelines from the EPA on buffer zones near wastewater treatment plants.  I am not expecting Ms Burke to comment on an individual case but the inspector from An Bord Plean&aacute;la acknowledged in his report that the guidelines from the EPA are old and dated.  I believe they are from 1990 or 1999.  He said the guidance document is 20 years old and does not deal with larger wastewater treatment plants.  This was in the context of one wastewater treatment plant where the residents wanted a larger buffer zone from the plant.  They cited the EPA guidelines and the inspector cited them in recommending permission.  However, he said it had to be acknowledged that they are 20 years old.  In views of the changes in everything, such as scientific evidence and technology, does the EPA plan to update those guidelines?</p></speech>

I refer to table 4 of the EPA's wastewater treatment manual on treatment systems for small communities.  I am asking about the general issue.  Those guidelines are from 1999 and are on treatment systems for small communities, business, leisure centres and hotels.  When building a water treatment plant near those facilities we look at guidelines from 1999.  Is the EPA planning to update them or is it satisfied that they are adequate?</p></speech>

I remember that during the consultation process there was a desire to set at least some criteria.  The Deputy should not hold me to this but I believe the word "minimum" is there.  Things have moved on a great deal in the area of dispersion modelling and, regardless of whether we were to change the guidance, the modern approach to odour is to do dispersion modelling.  One can do it much better than using an arbitrary figure because one can quantify the amount of odour that can be generated from a wastewater treatment plant and model it in different directions.  A far better approach at this stage would be to model the activity as opposed to putting a set number to it.</p></speech>

That is from the EPA's research completed in 2018.  It states that accumulation of radon in homes is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking and approximately 500 people are living in homes with radon concentrations above the acceptable level.  Again, my house has been affected.  I understand the uptake for radon remediation is not great.  Perhaps that is the wrong way to put it but not enough people are taking the assistance offered in respect of radon.  Will Ms Burke comment on that paragraph in the report?

Before the EPA the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII, highlighted it for many years.  It is a big concern that people might not be aware of, so it spent many years highlighting the issue of radon.  We took that on following the merger of the EPA and the RPII.  We have active campaigns to highlight the issue to people.  There is a national radon control strategy, which is an all-of-Government strategy.  It has just reached the end of its first phase and the next phase is being developed.  It looks at what actions can be taken.  Some of the actions require visiting individual houses and doing measurements.  First, however, there is identifying the areas that are most vulnerable, then there is promoting in those areas-----</p></speech>

In Galway we have seen the maps with the red spots and the high spots.  What is happening with regard to the steps?  What are the EPA's recommendations?  Is it the responsibility of the EPA or the local authority?</p></speech>

It is still necessary to update those, and that is one thing we are doing.  The national radon control strategy identifies roles for a number of bodies.  On what we are doing, first it involved things such as conveyancing and ensuring that radon is part of conveyancing so that if somebody is moving house the person can confirm that a radon survey has been carried out.  Also, one of the specific actions we did was a pilot project last year that looked at offering grants for people to support them.  First, one must do the measurement in one's area, but we identified that even where people had identified high levels of radon in their home, getting them to translate that into action and do the work was not as high as we would like.  We did a pilot project offering not only the testing but also grants for remediation.  We are now assessing the results of that to see if there are any lessons to push people further.  We are also looking at actions around guidance for builders and requirements for new builds.  There are actions by different parties and the EPA is one of them.  Our role is to pull it all together and to promote and push those various actions.</p></speech>

I think back to the secure bonds and the parent company.  If the parent company is an unlimited company, how would the EPA know if the parent company is good for the money?

It is only acceptable where the parent company is of sufficient financial strength to guarantee and there is no risk to the EPA legally enforcing the guarantee where the parent company and its assets are based.  It is not acceptable in the case of inevitable disclosures.  In terms of assessing and agreeing the monitoring of a parental company guarantee, first of all, there is a financial assessment of the parent company guarantee and its relationship with the operator and there is a review of the corporate structure and audited accounts.  It needs to be demonstrated that there is no legal obstacle preventing the parent company from entering into the guarantee or preventing the EPA from enforcing the guarantee so that is a review of the corporate constitutional documents and approvals.  We then look at the execution of the guarantee along with ongoing demonstration of the financial strength of the parent company, including submission of financial and management accounts.  We have extensive legal input into whether this is a suitable company to have a parental company guarantee.</p></speech>

I cannot understand why the EPA would have to go through the process described.  Local authorities used to keep a bond or surety.  Why does the EPA not do the same?  Many of these companies are huge companies that generally generate big enough profits.  Why does the EPA not just hold the money as a guarantee the agency would hold, on the company's behalf, to make sure?</p></speech>

Some companies are huge companies, as the Deputy noted, and are able to guarantee to us that this money will be available.  That is the key.  Whether it is a bond or a parental company guarantee, we get legal advice and rather than saying we will or will not accept a particular tool, the key is whether the tool will be able to deliver.  We are not managing money in a bank so that also has its own risks, liabilities, etc.  Different tools can work, which is why we try to provide flexibility as long as they deliver on their purpose.</p></speech>

It does not really matter if the population is ten or 15 people and it is one or two.  That is just a proportion.  What I am trying to get to are the science-led initiatives to reduce radon and in turn, reduce incidences of lung cancer.

What we do know and what is amply demonstrable is that with barriers and remediation measures in houses, one can achieve very significant reductions in radon exposure and, therefore, the risk to one's health goes down.  We know it is a scientific fact that if someone has a house with a high level of radon and intervenes by putting in a sump or if a person builds a new house and reduces the potential exposure by having a radon barrier installed, these measures work.</p></speech>

I want to make sure I am answering the first question.  The first issue is the ambient air quality monitoring programme, which is primarily about things like particulates and other things that have a significant impacts on human health, which is why we have air quality standards.  The second issue, which I can also address, is the national radiological measurement network, which is a separate network.</p><p>There are two different networks.</p></speech>

It monitors compliance with air quality directives at EU level.  At the start of 2017, there were 29 different monitors, 19 of which were real time.  I am referring to compliance with EU requirements.  We are fully compliant in Ireland with regard to the amount of monitoring.  However, while we are in compliance with EU standards, a number of the monitoring stations' air quality failed to meet the WHO guidelines.  Therefore, it is not a standard set by the WHO.  Rather, it is a guideline or recommendation, including in respect of fine particulate.  We have raised this in our air quality reports.  We have also called for making compliance with the WHO guidelines the standard rather than the EU standard, as such.</p> <p>  What we are looking to do is increase the number of stations throughout the country from 29 to 81.  This would more than double the number of air quality stations.  We have got agreement with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for that.  It will cost around &euro;5 million.  There is a monitoring aspect but, to answer the Deputy's question, there is also a modelling and forecasting capability aspect to the programme we are rolling out.  We are engaging with the likes of Met &Eacute;ireann with regard to that.</p> <p>  It is also a matter of encouraging greater public understanding and involvement in air quality through citizen science, etc.  Therefore, there are a combination of initiatives.  To answer the Deputy's question, we are increasing the number of stations from 29 to 81.</p> <p>  Let me refer to what occurs if there is a particular issue at a site.  With a fire, for example, there would not necessarily be an air quality monitoring station just beside it.  We have portable stations that can be, and are, brought to locations to monitor the air quality in those situations.</p></speech>

I refer to the risk of hormone beef entering our system, resulting in the subsequent excretion of hormones into the water table, as with antibiotics.  What sort of role has the EPA had in preparing for Brexit and the protection of our food supply chain?</p></speech>

We have a regulatory role, which involves examining the contained use of GMOs, including in medicine and for deliberate release.  It is a very specific regulatory role with regard to the potential environmental impact.  To answer the Deputy's question with regard to the monitoring of materials coming to the State, we do not have a role.  On occasion, when there was potentially an issue, we engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and gave our scientific expertise and input.  With regard to Brexit, the answer is "No".  On the broader Brexit question-----</p></speech>

If a very hard Brexit emerges eventually and there is a risk of certain products entering the market, will the EPA have done work on what is to happen if a container with a certain product somehow ends up entering the Republic of Ireland?  Is there an action plan to deal with tracing the product and removing it from the system?</p></speech>

Rainwater in Ireland, especially in the cities, is running into the sewerage system.  We are dealing with a greater amount of wastewater that is not technically waste.  Are there any plans for dealing with this in the longer term?  Run-off water would not need as much treatment as sewage.  I am referring to separation.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy absolutely, however.  Across Europe, there is an issue with all the water entering one drain and then having to be treated.  For us, there are broader issues associated with wastewater not being treated at all and raw sewage being discharged that should be addressed in the first instance.</p></speech>

In the response the EPA sends to us, I would like to see a reference to how long the radon guidelines are in place.  Other members might have something to say on this.  How much has been spent on this by the EPA and across Departments, including through external consultants, in terms of administration to deliver the message to people on the ground?  What has been the uptake since the genesis?  Perhaps a graph could be given showing the uptake.  Are there any data on the incidence of lung cancer, particularly in red areas?  I am very interested to see whether we have any bang for our buck in terms of overall positive health benefits, leaving aside the well-proven laboratory testing of methods.  I am talking about practical testing on the ground.</p> <p>  Let me follow up on the drug content, illicit or otherwise, in urban water.  This issue is important considering it is a problem in other European countries.  It just needs to be monitored.</p></speech>

There is a company in my area that one can be sure will do everything by the book.  If there is a criticism, one hears it often goes over the top, which I much prefer.</p> <p>  Let us consider circumstances where there is a changing environment.  For example, while we must consider that Aughinish has important jobs in an area in which jobs are not plentiful, the changing environment there concerns the US embargo.  Would the EPA review the bond situation and require a different kind of bond if there were a risk to the parent company in a way that potentially existed and might still exist?</p></speech>

We consulted our financial advisers and it was determined at that stage that the financial provision we had in place was satisfactory and there was no risk.  Where circumstances change, it absolutely needs to be asked whether the criteria on which we base a decision are still valid.  "Yes" is the answer to the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

In surveying people, we can determine if the communications we are using are working.

We also drill down into that information to determine what age groups are responding and where they find their sources of information, be that the television, social media and so on.  This helps us in the context of our communications on climate and other environmental issues to determine where we should be investing and spending money in terms of getting environmental issues awareness levels raised etc.</p></speech>

First, I do not think radon and climate change are comparable.  There has been much talk about climate change.  We need action.  On radon, there was a good awareness campaign.  When I was a member of Galway County Council, we got quarterly reports on housing which included updates on radon levels.  That practice has slipped.  I look forward to reading the information the agency proposes to send to us.  These programmes have to be monitored and led.  There must be leadership from the local authorities and they must then be reviewed by a higher body.  Climate change is utterly different.</p></speech>

The message from the people and children of Ireland is for something to be done about climate change.  We do not need any more dialogue or communication.  At least, I do not think we do.</p> <p>  The briefing documentation provided refers to a national priority site list which is updated regularly.  I downloaded and examined the list for July to December.  Is this a new initiative and when will the next list be available?  Am I correct that the list is updated every quarter but it is not available every quarter?</p></speech>

In some instances, if there is an incident, for example, we may go straight to prosecution and then such a site may end up on the priority site list after that.

It we look at the viewership of environmental messages, on a bang for our buck basis, that is very high.  We have also made smaller sponsorship allocations.  About &euro;37,000 was given to the "Grow, Cook, Eat" programme that can be seen on RT&Eacute;.  The programme looks at the nexus of food, health and the environment.

I will leave that.  The last point I had was on remediation and I found the information I sought.  There are 71 historical landfill remediation sites, just in category A, and that is outside of Silvermines, Avoca and all of the other former mining sites.  It really is a picture of Ireland and what we have done.  We are back to compliance and regulation.  It costs us much more in the end.  Aughinish will be the same.  It is better to do things right the first time.  If we, therefore, are going to give licences to industries, we have to ensure they comply.  We are now picking up the pieces.  I have lost count of the money allocated for the remediation.</p> <p>  What role does the EPA have regarding these old sites being remediated?  There are plans but it is difficult to keep up.  The Department has been very good in giving the information but then there is a delay and the allocated money is not spent.  What is the situation with those sites now?  There is one in Galway but it is not on that category A site list.  It is a former dump in Galway.  There was a time when the former city manager was about to go to prison for contempt of court.  In fairness to him, he inherited that situation but that is how bad the situation was regarding the site in Galway.  What is the EPA's role in respect of these historical sites?  Is it part of the delay?</p></speech>

On the historical sites, the local authorities, through their waste management plans, are responsible for infrastructure and waste facilities.  Our role is regulation.  Some 285 of these sites need to come to the EPA for authorisation as historical landfills.  Those are the ones that were in operation between 1977 and 1997.   We also have a role in providing technical support and guidance.  We have, for example, issued codes of practice to local authorities to support them in their work of assessing these landfills.</p><p>The other aspect we have, which is pulled together there with regard to the number of sites, is the EPA's role in providing a section 22 register.  This is where the local authorities log all of the information on the historical landfill sites and this information is included in the waste management plans for each of those regions.</p></speech>

There are 71 sites that are high priority.  Some are local authority sites that we regulate, some are what we call pre-1977 sites, which are not due to be regulated, some are illegal sites and others are private sites.

I have some questions also.  I echo Deputy Connolly's comments that it is a fine annual report.  Representatives of many organisations appear before the committee and this is one of the better reports we have seen.  I refer not just to the financial report but also the rest of the report which covers many areas.  I can see that it takes a lot of work to get from the science down to readable English.  The report could do with a glossary for those of us who are not technical.  I do not know what the term "Control of aircrew exposure" means.  If I do not know, other people may not know either.</p></speech>

Maybe an explanation could be provided the first time a term is used.  This happens in other reports submitted to the committee.  For example I note the line, "introduction to the role of Radiation Protection Officer (RPO)" in the report but if I was to see the term "RPO" for the first time 20 pages after that reference, I would not know what an RPO was.</p></speech>

From the committee's perspective, we often put a glossary into our reports.  Members might understand the reports but not everybody does.  Ms Burke might now explain what "aircrew" means.  It is referred to on page 11 of the annual report.  Will Ms Burke tell the committee in layman's English what "Control of aircrew exposure" is about.  When one looks at the chart on the next page it illustrates a figure for aircrew that is twice as high as it was a few years ago.</p></speech>

The cases are all accessible and everybody can see them.  The European Commission published an environmental implementation review a week or two ago that looks at overall compliance with environmental legislation across the EU for each member state.  One of the things it identified in Ireland is the fact that information on prosecutions is up on the EPA website but maybe not all prosecutions are as easily available, for example, on wildlife crime and so on.  This is of interest, not only to the committee but also to others.</p></speech>

I am aware that there are seven or eight river basin management plans in place.  In my area the rivers Barrow, Nore and Suir go into one area.  I am sure the River Shannon and the River Liffey have similar plans.  From the EPA's perspective, which area's management plan poses the most difficulty with regard to its role in drawing up the plan or water quality or other issues?</p></speech>

With regard to areas that are poorer, we issued an overall water quality report in November last year which showed an overall decline of 3% and a reduction in pristine areas.  I do not have that quality report to hand.  The EPA looks at it on a national level to identify if water quality is improving or declining.  We have seen a decline, mainly because of phosphorous and nitrogen.</p><p>We then look at highly polluted sites rather than looking at each specific area, although all that information is available in the water quality report.  Part of the role of the EPA under the water framework directive is around the science and we get down to the other extreme, which is each catchment and looking at what pressures are in each individual catchment.  From memory, there are approximately 46 different catchments around the country.  It is at both a local level and quite a high level but I can get that information, if the Chairman does not mind, because I do not have it off the top of my head.</p></speech>

On a positive note, we did get resources to look much more at the science and water quality in each catchment.  We have done an enormous amount of work on that and engaged with local authorities.  Local authorities now have the local authority water catchment offices, LAWCOs, of which there are three in the country and that links back to the three plans the Chairman mentioned.  LAWCOs examine what actions can happen at local authority level to improve water quality because agriculture and wastewater treatment tend to be two of the big issues, along with nitrogen and phosphorous, and there are things that can be done at local level.</p></speech>

What happens in Laois affects what happens in Kilkenny and Waterford so it is not a function that is specific to a local authority.  Rivers flow thorough various local authorities and that is the whole purpose of regional plans.  The regional basis was more holistic.  They can do what they like in Waterford, but if they are messed up by the River Barrow in Laois-----</p></speech>

Local authorities have surveys out in areas where the roads are noisy.  We all know the lovely soft sound one hears when driving in Newland's Cross unlike the noise a mile further along the road when the road surface changes to tarmac.  I presume the noise reducing surface is more expensive.</p> <p>  The EPA also mentions airports and there is a Bill to regulate noise levels at Dublin Airport going through the D&aacute;il.

We hear that the guidelines are being finalised.  At first no environmental impact assessment of the policy was done because the Department did not know it should do that.  That set back progress by a year.  The EPA raised some other issues last year which the Department should have foreseen and that set things back another year.  The technical information the EPA provided will probably be out of date by the time the Department issues its plan.</p> <p>  I have a few questions about the board.  The EPA had 48 board meetings.  This board is unusual compared with the ones that are often before this committee because it is an executive board, a bit like An Bord Plean&aacute;la or some of the regulators.  There are not external people who come in to tell the experts what they should be doing once a month.  That is fine and I understand the reasons for that.  The board had 35 technical meetings which I presume cover in-house, routine business.  Ms Burke might give me an update on changes on the board.  I presume she got a second seven-year term as director general?</p></speech>

I have a suggestion that might be more for the Department than the EPA.  There might be a cost but an advisory board would benefit from having some people from outside the State on it.  The advisory board seems to be comprised of people nominated by the Irish Farmers Association, National Youth Council of Ireland, Irish Radiation Research Society and others.  Many of the environmental issues are bigger than an individual country and do not stop at our shores.

The advisory committee is really useful to the agency but its members are appointed by the Minister and it is out of our gift.  The audit and risk committee is within our gift, as one can see on page 68 there.  We specifically asked somebody from outside the State to be on the audit and risk committee and that is Mr. Allan Reid who is from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.  One sees similar issues and challenges and we have found that beneficial.</p></speech>

On page 69, there is mention of legal fees of more than &euro;1 million.  The cost of legal advice, including financial provision of licence activity, amounted to &euro;561,000.  Legal fees and legal proceedings amounted to &euro;440,000.  Legal fees seem to account for a big chunk of what I will call the EPA's discretionary spending when salaries, pension contributions and everything else like that are taken out.  Has the EPA considered employing internal legal people?  Is it all done externally?  Are many of the legal issues routine that could be handled in-house if appropriate people were hired?</p></speech>

One of the things we have looked at, certainly in recent years, in the context of communications is rather than saying, for example, that wastewater treatment or air quality is compliant or non-compliant with a directive, we should explain the purpose of the directive around protecting human health and the environment.  Otherwise, we are blaming the EU without explaining the reason.</p></speech>

We should be taking these measures because it is good for us.  Even if we were never told this, we should be doing that.  To stray somewhat from the discussion, it is like some Tidy Towns committees saying they have to do up their towns for the tourists.  I say they should do them up to make them nice to live in and the tourists will like them too when they visit.  We should do this for the right reason and not because we are being threatened by the big bad wolf in Europe.  I think we both understand what we are saying on that.</p> <p>  Regarding radon, which Ms Burke mentioned earlier, I know she cannot work out the statistics on that but is there any other country that has been dealing with the radon issue longer than us that may have some internationally calculated figures rather than actual figures that the EPA could use?  In terms of what Deputy O'Connell asked about, could the EPA use some other country as an example of how this work on radon can be beneficial?  It is clear we do not have it here but some other country might have useful information that we could use to help explain the issue to people.  Nationally, it is a good idea but it would be helpful if people had specific figures on it to which they could relate.  Ms Burke might look to see if there are any international figures available.  There may not be but they would help.</p></speech>

That is the reason I am not sure about that so that would be helpful.</p> <p>  That concludes our business.  I thank the witnesses for coming in today.  It is a compliment to the EPA witnesses that we are finished a little early.  There will be a routine meeting to discuss its annual financial statement.  We chose to invite the witnesses.  I am not sure when they were here last but the EPA is a significant State organisation and the witnesses answered the questions put to them clearly and concisely without any particular difficulty.  From our point of view, this was a good meeting even though it was short.  I stress that is because the EPA witnesses were good witnesses.  We have people in here from whom we cannot get answers and the meetings drag on with members becoming a little cross when they do not get the information they want.  It did not happen today.  We look forward to receiving the balance of the information, which I ask would be sent to the secretariat within the next fortnight.  I thank Ms Burke and her colleagues, the Department staff and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his officials for being here today.  We have agreed that the clerk to the committee will seek any follow-up information and carry out the agreed actions mentioned during the course of the meeting.</p> <p>  We will adjourn until 9 May when we will meet An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in regard to the appropriation accounts for 2017 for Vote 20, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2017, chapter 7 on the management of overtime expenditure in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

We are meeting the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to scrutinise the draft stability programme update, SPU, which the Minister published on Tuesday, 16 April.  The stability programme is an important pre-budget update on the Government's budgetary and fiscal planning for budget 2020.  The SPU is due to be submitted to the European Commission at the end of April.  This is a useful opportunity for the committee to engage with the Minister and provide him with feedback on the SPU before it is finalised.  I welcome the Minister, who is accompanied by Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist at the Department of Finance, Mr. Brendan O'Leary, assistant principal at the Department of Finance, and Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I thank the Minister for updating the committee.</p><p>Before we hear the Minister's opening statement, I draw witnesses' attention to the position of privilege which applies to all witnesses.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I again thank the Minister for appearing before the committee and invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Given that I have appeared before various members of the committee on a few occasions this week, and given that I forwarded my statement to the committee earlier in the week, I propose highlighting three or four points and then letting the committee quiz me on the document.  I could spend 20 minutes reading the statement aloud but colleagues may have read it.  If not, I can highlight some of the main issues.</p> <p>  On economic growth and broad economic development, the main point is that we have revised downward our growth forecast for 2019 and 2020.  For this year, we had expected the economy to grow by approximately 4.2% but we now expect it to grow by 3.9%.  For next year, we expect the economy to grow by approximately 3.3%, which is another revision down from where we had expected it to be next year.  The reasons for that are well known to the committee, namely, what is happening with global trade around the world, signs of a slowdown in different parts of the world, the debate taking place in the United States about its economy, what is happening in the eurozone, and various tensions such as that of global trade, which are all having an effect on our economy.  Nevertheless, growth rates of 3.9%, and wage growth of 3% per head, remain good for the number of people who work in our economy and for our ability to invest in the economy for the long term.  We have seen the sharp and high growth rates of the post-crisis period begin to moderate into ones which are real, can make a difference to people's lives, but are more mature and, therefore, one hopes, capable of being sustained for longer, which is good.</p> <p>  That brings us to the information I shared with the committee about our progress with that which makes a difference to most people's lives, namely, whether they have a job, whether they can find another job and whether they can keep the job they have.  The comments I made about a growth rate lower than forecast but which can still make a difference to the lives of people are perhaps most evident in that even though we have seen a decrease in how we expected the economy to grow this year and next year, we are still seeing employment growth which, by many measures elsewhere in Europe and compared with where we were in our not-so-distant past, remains strong.  Last year, some 63,000 jobs were created in our economy.  Even with the slightly lower forecast for this year, we expect approximately 50,000 jobs to be created, which is a strong pace of employment growth.  We expect to see wages within the economy grow by approximately 3% this year.  Within that 3%, many sectors will grow more quickly while others will grow a little more slowly, but an average of 3% is below the rate at which our economy is growing.  Of itself, it is unlikely to generate inflationary pressure, but if we were to keep it at that pace for a longer period, it would be a positive development for many people.  </p> <p>  On the budgetary end of where we stand overall, I will comment briefly on the structural deficit and the top-line deficit.  The European Commission, which has measured our structural deficit, indicates that we should move to a structural balance of minus 1.1% this year.  The Commission is currently carrying out an assessment in that regard and may make comments later in the year.  If, however, we consider a form of measuring our structural balance specific to our economy, developed by the Department of Finance and endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, the forecast for this year is a structural balance of 0.1%, which is ahead of our target for this year.  I remember being in this room years ago and having debates about what the structural balance is and is not.  There are many ways of measuring and evaluating it.  The Commission will view the figure of minus 1.1% as different from what it could and should be, but from the point of view of IFAC and the Department of Finance, the balance of 0.1% reflects our measurement of where we are and is ahead of where we were expected to be.  From a top-line point of view, we believe that, all other things being equal, we will move to a surplus of 0.2% this year, which is ahead of where we expected to be this year.  Were the trends in our economy to continue into next year, we believe we would move into a surplus of 0.4%, but that is on a no-policy-change basis and before any policy decisions have been made.  My entire statement was written on a no-policy-change basis.  Overall, our debt burden, which, as a percentage of GDP, is 61.1%, is expected to decline to 55.8% for 2020.</p><p>The committee will be aware that we use different forms of measuring national income, most notably GNI*.  Using that as a ratio of debt to national income, we are still in excess of 100%.  </p><p> The text of my opening statement contains figures for expenditure and tax forecasts.  The tax forecast for the quarter is a little ahead of where we had anticipated.  The VAT performance in particular is strong and our excise performance is the strongest it has been in some years.  That said, these are the figures for one quarter only.  May will be a key month from the perspective of VAT, corporation tax and expenditure.  Total Government spending is below profile overall and in 14 of 17 Votes.  However, this represents only a single quarter and the pre-summer period, from April until June, will be the crucial part of the year.</p><p> That is an overview of the key points in my statement.  I will answer any questions members wish to raise.</p></speech>

In-year expenditure growth has been raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which has been critical of the Government in this area.  Taking the figures prepared by the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2018, in October 2017, forecasted expenditure for 2018 stood at &euro;60.9 billion.  The figure increased in the Estimates in December 2017, increased further in the expenditure report of October 2018 and increased again in the Supplementary Estimates and Revised Estimates in December 2018.  Between October 2017 and December 2018, the figure increased by approximately &euro;2.3 billion, or 3.8%, from the original forecast.  Does the Minister have concerns or any observations to make on the points raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council about in-year expenditure growth every year?</p></speech>

I debated the points raised by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, particularly on unplanned expenditure in health in the second half of last year, with Deputy McGrath's colleague, Deputy Cowen, earlier today.  While expenditure growth is now far lower than it was during the pre-crisis period, I take the point that in-year expenditure growth, particularly in health, as it has recurred, is an issue on which we need to do better.  I return to the comments I made on expenditure a moment ago, namely, that while the first quarter looks okay, it is an issue we must follow up on throughout the year.</p></speech>

While I know the first quarter is not a big one for corporation tax, the first quarter outturn in the fiscal report shows that receipts were much higher than anticipated.  Some weeks ago, when I questioned the Minister on this issue, he said he was seeking another way of measuring the sustainability of corporation tax receipts.  I asked him to consider conducting a review on its sustainability, as he had been working on the basis of the Coffey report which stated that receipts were sustainable until 2020.  There have been several step changes since in the level of receipts and these appear to be continuing.  Has the Minister found a way of reviewing the sustainability of our corporation tax receipts?</p></speech>

I would not draw any conclusion on corporation tax for the first quarter and the key indicator for the year will be May.  Nevertheless, the chief economist in the Department of Finance, John McCarthy, and I have been looking at this issue to see if we can form a view on the sustainability of corporation tax.  We hope, as we approach the summer economic statement, that we can put some options to the D&aacute;il on how we will do that.  Deputy McGrath has told me previously that he would like to see this being done independently.  While he has never undermined the professionalism of my Department, the Deputy has given some reasons as to why this should be done and I am reflecting on these.  I want to ensure that when we do this work we have access to the black box, as it were, that lies underneath all of this in order that we can see the nuts and bolts of what is going on.  I want the Department of Finance to have ownership of the process because corporation tax is such a key variable in what will happen in future.  I am reflecting on how we might do that as corporation tax changes so often.  If we see things changing before our eyes, I want to have an ability to understand the changes to be anchored in the Department of Finance.  I hope to present a proposal on how we will do that in the summer economic statement.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has referred to a figure of &euro;3 billion for the national broadband plan.  We have heard of other projects.  At a local level in Cork, the Dunkettle interchange contract is yet to be signed but there are rumours - that is all they are - that the project will cost much more than was expected.  I make this point in the context of the Government's commitment to a multi-annual capital plan, the national development plan, and a range of projects set out within it.  Is the Minister concerned about how far the money he has earmarked will go given the level of construction inflation and pressures in the economy, including labour shortages in construction where labour rates are rising?  Is he concerned that the Government may not be in a position to deliver many of the projects specified because costs are rising very quickly?</p></speech>

We are seeing inflationary pressures develop in some parts of the economy, particularly in large construction projects.  The reason I am not concerned at the moment is that capital expenditure is slightly below profile in the year to date.  It might be the case that some projects-----</p></speech>

However, there is a "but", namely, that these capital expenditure figures and ceilings were set well over a year ago when we did Project Ireland 2040.  As the Deputy knows, we are normally far below profile at the start of the year and we end up being above profile at the end of the year.  That has been the case for capital spending since the crisis period.  Last year, we came in almost on profile in capital spending.  While it is possible that some projects will cost more, I am also aware that some planned projects may go ahead with slightly different timings.  While this is an issue, I do not yet have a view on whether we need to change the capital ceilings.  If we do need to change them, that will have an effect on other projects that we may or may not want to proceed.  I will probably be in a better position to give a better view on that in July.</p></speech>

With regard to how the Department of Finance calculates the structural balance compared with the provisions set out in the Stability and Growth Pact, the Minister referred to negotiations with the Commission.  Will the Minister indicate how the negotiations are proceeding?  Without pre-empting the outcome, what would be the impact of a failure to reach an agreement?</p></speech>

As to whether there will be a consequence, that is a matter for the Commission.</p><p>It could say, for example, that we have breached an expenditure benchmark.  That is up to the Commission, however.  It will publish an assessment of all of this, probably in May.  I want to be open with the Deputy in saying this is not a negotiation.

I indicated that when I did the summer economic statement, which we will deal with some months from now, I would provide a five-year framework setting out how we think the economy will perform.  That is what I will do.  The so-called fiscal space is replete with potential for errors and misunderstandings.  However, I will agree with the Opposition parties a way of publishing this that allows everybody to have a benchmark for decisions they might want to make.  I appreciate that colleagues will want to be able to form views regarding policies in the future.  Incidentally, I am going to try to keep this D&aacute;il going for as long as possible.</p></speech>

On current expenditure and the projections, I note that we are looking at an increase of around 1.5% over the next years.  If we look at the actual growth between 2001 and 2019, it averaged 5% every year.  How realistic are those projections given what has been the case in the past?</p></speech>

The figure of 1.5% the Deputy cited takes account of demographics, pre-existing commitments and so on.  There is a view that it should be assumed that budgetary decisions that normally happen will continue into the future.  I take a different view.  If that is the path we go down, we will get to a point where a Minister for Finance in the future will be making decisions on tiny parts of his or her budget.  It is the preserve of Ministers who will come after me - and will hopefully be my preserve in the future - to be able to decide how they allocate a degree of funding at budget time.  Expenditure growth in the future will be higher than the figures to which the Deputy is referring but that will be the result of budget day decisions that, hopefully, the D&aacute;il will pass.</p></speech>

We saw a document last week which showed that health spending is already above what was budgeted for.  I cannot predict whether there will be a need to fill another hole in health at the end of this year but in all likelihood there will be some hole to be filled.</p></speech>

It was what the Department indicated it would be.  It is the case, as the Deputy well knows, that for every other year, we have had Supplementary Estimates in the Department of Health.  Last year, the Supplementary Estimate was far higher than previously.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I have spoken about this.  We need to deal with where we are in health and I am absolutely committed to doing far better than we have done before in this area.  At the end of each year, other Departments have needed some technical Supplementary Estimates.  When all these supplementary allocations are added together, they result in a material figure.  What I tried to do in this year's budget in respect of the sources of Supplementary Estimates in the past for some Departments, notably the Department of Education and Skills, was to deal with that as part of their budget day package.  I want to try to reduce and eliminate additional allocations for other Departments and the Minister and I are already working on health expenditure.  I informed the D&aacute;il earlier today that after Easter I will sit down with Government colleagues to review where we are with a number of particular Departments.  The Minister for Health and I have already met twice now on health expenditure.</p></speech>

To paraphrase the Minister, he said he was not concerned right now about that.  It is clear that construction costs are only going one way.  I presume, because of the tightening in the labour market, that wages will go in only one way.  It is obvious that the Government will not be able to achieve what is envisaged.  If things are costing more and we are paying more in construction costs and wages, there will be less to spend on capital projects.  The Minister said that some of them may be pushed out for various reasons.  I am not suggesting that some of them are being cancelled or anything.  Can the Minister give us some more detail on projects which may be pushed out?  Are there valid reasons for this?  Is planning the issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041800002#E01100"><p>I was simply saying that for now, I cannot give the committee an assessment of where our capital ceilings might be for next year, beyond saying that we have a capital expenditure increase of approximately 10% or 11% already baked in for next year.  We already have that provisioned in our figures for next year.  All I was suggesting was that it is entirely possible that it might take some projects longer to go through the planning process or even the tendering process than we had initially thought.  It will be towards the latter part of the year before I can give the Deputy a data-based view of that.</p> <p>  As against the picture the Deputy has talked about, there are two other things we should consider.  The first is that economic growth figures of over 3% for this year and nearer 3% for next year are very different from where we have been in recent years.  That may have an effect on the issues to which the Deputy is referring.  As I said, I will need to move later into the year to see it.  The second factor is that wage growth is at 3% at the moment.  If that were to continue, again, it might have an effect on the issue.  I am not discounting the risk because clearly we can see one project that cost more than expected.  However, I would be stretching things to place the blame for that on labour market inflation.  We are all aware that prices in some parts of the economy are higher than they were last year.  However, from my point of view, with overall expenditure at the moment of around &euro;7.3 billion in capital for this year, it is too early to say if those trends are having a material effect on the delivery of projects.</p> <p>  For all of the discussion of inflation, productivity levels in the construction sector here are 24% below the European average.  If we were able to claw back a little bit of that, it would do more than enough to offset the inflationary risk the Deputy is talking about.  It might seem a very mundane matter but the work that my Department has under way in respect of building information management, coming up with new IT ways of storing the designs of buildings, has the potential to have a very positive effect on public procurement.</p></speech>

It is very much welcome that the Government achieved a surplus of &euro;50 million in 2018.</p><p>That was the first surplus since 2007.  There was an improvement in the deficit of &euro;830 million in 2017.  How does the Minister intend to use the surplus?  I do not expect him to announce the entire budget now but I ask him to give us an insight into his thinking, in broad terms.  Critically, does he believe that a surplus can be maintained after Brexit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041800002#F00200"><p>The first thing I want to do is to collect this surplus.  My first objective is to make sure it is delivered.  What I want to do with it is grow it into next year.  We will deal with this in more detail in the summer economic statement but a fair chunk of the surplus of 0.2% is coming through what we think might happen with corporation tax during the year.  Our economy should be in a position, if it continues to grow next year, to continue to have a budget surplus.  In terms of Brexit, though, the position could change very rapidly.  We believe the effect of a no-deal scenario on the general Government balance would be a move of 0.5%.  The surplus would very quickly go and the economy would begin to run a significant deficit.  Over a ten-year period, in the event of a disorderly Brexit, the deficit would amount to nearly 1%.</p> <p>  The answer to the Deputy's first question is that we will try to collect the surplus, preserve it, make sure we come in at that point and hopefully grow it in the future but a no-deal Brexit changes all of that completely.  It would put us in a deficit position and more than likely, it will be a deficit position that will not be the result of temporary, one-off things.  It will be a deficit position because our terms of trade with the United Kingdom will have completely shifted.  This Government and future Governments will have to respond to that.</p></speech>

I was about to ask about forecasting in the context of a disorderly Brexit but obviously that work has been done.  We all hope that it will be a soft Brexit.</p> <p>  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action which published its all-party report recently, ahead of the launch by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment of his all-of-Government plans.  Climate action is the issue of this generation and if we did not have Brexit to contend with, it would be top of the agenda.  I ask the Minister to outline the financial implications in the longer term of our approach to climate action in light of the committee's report and the forthcoming announcement from the Minister, Deputy Bruton.</p></speech>

However, on page 49 of our document we have called out climate change and our renewable energy targets as representing a high risk for the economy in the medium term.  The Department and I decided that we would call this out as being a risk in a way that we have not done in the past.  It is certainly something that will frame my thinking in terms of what we do on carbon taxation.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to outline the discussions that he has on this in Europe and how such proposals are viewed by other member states.  Do we have many allies in the EU in this area?  This is crucially important in the context of our small, open economy.</p></speech>

At the most recent informal finance Ministers' meeting we had in Romania, this was a subject for discussion.  As the Deputy has said, the European Commission has indicated again that it will publish proposals to remove the principle of unanimity from taxation decision making in the future.  It is apparent to me that for all kinds of different reasons, many countries have a big concern about that.  In the past, it would have been only Ireland and one or two other countries with the strongest views on this matter but now there are more countries, for different reasons, sharing our view.</p> <p>  If I may, I wish to go back to Brexit briefly.  Reflection will be required if we find ourselves moving into October with no clarity on where Brexit stands, especially in the context of putting together a budget a few weeks beforehand.  I wish to flag to the committee that such a situation would require a lot of thought from me and from the Government and a lot of engagement with the Oireachtas.  It is one thing to put together a budget, as we did last year, where the central case scenario was that an orderly agreement would be reached.  It is pretty likely that this will continue to be the central case scenario in that we know that we will go all the way up to at least October with the current trading conditions and political relationships continuing.  However, finding ourselves in October with the UK due to leave that month will require work and a great deal of effort in terms of dealing with it.</p></speech>

There is a requirement to have our budgets in at a particular point in the semester.  I am not saying that I have made a decision on it but the value of Irish budgets in recent years has been that we have been able to indicate certainty regarding where we stand.  The Deputies have raised issues regarding unplanned expenditure and certainly there are issues on which we need to do better.  We need to have an agreed view on what is to happen in the economy over the coming years but if we find ourselves in a position where the fate of Brexit is not yet known and we are preparing a budget, that changes the context entirely.  I look forward to working with all colleagues on that during the year.</p></speech>

However, we still have massive hangovers from what happened and the actions taken during that period.  We still have a massive level of debt, which the Minister has said is very worrying.  We also have a very big housing crisis, a big problem with our health services, infrastructural deficits in a number of areas and so on.  There are some very big hangovers and now we are starting to see warning signs of things going against us.  Brexit is a significant risk which is likely to negatively affect economic growth.  Global trade is beginning to contract and we do not know where that will go.  Climate change, as has been mentioned, poses a high risk because we have done extremely badly in terms of addressing it.  We are way behind the curve in that regard.  We also have an over-reliance on a small number of multinationals which the Minister rightly identifies as high risk.  Does the Minister think that we are acting with the sort of urgency and radicalism required to address these problems, given that they are coming at us now when we are still suffering the very severe hangover from the recession?  I do not see any ambition on climate change.  We are way behind and we are still trying to expand sectors of the economy that are contributing to global warming, particularly agricultural exports.  That does not make sense.  We are talking about a carbon tax but we have not even done research on its potential impact.</p><p>The research I have seen on British Columbia shows it has no impact, setting aside the arguments about the fairness and so on, and that is the only thing the Minister is talking about.  Where is the radical ambition to diversify the economy and shift things?  Brexit, the slowing down of global trade and the overemphasis on multinationals highlight the need for us to diversify the economy to insulate ourselves.  I do not see the ambition.  </p><p> To follow up on our earlier discussion, we have talked about how one private company effectively has us over a barrel on broadband and what its cost could be.  We have seen the overruns on the national children's hospital.  Another serious danger in expenditure is our reliance on the private sector to deliver our housing output, particularly social housing.  The cost of that is going to be extortionate.  That sector also has us over a barrel.  There is no reason to believe that the cost will do anything but escalate. </p></speech>

It is to the credit of Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Lahart and his party that they have been willing to support measures like that.  In the period that led up to the crash decisions that narrowed the tax base were never reversed when times were good.  We have done that in the past two budgets.  We made a big change in VAT, which was contested by many.  That has the potential to bring in between &euro;500 million and &euro;650 million extra per year.  It is a big tax change.  We made a decision on stamp duty on commercial property.  That is exactly the kind of change that never happened before yet we were able to assemble a majority in the D&aacute;il to do that.  Many other smaller scale measures have happened but those are big tax changes that a minority Government was able to make happen with support in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  Carbon tax could be another one.  Deputy Boyd Barrett quoted evidence from British Columbia.  The evidence from the ESRI shows that a high level of carbon tax can reduce emissions.  I hope the parties of the left will not again oppose using tax policy as a way of affecting behaviour and raising revenue to invest in environmental measures, although I have a feeling they will.  If that is where we end up it will be another thing that makes the Irish left and far left very special in the European setting.  We can build a consensus for doing that.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about radicalism and our expenditure.  Capital expenditure for this year is increasing by 24%, which is a &euro;1.4 billion increase.  It is making a big difference to projects all over the country, for example Grangegorman in my part of the city, O'Devaney Gardens, and Dominick Street.  That is just a small part of our city. </p></speech>

Whether that is where the Minister got it from I do not know but we proposed it the year before he introduced it.  The idea that we are not willing to make, or side with the Government in making, radical proposals in this area is unfair.  I am just pointing out to the Minister that there is no good evidence for carbon tax but there is very strong evidence that it becomes a substitute for doing things that would be radical and make a significant impact on carbon emissions, where we have failed dramatically.  He did not respond to the point that other areas of industrial policy are going away from diverting our economy away from reliance on sectors that dramatically contribute to our poor performance on CO2 emissions.</p></speech>

Other parts of the economy need to play their part and this is why the all-economy plan that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is putting together will be important because all parts of our economy have to play a role.  I agree with the Deputy on that.  No Government on its own will be able to respond to the significant challenge of climate change but it is the responsibility of Government to take leadership on this.  Under Ireland 2040, our investment in public transport and in renewable energy, are part but not all of it.  In the debate on carbon taxation that I sense is approaching perhaps the Deputy could give me examples of economies that have done well in reducing emissions without using carbon tax as part of how they did that.</p></speech>

The Deputy is aware of where we ended up last year.  We consider recruitment and expenditure in different segments within the Department's Vote.</p></speech>

January, February and March were on profile. January and February health expenditure was below what we have seen previously.  March expenditure was a bit higher than before.  One of the many lessons I have learnt from what happened in the past 12 months is the need for us to continue to engage on this issue and have an aligned understanding of how the expenditure is developing during the year.  We did better on it the year before last.</p><p>Things did not go as we wanted last year.  For the third year in which the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I are working on it, we are looking to find new ways to deal with it.  That is why we are doing these meetings.  Officials are present.  My officials have been meeting officials from the Department of Health in the run-up to each of those meetings.</p></speech>

In January and February, the health expenditure was lower than those months in the previous year and it was a bit higher in March.  To break that down, we then look at where we are by hospital group and by different parts of the HSE.  There is a further time lag before that becomes available to us, normally a couple of weeks.  As we move into April and May, we will have detail that is of use to us regarding where we are, well below the health expenditure Vote top-line.</p></speech>

I aim to have that in place for the revaluation that will take place towards the end of next year.  I am well aware of the issue that the Deputy raises.  I am also aware of what has happened and of revaluation points for taxes such as this all over the world.  The Deputy should look at the report I gave to the committee, which I know I will engage with it on later.  The committee said a while ago that there were two different models it wished to look at regarding how well property tax could work.  One was to have a model in which yield for the country is fixed and each local authority can vary the rate, or a model in which we fix the rate for the country and have that give the yield that it does.  After months of poring over many different tables and ways of doing it, it became apparent to me that because of the different levels of price growth in different parts of the country, the consequences of either of those two routes would be very different from what even the Deputy may have expected.  I will ensure that we can retain that tax.  I have some ideas about how we will do it.  When the Deputy looks at my report, as I am sure he has, the consequences of the different options that the House and I have considered may be different from what was initially thought.</p></speech>

Would that yield be commensurate with the numbers that are being brought in or does the Minister expect to increase the yield anyway?</p></speech>

An essential thing that we should be able to do is to demonstrate that all properties are taxed the same regardless of when they were built.  For example, if we said that we wanted to bring new homes into the local property tax-----</p></speech>

If we brought them in at present value, that would automatically mean that all homes built before that point have to be taxed in the same way, which would mean an immediate increase in yield from existing homes.  We looked at an alternative way of doing it, to see if there would be a way to ascribe a nominal value to homes that have been built since 2013 and to use the 2013 valuation.  After much examination of this, it became apparent to me that there is no easy way to do that.  I believe we should bring the homes that have been built since 2013 into the tax base because otherwise the inequity the Deputy referred to will only grow.  The best and fairest way to do it is to bring new and existing homes in at the same valuation point.  I will recommend that and believe the House should do that when we get to the point of passing legislation on the tax.</p></speech>

We can continue then.  I have one or two issues to raise myself.  As Chairman, it would be remiss of me not to make the point which Deputy Lahart has alluded to.  We feel that as a committee that when we make a request of officials from the Minister's Department, they should attend, particularly officials who have indicated that they believe they have a report for this committee.  We would like that to be noted.  We have communicated about this and the committee has raised it on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  One of the areas that I am interested in which we have not touched on at all is the EU multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and its impact on the Irish budget.  I do not know what the Minister's thoughts are on Commission proposals.  I know it is only a negotiation process but some proposals floating around would have a direct impact on our budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.649" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041800002#H01100"><p>I will address the second point first.  Even though it does not feel like it, we are at a very early stage in all of the discussions on the MFF.  It is likely that this work will accelerate towards the end of this year.  It will have to.  There are scenarios in which our contribution to the MFF will go up.  In a speech to the European Parliament a number of months ago, the Taoiseach said that he believed that Ireland should pay more and make more of a contribution to the MFF, which I wholeheartedly agree with.  If we have benefitted from the European budget in the past, and given the kind of support we have received from European institutions in the past year, I believe that we should make a contribution.  We are thinking through the budgetary consequences of all of that.  If I was to start talking about figures now, it would not reflect the fact that we are in a negotiation.  Before I get to the point of explaining to the House the additional contributions that we might need to make, it is probably better that we gain a firmer view regarding what the Commission will look for and why.  When we have done that, I would be happy to come back and update the committee on that and its budgetary consequences.</p></speech>

We will conclude shortly.  I call Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.</p></speech>

Table A5 on page 65 refers to the general government debt to GDP ratio.  It has reduced significantly from 64.8% to 51.6%.</p><p>Can the Minister explain that given that the closing debt balances in five years will be similar to those in 2018?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019041800002#J00200"><p>The Deputy is correct.  Table 13 refers to some of the figures he has touched on and shows that while our national debt will dip in 2020 to under &euro;200 billion, it will then increase again.  There are two reasons for that, however.  The first is whether the Government of the day will make a decision to run larger surpluses than are currently set out in this document.  I mentioned earlier that all the figures were set out on a "no policy change" basis.  If the Government of the day were to decide to run larger surpluses, that figure would begin to come down.  The second thing that would be open to us relates to one-off gains.  I am of the strong view that if one-off gains become available to the State, we should use all or nearly all of the amounts to reduce that debt.  I believe there will be one-off gains available to the State that could play a material role in reducing that figure.  There will be a global shock at some point and we are part of a global economic cycle.  When the economy moves into the next recession globally, the lower that debt figure is, the better will be our ability to withstand the challenges we may face.  It should go without saying that the other variable in the context of which that figure must be considered is the ratio of debt to national income.  The Deputy is asking me about a stock &ndash; the amount of debt we have &ndash; but we also expect the income we have to grow across the coming years.  That will bring out debt down as a percentage of national income.  I think about the stock a great deal, however.</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks at page 34 of our document, the average interest rate across the period is set out at the bottom of table 13 and it is approximately 2%, which is a staggering turnaround from where we have been over recent years.  If one goes back to the point I made earlier, one sees that as a percentage of gross national income, our debt begins to come down quite a bit, in particular after we go through 2020.  If the Deputy was to use debt as a percentage of GDP, it would be a far lower figure, continuing to reduce.  Indeed, that is at the top in the second row.  Debt as a percentage of gross national income is a better measurement of how we are doing.</p></speech>

If so, how will that challenge be addressed?  We had a discussion earlier about Rebuilding Ireland.  We can debate the balance relating to current expenditure, which we did earlier, but, whether we agree about Rebuilding Ireland, we have to phase out at some point the heavy reliance on current expenditure to the private sector to deliver social housing because it is not as good value for money as doing it ourselves.  If the Minister accepts that, we must surely move faster than we are moving given the risk.  Apart from the housing problem, it is a risk to be so dependent on something that is so costly.  Has he quantified that risk fully and calculated the amount pouring out in billions of euro in RAS, HAP and leasing to meet the targets of Rebuilding Ireland?  Does he get my question?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked if I want to change the balance between current and capital expenditure on housing and the short answer is, "Yes, I do".  On his first question as to whether I accept this is a macroeconomic or overall risk for the economy, the answer is also "Yes".  The Deputy and I differ on many things, as he well knows, but I accept the genuineness with which he approaches this issue, as he accepts my genuineness too.  However, the balancing act I am attempting at all times involves building more homes in a sustainable way for our economy and as quickly as we can.  The Deputy does not think we are spending enough in capital expenditure in our economy.  He has argued that point with me many times and we have different views on it.  However, to increase capital expenditure by one quarter in one year is as significant an increase as one will find in our recent economy history.  I did that because I accepted that there are many legacies from the awful period we went through that are causing trauma and anxiety for many of our citizens today.  Even if they were not legacies but were rather issues we were starting to face in 2019, we would want to do better.  I do not want families and young children growing up in circumstances in which the only home they have ever known is a hotel bedroom.  We can address that and we will.  That is why we have made these increases in investment.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to mention this meeting on "Morning Ireland" this morning so I hope we will have expanded interest in it.  We appeared before this committee two years ago when Yemen was first on the brink of famine.  It is heart-breaking that we are here again as Yemen continues to experience the world&rsquo;s worst humanitarian crisis.  I am delighted to be joined by my colleague, Dina El-Mamoun, who is our international head of policy and advocacy on Yemen and who lives there.  Since 2015, Oxfam have been working with local partner organisations in eight governates in Yemen and we have reached more than 3 million people with water and sanitation services, cash assistance and food vouchers.  This assistance is essential for mitigating the devastating effects of the protracted conflict, which is bringing new suffering and civilian damage on a daily basis.</p> <p>  We are now into the fourth year of the conflict and people are being pushed beyond their limits.  Ms El-Mamoun will speak to the rapidly changing situation in the country itself, but first I will try to remind the committee members of the scale of the crisis we are facing.  Between March 2015 and August 2018, the conflict in Yemen has led to a total of 17,062 civilian casualties.</p><p>It has forced more than 3 million people from their homes.  Some 24.1 million people, or 80% of the population, need humanitarian assistance, including 14.3 million individuals who are in acute need.</p><p> Yemen is experiencing a third wave of the world's worst cholera outbreak, with two previous waves from October 2016 to March 2018.  There have been more than 1.5 million suspected cholera cases, including 3,024 related deaths in Yemen since October 2016.  Some 22 of the country&rsquo;s 23 governorates are now affected by cholera.  Without prevention measures being put in place urgently and a rapid and unhindered scale-up of the response, the outbreak will become an epidemic as the rainy season approaches.</p><p> As members will be aware, food security in Yemen is critically dependent on imports and incomes, both of which have been knowingly undermined by parties to the conflict over many months.  Very little food is grown in Yemen.  Approximately 90% of the country&rsquo;s food has to be imported, with 70% of that coming through Hodeidah port.  Actions that have obstructed food availability and accessibility include the Saudi-led coalition, disrupting food and other supplies entering Hodeidah and Salif ports by means of blockades, inspection processes, delaying of vessels or diversion.  While imports of bulk foods, such as wheat, rice and sugar, are under way, containers have been blocked, which prevents the offloading of supplies of milk powder, cooking oil, medicines and other goods.  Hodeidah is the most important point of entry for food, fuel and medicines needed by 20 million Yemenis in the northern governorates in order to prevent famine and a recurrence of a cholera epidemic.  Any disruption of or attack on the port that results in cutting off imports means cutting off the lifeline for not just the people of Hodeidah but the entire country.  It is worth emphasising that international humanitarian law, underscored by UN Security Council Resolution 2417, requires all parties to conflicts to ensure that they do not target civilians and objects necessary for food production and distribution or objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, including crops, livestock and water sources. </p><p> Yemen&rsquo;s economy has been shattered.  Since 2015, the economy has halved in size and very few Yemenis have any source of income.  More than 80% now live below the poverty line.  Salaries for many workers in the public sector have not been paid for two years, leaving many destitute.  The exchange rate has faced severe shocks and has fluctuated sharply since the escalation of conflict.  The central bank has struggled to ensure liquidity in the market, making it difficult for importers to bring supplies into the country.  Fighting and financial constraints have led to the closure of 35% of businesses and the shrinkage of more than 51% of surviving firms.  As a result, food prices have been pushed so high that essential supplies have become too expensive for most.  In October 2018, retail prices of food commodities were between 73% and 178% higher than in the pre-crisis period, while the price of fuel, which is essential for distribution of supplies, had risen at an even higher rate.</p><p> Sustained undermining of food imports, availability and plummeting incomes have clear and unequivocal humanitarian consequences.  Some 14 million people, or half the population of Yemen, face a clear and present danger of imminent famine, while 20 million, or two thirds of the population, are reliant on food aid in order to survive.  Yemenis are resilient people, but the current situation is the worst we have seen and it keeps deteriorating.  In surveys late last year of people in Taiz, southern Yemen, who had received assistance from Oxfam, 99% said the adults in the family had reduced how much they ate to give more food to their children and 98% had cut down the number of meals they ate every day.  More than half said they had borrowed food from friends or relatives, while almost two thirds of people to whom we spoke said they had taken on debt.  In almost all cases, this was to buy food, medicine or water.</p><p> Coping mechanisms for many Yemenis have become more and more desperate.  Oxfam has spoken to families in Amran Governorate in the north of Yemen who, hungry and isolated after fleeing their homes, have been forced to marry off their daughters - in one case, the child was as young as three years old - in order to buy food and shelter to save the rest of the family.  Although early marriage has long been a dire practice in Yemen, marrying off girls at such an early age in pure desperation to buy food is shocking.  We know that in situations of food shortage, women eat last and least.  Yemeni women face one of the world&rsquo;s greatest gender-based disparities and this imbalance is clearly evident in the context of food security and nutrition.  Escalating food shortages have left an estimated 1.1 million pregnant and lactating women malnourished and threaten the lives of 75,000 women who are likely to develop complications during childbirth, including the stunted growth of their newborns.  Even with humanitarian assistance, women give priority to children or other family members, or use the money for other household needs.  An assessment carried out after one Oxfam distribution showed that 14% of respondents from female-headed households still had a poor food consumption score compared with 6% of male-headed households.  Under conditions of conflict characterised by displacement, loss of personal security, family instability and a lack of access to rights, Yemeni women and girls are exposed to many risks, including gender-based violence.  A protection survey carried out in November 2018 found that women experienced the highest levels of all violence - psychological, physical and sexual &ndash; and that, overall, girls were affected more by all forms of violence than boys.  We are also aware that there is likely to be vast under-reporting of sexual violence as a result of the fact that survivors face stigmatisation.</p><p> The international humanitarian response, of which we are a part, is saving lives, but it is taking place in a very challenging environment.  Conflict, security constraints and the harassment of humanitarian workers are just some of the challenges faced in accessing the hardest-to-reach areas without compromising the safety and security of those we work with, our local partner organisations and our staff.  The only real solution to the crisis in Yemen is political.  Talks in Sweden at the beginning of December were the first since 2016 that were attended by both warring parties.  This was a big first step.  Despite an agreed ceasefire in the city and port of Hodeidah, however, three civilians are still killed every day.  That is one person every eight hours.  The international community needs to maintain pressure on all parties to the conflict in order to ensure that ceasefire agreements are honoured and that there is a quick return to negotiations.  It is essential that the peace process is inclusive, with the active and meaningful participation of women, civil society and youth.  While women bear the burden of war, they are not passive victims.  Women are leading efforts to increase the resilience of their communities and contribute to peace-building at local level through resolving conflicts over resources such as water and land.  Although gender norms are strongly conservative in Yemen, women are accepted as mediators in local conflicts among tribes and rural communities, which is a long-held tradition.  Women are largely excluded from formal peace processes, however.  Where they have been involved, women&rsquo;s groups have described their inclusion as disappointing, representing a missed opportunity for sustainable peace.  In the course of our work, we have seen the necessity of including women in peace discussions and negotiations at the early stages.  When that is done, the likelihood is a far better and far more sustainable outcome in peace negotiations.</p><p> Critically, the world must stop fuelling the conflict by selling weapons for use in the war.  Homes, school and hospitals, as well as our own water projects, have been repeatedly bombed.  Arms sales from the US, the UK, the EU and others fuel this man-made crisis and legitimise, prolong and deepen a conflict that causes immense human suffering.  US, EU and Canadian arms sales alone to the three largest coalition players in the war - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - totalled more than $33 billion between 2015 and 2017.  Since March 2015, the sale of UK arms licensed to Saudi Arabia has exceeded &pound;4.6 billion.  Oxfam supports the full and robust implementation of the arms trade treaty.  The international community must refrain from sending any arms, ammunition or munitions for use in Yemen by parties to the conflict.</p><p> Ireland and Yemen are not so far apart.  Ireland has long-standing diplomatic engagements and opportunities for influence in respect of Yemen, as well as strong trade ties in surrounding countries.  Ireland&rsquo;s new international development policy, A Better World, sets out a firm commitment to reduce humanitarian need, intensify political efforts to address root causes of conflicts, and bolster engagement in fragile contexts.  We recognise the Government&rsquo;s action on Yemen to date, including the participation of the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, at the high-level pledging event for Yemen last month in Geneva, and Ireland&rsquo;s pledge of &euro;5 million.  The latter brings this country's support for the Yemeni people up to more than &euro;22 million since 2012.  We also recognise Ireland&rsquo;s advocacy for humanitarian access in Yemen, including through resolutions at the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s universal periodic review.  To realise the values of A Better World, however, and to live up to the commitments of empathy, partnership and independence as set out in Ireland&rsquo;s UN Security Council campaign, we must do more.  A seat at the UN Security Council would enable Ireland to have a strengthened role in international peace and security, which we would certainly welcome.  If Ireland wants to play this role, which it can do, it needs to ensure that it does all it can to deliver on a successful outcome in Yemen.  There are many actions it can take in that regard.</p><p> It is critical that the Government and, specifically, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade use Ireland&rsquo;s influence at EU and UN level to apply pressure on all parties to respect international humanitarian law, negotiate and maintain a nationwide ceasefire, and approach peace talks with the best interest of the Yemeni people in mind.  We ask the committee to write to the Minister to request an update on diplomatic efforts made by Ireland in respect of Yemen, to request that Ireland press for the full commitment of warring parties and their backers to a ceasefire in Hodeidah, and to support the full implementation of the Stockholm agreement as pillars for moving the peace process forward.  As we requested during our previous appearance before the committee, we also recommend that the T&aacute;naiste direct his Department to use its embassy in Saudi Arabia to convene a meeting with its Saudi counterparts in order to make clear that Ireland unilaterally condemns the country&rsquo;s devastating bombing campaign in Yemen at the highest level, and to reiterate the need for a comprehensive ceasefire.  Oxfam has worked in Yemen for 35 years but we have never seen a humanitarian crisis on this scale.  Yemenis face the triple threat of war, disease and hunger.  We and the UN consider it the greatest humanitarian crisis on the planet but it just does not seem to be getting the attention required.  We urge the committee to do everything it can to raise awareness and make space for it in the Irish context in order that Ireland can play its role internationally, which we believe it can do.</p><p> I thank the committee for listening to my statement.  Ms El-Mamoun and I will be happy to discuss the matter further, while she can provide much more practical information about her experience on the ground.</p></speech>

We arranged for Oxfam Ireland to make a presentation to the committee to try to get the message out to the public as well as we can and to create greater awareness of the threat of war, disease and hunger facing many people.  When two thirds of the people in any country need humanitarian assistance, it paints a grim picture.  I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

I apologise that I will have to leave the meeting early to speak in the Chamber.  I was struck that the sale of UK arms licences to Saudi Arabia has exceeded &euro;4.6 billion, yet UK aid has reached 0.7%.  It is a total contradiction and incoherence.  There are arm sales from the EU even though it is a major donor of aid.  The easy part is giving the aid; the difficult part is facing the challenges.  France and Germany have stopped selling arms, although they are probably selling arms elsewhere, but the recent announcement by the US President, Donald Trump, has not helped.  There is no doubt that it has received less attention.  For a period, every time one turned on the news it was about Yemen but it is becoming forgotten.  I expect it to be consigned to history with other forgotten tragedies.</p> <p>  I attended a presentation yesterday and the previous day on access to medicines.  How is Oxfam Ireland coping in that regard?  There are also non-communicable diseases.  Is Oxfam able to provide the medicines that are needed for them?  We see people dying in conflict, through being shot, bombed or whatever, but individuals also die from illnesses which can, and should, be prevented.</p> <p>  Our guests might also elaborate on attacks on humanitarian workers and how difficult the situation is for them.</p></speech>

On the access to humanitarian supplies, we have repeatedly faced difficulties with their importation.  Last year, for example, we tried to bring in supplies for treating cholera.  That was supposed to be rapid, with supplies from different countries, but we ended up in a situation where it took us months before we could get the supplies into the country and then distribute them.  That was because the access restrictions are twofold, relating to bringing the supplies into the country and the fact that movement within the country is curtailed.  We must, therefore, obtain endless permits, which has resulted in us being unable to distribute the supplies throughout the country, at least two months after they reached Yemen.  The concern is that we face the same problem again because we definitely need supplies in order to treat cholera.  While the UN is devising a list of the supplies needed, we could well face the same situation we faced last year due to the access restrictions.</p> <p>  On a tax on humanitarian workers, that takes several shapes.  On the one hand, access is again an issue.  For us to access areas we need to cover, due to the situation in certain parts of the country, our permits are often rejected.  Our team's permits have been rejected on at least three occasions in the past three months.  Ours is not an isolated case.  Most international non-governmental organisations will have faced similar problems.  There are also checkpoints along the roads.  If we want to go to an area such as Hajjah, which is an area not only in conflict but also high in cholera and food insecurity, we find there are at least 30 checkpoints between it and Shaharah.  Along that route, anything could happen.  Encountering a checkpoint could mean that we will be stuck or that we will sail through; we never know and that is part of the obstacles that we face daily.  We simply need to act quickly but we struggle to do so with the restrictions we face on the ground.</p></speech>

I appreciate their appearing before the committee and providing it with information.  Food and clean water are necessary to live.  Mr. Clarken stated many of the facilities in which Oxfam has been involved have been bombed.  Clean water is essential to life and I imagine Yemen is a very warm country at times.  How are people managing in that regard?  Are the countries which are being sold arms involved in the bombing of the water infrastructure?  People at home and members of the committee hear of the scale of the conflict and the international players involved.  Al-Qaeda is also involved.  Are these various actors involved in attacking al-Qaeda in the region?  Is that their justification for being involved in the conflict, or is it part of the Iranian-Saudi Arabian conflict in the region, with the support of the US, France and the UK?  Will our guests also comment on the use of cluster bombs?  One of the potential solutions Mr. Clarken outlined is that the Government should contact the Saudi ambassador.  Should the Government have a word with the British, French and US Governments, as well as the other players, about their involvement, given that it is clear they are complicit because they are supplying weapons?</p> <p>  Mr. Clarken stated that while he hopes for a ceasefire, a political solution is needed.  He noted that although goods are being imported, the problem is the stranglehold around those goods.  In theory, the ceasefire is holding, but if the food and medicines cannot be given to those who need them, it shows the fallacy of what was agreed at the talks.  What will be the political way forward?</p><p>Does it need to include free access to food, medicines and aid to the areas most affected?  Our guests might also expand on the cholera epidemic, which is linked to the lack of clean water and poor sanitation as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.677" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dina El-Mamoun" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019041800002#E00200"><p>In regard to clean water, there have been at least two incidents of air strikes in which the water systems and solar panels we had installed were hit indirectly.  In other words, the air strikes hit an area and indirectly hit the water systems we installed.  That has affected communities.  In one of those areas, we have not been able to repair the damage because of restrictions in terms of access.</p> <p>  More generally, clean water is an issue not only in Hajjah and Hodeidah in Sanaa.  What is different about this cholera outbreak is the high level of the outbreak in Sanaa.  This is linked to the sewerage system being old, derelict and in need of replacement but it is very difficult in the current situation to undertake large infrastructural projects around big cities across the country.  This is also contributing to the cholera epidemic, the levels of which are quite high in comparison with the previous rounds.  We are concerned that in this particular round of cholera the numbers will surpass those of previous outbreaks.</p> <p>  On the scale of the conflict, there is a ceasefire in Hodeidah.  It is not a countrywide ceasefire, which means air strikes and ground level fighting continues in other parts of the country.  Although the ceasefire in Hodeidah is holding, ground-level fighting is still happening.  All of these issues are affecting access and our ability to respond and so we are calling for the ceasefire to apply countrywide rather than in only Hodeidah.  We need that to happen for us to be able to move around and reach communities in different parts of the country.  </p> <p>  On the Stockholm Agreement, while the ceasefire in Hodeidah appears to be holding we are not seeing the next steps.  For example, we are not seeing the full implementation of the agreement.  There has been no progress on implementation since December last.  At the same time, there is a deterioration in the economy and an outbreak of cholera.  All of this is linked to the slow collapse of the country.  The Yemeni's believe they are dying a slow death.  They do not accept that other countries are rallying to their support.  Ireland has a particular role to play.  As it is not involved in the arms transfer, it is in a unique position.  It is supporting Yemenis but some political leverage needs to be add to that support.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Clarken at this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.678" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Clarken" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019041800002#E00300"><p>The statement that the Yemenis believe they are dying a slow death presents a strong image.  There comes a time when that becomes catastrophic, although the situation is already catastrophic in terms of the number of people affected.  It is worth remembering that before the conflict Yemen was the poorest country in the region by a distance.  It is already a very poor country.  Approximately 51% of the health services are no longer functioning, even at the level at which they operated before the crisis.  One can imagine the impact of that, leaving aside an epidemic of cholera, a food crisis and so on.</p> <p>  The Stockholm Agreement was a really positive initial step forward.  Like all peace agreements, it requires ongoing monitoring, commitment, focus and political engagement, even during the tough parts.  It is not a linear process.  We have to keep at it.  There is a sense that that is probably not happening at the moment.  The issues are how do we make sure that Hodeidah is accessible and then, because there is no point stockpiling everything there, how do we ensure there is a proper ceasefire across the country.  We need an inclusive peace process, that will take time a long time, but that starts and people feel connected to so that, at least, in the initial stages the humanitarian access is there to deliver the support that is needed.  We can then start to gradually rebuild.</p></speech>

Is he frustrated by the lack of media coverage of the conflict?  It is rarely reported on the front pages of the newspapers, on CNN or Sky News.  Even when it is mentioned, it is only a short report.</p></speech>

According to the UN and everybody else working in the area, including Oxfam, this is the world's worst humanitarian crisis by a distance.  It should be front-page news all the time.  It should be constantly in the public mind.  There are issues around access from a media perspective.  It is not an easy place to access.  However, that is not to suggest that we should not continue to work on it.  We need to examine how we can influence all of the key actors to ensure there is media access because Governments and people respond when they clear on what is happening.  We need to work harder to make that happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-04-18a.681" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1219" speakername="Se&aacute;n Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2019041800002#E00600"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for being here.  It is important that what is happening in Yemen is highlighted in the public domain.  When it comes to matters of foreign affairs, we are ignorant about Yemen.  The information contained in the documentation supplied to members is not generally known.  I hope this meeting will help to highlight the situation in Yemen.  We need to do highlight this outrage on a continuous basis.  The conflict does not arise out of poverty so it should be possible to resolve it.  The lack of publicity in regard to the ongoing atrocities does nothing to help resolve the problem.  It is important that the committee is updated regularly on this situation.  In that regard, I suggest that our guests to invited to appear before us again in the not too distant such that we continue to highlight this situation.</p> <p>  This is the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence.  My knowledge of the atrocities that are happening in Yemen is fairly limited, for which I apologise.  As already stated, we need to ensure that it is highlighted.  Our guests will note that there is not much media presence at this meeting, which is the norm when it comes to discussing these types of issues.  We find it difficult to get the necessary publicity about what is happening.</p><p>The committee should do everything in its power to highlight these atrocities in Yemen and other parts of the world.   We can continue to meet the delegates and highlight what is happening.  When I read the documentation, I was quite frightened because nothing is being said about what is happening.  The request that the committee should write to the T&aacute;naiste seeking an update on diplomatic efforts made by Ireland regarding Yemen is not too onerous.  Not only should we write to the T&aacute;naiste, we should invite him to come before us in order to discuss these matters, particularly Yemen, with him.  Our guests also requested that Ireland use its influence at EU and UN levels.  This is not a major request but, again, it highlights the issue.  With regard to both requests, the committee should formally make a presentation in writing before inviting the T&aacute;naiste to come before it and asking that what we desire be done.</p><p> I congratulate our guests on continuing to bring these matters to our attention.  It is fairly easy to forget about the parts of the world in question.  It is quite horrific that what is happening is not the result of poverty.  Yemen is located in a reasonably well-off part of the world but it seems to have been forgotten.  Our job is to make certain that we highlight what is happening there.  I suggest that we do as requested in the report, that is, contact the T&aacute;naiste and ask him to attend, if at all possible, to highlight what is happening in Yemen.</p></speech>

This is a collective effort.  We acknowledge that Ireland can do only so much but it can do things.  Ireland plays an important role in the world.  Despite its size, it has access to extraordinarily influential people.  Interestingly, Ms Nancy Pelosi, who was in the Houses yesterday, is one of the people who slapped down the US President in regard to the veto.  She was immediately connected to that.  Ireland is in such spaces and can use its voice as an honest country that genuinely wants to do the right thing, but we should not be afraid to raise the issues and be clear about our position on these matters.</p></speech>

I apologise because I was a late to it.  As others have stated, hearing about the scale of the humanitarian catastrophe made for grim listening.  The delegates have given us a really clear picture of it.  The focus on the gender aspect and the devastating impact on women and children, in particular, really brings it home.</p> <p>  Like others, I was struck by the comment that the only real solution is a political one.  I agree with what Deputy Barrett stated, namely, that the requests made by our guests are very reasonable.  As a committee, we absolutely should write to the T&aacute;naiste to request an update and seek to use Ireland's influence.  There was a specific request that the T&aacute;naiste should direct his Department to use the embassy in Saudi Arabia to convene a meeting with Saudi counterparts.  We should include that in our letter also.  We do have an update from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We have been told the T&aacute;naiste met the Saudi ambassador in October 2018 and February 2019, which was quite recently, to stress Ireland's concerns over humanitarian access.  We have not been told whether our embassy in Saudi Arabia has made representations there.  Perhaps we should emphasise that.</p> <p>  Clearly, there has been considerable focus on Saudi Arabia as a key player and on arms sales to that country.  As a small country, can Ireland do more to press our its EU partners to discontinue arms sales to Saudi Arabia in particular but also to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Iran, each of which is also a player in the conflict.  Can we do more on that front?  There has been a lot of focus on British arms sales but other EU countries are also involved.</p> <p>  What more can we do about the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Iran?  We have been told the Department has conveyed to the Iranian embassy here Ireland's strong concerns over the safety of civilians and compliance with international humanitarian law but we have not been told whether any representations have been made by Ireland to the United Arab Emirates or Egypt.  Have the delegates any comment on that?</p></speech>

With regard to Iran, it is important to note that advocacy in respect of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is likely to be successful only if other parties with leverage in the conflict, on all sides, are included.</p> <p>  We do not know what Iran is doing in regard to pushing the Houthi authorities in the north on access and other issues faced.  It is important that this be addressed in equal measure.  Ultimately, the transfer of arms is to all sides of the conflict, not just one.  This message needs to be sent across the board.  We know the United Arab Emirates is playing an important role in the south of Yemen in particular but it is also important to note that the impact of the conflict is not only felt in the conflict areas in the north.  There is also a devastating impact across the rest of the country, even in parts of the south where there is no live conflict.  It is important to note it is not a question of the United States, for example, saying what is being done is important to fight al-Qaeda because the whole country is now in a situation where people are starving and cholera is rampant.  It is important to show the humanitarian impact of the conflict as a whole and of arms transfers across the country.  Egypt is part of the coalition.  All members of the coalition will need to be addressed in that respect.</p></speech>

It is frightening that Yemen is again facing the triple threat of war, disease and hunger.  The reason our guests are before us is in order to try to create greater awareness among the public of the ongoing conflict, which is now in its fourth year.  As my colleagues stated, unfortunately we do not hear as much about the conflict in the international broadcast media as we should.  Our guests outlined very clearly that 24 million people, out of a population of 30 million, are in need of humanitarian assistance.  There is major loss of life.  The actions of the Saudi-led coalition in preventing food and medicine from getting to those who are starving, dying and suffering so much are absolutely reprehensible.  It is so disappointing that Yemen continues to experience the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with a conflict in its fourth year.  Mr. Clarken and Ms El-Mamoun both made the very valid point that Yemeni women and girls are exposed to many risks, including that of gender-based violence.</p><p>It is a major indictment of the international community that girls and women are subjected to further gender-based violence in addition to the suffering they already experience.  Earlier, Mr. Clarken asked that the committee would write to the T&aacute;naiste regarding the need for Ireland to continue to use its influence at every forum available, including through the European Union and the United Nations, in order to apply pressure on all parties to respect international humanitarian law.  With the approval of the committee, I suggest that we would also write to the T&aacute;naiste requesting an update on what diplomatic efforts we are pursuing with the Saudi authorities, particularly in the context of the blocking of essential foodstuffs and medicines getting through the port of Hodeidah.  The full implementation of the Stockholm Agreement is critical.</p><p> We will also ask the T&aacute;naiste to request that staff at the embassy in Saudi Arabia convene a meeting with their Saudi counterparts in order to raise all of the basic human rights issues of concern, including the lack of humanitarian assistance getting to the people in need.  This committee has listened to many presentations but I do not know of any country in conflict where such a high proportion of the population was in need of humanitarian assistance.  We heard that 24 million out of a total population of 30 million are in need of humanitarian assistance.  We would be very pleased to write to the T&aacute;naiste to ask him to pursue the issue through every forum that is available to him and also to continue to exert all the pressure we can through the diplomatic network in order to ensure that a peaceful resolution is found.  It is terrible to think of the triple threat the country is facing, which the witnesses put so well, of war, disease and hunger.  I thank both of our guests for their detailed presentation and I compliment those from Oxfam International and sister organisations that are working in Yemen in very difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

We have an embassy in Saudi Arabia but it is important that we would also formally contact all the countries that are involved in the region to give them the same message.</p></speech>

As Deputy Barrett indicated, that would meet with the request of our guests.  I again thank Mr. Clarken and Ms El-Mamoun and welcome their colleagues who are present.  On behalf of the committee, I wish them well in their work.  As Deputy Barrett stated, we would be pleased to meet our guests again.  I hope we will not need to do so and that progress will be made.  However, if the need arises, and we need to keep the issue on the agenda in order to create awareness, we will do so.</p></speech>

Members have become advocates in respect of this issue.  We need advocates here in Ireland as well as globally.  Peace will not be easy to achieve but it is possible.  It is crucial that we use whatever diplomatic influence we have with all actors as opposed to one or the other.  There are a number of actors and we know who they are.  Ireland has varying degrees of relationships with all of them and we can do a lot.  It is heartening to hear the passion and commitment of committee members.  We really appreciate it.</p></speech>
