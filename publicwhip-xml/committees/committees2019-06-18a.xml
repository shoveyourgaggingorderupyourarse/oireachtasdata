Today we are discussing animal welfare and the control and management of horses.  I welcome, Mr. Martin Blake, chief veterinary officer, and Mr. Dermot Murphy, principal officer, animal health and welfare division from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and, from the Local Government Management Agency, Mr. Paddy Mahon, chair of the County and City Management Association environment, climate change and emergency planning committee, Mr. Joe Boland, director of services, environment, Kildare County Council and Mr. Garrett Shine, veterinary officer, Louth County Council.  I thank them for coming before the committee to discuss animal welfare, specifically, issues concerning the control and management of the equine sector.</p> <p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I understand both bodies have made submissions, which members have read.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Blake" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#C00300"><p>We welcome the opportunity to come before the committee.  As the Chairman stated, I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Murphy, principal officer in the animal health and welfare division.</p> <p>  In our submission, we provided a brief overview on animal welfare as a concept and how it evolved over the years.  It was legislatively provided for in the century before last, yet it is only since the 1960s that the science has developed.</p> <p>  It is a complex issue.  We emphasise that assessing an animal's welfare is not a binary issue.  If one looks at welfare in the extreme, one can have both positive and, at the other end, negative.  Invariably, it is somewhere in the continuum in between because so much impacts on animals' welfare.</p> <p>  I make reference to the major strides that have taken place in Ireland in recent years with a view to bringing about improved welfare outcomes.  I mention in particular the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  This brought greater clarity to the range of interconnected issues involved, leading to greater societal awareness and understanding.  It also brought greater clarity to certain matters and has supported more effective implementation.  Of critical importance in the Animal Health and Welfare Act is the clear enunciation that the owner or person in charge of a kept animal has primary legal responsibility for its welfare.</p> <p>  That said, the Department continues to devote considerable attention and resources to animal welfare issues through its regional veterinary offices and the licensed slaughter premises that it supervises.  We have in place an animal helpline, which encourages members of the public to bring to our attention any issues of animal welfare.  In the submission, I provided figures for the number of calls that the helpline has taken in the past number of years.  There were 321 calls received in 2017, 446 in 2018, and 136 so far this year.</p> <p>  The Department is also supported in animal welfare issues by the charities involved.  The Department provided significant funding to these charities over the years, and gave &euro;2.75 million at the end of 2018.  That doubled the support to the charities since 2013.  A number of the officers within the larger charities have been made authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act and they are an additional resource to deal with animal welfare issues, particularly in the urban and peri-urban areas.  Other significant welfare legislation emanates from the EU relating to the transport of animals and the welfare of animals at killing.</p> <p>  A key focus over the past while has been the development of an animal welfare strategy.  A consultation process was launched by the Minister, Deputy Creed, in September last and we are working towards bringing that to fruition in the next number of weeks.  Hopefully, by the end of the summer, we will deliver an animal welfare strategy for Ireland.  We very much appreciate the involvement of the various stakeholders and we received good responses.</p> <p>  We have a number of advisory committees.  The farm animal welfare advisory committee involves all stakeholders and we engage with those on a number of animal welfare issues.  They have been singularly successful in delivering an early warning system for on-farm welfare issues that arise at farm level and in developing guidelines for animal owners and keepers.  We are also supported by the scientific advisory committee on animal health and welfare, which has given us scientific advice on a number of issues, such as husbandry practices on farm and the killing of animals.</p> <p>  I would like to mention the "One Welfare" concept.  It is referred to our submission and I will not dwell on it.  Essentially, it is new thinking in the context of the interdependence between human well-being and animal welfare.  There is clear science behind that now showing an interconnection between human well-being and animal welfare.</p> <p>  Moving on to equine welfare, broadly speaking,  it is similar to the welfare of all other animals.  It is subject to the same legislative framework.  It is somewhat different in that generally equines live much longer.  They are kept for a greater variety of reasons.</p><p>They may experience a change in utility during their life, especially those that have been kept for athletic or sporting purposes.  They may be treated with animal remedies that are not available for use in other food producing animals.  Given their longevity, they are expensive to keep.  On an individual basis, they are predisposed to being transported more often than any other individual animal.  Their economic value varies significantly depending on what they are being bred and kept for.</p><p> The Department pays particular attention to the welfare of horses.  We encounter similar presenting signs to those of other animals, such as different degrees of neglect and cruelty being inflicted on the animals in other cases.  A confounding factor with the welfare of horses, which is almost unique when dealing with farmed animals, is the issue of stray animals.  This is not new.  The Control of Horses Act was introduced in 1996 to address that issue.  This gave powers to local authorities to control where horses could be kept and powers to seize straying horses.  This straying phenomenon has been compounded more recently by a recognised practice of some horses being abandoned.  These events are relatively infrequent.  However, they are quite stark and, from an animal welfare perspective, it is totally unacceptable that any domesticated animal would be abandoned by its owner.</p><p> In both scenarios, straying and abandoned animals are subject to seizure under the Control of Horses Act.  While still at an unacceptable level, the overall numbers seized have been falling year on year from a high of approximately 5,000 in 2014 to less than 1,500 last year.  The reduction in numbers and greater rehoming possibilities in Europe are assisting the situation, which leads to reduced numbers of animals being euthanised.  One of the greatest challenges in dealing with straying and abandoned horses is the difficulty in establishing the ownership or person in charge.  This reflects how the identification and traceability system in the industry has evolved.  In recent years, we have introduced two new statutory instruments, one relating to identification of equidae and the other to deal with control on places where horses are kept.</p><p> The Department has engaged in preventative measures and education, engaging with local authorities, charities involved in equine welfare and other interested parties.  We have developed State-sponsored equine centres in a number of urban areas and projects at the edge of provincial towns that involve stabling facilities for those that find it difficult to access land.  For example, in Dublin, the Department was pleased to assist in the financing of the Clondalkin Equine Club with South Dublin County Council.  The Department is also involved in projects involving the Traveller community in Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford.  The committee will have noted the launch last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, of the outcome of a research project on Traveller horse ownership, which was funded by the Department.</p><p> The Department has also undertaken an initiative in raising awareness of the critical importance of good horse welfare among road racing sulky participants and the owners and keepers of trotting horses.  We have engaged a relevant education provider to deliver an education programme to these people.  A key element of the programme is to encourage participants to move off-road and to engage with regulated Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, activities.  The Department also supports an education programme with a focus on horse welfare in schools in Limerick city.  The results to date have been positive with employment opportunities being pursued with the assistance of the Racing Academy and Centre for Education in the Curragh and a number of training yards.</p><p> I hope I have given the committee a broad overview of animal welfare and the activities of the Department.  There is more information in the document submitted.  We are pleased to take any questions that members have.</p></speech>

Our paper is taken to have been read but I will address some key points of it, hopefully not repeating what Mr. Blake has said.  Local authorities are responsible for the control of horses under the 1996 Act and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the primary agency for animal welfare under the 2013 Act.  The number of horses seized over the past number of years is down but the number euthanised, while it has gone down, remains unacceptably high.  Our experience in local authorities is that we deal with nuisance horses that pose danger to the public.  They are generally in urban areas, on public lands and sometimes on semi-private lands.  We hear on "AA Roadwatch" about loose horses on our roadways.  We encounter them regularly in public spaces and on local authority housing estates.  Generally, local authorities seize and impound the horses by contract.  It is expensive and dangerous.  Our response is generally reactive and firefighting.  Most of the horses that are seized are not microchipped.  The maximum subvention at present is &euro;375 per horse if it is euthanised and &euro;200 if it is rehomed.  There is no subvention if the horse is reclaimed.  The cost to the local authority would be between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per horse.</p> <p>  Equine welfare is the main subject of concern to the committee and we feel that it is inextricably linked to the control of horses.  We have a number of proposals for improvement in our submission.  We should try to deal with the causes rather than the symptoms of the problem.  We believe there should be vigorous enforcement, hopefully involving a multi-agency response or a task force for each county or region, which has worked in other areas in our experience, comprising local authorities, the Department, the Garda, and other relevant agencies, targeting specific areas of concern.  We believe there should be greater recourse to local by-laws, especially in the designation of exclusion zones.  The review of the Control of Horses Act needs to be prioritised.  We believe that the potential for a service-level agreement between local authorities and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would be beneficial.  We believe that one is in place between the Department and ISPCA, and between the Department and us in other areas.  We successfully operate service level agreements in partnership with other agencies and Departments to achieve common goals and shared visions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#D00300"><p>I submitted a PowerPoint presentation but, in the interests of time, I will not necessarily go through every bullet point.  This is still a significant issue.  According to our records, there were 1,603 seizures of equines in 2017.  It is a resource intensive activity, requiring significant manpower, equipment and holding facilities in the form of pounds.  There are health and safety issues, significant cost implications and animal welfare concerns.  Most of the animals that are seized have welfare issues.  While legislation has been strengthened recently, there is little evidence of compliance with regard to horses that are seized.  All that said, there is good co-operation between the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, local authorities, the Garda and other entities.  With regard to cost, up until recently, much of the cost fell on the local authority.  That may change with the new national tendering but much of the cost will still fall to local authorities.  The benefit of national tendering still has to be fully assessed.</p> <p>  There are significant challenges since there are not many impounding contractors on the market, so the market is not strong.  There is a culture of carelessness on the part of some horse owners.  Most horses that are seized are in poor condition.  Few are microchipped.  There is also the issue of stray horses on undeveloped zoned land, and the issue of adverse possession could be mentioned in that context.  Few horses are rehomed, and I think the figure for euthanasia in 2017 was 75%.  There is evidence from the past of local authorities being used as an expensive disposal service for unwanted horses.  It is a particular problem in urban areas, especially cities.  The merits of keeping a horse in an urban area are questionable on welfare grounds.  There are problems with seizing horses in urban areas since significant costs and health and safety issues can be involved.  Some 1,600 horses were seized in 2017.</p><p>The problem has abated somewhat but it has not gone away.  I would emphasise the need to deal with the root causes rather than the symptoms, and to examine why we have so many stray and unwanted horses.  The issue of animal welfare is to be emphasised although the legal position is that welfare is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Our role in respect of welfare is incidental to our control role.</p><p> Moving on to point 8 on the slide, we agree that local initiatives involving animal charities are part of the solution.  The Dunsink project has been hailed as a particularly good example in that regard.  In terms of moving forward, I would emphasise the importance of a multi-agency approach involving all the stakeholders: the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, ourselves, the local authorities, the Garda, animal welfare groups, representatives of horse owners, and the farming community.  I would also emphasise the need for collaborative enforcement, especially around equine ID.  By-laws and exclusion zones are part of the solution.  There are examples where that approach has worked well.  We advocate the move to full traceability of all horses through effective enforcement, similar to cattle.  It is more complex if we are dealing with outside-the-gate issues, as it were.  All owners should be fully accountable.  A review of the Control of Horses Act is urgently required in the view of the local authority sector.  The emphasis should be on a multi-agency approach dealing with the causes rather than the symptoms.  Much of what we do tends to be reactive.  A greater emphasis on dealing with the causes would be a better approach.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  I have raised this matter on a few occasions and requested that it be dealt with by the committee.  My county has unfortunately had a good few examples of the ill treatment of horses.  I would put horses and dogs in the one category in that regard.  We have seen horses been driven in harness to the point of collapse, pulling loads inappropriate for their size.  In Knocklofty the winter before last we had starvation issues on lands that were in public ownership.  Thankfully, this winter came extremely mild.  We would have had a lot more issues this winter if it had been in any way wet or harsh.</p> <p>  There was mention of horses in urban areas.  There are probably two classes of ownership here.  We have horses in urban areas where a person has one or two horses under his or her care.  However, we also have people with herds of horses.  There might not be many such people but they are there.  They are using public lands or land belonging to semi-State companies to graze these animals.  They are in it for profit.  They are not keeping those horses to lose money.  Mr. Blake was talking about ring-fencing accessibility for horses to the food chain.  If horses are not microchipped, how can we be sure they are not entering the food chain?  I have heard reports that a significant number of horses belonging to these gentlemen are making their way across the Border and to abattoirs in different countries.  What percentage of the horses that have been seized and euthanised were microchipped?  I am a farmer.  We have very strict regulations.  Animals have to be tagged within 14 days of birth.  A significant number of horses are not microchipped and there does not seem to be any focus on improving the situation.  Until we have that kind of traceability, how can we be confident about the controls we have over them?</p> <p>  There was talk of better education about the welfare of animals.  That is extremely important.  The message has to be gotten across to people that ownership of animals comes with responsibility.  There also has to be respect, especially in housing estates.  One of the speakers asked if it is appropriate to have these animals in urban housing estates.  One would wonder.  Green areas there are for recreation, not for residents to use for grazing their horse or a number of horses.  I was in a town in my county recently and the youth soccer team was going playing a match in the field beside their estate.  Before they could play their match, the first job was that three or four men had to go around with shovels taking the horse manure off the field.  That should not be the case with a public amenity like a soccer field.  It is there for the youth of the town or whoever wants to use it.  It is not a grazing ground for some residents' horses.  On approaches to towns, we see horses tied in a narrow space grazing on lay-bys where access to water and so on would be very questionable.  There are definitely too many horses being kept by people who are not landowners.  They do not have the resources to feed these animals, especially in winter time.  Many of the horses are being kept on land illegally.  The vast majority are unidentifiable as they are not microchipped or registered and do not have horse passports.</p> <p>  I do not know if my county is unique in having all these incidents.  We had another case about three or four months ago where a young girl crashed into a horse late at night.  She is in the Mater since the accident waiting to go to D&uacute;n Laoghaire for rehab.  Unfortunately, the poor young lady is paralysed from the neck down; that looks to be her future.  She has no one to claim against.  No one owns the horse when something like this happens.  The horse had strayed onto the road.  Some people feel that owning an animal is part of their culture.  We are not debarring anyone from keeping animals but responsibility comes with it.  People have to have the resources to look after animals and they have to have respect for other people living in their locality.  </p> <p>  I will go back to the people who have these large herds of horses.  Bord na M&oacute;na is the most guilty party in my county.  Many horses are grazing on Bord na M&oacute;na land.  The men who are grazing those horses are commercial individuals.  They are definitely not keeping them to lose money.  The horses are being fattened on that land and they are moving somewhere.  That needs to be investigated.  We have the microchipping of horses regulations of 2016 but I have serious concerns that they are not being enforced.  Until we enforce them, it is going to be very hard to get on top of this issue.  When incidents come to me and we report them, as regards horses being seized and taken to the pound, I have no complaints whatsoever.  It is a very expensive way of dealing with the problem, however.  As was said in one of the presentations, according to the legislation the Department should be covering the cost but, at best, the cost is now divided 50-50 between the county councils and the Department.  State agencies have a responsibility to manage their land stocks.  Horses that are grazing illegally should be removed.  These lands could be managed better.  The HSE has the guts of 300 acres of land in Clonmel.  That land should be given to a tillage man, in my view, so that it would be in a crop and there would be a serious responsibility there.</p><p>A herd of horses would not be allowed to traipse across it so easily then.  There is a responsibility on State agencies to ensure their lands are not being illegally occupied.  Last year, pictures appeared on Facebook of a horse with a broken leg that was tied to a gate near Newport and left to die.  Again, nobody could be held responsible because there was no microchip in the horse.</p><p> Dogs are another issue.  We have a problem with lurchers.  Gangs of people from different areas hold sports with lurchers.  Competitions are held over how many hares a lurcher can kill in a day.  Groups of people will follow eight, nine, ten or 12 lurchers.  Bets are placed on this illegal hunting.  The Garda is finding it very hard to impound these dogs.  The legislation around the seizure of dogs definitely needs to be improved.  When the authorities come upon these gangs, it is very hard to have all the personnel required to seize dogs.  This can happen on a Sunday afternoon but the dog warden and the members of the Garda must be in place.  It can be extremely difficult to have all the i's dotted and the t's crossed.  Legislation must be strengthened in order that dogs can be seized immediately when people trespass on land for illegal hunting</p><p> I want to ask three questions.  The first concerns microchipping.  Is a plan in place to microchip the vast majority of horses?  Really there should be 100% compliance.  There is no place for any leniency when dealing with bovines.  Is the legislation regarding dogs and horses strong enough to allow the Department and county councils to do what they want to do?  Are there enough resources to control the issue?  When I have contacted the authorities on specific cases the response has been very good but I know of people in my county who are being intimidated by people with large numbers of horses.  That situation should not be allowed to continue. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#F00200"><p>I thank the Department and the local authorities for their comprehensive presentations and for providing their excellent submissions prior to the meeting to give us an opportunity to review them.  This used to be a predominantly urban issue but in the decade or so since the downturn it has become more prevalent in rural areas.  That is part of the problem.  I broadly agree with the points made by Deputy Cahill.  State and semi-State agencies have a serious duty and obligation to ensure that any lands or premises under their control or owned by them are managed and grazed properly and appropriately.  Every occupier's land must be clearly identified and a full account must be made of all animals grazed on the land.  This should be submitted to the local authority or to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or to both.</p> <p>  I was a member of Westmeath County Council when this Act was passed.  There were several problems.  I got a bit cheesed off because the Department simply sent instructions to the local authority.  It never sent a shilling.  There were no resources, just an instruction to get on with it.  At that time, there was no rate in place at local authority level and the responsibility was simply devolved.  A responsibility without resources is an absolute disaster for a local authority.  I am sure the local authorities will recall this.  In the 1990s and the 2000s there was not a shilling available.  That is a lacuna.  That was obviously a political decision.  Mr. Murphy knows very well that it is very easy to sidestep that, but it is a political responsibility.  However, as a senior official within the Department, it is important that he knows that and I think he does.</p> <p>  Another big problem in this area is the splintering of responsibilities.  One cannot implement anything by giving Willie Penrose one responsibility and another responsibility each to Charlie McConalogue, Marcella Corcoran Kennedy and Martin Kenny.  That is a recipe for not getting the job done.  There must be an umbrella body to deal with this.  This was going on in 1997.  I remember it well.  That is more than 22 years ago.  If we live for another 20 years we will still be talking about it.  Let us be clear.  Let us stop being a talking shop.  People out there are fed up with talking shops.  Let us put our heads together.  Nobody should recoil and run off to the Attorney General for advice just because one of us suggests something.  Let us take a practical view.  I agree with the broad thrust of what Mr. Mahon and the county managers say.  They are right.  The Act is 22 years old and life has evolved.  Things have changed and it is not fit for purpose.  The key point is that we must allocate money to ensure that the objectives are achieved, realised and implemented.  How could we expect otherwise, particularly in the last ten years when local authorities have not been able to do the things they are meant to do, that is, their mandatory responsibilities in this regard?</p> <p>  Very often local authorities are in a reactive phase.  They hear about a problem and race out to address it.  As far as I know from Westmeath, Longford and those areas they only have one veterinary person.  That person's primary responsibility is dealing with the food chain.  They are used to dealing with abattoirs and things like that.  I remember it quite well.  They have big responsibilities in those areas.  Those people then have to race out to deal with horses and everything else.  This is a huge area.  I do not blame anybody or at least I do not blame officials.  We at the political level have nicely sidestepped this.  </p> <p>  What represents a danger to the public or a nuisance?  The Act has been challenged three or four times.  Issues have arisen as a result of those challenges.  I know an awful lot of stuff is going on in the Department.  It is dealing with Brexit and the Common Agricultural Policy.  The last thing officials want to hear is that they have another responsibility.  However, the Control of Horses Act 1996 and all the legislation on animals must be immediately reviewed, amended to be fit for purpose and codified.  That is very important.  We must also recognise the interaction and intervention of various animal charities.  They also have played a big role and things would be even worse without them.  We must compliment them for their active intervention at various times in the last several years.  </p> <p>  Deputy Cahill is right.  Microchipping may be mandatory now but that is more honoured in the breach than the observance.  I do not want to trespass onto any recent developments but one can see that the Department is concerned with various issues related to the food chain.  There is always a danger of horses entering the food chain illegally.  Full traceability is essential.  We have it for other animals.  I accept that it is not easy to implement with large animals which live a lot longer and have different breeds.  I understand that.  I do not say this will be easy.  I refer also to the registration of holdings and things like that.  The same level of scrutiny does not appear to be applied to horses in that regard.  There are little things we can do.  There is recognition in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 of the important role of rehoming.  It is recognised in statute.  Members will remember that the Minister had to go back and rejig it.  The same thing must be done with horses.</p><p>There is only a two-liner on this in the greyhound legislation.  The same thing has to happen in regard to horses as it is important in the longer term.  Many activities occur outside the farm or in a non-farm environment - on the side of the road rather than inside a farm gate.  That is a big difference and a challenge.</p><p> The bodies and associations involved with rehoming should be recognised in any future legislation and should get appropriate recompense to ensure they deal with that.  Rehoming of horses is well down the food chain in comparison with greyhounds, on which we have heard presentations in the committee, whereas we have never heard from anyone in regard to the rehoming of horses.  The departmental officials might say we should not have to do that, and they would be right in a utopian or theoretical society.  We are where we are, however, and we have to deal with that.</p><p> Education is extremely important.  Education in secondary schools should be widened.  We are talking about the curriculum being changed at junior certificate level to deal with climate change as a subject over 30 or 40 hours, which is important.  However, the welfare of animals is another important area, and it includes all animals.  Not everybody is going to study agricultural science.  This is also important for those who are non-farmers.  Generally, we all started agricultural science because we had an interest in farming and had perhaps come from some sort of farming background.  However, this is important and should be progressed.  Young people take up causes now, as we can see, and I believe it is important to do this.  I know there are significant costs involved and that has to be dealt with.</p><p> The Department referred to the Irish Harness Racing Association's activities and it recognises the association in its presentation, but that is as far as it goes.  It does damn all else, notwithstanding the urging and prompting from this committee.  The association receives no annual funding, although it has made numerous presentations, including one a few days ago.  The Department seems to regard organisations like this as poor relations when they are doing their best to contribute.  The Department knows the areas in which this association is working, yet it receives no annual funding.  Various items of legislation have excluded the association, and I know all about the allocation of funds under the greyhound legislation and the various other Acts we have passed in these Houses.  We devote between &euro;83 million and &euro;84 million to dogs and horses, with something like &euro;16 million of that specifically for dogs.  Surely to God we could give &euro;1 million, &euro;1.5 million or even &euro;2 million to the members of that association.  Their role is important and, to be fair, Mr. Blake and Mr. Murphy have recognised this.  However, we have basically excluded them.  On the basis of equity, and to recognise the good they are doing, which is clearly recognised in the Department's contribution, surely they deserve some annual subvention or grant.  I believe this would repay itself one hundredfold.</p><p> I know about the Traveller programme in Longford and the work that is going on in that regard, and I know about the race programme, which are all excellent initiatives and very positive offshoots.  I want to recognise all the good things.  I want to make suggestions in a constructive way because it is easy to come in and condemn.  There may be a number of ways in which we can break through in this area.  The problem is a huge number of stakeholders and groups are involved and, as a first port of call, we depend upon the local authorities to solve this problem, very often alone.  That is not going to work.  It needs a cross-agency and stakeholder process, and it needs somebody to lead that and to take responsibility.</p><p> Deputy Cahill is correct that any time one contacts local authorities, the Garda or other agencies, they react very well, but it is a firefighting operation and is reactive, rather than being proactive.  We need an agency that is in control.  It is no use setting up talking shops.  Unless we give adequate financial resources to those agencies, we will be back here in five or seven years' time talking about the very same thing, although I will not be here.  I thank the witnesses for their contribution, which was very worthwhile and very informative. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#G00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  One of the things that always strikes me in regard to the equine industry is that we always have people from Horse Racing Ireland and various sectors coming into the committee and we are usually talking about big prize money, very valuable animals and so on.  Yet, at the other end of the scale, we have this situation which is causing huge problems.  In every country, and in some it is a little worse than in others, there are situations where horses are being abandoned and there is very poor animal welfare.  Those issues need to be dealt with in the context of an industry which we always talk about in terms of value and the great resource it is for the economy but in which we find this dirty backyard that nobody wants to look at or clean up.</p> <p>  There has to be responsibility for this across the board.  The variance in economic value that was mentioned from one end down to the other is really what is at stake here.  Deputy Cahill referred to traceability.  There seems to be practically no traceability in the vast majority of such situations.  There is tagging and full traceability in cattle farming, for example, and we nearly know the DNA of the animals.  If, however, a horse jumps in front of the car and causes an accident, as was mentioned earlier and which has happened on numerous occasions, nobody is accountable.  That is one of the very serious parts of all of this.  The Control of Horses Act has to be dealt with and it needs urgent reform.  This needs to happen as quickly as possible and we need to try to make progress in that regard.</p> <p>  As for the various agencies that are doing work in this area, the local authorities in particular are very stressed.  I know from talking to the veterinary officers in a couple of counties that the question as to where the resources to deal with this situation will come from is an ongoing problem.  There are never enough resources.  We have had recent incidents in various parts of the country in regard to the risk of inappropriate horsemeat getting into the food chain.  Horsemeat is appropriate in some cases, and is being managed and is going into the food chain, correctly so, although we do not have a tradition in Ireland of eating horsemeat and it is for export.  The problem is there are shenanigans going on and this really needs to be looked at closely.  It is clearly open to such abuses because there is no traceability, which is the core of the problem.  While there is no traceability, it will remain a huge problem.</p> <p>  There is a traditional horse fair in Mohill, County Leitrim, where there is bartering on the street corners and people buy and sell horses, and that has been the tradition.  When the marts came into being in the late 1960s and early 1970s, everything changed and it forced traceability and put things into a different place.  Something will have to be done in regard to how horses are traded and moved, particularly in regard to the traceability issue.  This is the key issue we have to get right.  No one should own a horse unless it is clearly traceable, has its passport and is microchipped.  It is an enforcement issue.  Rather than putting the energy into trying to clean up the mess, more energy should go into finding the problem before it becomes an even bigger problem and then trying to deal with it.</p> <p>  The issue raised in regard to dogs is a similar one.  Approximately half of the dogs in the country are licensed, or perhaps less than half.  That is clearly the problem.  We then have issues of sheep being killed in various places and nobody knows who owns the dogs.  I have come across a cross-Border problem that affects County Louth in particular.</p><p>We talk about Mr. Trump wanting to build a wall on the border; some sheep owners would like to see a good fence going up because they do not know where the dogs are coming from that are killing their sheep.  That is a problem because, as far as I am aware, the existing database is supposed to be an international one but it is only fed into by one jurisdiction.  That is another problem.  We need an all-Ireland database for both horses and dogs.  Work is required in that regard to improve the situation.</p><p> The core of the problem is that we have an industry that is worth a lot of money at one extreme and yet has a very big problem at the other extreme.  Given the resources available to the industry, it does not make sense that the problem has gone unchecked for so long.  There needs to be a diversion of some of the available resources.  As Deputy Penrose mentioned, &euro;80 million has been invested in the industry and yet we see this problem.  That does not add up.  It does not logically make sense that it is happening.  There are issues concerning culture and how matters are dealt with, but there is also a sense that somehow or other we can allow bad behaviour under the guise of culture and that is okay.  It is not, and that needs to be spelled out.  It is just not on.  It will take a firm hand to go in there and deal with that but it needs to happen as quickly as possible.  Where amendments are needed to the Control of Horses Act and to various other pieces of legislation we must bring them forward as quickly as possible.  That said, resources are the biggest issue.  If resources are put in place we can deal with much of it very quickly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#H00200"><p>I welcome the representatives from the Department and the LGMA.  Initially, it is shocking to see the statistics on the number of horses that have been euthanised.  Thankfully, it is in decline, but it gives an idea of the extent of the problem.  There are problems with all sorts of domesticated animals, but unlike dogs or cats, horses are big and one cannot hide them.  That said, I am aware that horses have been kept in houses in the middle of towns.  It is not an invisible problem and yet the problem is pervasive throughout the country.</p> <p>  I praise the unsung heroes in the animal welfare organisations, which receive funding from the Department and the local authorities, but it is a fraction of the cost to them of delivering the service.  I have seen figures for animal welfare organisations.  We have some very good ones in County Mayo.  Between veterinary bills, even with a discount, and everything else, they are constantly in debt and they resort to all sorts of fundraising.  The work they do is a labour of love but I am sure there is a lot of heartbreak in it.  If the State had to do the job they do, it would not be able to afford it.  We give the animal welfare organisations some money but the problem does not go away.</p> <p>  It has been explained that many cases come to the attention of the authorities, whether it is the Department or local authorities, in the event of there being a danger to the public but underlying that is the very real issue of animal welfare, which is how the animals are being abused and are not treated right to begin with and then we get to the point of them being euthanised.  Dialogue with the organisations is required on how we can go about having a meaningful impact.  As Deputy Martin Kenny said, we must focus on preventing it rather than dealing with the end result.  I accept that funding is an issue for local authorities because the situation is extensive, but it has also been my experience that many of the horses concerned are on land within the control of local authorities.  I am not taking from the difficulty of the issue.  We could go down the route of chipping the animals but there is a serious cultural issue around horses and how they are kept, regardless of the environment in which they are being kept.  I refer to an urban environment where one might question if there was even room for a dog and yet a horse is being kept there.  In addition to the heavy workload of local authorities, there must be more enforcement on local authority property where horses, dogs or other animals are kept.  That should include horses grazing in parks that are owned by local authorities.  People must understand that it is not acceptable and it will not be tolerated, which comes back to enforcement.</p> <p>  Education is one of the biggest elements in terms of getting to the root of it.  Aside from us commenting here on the end result, which is where animal welfare intervention is required when things go wrong, we all know that there is a therapeutic value in horses, culturally, for people of a Traveller background.  That is a tradition.  However, we must marry the reality of looking after an animal with the entitlement to own an animal.  There would be a great benefit in involving secondary schools or targeting young people in urban areas who keep horses.  A limited number of horses could be held in an area and people could be supervised while looking after them.  The young people could be taught animal husbandry and the implications rather than what happens at present because it is like cowboys and Indians at times.  It is not acceptable.</p> <p>  In Mayo where I come from there is a horse sanctuary, the North Mayo Horse Sanctuary, which is run by a former councillor, Gerry Ginty, who is very dedicated to horses.  He would give his right arm for them.  He expends a lot of resources.  He has a good team around him.  The group rescues horses all the time and it tries to get land to feed them and to look after them.  Euthanising them is a last resort.  I would welcome an education programme, in particular for Traveller children or young people, which would allow them to direct their energies towards looking after animals without having an animal on a green area or on a football pitch, as Deputy Cahill outlined.  People have to coexist and there are certain realities not being expressed in the conversation about what coexistence means and respecting other cultures.  It might be worthwhile to have a pilot project with someone like Mr. Ginty who runs a sanctuary to see if some reason can be brought to bear.  One would not be entirely excluding access but it would be limited and the rules would be set out for how it would work.  Can one imagine living beside the nuisance that is caused?  It is crazy that the animals are being treated in the way they are.  Animals should not be treated that way.  We could be doing more but we need more dialogue.  I do not take from the work that is done or the resources that are provided but it is a serious issue that needs to be addressed in a more holistic way than just throwing money at animal welfare organisations that are not fit to cope with the volume of work being done.  I acknowledge the work done by the Department and the councils.  In my area the dog warden gets involved.  The work comes under the general heading of animal welfare and everybody gets involved.  Something more needs to be done and it must get to the core of the issue, which is the people who own the horses whom we cannot trace but we all know about.</p></speech>

I am sorry that I was delayed in the Seanad.  I wish to focus on a couple of points.  Reference was made to carrying out independent research.  I can identify with that in the sense that there is much anecdotal information and there needs to be a comprehensive research report not just into the symptoms but the causes leading to the situation where so many healthy horses are put down.  Reference was made to "supplying the food chain, an activity which is now highly regulated".   Could Mr. McGrath please expand on that for me?</p> <p>  I too commend the work of the voluntary organisations, in particular the former Mayo county councillor, Gerry Ginty, who has done an enormous amount of work involving the care of horses.  He is well recognised for it.  He is no longer a councillor as he did not run in the recent local election but that was one of his key areas of work.</p><p>Research is needed because as well as thinking outside the box about horses, it could be combined with the research that has already been done on the value of equine-assisted activities and therapies for children and young adults with autism.  There is already some research that shows the value of such activities and we need to add to that.  If we were to use this research and target the resources properly, we could put many of those healthy horses to use in social enterprises.  It has been proven that working with horses can help to improve not only the physical make-up of young people with autism but their communication skills and behaviour as well.  Perhaps the witnesses could tell me who needs to instruct that research.</p><p> What are the mandatory holding periods in secure pounds at the moment?  It was said that a task force for rigorous enforcement was being set up between local authorities, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Garda.  Whose responsibility or duty would it be to set that up and to make a similar task force workable in the local authorities?  At the end of the day, much of the responsibility is left with the local authorities.  It is not only a matter of resources, although more resources are needed, because until we get that piece of research, we will not know exactly where the resources need to be deployed and we will be unable to quantify the resources needed by each local authority.  There are also inconsistencies between what different local authorities would demand.  Having one veterinarian in each local authority does not seem to be sufficient for the job that needs to be done here.</p><p> I welcome the opportunity for this presentation.  We need to find out who is responsible for implementing this research and how it will be done.  We also need to enable the local authorities rather than simply heaping the problem on them.  The key requirement is to look outside the box and further afield because otherwise we will be having the same conversation about horses in ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  We could potentially use the rural environmental protection scheme, REPS, or the mechanisms of the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, when it is negotiated, in a way that leads to better preservation of horses.  We should also look at how we can better utilise our native horse breed, perhaps in the tourism sector.</p></speech>

Much more work is needed to achieve more co-ordination and resources to ensure this issue is better addressed.  Today's meeting is useful in that we can look at the gaps and outstanding issues.  My colleagues have covered many of the issues but I have a slightly tangential question on the change in stocking criteria for areas of natural constraint, which was introduced in the past year.  I am particularly interested in the change in the categorisation of donkeys, although I accept that today's discussion is primarily focused on horses.  However, given that many of the witnesses come from an animal welfare background, I would like to use this opportunity to ask them to elaborate further on that change.  People do not see merit in it because donkeys are kept well.  A welfare rationale was given for that particular decision.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on the issue but we have not had an opportunity to tease it out.  I would appreciate, therefore, if the witnesses could flesh out the background to the change and indicate whether it was necessary because a number of farmers do not see the rationale behind it.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the voluntary groups that do tremendous work on the welfare of animals.  I cannot understand how people can abandon horses and leave them to starve and die.  It is shocking and should not be tolerated anywhere.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to programmes for children with special needs.  That is an area with great potential for development.  Animals could be moved to local authority land and looked after under some sort of employment scheme, and people could visit and spend time with them.  Interaction with animals is very good for children, particularly those with disabilities.  I would like to see such a project developed in local authorities because they have parcels of land close to towns and villages that will not be used for housing.  Perhaps it could be a pilot scheme.  This would be good for men, women, children and animals.</p></speech>

I will start at the beginning with Deputy Cahill's question, which was raised again subsequently, on the security of the food chain.  We all recall the contamination of beef with horsemeat back in 2013.  At that time, we undertook a significant review of the controls used for how horses are traced, identified and checked into the food chain.  We now have enhanced controls in place.  Since then, we have also established a central database in which any animal presented for slaughter must be registered.  Food business operators must cross-check animals on the database.  They must also cross-check passports for their authenticity if they have any suspicions about them and check the entries regarding prohibition for slaughter as well.  That is verified by our Department inspectors and we also check the identification.  We can cross-check any passport we have a concern about with the passport-issuing agencies.  More recently, we have started harvesting microchips post-slaughter in order to cross-check them.  There is, therefore, a robust check for animals going in for slaughter at this point.  We are always seeking to make incremental enhancements and we apply additional controls when we find a particular issue of concern.</p> <p>  On the numbers of horses being microchipped, we estimate that between 20,000 and 25,000 foals are born in Ireland every year and that we have a horse population of approximately 250,000.  Data from the past couple of years suggest that the numbers of young foals microchipped, identified and registered stood at 17,800 in 2016, 18,600 in 2017 and 19,900 in 2018.  While we cannot be sure there is 100% compliance with the practice of microchipping foals as they are born, and we acknowledge that is unlikely, we are satisfied that the level of compliance is significant and increasing.</p> <p>  We note the point about State agencies and lands and it is something we reflect on.  It is true that we are unable to identify who is responsible for abandoned horses if they are not microchipped.</p><p>I ask Mr. Murphy to update the committee on our positioning with regard to the Control of Horses Act 1996.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#K00200"><p>We have been examining this legislation.  Overall, it has served the country well.  As Deputy Penrose recalled, we had a major issue in 1996 with the dangers posed by horses in green areas.  The Control of Horses Act 1996 has worked well in controlling what were very dangerous situations.  Other developments at European level have impinged upon the Act.  As the chief veterinary officer stated, we are much more advanced now, with identification and microchipping, than in 2009.  Those controls are being strengthened all the time.  Certain elements of the Act could be reviewed, such as licensing and similar aspects.  Other elements of the Act are, however, still relevant to what can be done by local authorities regarding exclusion areas.  They can be very beneficial.</p> <p>  We will certainly continue to work with representatives of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, some of whom are present, to refine the concept of what a new Bill might look like.  That said, I would not want to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  The Act has worked well in providing greater security in green areas over the years.  There have been fewer accidents and the local authorities have been better able to interact with contractors to seize horses.  Critically, the situation is improving.  There have been many more possibilities to rehome horses on the Continent in recent years.  While seizures are falling the proportion of horses being rehomed, and indeed being returned to their owners, has been increasing.  That has been a welcome development recently.  We will continue to look at the elements of the Act that might be improved upon but it has served the country well over the last 23 years.</p></speech>

As Mr Murphy indicated, we are tracking the level of rehoming.  In 2018, 1,460 horses were seized under the Control of Horses Act 1996.  Some 271 of those were rehomed and 133 were returned to their owners.  That is a growing industry.  It does not deal with the issue in its entirety, but it is an area we are working on and supporting.  I mentioned education in my introduction as one of the issues highlighted to us in our consultation on the animal welfare strategy.  That is not to say that we are not already involved in elements of education.  We have several projects ongoing with welfare organisations and local authorities in Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Sligo and Mayo.  We are seeking to fund a number of education projects and riding welfare classes nationally.</p> <p>  We have provided funding for the online training programme provided by the Irish Horse Welfare Trust, IHWT, as part of those education courses.  Funding has also been provided to the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, to allow it to provide training days with the Laois Traveller Action Group.  The Department also continues to support programmes such as the Moyross equine education and therapy programme and Cherry Orchard Equine Centre.  We are also funding two research projects through Pavee Point.  The findings of the most recent project were published this week.  In the context of our engagement with the local authority in Longford, we are working with it to find a facility for use by traveller families close to the town.  The Department has also supported the provision of fencing to a project in north Meath.  I understand that insurance issues have arisen but that is being progressed.  In Sligo, a site has been selected and arrangements are being made through the local council for the provision of a number of stables.  There are also projects in Carrick-on-Shannon and Kilkenny.  The Department has, therefore, been working on the issue of urban horses and has sought to support and education.</p> <p>  Deputy Penrose also mentioned the Irish Harness Racing Association.  The Department continues to work with that association in providing training under its auspices and with its support.  We are funding that training for trotters and people who might be sulky racing on roads.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny raised issues concerning the variance in the value of horses.  That is something we understand and acknowledge.  We also note the points made concerning how funding is apportioned and that is something we can reflect upon.  On the issue of the identification of horses, I gave some information regarding the level of microchipping and registration that is occurring.  That is approaching nearly 90% of what we expect it to be.  That has grown incrementally over the years.  It is not where we want it to be yet but it is improving.  </p> <p>  Turning to the database, I mentioned it in the context of dogs and horses.  We have our own national database for horses, while a number of registration bodies have their own databases for dogs that can be interrogated by local authorities, ourselves or veterinary practitioners to investigate rehoming.</p> <p>  Senator Mulherin raised the issue of education.  I hope I have addressed that point in the context of engaging with young people and Travellers.  We have been trying to do that and we continue to want to do.  It will feature strongly in our animal welfare strategy to be published later in the year.  </p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to research, which I mentioned in my comments on our animal welfare strategy.  Research is one plank we have identified as something in which we need to continue to invest.  We have already invested in some research projects, such as the project I mentioned in respect of Pavee Point.  We have also invested in research on the welfare other animal species.  We will be able to deal with research needs and the Department will take the lead in identifying research needs regarding any welfare issue affecting any animal species.  I mentioned the "One Welfare" concept earlier.  That also feeds into the issues mentioned regarding the well-being of people, the welfare of animals and the interconnectedness of those elements.  We have recognised this issue and it will be featuring in our animal welfare strategy.  We do recognise the benefits that animals bring to people and people bring to animals.</p></speech>

We have a robust check on all animals entering the food chain.  Only 6,000 to 7,000 animals are slaughtered each year.  This happens at two plants so it is easy for us to check.  We have a full-time presence in those two abattoirs.  If we find something wrong then that animal is rejected.  For example, if we find two microchips in an animal post slaughter, the carcase is rejected.</p></speech>

There was also suggestion the donkeys were being brought in from England.  It was in that overall context that that review was taking place.  We work closely with The Donkey Sanctuary and are conscious of the implications of this change from a welfare point of view.  We are meeting The Donkey Sanctuary on Friday next, and with Mr. Joe Collins MRCVS, to discuss possible implications.  Issues were raised in the whole examination of the areas of natural constraint, ANC, on how it and the compensatory payments were being operated.  This relates to that suggestion of the use of donkeys by non-farmers, that is people who had land but would not normally be associated with farming.</p></speech>

In our view they are not adequate to deal with the overall problem.  Our opening statement pointed out that we do not have sufficient professional and technical resources to deal with the increasing number of incidents of horse welfare issues.</p> <p>  On purely financial resources, in figures I mentioned earlier, it is costing between &euro;500 and &euro;1,000 per horse.  We recoup some but not all of that from the Department.  From a resource point of view we have to supplement this from our own resources through ratepayers etc.  Ideally we would like full recoupment for these costs.  </p> <p>  There is a new procurement framework in place and we should see some efficiencies there.  This is an ongoing issue for local authorities in trying to match resources with expenditure in all our areas and control of horses is a very significant one in some of our local authorities.</p></speech>

The local authority sector does have equivalent taskforces in the area of waste enforcement and areas where dog wardens need to work in partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We have and are developing protocols in those areas.  This is worth exploring.  As mentioned in our statement we are very open to exploring how a service level agreement, SLA, can be developed between ourselves and the Department similar to what is in place with one of the animal welfare bodies. This sector is very open to such an arrangement.  This is about how best to apply resources that are scarce.  I will ask Mr. Boland to deal with research.</p></speech>

The local authority sector has been looking for this for quite some time.  It will be gleaned from the conversation today that there are significant costs involved.  All of these are reactive.  We are reacting to a problem and are never sufficiently focused on the cause of the problem in the first instance.  What is the cause?  Is it solely down to cultural issues or are there other factors involved?  Does this relate to a culture of carelessness or indiscriminate breeding?  Does it relate to issues of supply to the food chain, as suggested by Deputy Cahill?  Are there issues relating to adverse possession of lands?  Are there other issues or ones of criminality involved?  Are horses being kept simply as an attack on authority?  There are many aspects to this.  The local authority sector would welcome independent academic research on this and again I agree wholeheartedly with many of the comments made here.  I commend the work of this committee and this is one action that it should consider very carefully.</p> <p>  As far as local authorities are concerned we would be happy to contribute to the costs, but as several members of the committee have said, we do not want to be back here in ten years time talking about this again.  The problem would appear to have abated somewhat but is certainly not gone away by any by any manner or means.  </p></speech>

Could a collective local authority submission be made to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to have a measure within GLAS, that would in some way address part of the issue we are trying to deal with here that could be considered at European level?

In our by-laws in County Louth, if after five days the owner is known, one has to serve a second notice to give another five days.

From my experience, the mandatory microchipping of dogs has come a long way.  It has been very positive and I know from our pound that we are practically reaching a 50:50 state where about 50% of dogs coming in are properly microchipped and that has been excellent because the amount of reclaims, as in dogs we are reuniting with the owners, has gone up dramatically.  If the annual statistics are read each year, it will be seen that the reclaims of dogs, that is, dogs going back to their owners, is rising all the time, and that is down to the microchipping.  It is highly beneficial and very good.</p><p> The flip side is that, while the overall amount of horses microchipped in the country might be about 90%, unfortunately, the vast majority of the horses we see in our pounds that have been seized under the Control of Horses Act 1996 are not properly microchipped.  It is exceptionally rare to have a seized horse in that is properly microchipped with a passport and the details of that microchip which give the current owner.  We are seeing that to be incredibly rare.  It may be the genre of horses we are coming across and seizing but if there is a gap in microchipping, that is exactly where it is.  I agree that if that could be targeted it would be beneficial because we could get to the root of the problem before it creates difficulty.</p><p> Questions were asked about the legislation and how strong it is and dogs were mentioned as well.  The Control of Dogs Act 1986 is old legislation and I know the Department responsible for that is the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It will be reviewed over the summer but it is working quite well.  Deputy Cahill asked about coursing and what can be done and there are provisions in the Control of Dogs Act 1986 that can deal with that.  I accept that if it happens out of hours-----</p></speech>

The position of Louth County Council is that the horse legislation needs to be reviewed and that is probably urgent, especially with recent High Court cases and so on.  It urgently needs to be reviewed to help us do our job.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#M01100"><p>I want to go back to microchipping.  For me, this is at the hub of the issue.  Mr. Shine answered a question there and he said that the vast majority of the horses that are impounded have no microchip.  He said he was happy enough and I took a rough calculation of the figures he mentioned for registration as regards the number of foals that are born every year and I reckon that only 80% to 85% are being microchipped.  Therefore, we have roughly 15% of each year's horse population that is not being microchipped and that is the 15% from where all our problems are coming.  If there is irregular movement of horses out of the country, it is happening out of that 15%.  Mr. Shine was talking about the database and all the rest but we have an incomplete database when we have that level of non-participation.</p> <p>  Cross-compliance obviously forces other herdowners to comply with registration but do we have any stick we can use to force owners of mares to microchip a foal when it is born?  I know the resources to go around and inspect this would be colossal but is there any weapon in our armoury that we can use to try to move to 100% compliance?  If we had 100% compliance, we would be an awful long way down the road of solving both our cruelty problems and our neglect problems.  In a case of trespassing, for example, if the animal is traceable back to an owner, it would greatly increase the onus on the owners to look after the animals.  To me, the hub of the issue is microchipping.  While Mr. Shine has said that we have come a long way from where we were, we are still a long way from a complete database and I could not have confidence in a system such as that.</p> <p>  If we go back and compare this to the situation with bovines, we would be laughed out of every market in the world if we only had 85% compliance in that sector, or in the sheep sector or any other agriculture sector for that matter.  Horses are legally entering the food chain as well, that is a reality.  Unless we have plans to increase the percentage of the horse population that is being microchipped, as Deputy Penrose said, we will be back here in five or seven years' time with the same problems.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.81" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019061800002#M01200"><p>I was going to make a similar point on the small amount of the sector that are not microchipped.  When we talk about horses are we covering horses, ponies, donkeys and everything in the equine sector?  I imagine that the high end is looked after, which is probably 50% or more, and it is that other sector that is not being taken care of.  In some cases, as has been mentioned earlier, we come across semi-retired farmers who have a small bit of land and in order to keep their areas of natural constraint, ANC, payment, they have a couple of assess on the land.  I know them and I met a man last week in his 80s who does that.  There is nothing wrong with that and it is not trying to pull the wool over people's eyes in any way.  It is tiny and it is very much a by-issue.  The point is that in some of those cases, microchipping and all of that may not be dealt with as appropriately as it should be.</p> <p>  We also have a range of people such as the sulky racers and all of that sector.  I imagine that a similar range of people are involved.  The focus needs to go towards that end and that comes back to the point Deputy Penrose made on the Irish Harness Racing Association.  While I acknowledge some assistance was given to the association, its members are telling us that they are meeting a stone wall with their big asks.  All of us have met its members and they tell us they are finding it difficult to overcome that.  Were adequate resources given to that sector, it would resolve a fair part of the problem, because it would create a regulated industry where those types of horses and ponies would have a way forward.  The sector would know what it was doing, it would be regulated and matters would be better looked after.</p> <p>  That is one of the key matters we should be looking to resolve.  We should see if the Irish Harness Racing Association can get on a proper footing in Ireland.  It is a huge industry in France and in other countries and yet, we are dragging behind here.  It is not appropriate that we say we have this problem and yet we have part of the solution and we are ignoring it.  That solution needs to be dealt with more appropriately and that seems to be coming up all of the time.  They tell us that, they have come in and met committee members and they have lobbied us many times on this issue.  They have been at this for a couple of years and they do not seem to be getting any traction.  I appeal to the Department in particular to sit down with them and come up with a solution to their problems because solving their problems would solve a big part of this other problem as well.</p></speech>

It must be possible to register an equine animal, be it a horse, a pony or whatever else, in order to draw down a payment?</p></speech>

The suggestion has been that the system might have been used a bit by people who are not normally associated with farming, and that was what was coming up in the stakeholder review that I mentioned earlier to Deputy McConalogue.  There would be a passport, therefore.</p> <p>  There was also the suggestion that some animals were being brought in from England to benefit.  In these cases there would not be any other livestock units on the farm and so on.  That was all thrashed out in the stakeholder review that took place but there would be a requirement to have a passport and to be microchipped since 2009 under EU law and Irish law.</p></speech>

Part and parcel of our original office grouping involves checking for identification on an ongoing basis.  We have looked at the incremental increase over the years as a response to that engagement.  We have registered 25,000 premises where horses are kept.  Two years ago we did not have that number.  Essentially, we know there are 25,000 premises where horses are kept.  There are only a handful of horses on most premises.  We also have large herds of horses.  That has become a feature of recent years.  We have checked some of these large horse holdings and some of the large horse dealers to ensure they are compliant.  We have set up checks at some of the fairs with the help of the Garda in some cases.  In some cases, the Garda has advised us not to undertake checks.  We have undertaken checks at some of the fairs where some of the horses about which we have concerns might be traded.  We have had multi-agency engagement at Banagher fair.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Garda and ourselves have checked on participants for animal identification and other issues.  There is an element of engagement across agencies.  Perhaps we need to do more of that in the context of the holistic issue that is presenting to us.</p></speech>

Where we are dealing with 50% of clients not in compliance, we work on trying to get more and more people compliant.  The ability is in place to take people to court on identification and welfare issues.  We have prosecuted several cases under the new Act on horse welfare grounds since 2013.</p></speech>

Actions to mitigate the causes and impacts of climate change are likely to have a significant budgetary impact on both revenue and expenditure.  The purpose of this committee meeting is to discuss the long-term budgetary implications of climate changes measures, including climate change targets and compliance costs, the budgetary impact of measures to introduce carbon taxes, and the long-term changes to yield for the Exchequer arising from climate change measures.</p><p>I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound quality and transmission of the meeting.  I welcome Professor John FitzGerald, chair, and Mr. Phillip O'Brien, council secretariat, from the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC.

By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask each of the witnesses to make their opening statements, which will be followed by questions and answers.  I invite Professor FitzGerald to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will say a few words on the plan.  The Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, welcomes the plan that was published yesterday as a major step forward.  It includes realistic sectoral targets and appropriate governance to ensure a successful transition.  It provides for an early warning to be issued if we are underperforming.  Rather than making optimistic assumptions about oil prices, which would reduce the magnitude of the challenges we face, the plan is more realistic.  This is to be welcomed.  The next task is to ensure the detailed measures proposed in the plan are implemented in an appropriate timescale.</p> <p>  As the statement I have submitted makes clear, the costs of doing too little on climate change are far greater than the costs of doing too much.  We should be erring on the side of caution by doing too much, but we are actually doing too little.  Ireland has set itself a binding target of decarbonising by 2050, with key milestones along the way.  The plan sets out realistic targets for 2030.  Out to 2050, however, it involves a significant rate of acceleration.  If we had seen a trajectory to 2050, we might be able to say we should be doing more by 2030 to meet the 2050 target.  That remains to be seen.  Our job is to provide independent advice on the most cost-effective way of meeting our climate change goals.</p> <p>  On carbon taxation, a wide range of research in Ireland and elsewhere shows that if global warming is to be halted, it is essential that we raise the cost of emitting greenhouse gases.  One of the key messages from the CCAC in successive reports has been that if we are to make progress, we need to implement rising carbon taxes that reflect the potential damage done by emitting greenhouse gases.  Various other measures and policies are needed to bring about decarbonisation, but they will be significantly undermined if emitting greenhouse gases remains the cheap option.  The carbon tax in Ireland and the carbon price in the EU emissions trading system are too low.  That is one of the reasons we are underachieving.</p> <p>  It is important to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions for three key reasons.  First, it discourages the use of fossil fuels and makes it comparatively cheaper to use electric cars and upgrade our homes.  If emissions are priced appropriately, businesses and the Government will find that the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions saves money.  Second, carbon pricing, especially the carbon tax, provides the Government with revenue it can use to compensate or support those who are on low incomes.  Such revenue can be used in the budget to reduce other taxes or to increase expenditure.  Research shows that shifting from taxes on labour or indirect taxes to taxes on carbon can increase employment.  The use of the revenue from a tax of this nature can affect the distributional effects of the tax and can have beneficial effects on the economy as a whole.  The third and most important reason to price emissions is to incentivise businesses and households to invest in new technologies.  This will allow us to continue to enjoy a reasonably high standard of living while eliminating greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  Those involved in companies like Volkswagen are investing billions in the development of electric cars not because they are nice people but because they know they will be priced out of the market if this does not happen.  This shows that the expectation that prices will increase drives technological development.  The current carbon pricing levels are too low to drive real change.  In light of our failure to take action in this respect in the previous budget, I suggest that the carbon tax should be increased to &euro;35 a tonne in the next budget, with a commitment to increasing it to at least &euro;80 a tonne by 2030.  It is important for the Government and the Oireachtas to give a commitment to an increasing trajectory over time so people know that if they invest in reducing emissions, they will make money in the future.</p> <p>  A massive body of evidence from across the world shows that carbon taxes are essential.  There are very few carbon tax deniers in the economics community.  A recent statement by a large number of American economists, including 27 Nobel prize winners, identified carbon taxes as essential for the US and the world.  The OECD and the EU led the way in 1990 and 1992, but unfortunately Ireland rejected the proposal to raise a carbon tax at EU level in 1992 on the basis that we did not believe in tax harmonisation.  That was a very unwise move by Ireland at the time.</p><p>The research carried out by the ESRI showed that it would have been beneficial for Ireland if it had gone ahead with that EU proposal.  There have been many papers since 1992, some of which two colleagues from the ESRI have been involved in, all of which show that carbon taxes are essential to driving the decarbonisation of the economy.  There has been at least one per year over a 30-year period.  The council advocates hypothecation of the revenue from carbon taxes, using it to compensate those on low incomes who might otherwise carry a disproportionate share of the additional tax burden, promoting investment in dealing with climate change, and returning residual income to households.  </p><p> As long ago as 1992, an ESRI study indicated that 30% of the revenue from a carbon tax would need to be used to compensate those on low incomes.  Many papers since then have considered the issue.  A useful paper by Barra Roantree from the ESRI published last week considers a range of options that provide the information the Government and Oireachtas need to determine how best to carry out a just transition.  While advocating a just transition approach, the council has not favoured a particular scheme for achieving it.  Detailed policies on how best to redistribute income are a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas, not for an advisory group on climate policy.  </p><p> It is important that the investment programme to be financed in budget 2020 be subjected to rigorous assessment using the parameters of the revised public spending code, PSC.  This code assumes that an appropriate price of carbon for 2050 is &euro;260 a tonne.  Using the recommended discount rate in the code, this implies a price today of approximately &euro;80 a tonne.  In planning for the future, the Government should take account of the fact that saving emissions is worth &euro;80 per tonne today and could have a significant effect, for example, on the State's investment in vehicles.  In planning to ramp up investment in retrofitting houses and other buildings, it will be important to take account of the capacity of the building industry to deliver.  The plan pays particular attention to this issue, which is welcome.  The expertise and skills need to be developed to undertake this work and this may take some time.  However, the plans states that these investments in retrofitting houses will make sense if the carbon price is &euro;30 or &euro;80 per tonne.  It emphasises that this will not happen unless the carbon tax is raised, as we recommend.  One way of developing this expertise would be to gradually ramp up contracts to retrofit the stock of local authority dwellings owned by the State.  The State is the landlord and is responsible for doing so.  In doing so, the State would signal that investment in this sector will be a major feature of the coming decades.  Developing the building industry capacity and skills to deliver it will be worthwhile.  This investment would also substantially reduce emissions from families in local authority dwellings, many of which are on low incomes, and substantially reduce their expenditure, thus benefitting them in other ways and, in the case of more elderly tenants, bring significant health benefits.</p><p> In conclusion, carbon pricing alone will not deliver the necessary emissions reductions but delivering emissions reductions without a sufficient carbon price will be almost impossible and certainly much more expensive.  Increasing the cost of emitting carbon is not a once-off commitment but must be sustained over the coming decade.</p></speech>

I am head of the climate economy modelling team at the ESRI, and I am accompanied by my colleague, Dr. John Curtis.  This committee is considering the budgetary implications of issues relating to climate change.  The specific design of a climate policy will have ramifications for its environmental, economic, distributional and budgetary impacts.  It is critical that policies are well designed to ensure emissions reductions, minimise the economic disruption and be distributionally fair whereby those most able to bear the costs do so.</p> <p>  In this opening statement, I will give the committee an outline of the current work being conducted at the ESRI on the carbon tax and convey our results concerning this issue.  Our goal is to provide insights into the impacts of increasing the tax to guide policy formation.  I will focus on our results concerning the increased revenue resulting from a carbon tax increase, the impacts on emissions, macroeconomic impacts and distributional impacts across production sectors and households.  </p> <p>  To contextualise our results, a general understanding of our methods is useful, hence I will first give a short non-technical overview of our model.  The Ireland, Environment, Energy and Economy, I3E, model has recently been developed by Dr. Aykut Mert Yakut and I.  It examines the relationship between the economy, energy use and the emissions of greenhouse gases.</p><p>In technical terms, it is a macroeconomic intertemporal computable general equilibrium model, which reproduces the structure of the economy in its entirety.  It includes 32 distinct production sectors, 37 different goods, ten households types, three labour types, trade and the government, among others.  It is a dynamic model, which incorporates economic growth over a modelling horizon that runs from 2014 to 2050.  Under the model, the nature of all existing economic transactions among diverse economic agents is quantified.  It examines how inputs and outputs flow between production sectors of the economy and result in final goods consumed by households.  The I3E model includes energy flows and emissions in addition to the standard monetary flows.</p><p> Each production sector produces an economic commodity using labour, capital, material inputs and energy inputs.  The I3E model explicitly comprises a set of carbon commodities, including peat, coal, natural gas, crude oil, fuel oil, LPG, gasoline, diesel, kerosene and other petroleum products.  Based on relative prices, producers can change their production inputs to minimise costs.  Similarly, consumers can change their consumption patterns based on relative costs to maximise their utility.  The explicit modelling of intersectoral linkages makes it possible to investigate the wider economic impacts of a specific policy, such as a carbon tax, through the different transmission channels in the economy.  We examine the impacts of an increase in the carbon tax of &euro;10 in 2020 with further increases of &euro;5 a year after that reaching a carbon tax of &euro;80 in 2030.</p><p> I will first focus on the case where carbon tax revenues are used to reduce Government debt.  After that, I will discuss our investigation of different revenue recycling schemes to understand how carbon tax revenue can be used to limit the economic and distributional impacts of the carbon tax increase.  Increasing the carbon tax by &euro;10 in 2020 would increase expected carbon tax revenue from &euro;459 million to &euro;666 million in 2020 and the additional increments in the tax would increase carbon revenues from &euro;682 million to &euro;2.138 billion in 2030.  However, when this carbon tax revenue is not recycled but used to reduce Government debt, our model shows that revenue impacts are likely to be negative, where large decreases in the receipts of sales taxes, wage taxes and corporate taxes, due to decreased economic output and consumption, outweigh the increase in carbon tax receipts.</p><p> Household emissions are estimated to decrease, on average, by 10% in 2030 compared to no increase in carbon tax.  These results are in line with other ESRI work, which develops a behavioural microsimulation model and econometrically estimate the behavioural response of households to a carbon tax increase in terms of direct carbon emissions.  We find that rural households reduce their emissions substantially more than urban.  Economy-wide emissions in 2030 are estimated to be 15% lower with the carbon tax increase then without it.  Over time, however, emissions still increase, with 2030 emissions almost 27% higher than 2018 emissions.  Our model is likely to underestimate emission reduction as we do not explicitly include new technologies in the model, though it is clear that in absence of other climate policies, the carbon tax would need to be significantly higher to reach the Irish EU emission targets.</p><p> Real GDP will be lowered by 0.3% in 2020 compared to no increase in tax and will be 0.6% lower in 2030.  Wages will decrease, where low-skilled labour is impacted most.  The most impacted production sectors are transport, mining and electricity with value added reductions of up to 2.7%, compared to a situation where there is no increase in the carbon tax.  Comparing impacts across households, we find a strong regressive trend, where poorer households are impacted the most in terms of disposable income, consumption, price increases and welfare.  In terms of welfare, rural households are impacted more than urban.  This is in line with the findings of Tovar Reanos and Lynch, as well as other ESRI work which applies the ESRI&rsquo;s tax and benefit microsimulation, SWITCH, model, which replicates the tax and benefit system of Ireland in a high level of detail.</p><p>The Ireland Environment, Energy and Economy, I3E, model finds higher impacts, as it includes secondary impacts such as price changes to non-carbon goods, macro-economic impacts and household income impacts via wage and capital income. <br/><br/>A major concern about a carbon tax is that it is often regressive in nature.  We see the same effect in Ireland.  Distributing carbon tax revenues to households is often proposed as an effective way of reducing the regressive aspects of the tax.  We have examined two transfers schemes to see what the impact might be.  Under the first, carbon tax revenues are given back to households on a <i>per capita</i>basis.  Under the second, revenues are distributed based on relative current welfare transfers.  In terms of real disposable income, a lump sum transfer would significantly decrease the regressive trend of the tax, having positive impacts for rural households and negative impacts for urban households.  Applying a transfer based on social welfare, we find a decrease of a lesser degree in regressiveness.  Both Tovar Reanos and Lynch and Bercholz and Roantree, in their respective studies, find such transfers to have a higher impact in reducing regressive trends.  Our results show that the secondary impacts of these distribution schemes - predominantly changes in wage and capital income - are regressive.  Real GDP impacts remain negative, but they are almost halved when compared to when revenue is used to reduce Government debt.  When applying social welfare or lump sum transfers, net Government revenue is estimated to increase by approximately &euro;500 million in 2020.<br/><br/>It is often suggested the revenues from an environmental tax may be recycled to create a so-called double dividend, whereby other distortionary taxes can be reduced and economic growth boosted, while, at the same time, achieving emissions reductions.  We have investigated various revenue recycling schemes and their impact on the economy, as well as their distributional impacts across households.  Our results show that when carbon tax revenue is used to reduce other distortionary taxes in the economy, a double dividend can be achieved.  Decreasing wage taxes, sales taxes or corporate taxes will result in an increase in GDP of up to 0.8% compared with no change in carbon tax, while still achieving significant emissions reductions.  The impact on households will be positive, but it will have higher positive impacts on richer households.  Value added in most sectors is boosted and value-added reductions are limited in carbon tax sensitive sectors, with the exception of transport. <br/><br/>If carbon revenue was to be used to reduce sales taxes, it would increase wage and corporate tax receipts owing to increased consumption, giving an increase in total Government revenues of approximately &euro;660 million in 2020.  Reducing wage taxes would boost production and receipts of sales taxes and corporate taxes, resulting in an approximate increase in total Government revenues of &euro;1.6 billion in 2020.  A reduction in corporate taxes would increase receipts of wage and sales taxes, thereby increasing total Government revenues by &euro;1.3 billion and reducing more Government debt than when revenues are used directly to reduce Government debt.<br/><br/>We have found that the economic and budgetary impacts of a carbon tax will strongly depend on the policy design.  A well designed carbon tax revenue recycling scheme can assist in reaching other policy goals such as economic growth and inequality reduction, in addition to emissions reduction.  We wish the committee every success in its work and will be happy to assist members in the coming months.</p></speech>

The plan sets out how Ireland will, at the very least, meet its targets for the period to 2030 and puts us on a trajectory to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  The plan will have a strong focus on implementation, setting out more than 180 actions with clear timelines and steps needed to achieve each of them.  It will follow a similar approach to that of the Action Plan for Jobs model and include annual updating of the plan with new actions, quarterly reporting on delivery, the establishment of a climate action delivery board to be chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach to hold Departments and public bodies to account, ongoing consultation and feedback which will inform each subsequent plan and ongoing review of changing costs and technologies to inform new actions being developed.</p><p>The goals and targets set out in the plan are informed by analysis of the most cost-effective choices currently available to reach our 2030 targets.  By articulating a decarbonisation ambition range for each sector, the framework provided by the plan will enable each sector to identify and put in place the most appropriate policy tools to deliver the stated ambition and enable Ireland to meet its 2030 targets.<br/><br/>As the committee will be aware, an objective of the Minister in finalising the plan was to follow closely the recommendations of the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, published in March of this year.  That report was informed by the earlier work of the Citizens' Assembly, which reported in 2018.  I will refer briefly to the main points mentioned in the committee's letter of invitation to the Department.<br/><br/>The first issue we considered was the revenue implications of increasing the price of carbon.  The Government is committed to carbon pricing as a core element of the suite of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a sustained manner over time.  Ireland is one of a minority of countries globally to have already implemented economy-wide carbon pricing, through its implementation of the EU's emissions trading system, ETS, for electricity generation and large industry and through a national carbon tax that applies in other sectors of the economy.  The climate action plan, while recognising that taxation decisions are primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance, commits the Government to implementing a carbon tax rate of &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, with a trajectory of increases over successive annual budgets.  This was recommended by the Climate Change Advisory Council in its 2018 annual review and was also broadly endorsed by the joint committee in its report.  There is a clear rationale for both increasing the rate and for clearly signposting the desired future rate of carbon tax, as these actions provide a strong signal to households and firms of the need to invest in low-carbon alternatives where possible.<br/><br/>I will not dwell on the potential additional revenue that may be raised through the carbon tax.  As the committee will be aware from tax strategy group analysis, each additional &euro;5 in the rate of carbon tax could raise in the region of an additional &euro;100 million per annum.  The Government is, of course, concerned about the distributional implications of increasing the rate of tax.  I understand the Department of Finance is considering a number of options in respect of the use of any additional carbon tax revenue in this regard.  In addition, the Department is consulting on how additional revenue raised by increasing the carbon tax could be used.  My colleagues from the ESRI have provided information on their detailed research programme examining both the revenue and emissions impacts as well as the distributional aspects of increasing carbon tax.<br/><br/>Another issue we considered is the medium-term expenditure requirements to achieve our EU 2020 and 2030 targets<b>.  </b>The overall quantum of capital resources available to Departments and agencies is set out in the national development plan, NDP, for the period to 2027 in the context of the Project Ireland 2040 framework.  The NDP allocates approximately &euro;30 billion in Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources to climate action and sustainable mobility over the decade, the allocation of these resources to individual Departments being subject to the normal Estimates and budgetary process.  However, achievement of the Government's climate policy objectives and the particular targets set out in the plan as published will not only rely on Exchequer funding.  The plan also foresees a role for taxation policy and regulatory measures to bring about reductions in our emissions.  These include setting a long-term trajectory for the carbon tax to change long-term behaviour and decision-making to encourage investment in more sustainable choices, and new regulations to end certain practices, such as phasing out oil and gas boilers in homes or banning the sale of new petrol or diesel cars from 2030.<br/><br/>The low-carbon transition will require significant private investment alongside Exchequer expenditure on a sustained basis over a number of decades.  The Government will seek opportunities to leverage private finance with its Exchequer funding.  For instance, in the first call of the climate action fund, which has an overall envelope of &euro;500 million, a &euro;77 million commitment from the fund was able to leverage a total investment of &euro;300 million.  NewERA will continue its work with the commercial State companies to identify priority opportunities in key sectors to mobilise private investment towards assisting in meeting our climate objectives.<br/><br/>The plan also envisages new ways of spending the Exchequer resources we do have.  To maximise the impact of the &euro;3 billion that was allocated to home energy retrofits under the NDP, we are reforming the current system to create a new retrofit delivery model.  This envisages grouping houses together so that one contractor would retrofit batches of homes in the same area, developing smart finance products, with low-cost financing linked to energy performance improvements, and easy payback methods whereby households can pay back the cost over a longer period through, for example, a voluntary increase in their local property tax or electricity bill.<br/><br/>Another issue to consider is the cost of missing our targets.  Ireland is required under EU rules to reduce emissions covered by the non-ETS sector by 20% relative to 2005 levels by 2020.  Current projections by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, indicate that relevant emissions could remain at between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.  The relevant EU legislation does allow member states to meet their targets by means of unused emissions allowances from earlier years or through purchasing credits from other member states or on international markets.  This will allow Ireland to remain compliant with the EU rules even though our emissions will not have reduced to the mandated level by 2020.</p><p>The Government spent approximately &euro;120 million in total on the purchase of credits between 2007 and 2009, for which sum approximately 8.5 million credits were received by the State.  Some of them were used towards Ireland's compliance with the Kyoto Protocol first commitment period in the period 2008 to 2012.  On the cost of purchasing additional credits to meet our targets, the Department currently estimates the cost to be in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.  On 2030 compliance, the same arrangements in regard to purchasing credits will apply under EU rules.  The Government&rsquo;s objective, however, is to avoid having to rely on this option.  </p><p> With regard to other channels through which the budgetary process could assist in addressing climate change, robust rules on how we value the shadow price of carbon, as part of project appraisal for all public capital investments, are essential to avoiding expenditure that locks in long-term fossil fuel consumption.  To that end, the Government, through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is currently reviewing the PSC to improve the calculation of a shadow price of carbon.  This proposal would see future Government capital investments valuing carbon at a level which will see the shadow price increase to &euro;32 per tonne by 2020, &euro;100 per tonne by 2030, and &euro;265 by 2050.</p><p> The climate plan also includes a new commitment to ensure that all Government memoranda and major investment decisions are subject to a carbon impact and mitigation evaluation.  The objective is to incorporate this requirement into Cabinet procedures, regulatory impact assessments and project appraisal processes.  Consistent application of these rules will allow decision-makers to better understand and appreciate the climate consequences of their investment options.  </p><p> That concludes my opening statement.  My colleagues and I are available to answer any questions members of the committee might have.</p></speech>

We have significant and difficult decisions to make as a Parliament and as citizens.  We are not in agreement on how best to make those decisions and we do not agree on how quickly the aspirational elements of the Government's climate plan, which was published yesterday, can be achieved.  While the plan is welcome, it is short on detail.  No full costings are available.  We do not know how much it will cost to implement the plan or even whether it is possible to implement it within the timeframe.  It is disappointing that we will miss our 2020 targets by a long way.  It is even questionable whether the State can meet its targets for 2030.</p> <p>  My first question, which is for all three contributors, seeks their view on the costing of yesterday's plan.  Is it credible?  Is it achievable in terms of the timelines set out by the Government yesterday?</p></speech>

Regarding implementation, what needs to be done needs to be spelled out.  Considering the macroeconomic impacts and investment by people in electric cars, as is assumed will occur, there may not be a net increase in expenditure.  The argument is that it will save people money if they buy electric cars over the next decade because they will be the cheaper option.  At the moment, they are not.</p> <p>  With regard to the investment in retrofitting houses, there is a need to spell out how the programme is going to be ramped up.  It is going to be a gradual process.  It is not spelled out.  An essential ingredient in the plan is that it recognises that the carbon price needs to be between &euro;30 and &euro;80 per tonne to make it worthwhile to undertake the investment.  The size of the investment could be large.  I refer to how it is scheduled.  Regarding the public sector's role in this, we have suggested that whatever resources the State has, it should concentrate first on local authority housing as a method of ramping up the capacity in the building and construction sector.  It would have significant side benefits.  It is the landlord's job, not the tenant's, to upgrade dwellings.  The work has not been done on determining how much is available for this and on how one would ramp it up.  The Deputy is identifying an issue that needs further work.</p></speech>

Many of the options needed to reach the targets are cost effective, even without an increase in the carbon tax.  Whether we can reach the targets by 2030 will very much depend on how we can incentivise people to make the transfer.  This is where the carbon tax is very relevant.  I do not know whether the objective is achievable.  It depends on what policies are put in place to incentivise behaviour to switch from carbon.</p></speech>

Most of us are in agreement that a carbon tax is necessary.  We have concerns, however, about pushing people into fuel poverty.  The poorest households will be hit the most.  Dr. de Bruin said in her opening statement that a carbon tax on its own is quite regressive and hits the poorest the hardest.  Interestingly, she spoke about recycling the tax revenue.  It is not necessarily a matter of giving it back in a lump sum, whereby a carbon tax would be paid and a cheque would be handed back at the end of the year.  It would be a matter of using the carbon tax to offset against income tax or other taxes, thereby reducing emissions and stimulating economic growth, which sounds good.</p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald is obviously a strong advocate of the carbon tax.  He has highlighted that former Nobel prizewinners have advocated it as the first and essential step to reducing emissions.  What is his council's view on tax recycling?  Rather than taking money with one hand and handing it straight back, what is the best way to apply a carbon tax?</p></speech>

The ESRI paper published last week by Mr. Barra Roantree and a colleague examines a range of options, one showing where all the money is used to increase welfare benefits, which would lead to a significant reduction in poverty.  It is up to the committee and the Government to do the sums.  Perhaps half the revenue could be used in the way I described, and half in some other way, which would ensure that those on low incomes do not lose out.  Options exist but, as a council, we believe it is essential that people on low incomes do not lose out.  There is a range of options.  That is an issue for the Oireachtas and the Government to decide.</p></speech>

I am conscious time is running out.  The Department has been quiet on the first two questions.  I thank Mr. Maughan for presenting his evidence to the committee.  I smiled when I read the first page of his opening statement, which suggested there would be quarterly reporting on delivery.  I am sure all of us will be looking forward to that.  The criticism of yesterday's publication is that we do not have any costings or a clear process for implementing the plan.  We have no idea, therefore, how the Department proposes to implement it.  It is very much aspirational in parts.  It sounds lovely in parts but very expensive.  I would like Mr. Maughan's response to what Professor Fitzgerald has said, namely, that it would be nice to have costings.  How does he propose to implement the plan?  What is his view on how the carbon tax regime should be implemented?  I acknowledge that he does not want to dwell on additional revenue that could be raised through the carbon tax but, as a committee, we consider revenue-raising measures, where revenue should be spent and how it can best be used to serve citizens.  We very much dwell on where the money will be used.  It would be interesting to hear the Department's views on how the carbon tax should be implemented and where the revenue should go.  Should it be handed back in a lump sum?  Should the tax be recycled?  Should it be used to pay off the national debt?  This was one suggestion, although I am not sure the latter would have a benefit in the broader sense.</p> <p>  Am I correct that there is a target of 1 million electric vehicles by 2030?  Is that even possible given there are fewer than 5,000 currently?</p></speech>

I did not have an opportunity to respond to her first two questions but I will also address them.</p><p> I wish to clarify the point I was trying to make about dwelling on the additional revenue.  I was picking up on a question in the committee's invitation about the amount of additional revenue that could be raised in increasing the carbon tax.  It is a matter of public record in the Tax Strategy Group papers.  The figure I provided in my opening statement was &euro;100 million for each additional &euro;500 million raised.</p><p> I was asked about the potential use of additional revenue from the carbon tax.  As I mentioned, the Department of Finance has issued a consultation paper on this issue.  The Department has explicitly picked up on the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Climate Action on the potential options for recycling the revenue, either in terms of a dividend to individuals and households or using the additional revenue to fund specific schemes that could be directed at people at risk of energy poverty, etc.  The Department is considering several options and has invited submissions on the matter.  I expect that they will be considered as part of the budgetary process in due course and that decisions will be taken on the best approach to adopt to address the recycling of revenue.</p><p> I was asked a question about the cost of implementing the plan.  It presents the most cost-effective way of reaching our targets for 2030 across all sectors from which there are greenhouse gas emissions.</p></speech>

It is based on the marginal abatement cost curve set out in chapter 4 of the plan.  It is a matter for the policy design to determine the best way to achieve each of the various targets, including those for the numbers of electric vehicles, retrofitting, etc.  From that point of view, the plan does not set out specific costings because there is a policy design phase to come.  Part of the approach adopted in the plan and the actions set out in it allow space for the policy design phase.  In the plan we are not pre-empting budgetary decisions in terms of how the Government will choose to reach the targets.  There are design issues to be followed up on.  There are also questions about whether it will be done through expenditure, regulatory or taxation measures.  From that point of view, the plan does not set out costings across the board.  I indicated in my opening statement that the Exchequer resources available to the Government were set out in the national development plan.  That is the extent of the envelope available in terms of resources.</p></speech>

It is a matter for the Government to decide how it will implement the plan, but the Committee on Budgetary Oversight should know how much it will cost to implement it.  For example, how much will it cost to retrofit the current housing stock in the country?  How much will it cost to implement a carbon tax?  How might it be implemented?  These are reasonable questions.  How much will it cost the Exchequer if we push people away from using petrol and diesel?  That is something we need to do, but there would be a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  These are basic questions that, with respect, Mr. Maughan and his team should be able to answer.  The Department cannot publish a plan such as the one that was published yesterday and not have information on costings.  That is utterly ridiculous and makes our job impossible.

The annex to the plan sets out quarterly deadlines for various steps under each of the 183 actions.  When we speak about quarterly delivery and quarterly reporting, we are referring to reporting on whether the steps under each of those actions have been delivered or whether there are delays in the steps.  That is the way in which the plan will be transparent in its delivery.  The various actions, as I have mentioned, address various commitments under the plan for each of the sectors.  Each of those actions has detailed roadmaps with specific steps and quarterly timelines.  The purpose of the quarterly reporting is to be able to report on and publish whether Departments and agencies are actually meeting the commitments that the plan has set out for them in terms of those steps.</p></speech>

I simply do not understand the obsession with the carbon tax being imposed on households.  If I understand the testimony given by the ESRI representatives correctly, it seems even though they favour it they acknowledge that it is regressive.  Reference was made to a strong trend towards regression.  It was stated that low-income households spend a far higher proportion of their income on transport and energy than high-income households.  The ESRI also pointed out that more affluent households have higher emissions.  That is in page 6 of the ESRI paper.  The centrepiece of the Government strategy is to have a regressive tax that will hurt people generating lower emissions who are most vulnerable to the regressive character of that way of approaching it.</p> <p>  I am keen to hear the response from the ESRI on this.  I am arguing that it flies in the face of at least some analysis of the application of carbon taxes elsewhere.  Notably, Food and Water Watch examined the British Colombia carbon tax.  The organisation produced a report arguing that after the implementation of the carbon tax in British Colombia, taxed emissions increased while untaxed emissions decreased.  The implementation of carbon taxes on certain emissions did not actually impact.  Moreover, insofar as there was an overall slight reduction in emissions, it was more to do with the fact that there was a recession in 2008-09.  Where is the evidence?  In fact, there is counter-evidence to the effect that imposing what the ESRI seems to acknowledge as a regressive tax on people will not do anything.</p> <p>  Then, I asked myself another question.  Where are we looking at the alternatives?  All of this has been about carbon taxes imposed on households.  Where is the costing, economics and analysis of what the impact would be if we had public transport subsidies in this country up to the level of the highest in Europe?  What would the impact on behaviour be if we had free public transport?  What would the impact on people using cars as opposed to public transport be if we had 1,000 extra buses in the public transport fleet?  I would like to see those data because I wager the impact would be far greater than-----</p></speech>

There are serious questions over hybrid vehicles too.  Where is the analysis of all these things?  Let us suppose we increased current afforestation levels from 6,000 ha per year, which is well below our stated targets, to 10,000 ha per year and the move was based on more sustainable broadleaf forestry models.  What would the economic impact be?  What would the cost be?  What would the benefit be in terms of carbon sinks and so on?  Where is the analysis of all that?  It seems heavily loaded in the direction of a particular approach to this that is potentially regressive.</p></speech>

There are no carbon tax deniers among those who have done economic work.  Just as there is evidence that climate change is a huge problem, there is evidence that carbon taxes work.  It is true that emissions have continued to increase, even though we have a carbon tax of &euro;20 a tonne.  Emissions have increased because the economy has grown.  The evidence shows that emissions would have been higher if we had not had a carbon tax of &euro;20 a tonne.  The example of British Columbia mentioned by the Deputy takes no account of the other factors that are driving emissions.  The Deputy acknowledged that the state of the economic cycle in British Columbia had had an effect.  In my previous role as an academic economist, my job was to look at the literature.  I note that Dr. de Bruin is nodding in agreement.  There is near unanimity that carbon taxes work.</p></speech>

A paper published by Dr. Barra Rowntree last week shows that such people would be better off if all of the revenue was used to compensate them.  That is the evidence.  It is up to the Oireachtas to decide how it wants to distribute the income.  The net effect of introducing a substantial increase in carbon taxes and using the revenue raised in various ways could be to leave people on low incomes better off, rather than worse off.  The climate would be much better off in such circumstances.</p></speech>

As economists, the reason we are so focused on a carbon tax is it directly taxes the thing we want to get rid of and is the most effective way to deal with the problem.  I accept that if the revenue raised from a carbon tax is not used in an appropriate manner, such a tax is regressive.  That is why we have policymakers.  They can make policies that counteract the regressiveness.  As Professor FitzGerald has pointed out, if half of the revenue is used to reduce other taxes and the other half is used to compensate poorer households, we can get an economic boost from the carbon tax, while fighting the regressiveness of the tax.  An appropriate carbon tax policy is not regressive.</p></speech>

The ESRI has made it clear that how the revenue is recycled is important to gain the benefit of the tax.  The ESRI has three teams looking at different aspects of the carbon tax.  As we published last week in our quarterly economic commentary, one of the teams is looking at whether the revenue should be handed back in a green cheque or targeted at those most in need.  It was concluded that even though giving every household back the same amount in a green cheque would compensate for the extra tax, it would be much better to focus the recycling of revenue on those most in need, including the fuel poor.  That was clearly demonstrated.  It has been suggested we have been entirely focused on the carbon tax, but I do not think we have done that.  What are the alternatives?  I have spent a couple of years looking at household retrofits.  In collaboration with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, I have looked at the data for people taking out retrofit grants and how they have responded to such initiatives.  Some of the conclusions from that research were taken on board in the plan launched yesterday.  For example, it was announced that there would be a one-stop shop to help people to go about retrofits.  Even though the grant encouraged people to become involved, we found that people applied for it but did not follow up on it because they encountered difficulties and barriers, for example, when organising tradesmen.  The research we have carried out has influenced various aspects of the plan, not just on the carbon tax.</p></speech>

All the witnesses have done is assert that their effectiveness has been proven by everybody, whoever they are.  I cited the example of British Columbia, where the evidence shows that the taxed emissions increased and the untaxed emissions decreased.  Rather than this tax being more effective, the opposite was the case.  This sort of evidence needs to be scrutinised before we can make blank assertions that carbon taxes are necessarily effective.  It has rightly been pointed out that our emissions have continued to climb even though we have a carbon tax.  Are we recycling the money that is being generated at the moment so that it has an impact on our emissions?  The signs are that we are not doing that, even though a considerable amount is being generated from carbon tax.  The witnesses seem to have acknowledged that unless the revenue is recycled in a fair and effective way, it is regressive.  The experience is that the receipts from our carbon tax are not being recycled in a manner that is effective or counteracts the regressive impacts of this tax.</p></speech>

The analysis is transparent and has been submitted for peer review.  It has been reviewed not just by our colleagues within the institute, but by anonymous peers from universities and the like.  Emissions have been increasing.  We had a reduction in emissions during the financial crisis when the economy contracted.  As Professor FitzGerald indicated, the size of the economy and the population of the country are both expanding.  The nature of those increases means we expect a growth in emissions.  Professor FitzGerald pointed out that if petrol costs and fuel costs in general were cheaper, we would have more emissions.  We have put the evidence out there.  The members of the committee and the other Members of the Oireachtas can take it on board.</p></speech>

We will take them from this meeting.  It is clear that the witnesses feel strongly about the academic research.</p> <p>  I have a question for the officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  This committee receives documents regularly.  It recently received an overview and analysis of major infrastructure projects under the national development plan.  Those projects are costed.  Some of the costs are overrunning significantly already, even those that are planned beyond 2027.  There is a capital tracker for the costing of these projects.  The work that was done by the Joint Committee on Climate Action and the Citizens' Assembly fed into the advice given to the Minister by the officials and others.  At some stage, the officials must have engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on how much all of these proposals would cost over a period of time.  I am asking this question from a budgetary oversight perspective.  Do the officials have any costings?</p></speech>

As the Deputy identified, specific projects are listed in the project tracker published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Some of those projects feature in this plan.  I suppose the two plans dovetail from that point of view.  As I mentioned, this plan does not include specific costings because the approach that is being taken involves setting out what the most cost-effective way of reaching our targets will be.</p><p>Throughout the various sectors there are sets of targets that can be delivered by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform-----</p></speech>

There is no costing for it.  I am just asking as a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  With regard to the cost of missing targets, as members of this committee we have received a briefing that states the Department of Finance has indicated Ireland is at risk of being subject to fines of &euro;600 million annually from 2021 if targets are not met.  It suggests Ireland could be subject to &euro;6 billion in fines between 2021 and 2030.  In his contribution, Mr. Maughan has said Ireland is required under EU rules to reduce emissions . Current EPA projections indicate relevant emissions could remain at between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels, which are the levels required, by 2020.  This would mean there would be no fines.</p></speech>

There is a separate compliance regime attached to that at EU level.  As I understand it, there will be a requirement to purchase compliance with that framework in case there is a shortfall in reaching the renewable energy targets.</p></speech>

Mr. Maughan has spoken about an emission reduction fine of between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million.  We have a 16% renewable energy target and we are projected to reach approximately 13% so we will have a three percentage point shortage.  The very large figures the Deputy quoted come from an initial estimate a number of years ago that had a range of between &euro;65 million and &euro;130 million per percentage point, so we would need to multiply them by three.  We do not know what the cost of purchasing the statistical transfers from other countries might be.  There have been limited trades so far and those costs have been approximately &euro;20 million to &euro;25 million per percentage point.</p><p>That would give what is very much a ballpark estimate of between &euro;60 million and &euro;75 million for compliance with renewable energy targets.  That would be on top of what Mr. Maughan described.  I stress that we are basing those estimates on a trade that was done between two particular countries and we do not yet have certainty on it.</p></speech>

That has not come to pass.  We have gotten off lightly on the cost of compliance because the market for complying with this has not been as steep as anticipated.  However, we anticipate that it will be higher in future.</p></speech>

It will be people deciding to buy an electric car because it is the cheap option, providing the carbon price is right.  These people would have spent money on a car anyway.  On heating, if the carbon price is right, people will spend money on insulating their homes and, in the period to 2050, will be better off as a result.  Expenditure and investment will be higher but their outgoings on energy in the subsequent 20 years will be much lower.  The issue is that the bulk of expenditure on a spreadsheet will be taken by households deciding on their car and house in a way that will save money; that is on a spreadsheet but behaviour is different.  I have done it myself and it saved me a lot of money, but there was also the hassle of doing it.  That is where the State needs to target resources.  One must give people a push and make it easy.  One issue in the plan, which is a reflection of these problems, is how to do it at scale.  If I had to go out and find a builder and engineer to retrofit my house, there would be hassle and uncertainty about doing it, whereas if the State managed to push the building industry into developing expertise and ramping it up so that it might come into an estate and offer to do everyone's house at a knockdown price, and the local authority guaranteed it would be done efficiently, there would be much greater take-up.</p><p>The State needs measures which will give this a push.  That is where there is a gap in that further work needs to be done.  The bulk of expenditure in these areas will be undertaken by the private sector but State intervention will be needed to give it a push.</p></speech>

I am sceptical, to say the least, about this.  Generations of teachers like myself and people generally have been talking about climate change for 50 or 60 years.  We spoke about the possibility of a type of Armageddon if we did not deal with it yet we, the politicians, and the professionals are still grappling with it.  Mention was made the other day about the need to reinforce the curriculum.  Most people know this has been coming down the line.</p> <p>  I will try to be specific in my questions.  Other members have asked some that I wanted to ask but on the implications for revenue of the reduction in oil and diesel as a result of this change, have the witnesses done any calculations on that?  Is there a need to climate proof a budget similar to gender proofing to ensure we can have a clear statement of intent?</p> <p>  I said on the previous day when we discussed the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council that nobody likes to pay additional taxes.  The reality is that there are some who can afford to do that but there are always those who cannot.  We have figures to show that on an annual basis 28% of the population are experiencing fuel poverty, which is a specific concern of mine.  Mention was made of 30% or 50% of the carbon tax being returned to them.  I would like the witnesses to comment on that.</p> <p>  Dr. Curtis spoke about people not taking up various schemes.  Organisations like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul would suggest that community energy advisers should be brought in immediately to lower socio-economic income areas to make those necessary savings.  Some local authorities have been proactive on that already.  Will the witnesses comment on that and how we can ensure that, in making the transition to a low carbon economy, it is fair and socially just?</p> <p>  I want to make two final points as I will not contribute again.  The witnesses spoke about retrofitting, and we hear about the skills and expertise that is needed.  Have they done an assessment as to whether that type of manpower is available?  I doubt that it is, particularly if our economy continues to grow at the current rate.</p> <p>  Mention was made by Dr. de Bruin from the ESRI that this would have a greater impact on rural areas than urban areas.  Has she examined the issue of the need to increase the rural transport system?</p> <p>  Last but not least, in the previous debates on this issue the sceptic in me asked where people will go with the electric cars after the cars' lifetime.  It is a simple question.  The reality is that the car will be clapped out.  There will be no competition.  If one buys a car from a particular dealer they will tell one to put it on a scrap heap.  The people I speak with who own a diesel or a petrol car and who are struggling will find it very difficult to make ends meet.  For anyone who bought a family car for &euro;18,000 or &euro;20,000 in recent years, there is no scrappage scheme that will compensate them in respect of that loss of revenue.  We need to cost this properly.</p> <p>  I smiled when Dr. de Bruin spoke about a technical study.  In terms of the language used in it, I have said previously that if we want to encourage people who do not understand the need to make these adjustments to understand it, we need to use less difficult language.</p> <p>  That brings me back to those who can afford to make these changes and those who cannot.  We need to speak to the ordinary people.</p><p>I mentioned energy advisers who could help people understand that they can make savings.  In the explanations given to date, I do not believe that message has got across to those who need to take corrective action.  The witnesses might comment on that.</p></speech>

On oil and diesel and what will happen once all the transport is electrified, the State will lose &euro;5 billion in revenue.  The Department of Finance has published a paper that is beginning to look at that.  It is an issue.  It will be a while before the revenue begins to fall off.  It will be only when we get the acceptance of electric cars.  That will be an issue.  In terms of climate proofing the budget, it sounds like a good idea to check what will be the effect of that.</p> <p>  On local authorities and people on low incomes, I believe the State owns more than 100,000 dwellings out of the 2 million local authority dwellings.  The State has the duty to upgrade them, not the tenant.  Kilkenny County Council did an interesting job on a local authority estate in Kilkenny a number of years ago.  Some of the local authority dwellings were privately owned but the council contracted with somebody to put external cladding on and do a job on the dwellings.  Those in the privately owned dwellings asked if they could pay and opt into the scheme.  I believe this is one of the pilot schemes that would work.  There were some problems with the scheme but that is the way to go.</p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about advisers.  It is not just people on low incomes.  I was talking to three people on very high incomes who do not know where to go for advice.  That is an issue, and that is the reason the Department is talking about ramping up and training.  The Deputy asked about the staffing available.  It is not available.  We have a building construction sector that is constrained.  The Department knows that.  That aspect of the plan needs to be spelled out but it is important that it is being realistic in that we need to do work to develop the supply side.</p> <p>  On the rural versus urban question, a very important paper was produced by Edgar Morgenroth and Richard Tol more than a decade ago.  The reason this falls more on rural Ireland than urban Ireland is because of commuters.  Barra Roantree had an interesting piece in his paper last week.  Farmers pottering around their local area do not clock up much kilometrage but commuters do.  The reason we need a carbon tax is to persuade the commuters to be early adopters of electric cars.  If they continue to drive a fossil fuel car in 2027, they will be paying a great deal of money for doing that but they will have the option then to drive an electric car to commute to and from work in Galway or Dublin and pay much less for doing so.  The rural versus urban issue is related to the commuting, not to the energy use of the household.  That is the reason the price needs to be ramped up.  It is to persuade commuters to move in this direction.</p> <p>  Also, the national planning framework calls for denser development.  In the future, we do not want more people commuting.  We will not change the pattern of people who are already commuting but we want denser development to ensure we do not have such numbers of people commuting.  One of the issues Deputy Boyd Barrett raised in terms of public transport is that it becomes effective when people live in an urban area.  For people travelling into Galway from all over the county, public transport is not an option.</p> <p>  The residual value of cars is certainly an issue.  We should remember that cars depreciate by 20% a year.  If a person pays &euro;20,000 for a car today, it will be worth &euro;16,000 next year and after three years it will be worth &euro;10,000.  By 2030, when we have to move away from driving fossil fuel cars, it will be worth nothing.  If a person is buying a car today, he or she needs to be mindful of the residual value of the car and whether that person should buy an electric car.  It is that uncertainty which will drive the early adoption of electric vehicles.  It will not be because the State will tell people to do it.  It will be because people will see the risk of buying a fossil fuel car in 2021, which could be worth nothing in 2027, and may opt to buy an electric one.  Those are the factors that will drive change.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the impact of diesel and petrol excise duties on revenue receipts.  The numbers I gave include that impact.  If we do not recycle the revenue and use it only to reduce the Government debt, the net impact will be negative.</p><p>If we recycle revenue, that decrease in excise duties will be compensated by an increase in other sales tax receipts and so the net impact will be positive.</p><p> On the issue of fuel poverty, Bercholz and Roantree looked specifically at fuel poverty and they found the ten-year increase in the carbon tax would increase fuel poverty by about 1%, but the redistribution scheme can compensate for that.</p></speech>

I already mentioned that the plan contains a new commitment on carbon-proofing Government memoranda and individual investment appraisals.  That should be strengthened as part of the public spending code the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is preparing at the moment.</p> <p>  Separately, I believe in last year's Budget Statement the Minister for Finance gave an undertaking to developing green budgeting as part of the budgetary framework into the future.  This year's Revised Estimates Volume contains an appendix relating to the individual subheads across Departments that are specifically related to climate action.  I understand the Department intends to develop that further in due course.</p> <p>  We acknowledge skills and retrofitting as an issue that needs to be tackled and has been addressed with specific actions under the plan.  There are a number of aspects, including the skills base required for retrofitting of buildings to what will be required in the future, which is a very deep level of retrofit considerably beyond what is being done.  The need to upskill the existing construction industry is recognised and there are specific commitments to develop accredited courses through the education and training boards to allow that to be done.  The upskilling required for the replacement of oil and gas boilers is also addressed in the plan.</p> <p>  The plan also contains a commitment on the development of a rural transport strategy for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></speech>

We have discussed some of the research with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Community energy advisers are not just needed for low-income households but right across the spectrum.  There is a lack of independent advice.  We are doing some work with colleagues.  People might think they need to replace their windows with double glazing or whatever, but if they had independent advice on what was best for their house, for the same money they might have had a better option.  From work we have done we have found households mostly rely on their neighbour, builder or plumber, but with new technology and materials they may not always be best informed.</p> <p>  SEAI has a number of grant schemes.  The names can be confusing and they apply to different levels of income.  The scheme with the biggest uptake is the Better Energy Homes scheme.  It offers a 30% to 35% grant on the cost.  That scheme essentially requires people to co-finance the remaining 65% to 70%.  In that sense, as a grant scheme it has been very positive, but many people who cannot afford that extra amount are excluded.</p></speech>

The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government began that process by implementing carbon tax in the first place.

The buses will be around for 20 years.  Based on the amount of damage they will do to the climate over that period and applying the public expenditure code, we would not be buying those kinds of buses.</p></speech>

That is the point the ESRI made.  Professor FitzGerald also made the pertinent point that it is regressive in its present format and that needs to be addressed in putting forward a policy or giving a pathway for its increase over the coming years.</p> <p>  Regarding the Department, I agree with Deputy Lisa Chambers that it is a lot of motherhood and apple pie.  I come from County Offaly which is Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB country.  In the 1930s and 1940s the Government of the day was advised to provide a mechanism by which jobs could be created in the region.  It was quite successful, thank God, and it provided up to 8,000 jobs at its peak in the 1980s.  However, at present it is accelerating its decarbonisation programme.  Its workforce has reduced to fewer than 1,000.  The public buys into it, strangely enough and thankfully for everybody's sake.  The workforce also buys into it.  The local authority has set up a transition forum with all relevant stakeholders to ensure the workforce is adequately trained and upskilled to provide alternatives.  However, we have not seen the same input, the same effort or the same cohesive and specific targeting of that region by Government.  For example, it did not even apply to the last Commission to include the peatlands regions in the EU coalmine transition fund.  That failure was recognised by me and another councillor when we went out there last year.  We now need to wait for a new Commission to be put in place for the Government to bring forward its application and ensure something is done in the future.</p> <p>  The public is interested and committed to buying into this.  However, they need to see the same commitment and buy-in from Government.  If they are making a commitment they need to know what they are getting in return.  The contents of the plan are so woolly and lacking in specifics that they cannot see what is in it.</p> <p>  Coming back to the remit of the committee and to my responsibility, I hope the Chairman will exclude the answers given to date in calculating those five minutes.</p></speech>

That is all the clarification I wanted.</p><p>It is very disappointing that there are no costings.  We have only come out of a phase whereby we have heard and seen that the children's hospital, within the national development plan, combined with the national broadband plan, add an extra &euro;2.5 billion to the national development plan.  We have been told by the Minister that the money will be come from future revenues yet the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council state that is not credible.  How credible is it now for this plan to be brought forward even though no proof has been given to us that the national development plan has been climate proofed?  The plan was published yesterday but it did not include costings.  The plan merely seems to be a reaction to the recent political competition, rather than a meaningful effort to inform the public that it will buy into this project with them, and help, assist and nudge them along.  How will people be nudged along?  Will people be given an incentive to ensure that the nudge is meaningful?</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that we have a plan and realise our views on parts of the plan may differ.</p> <p>  The Department very much backs this plan.  Today, however, on the Department's website there is a notice about applications to consent to conduct a survey for fossil fuel companies in the south west and one can see that there have been ten applications since last December.  Will the rhetoric in the plan be matched by action?  Will the Department change course and stop issuing licences for fossil fuel exploration?  We have just spent the last hour talking about how we need to electrify and decarbonise the environment and our transport fleet.  Has the Department changed its view of the legislation that seeks to end the practice of drilling for fossil fuels that is before this House?  Will the Department continue to oppose the legislation?  </p></speech>

There has been talk of price signals and all of the rest.  What signal do we send to an industry when we say we are open to receiving applications to drill for oil off our coast?  These are the same companies.  In fairness, Professor FitzGerald has accurately pointed out the level of economists who supported the carbon tax but they are also supported by BP, Shell, Exxon and all the major oil companies.  Indeed, the measure is supported in the United States because it focuses on that point.  What signal is conveyed when we say we are open to drilling for fossil fuels, while at the same time we put on paper the need to ask individuals?  This plan asks individuals to dig into their own pockets and invest in different motor vehicles or to upgrade their homes to do their bit for the environment when the Department overseeing the plan still says we are still open to drilling for fossil fuels?</p></speech>

I think pumping more oil is not part of the solution to climate change.  The one area where there would be a concern is that in the next 20 years, gas will be a significant part of the solution.</p><p>One example is compressed natural gas for heavy goods vehicles.  If one could, for the next 15 to 20 years, switch people in urban areas from using oil to using gas then that would be beneficial.  With electricity as the backup supply we will, hopefully, close peat and coal production but electricity production will be very dependent on gas.  A secure supply of gas is important if one could separate it from oil.  Pumping oil is not a solution for climate change and does the opposite.   </p></speech>

The ESRI, along with engineer colleagues in UCC and UCD, analysed the integration of more renewables and wind energy, and modelled out to 2050.  To keep the lights on through that period, and even with a move to net zero carbon, we will need fossil fuels, particularly gas.  We may have aspirations for electric vehicles and all the rest but we will rely on fossil fuels for quite a while to keep the economy going.</p></speech>

Can one say one can drill for gas but not for oil?  Gas has certain benefits but I cannot see that more oil will benefit climate change.  I should clarify that in terms of gas by 2050 there should be net zero emissions and the carbon dioxide produced by burning the gas should be pumped back into the ground, probably into the empty Kinsale gas field.  I do not know what the answer is.  I am not sure whether one can say one can drill for gas but not for oil.  If one cannot do so is one better saying drill for nothing?  I would want technical advice on that.  We have not considered the matter.</p></speech>

That sounds impressive but when one analyses the detail one soon discovers that the figure is only 5,000 more homes per year than was originally laid out in the national development plan.  Plus none of the homes, or very few of them, will be deep retrofitted because a B2 rating does not allow for this.</p> <p>  Is the project ambitious enough?  Will we need to provide additional incentives to individuals?  We hear stuff in the media.  People listening to this debate probably do not have a clue.  How much would it cost to retrofit a house in Donegal that was built in the early 1980s and bring it up to a B2 or A1 standard?  People are scared to do such work because they do not have the necessary money and do not see that supports are available.  The supports provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are great if one can afford a portion of the cost and is willing to wait for the savings over the medium and long term.  Many people cannot afford to do so.  Are additional supports required?    </p></speech>

I was a member of the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation in the last decade for four years and during my time the authority undertook two very interesting experiments.  One was conducted in Aughnacloy,  another was conducted where there had been a major massacre in the previous 20 years, and another one was in a Protestant village.  The authority discovered that if one said one wanted to offer the whole village one got much more acceptance whereas if one were a 70-year old, like myself, who lived up the side of a mountain in County Donegal, one would be scared of being burgled, done or whatever.  If one provides a scheme on a community basis one is more likely to get buy-in, particularly in rural areas.</p><p>As I said in Kilkenny, people do not know what is the right thing to do.  They may be willing to do the right thing.  The Northern Ireland Housing Executive which has a much larger local authority housing stock has experience of ramping up and I want to get some of its people down to talk to us about how to do that.  When I spoke to a person at the margins of a meeting, he said the lesson is that one goes in and offer the same for all houses, one does not differentiate.  I want to tease out this point.  Learning from what has happened elsewhere is the key.  In many cases we think we know the best way and we may do things more efficiently, but actually the Northern Ireland Housing Executive is an interesting example which we need to look at.  </p></speech>

The debate has opened up and there is a focus on the carbon tax.  Economists in America signed a letter about the "Green New Deal" to put the focus on carbon taxes, which is supported by also by the industry.  It is really a debate about whether we need to be investing and whether the State needs to play a larger role, such as rolling out deep retrofitting, more supports for energy-efficient cars, such as electric vehicles, public fleet or public infrastructure as opposed to just a market solution.</p> <p>  We need to meet these targets but the challenge, as I see it at this point, is that many people simply cannot simply do it.  The cost of retrofitting their homes even with State supports is way beyond their means.  The cost of buying an electric vehicle is way beyond their means and telling them that they will make so much savings in five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten years is not enough.</p> <p>  Microgeneration is an area where they can get some money to offset some of those costs.  Perhaps I can get the departmental officials to focus on the legislation that was drafted by Deputy Stanley two years ago.  It passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il but the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 is currently before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and is being obstructed on Committee Stage by the Government.  Yet we see this nice glossy report with no costings but a lot of ambition.  How do we take that at face value when there is an obstruction in place to block Bills that will do what some of the measures outlined?  Is there a change of heart to the Microgeneration Support Scheme Bill 2017 or will the Government continue to block it?  </p></speech>

My recollection is that the Minister accepted the broad principles of that Bill on Second Stage but there may have been differences of view on the details of the Bill.  The Minister has now come forward with a plan on how he proposes to implement a microgeneration framework in Ireland, which takes account of the need to have a framework that will reimburse householders for the export of excess electricity to the grid.  There are a number of design steps to work through in putting that in place, but the Minister is very ambitious to get that in place as soon as possible.</p> <p>  I cannot speak on the detail of the differences that the Minister might have with Deputy Stanley's Bill.</p></speech>

In order to help people change one needs to have a major range of other policies.  The State has a major role in this regard.  We are interested in possibly focusing first on local authority dwellings, where the State has the role.  How can one drive the development of capacity?  If one does it, there are multiple benefits.</p> <p>  There is an issue with infrastructure.  Somebody came to see me this morning from County Louth.  He drove from Dundalk to Dublin and the charger at the two service stations on the way down were broken.  He just got to Dublin and found somewhere to charge his car.  It is the responsibility of the State and the regulatory authorities to ensure the roll-out of the infrastructure.</p><p>The infrastructure must be rolled out in advance.  I am not going to buy an electric car unless I know I can get to Kilcrohane, which is as far as one can drive in Ireland, and charge my car.  Kilcrohane is even further away than Donegal.  The State has the responsibility to make it possible by putting in place the infrastructure.  Of course, one has to get the price right but that is only the beginning.  We need research.  In terms of retrofitting dwellings, we need to know what will work for people.</p><p> Another area which is important is getting the incentives right for the State itself.  One of my colleagues in the ESRI, Ms Sue Scott did an interesting study in 2003, looking at energy efficiency in the third level and university sectors.  Universities had done a reasonable job because they had built a combined heat and power plant because they knew they could get the money back over five years.  The institutes of technology were useless - not because they were useless - but because the Department stated that unless one could get the money back within one year, one cannot do it.  That was the level of control.  The headmaster - who died unfortunately in the past six months - of the school that my children went to 20 years ago, knew I was interested in this and sent me the electricity bills for the school and he showed he had managed to halve the bills but the point for him was that he managed to hide the money from the Department of Education.  As he was a woodwork teacher, he used the money to make furniture for the school, which he could not afford to buy.</p></speech>

I am really disappointed that Deputy Cowen has had to leave, because in his broad political point-scoring contribution, where he did not ask any questions, I was struck by the fact that different people can look at the same plan and see different things.  Deputy Cowen saw a political reaction to recent elections, while Friends of the Irish Environment have called it the biggest innovation in climate policy in 20 years.  Who does one believe?  I was struck by one of the points made earlier that one of the reason we are close to the 2020 targets was because of the recession between when they were set in 2005 and now.  I suppose Fianna F&aacute;il's contribution to climate change was to crash the economy, quadruple the national debt and cause a recession.  Just as Fine Gael fixed the massive job losses of that recession, going from 16% to 5% through the Action Plan for Jobs, that is exactly the approach that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, now plans to take in a detailed way through this plan, with 183 actions and a quarterly report.</p> <p>  I will not duplicate the questions that were asked earlier.  We have a generous regime of taxation incentives to promote the uptake of electric vehicles with VRT relief and the BIK regime and that.  Do the witnesses think they are set at the right level or do the rates of taxation incentives for electric vehicles need to be looked at?  In regard to VRT and motor tax on private cars, which has been calculated on the basis of CO2 emissions, with higher emissions attracting a higher tax liability, how do they suggest that should be changed to better impact climate action into the future?</p></speech>

One of the conclusions in the research reports is that the grant scheme should in essence be changed.  We provide grants at present for retrofits on the inputs, for the goods we buy and put into the house and not the outcomes.  In a sense the grant should be switched over, so that one gets a grant for how much energy savings or emissions savings one gets, not how much stuff you buy.  That refers back to my earlier comments that without the best advice, people were doing the best they could.  They were changing the windows when perhaps they should have been upgrading the envelope and so on.  However, if one was getting the grant based on the improvement in the outcome, one would force oneself not to make a mistake and to go and get independent advice.  That is one area where we could do better on the incentives.</p></speech>

What is affecting take-up of electric vehicles is, first, the question of whether they will have the necessary range and, second, whether they are cheaper than standard vehicles.  Given that the price is falling all the time and the range is improving, the next consideration is whether the infrastructure is in place to make it work.  If we put more incentives in place but the cars cannot be charged, we are going nowhere.  The next priority, therefore, is getting the infrastructure rolled out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2019061800002#Z00200"><p>We consider the incentives in place for electric vehicles to be quite generous.  In recent years, we broadened the incentives and made them more generous.  For instance, drivers of battery electric vehicles gets a 50% discount on tolls, there are incentives for taxis, and so on.  The other key measure we introduced is a grant for home charging.  In addition, the climate action fund is supporting rapid charging, and the climate action plan sets out the need to support local authorities with the provision of on-street charging.  In the coming years, the focus may shift towards infrastructure as opposed to incentives for the purchase of vehicles.  I echo Professor Fitzgerald's point that there are factors we can control and factors we cannot control.  In terms of the supply of vehicles, both the price point and the range are factors we cannot necessarily control.  The good news is that we are seeing longer-range vehicles and a reduction in prices.  All these factors coming together is very positive, but we absolutely accept that infrastructure must be a key priority for us.</p></speech>

Much of the investment that has to take place in the next decade will be private sector investment, including in respect of retrofitting, vehicle purchasing etc.  We are talking about hundreds of thousands of consumer decisions which the plan, through its various actions, will try to influence.  The broad balance between Exchequer investment and private investment is, as I said earlier, a question for policy design.  To come back to the exchange of questions around the electric vehicle incentives, we have a broad set of incentives which are appropriately structured for where things are in terms of the price of the vehicles.  As that price comes down over time, the way in which the Exchequer intervenes may also change, as my colleague mentioned.  That balance between the Exchequer component and the private component of the intervention must be carefully managed in the coming decade and further into the future to ensure we achieve the targets contained in the action plan.  It is not a matter of saying, right now, that for the next 11 years, the balance between private and State investment will be X% and will not change.  The balance will necessarily adjust over time.</p></speech>

We have been having a debate on agriculture in this committee and outside it.  We are an agricultural country, so it makes sense that we have higher agricultural emissions than countries without a large agricultural sector.  Given that our agricultural sector is fairly efficient, one of the arguments being put forward is that if we reduce agricultural production in this country, the food will have to be produced elsewhere and perhaps less efficiently.  What is the witnesses' view of that argument?</p> <p>  A related hot topic concerns the extraction of oil and gas.  Again, the same type of counter-argument arises in respect of the country's energy security.  If we are still dependent on those fuels to keep the lights on, what is the witnesses' view on our becoming reliant on another country to meet that demand and our having to import the fuels, which generates more emissions via transportation?</p></speech>

In our annual review report, to be published next month, we are including a chapter concentrating on agriculture.  Teagasc has put forward a range of measures in this area.  It is our view that we could increase farm incomes and the security of those incomes if farmers producing cattle moved to using the land in other ways.  The beef price in the EU currently is some 30% above the non-EU price.  Beef farmers are highly vulnerable to what happens with Brexit.  The numbers are already falling and a reduction in cattle numbers would be part of that.  We will go into those issues in detail in our report next month.</p> <p>  On energy security, I do not agree, as I said to Deputy Doherty, that there is a security argument for pumping more oil offshore.  There may be such an argument in the case of gas, but I would want to examine that because I am not sure we can segment the two.</p></speech>

As the Deputy probably knows, this has been looked at by the tax strategy group for the past number of years.  It is almost a standing issue on the agenda of the group.  It is subject to political decision, as Deputy Doherty knows, in each year's budget.  It must also be seen in the context of the wider issue of rebalancing the entire taxation regime to seek to promote electric vehicles as against either petrol or diesel vehicles.  Each of these proposals or issues cannot be taken in isolation.  The issue for the Department of Finance will be to find the best balance that addresses the issue of revenue protection while also addressing the objectives we are trying to achieve through the plan, which are to promote behaviour and investment decisions that are going in the right direction from a climate point of view.</p></speech>

It was a major point of discussion for the sector in the run-up to the latest budget because there was an anticipation that the Government would equalise diesel and petrol excise rates or increase carbon tax, or, indeed, do both.  That would have had an impact on the haulage sector.  My question is whether the diesel rebate should continue and, in the view of the witnesses, whether it would need to be modified, that is, increased to support the haulage fleet.</p></speech>

There is nothing to prevent Professor FitzGerald or the ESRI commenting on it but my understanding of the rules by which this committee operates is that departmental officials do not comment on policy.

It is something that we have been considering in terms of how to compensate the haulage sector without getting rid of the incentive to decarbonise.  The problem with the diesel rebate scheme is that participants get money back when they spend it on diesel.  It, therefore, has the opposite effect of the carbon tax.  We investigated the possibility of not increasing the rebate and giving a production tax reduction to the haulage sector instead to compensate for the increase in carbon tax.  If we do that, we can still get emission reductions in the sector while also compensating it for its carbon tax losses.  As has been pointed out, this is a policy question.  It is important, when considering this problem, to bear in mind that we want to reduce emissions with this increased carbon tax and compensating the haulage sector should not compromise that, if possible.</p></speech>

However, a refuelling infrastructure is still needed.  The Deputy's question relates to climate policy in the longer term but, in the short term, most truckers will not have an alternative so they will be forced to pay more.  In the longer term, if they are going to use gas or biogas, higher fuel costs might force them to seek out more fuel efficient or carbon efficient vehicles.  In the short term, however, the Deputy is correct that there are no alternatives available.</p></speech>

A network of 14 publicly accessible compressed natural gas stations is being rolled out.  The first one has opened in Dublin Port.  That provides an option for HGV drivers.  A commitment has been made by Gas Networks Ireland to roll out a network of 14 stations.</p> <p>  The other point to which Mr. Curtis alluded is that even though gas is a fossil fuel, in future there is the possibility of biogas being produced from anaerobic digestion using food and agriculture waste, injected onto the grid and then used in trucks.  In many ways the biofuels obligation that we have for petrol could fund that.  It is set out in the plan and we will consult on it in the third quarter.</p></speech>

Dr. FitzGerald referred to incentives earlier and we have advocated an increase in incentives in this area.  What do we have at the moment?  There are approximately 4,000 electric cars on our roads.  Many people want to do the right thing but there are challenges in respect of the infrastructure, certainty and so on.  Despite those challenges, people are still purchasing and investing.  Not everyone is doing long commutes and so on but these cars are beyond the means of lots of people who want to do the right thing.  It was suggested that the current incentives are appropriately priced but given the target we need to reach within ten years, would it be appropriate to increase the bands that are available?  The upper limit of the bands under SEAI is &euro;5,000 for a car.  The technology is changing, particularly in terms of the range issue which worries lots of people.  Next year, the range will be greater and so on but &euro;5,000 for a car that costs &euro;35,000 or &euro;40,000 is not a major support.</p></speech>

My next one will definitely be electric, although I hope the hybrid will last.  The technology is changing so rapidly that my judgment is, although this is not something that the council has considered, that we should keep the incentives where they are and, within two or three years, it will become the cheaper option for people.</p><p>My other concern is we will increase the incentives when there are problems in getting cars.</p></speech>

It may be the cheaper option for those who are buying new, but there is a large cohort - the majority - who will never be able to buy and who have never bought a new car because they cannot afford one.  They will always buy a second-hand car.  Then there are issues with electric vehicles that are being sold on and the supports available in that regard.  I am focused on those who want to do the right thing.</p></speech>

As I have always bought second-hand cars, I can see that it would be interesting to see whether we could speed up the adoption of second-hand cars in some way.  There is another issue.  If we increase the incentives now, it is difficult to lay our hands on one or two models that are popular.  If the supply is fixed, the money will go either to the distributor or the manufacturer.  This will be an issue at European level.  Will the ramping up of production of electric cars happen sufficiently rapidly or will it simply increase the margin?  For that reason, I am nervous about increasing the incentives.  The issue the Deputy is raising of second-hand cars is interesting and merits further consideration.</p></speech>

This year we have had over 2,600 new and approximately 1,200 used electric vehicles imported and licensed in the country.  There is a &euro;5,000 grant for the private purchase of a new vehicle, but there is also vehicle registration tax relief of &euro;5,000 that applies to new and second-hand imports.  Therefore, the fleet is growing.  They are battery and plug-in hybrid vehicles.</p></speech>

It is still only a small fraction of the figure of 2.7 million vehicles  I know that it is moving in the right direction, but are there additional incentives for those who will only buy second-hand models?  They will never be able to afford to pay &euro;20,000 or &euro;22,000 for a new car, even with a grant of &euro;5,000.  Even that figure is at the lower end, never mind the higher end cost of an electric vehicle.</p></speech>

It is not clear that additional incentives would lead to a significant uptake in the short term.  There could be an element of deadweight loss.  There are waiting lists for cars.  Countries are competing for the limited worldwide supply of electric vehicles.  It will be in the middle part of the next decade when price parity will increase the range and supply.  That is being viewed as the key point of inflection.</p></speech>

My general point is about the comments made in my absence.  The point was made that much of this would come from private sector investment.  That is fine and it will involve individual loans and so on.  However, there is an absence of detail.  The document before me includes no costings.  We know about the concept of the new green deal where the State views it as an emergency and there is much talk about what will happen if we miss our 2020 targets.  We know that at current levels the cost will be &euro;1.7 billion if we miss our 2030 targets.  We also know that the cost of credit is likely to increase.  That puts a financial figure on it, as opposed to the cost to the environment and our planet.</p> <p>  What is missing is the ambition of the State.  It needs to state we have an issue and that we will roll out retrofitting to every public authority house.  What is also missing is real public transport.  I cannot take a train from County Donegal to Dublin.  The last time a train ran to County Donegal was in 1963.  Let us consider the provision of public transport.  If it was not for private operators, we would not be able to get from A to B without reliance on a car.  These challenges are not laid out in the plan.  The fact is there are no costings and that we are going to leave it to each Department to put forward proposals in the Estimates every year.  That is not the right way to do it.  We should put a cost on it and acknowledge the size and scale of the problem.</p></speech>

My last question relates to carbon taxes.  My question is addressed to Professor FitzGerald.  I understand the issue of taxes.  One is to raise revenue and the other is to change behaviour.  If we want to change behaviour we need to have the option.  That is why we argued for the levy on sugar-sweetened drinks to be at a level that would change behaviour.  I have several questions.  The first is that the trajectory set out in respect of the report is for carbon taxes to increase to &euro;80 per tonne over a ten-year period.  That would allow for a &euro;6 increase per annum.  The Climate Change Advisory Council has called for a &euro;15 increase this year.  Does the council believe we need to have sharp rises to change behaviour?</p> <p>  The second point is the &euro;20 per tonne levy already brings in approximately &euro;486 million.  Is the money in the pot to be redistributed under the hypothecation model to those who want to invest themselves or to help those on low incomes, as the ESRI has pointed out?</p> <p>  Third, I subscribe to many of the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  There is an issue of justice.  People need to buy in to not only this part but to every part of the plan and other plans.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposals, like Powering Ireland 2030, which are far more ambitious than what the Government has in terms of renewable energy.  It proposes a level of 80% rather than 70%.  Other proposals need to feed into this mix.  Where is the equivalent carbon tax increases on the big polluters and on industry?</p> <p>  The last question I have is for Professor FitzGerald in particular.  Can he explain the impact in Sweden, which has the highest carbon tax in the world at &euro;120 per tonne?  Sweden introduced that in 1991.  Yet, Sweden has only 0.6% of electric vehicles on the roads.  While there are high levels of renewable energy, most is hydro-powered energy and that has been in place for decades.  There is high reliance on nuclear energy.  The figure is 40%.  If we want to move people or, as the Government has put it, nudge people along the road, how come high carbon taxes have not resulted in more electric vehicles in Sweden?</p></speech>

That is for the Oireachtas committee to determine.  We will suggest &euro;35 per tonne to suggest the urgency that we have missed out.  However, it may well be that sharp rises would be less acceptable.  Provided there is a trajectory laid out by the Oireachtas for the future, it should have an impact.  If it was &euro;6 per tonne every year, and that was agreed by the Oireachtas with reasonable certainty that it would happen in future, then that is fine.

I think it probably would be a good idea to put it all together rather than simply state it refers to the increase, because that is too complicated to explain to people.  If I was the Minister, I would indicate the full amount of revenue and attribute some of the increases in social welfare to it.  I would handle it in that way.  That is an issue for the political system rather than for the council, but it could be a good option.</p> <p>  Industry is important.  In Ireland 8% of emissions comes from manufacturing.  If we add in the electricity consumed, it takes us to a figure of approximately 15%.  People talk about taxing industry but one third of emissions come from agriculture and 15% of emissions come from households.  The bulk of transport emissions come from households.  If we are going to change, it is a question of "We, the people of Ireland".  However, in terms of industry, the council has been concerned about the incentives for industry.  The bulk of industrial emissions are handled within the EU emissions trading scheme.  The EU ETS has produced a price that is too low.</p><p>The French Government proposed a carbon price floor which would guarantee a high and rising price, in the absence of the EU emissions trading scheme, ETS, working.  Interestingly, the British are the leaders in this and have already done it.  Last year the French invited the Dutch and the British Governments to join a coalition in north-western Europe with Germany in doing it.  We advocated the Irish Government joining this potential coalition.  It is unlikely to happen unless the German Government buys into it.  If it does, and we published research in November on why it would be a good idea, it would drive out coal not just here - we are going to close our coal operations anyway - but in north-western Europe.  It is already closing coal in Britain.  It would be better if the EU's ETS worked better than it does currently because for the rest of industry which is covered by it, the incentives are not high enough to make them change.  The problem is that this is not something which is in the remit of the Irish Government.  However, the Irish Government has been advocating a much tighter approach at European level.  One problem is the fact that the Polish Government is totally opposed to it because of coal mining in that country.  The German Government has not bought into the French idea on a carbon price floor so far but the recent election and the changes in the political composition in Germany could see a change.  If Germany changes, Ireland should join the coalition, which would raise the price of electricity.  The modelling which we have done shows that it would not have a dramatic effect on consumers but it would affect the industrial sector.  The industrial sector, that is, big firms are not paying enough and the price should rise.  There is a mechanism available to raise the price for some of them but it is up to the EU ETS to raise it for all of them.  Even if that happened, the vast bulk of emissions are the responsibility of the people of Ireland, including farmers, householders and so on.</p></speech>

Even with a high carbon price and the price of cars coming down so rapidly, it still is not yet time, even in Sweden.  Sweden is interesting.  There is nuclear power in Sweden.  It has nuclear power and for 20 years has been fully integrated with Norway and Jutland, the main part of Denmark.  One of the reasons Denmark has been able to have so much wind power is that it is fully interconnected with Norway.  If the wind drops in Denmark, five seconds later, water is released from a dam in Norway.  Scandinavia, because it has a lot of hydro power and an integrated system, can make much better use of energy and deploy more renewables.  In the case of Ireland, with a target of 70% renewable electricity by 2030, we will need an interconnector to France but even that may not be enough.  Research done on this previously suggested that we will need a lot more interconnection with continental Europe.  It would be cheaper to interconnect with the UK but for obvious reasons, it is not the most reliable partner at the moment.  The tradition in Europe is that the costs of interconnection are shared between the two parties which is relevant in the context of an interconnector with France.  In terms of our interconnection with Northern Ireland and Great Britain, Irish consumers paid but British consumers paid nothing.

Second, ethanol is extremely popular in private vehicles in Sweden.  That is one of the main contributors to the slower than expected uptake.  Furthermore, the distances that Swedish people drive, on average, are much higher than in smaller countries like Ireland.  The uptake in recent years has increased tremendously in Sweden because the ranges of the electric vehicles have improved.  If one is looking at electric vehicle uptake in Sweden <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the carbon tax, one must look at the most recent years when the uptake has been much higher.</p><p>The reason for the delay was that people were using ethanol-powered vehicles in the interim.</p></speech>

In that sense, paying for carbon credits to deal with our failure to meet targets is retarding the global effort to reduce emissions.  Is that not a reasonable description of what we are doing?  In that sense, it is pretty shameful from the global perspective of addressing climate change.</p> <p>  I am also curious about a Government decision about which the departmental witnesses may not be able to say much; perhaps the ESRI representatives might be able to say more.  I am shocked at the Government's response - I had to run over to the D&aacute;il to repeat this point to the Taoiseach - to the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 sponsored by People Before Profit which seeks to keep fossil fuels in the ground.  Scientists are saying that 80% of known reserves must stay in the ground if we are going to address the climate emergency.  They refer to "known reserves", never mind exploring for more.  They do not limit this to oil either.  They are talking about known fossil fuel reserves, 80% of which must stay in the ground.  The logic of that is that one does not go looking for more fossil fuels and one does not facilitate that search.  The Taoiseach's response, in opposing that Bill, was to say that it will not make any difference to emissions.  That is a bizarre statement, given what the scientists are saying.  The Taoiseach said that it will not make any difference to emissions if we keep fossil fuels in the ground.  They cannot both be right.  Is it not obvious that if we allow exploration for fossil fuels and they are found, then more fossil fuels will be burned, more emissions will go into the environment and more damage will be done?  It does not really matter much whether the fuel is gas or oil.  Indeed, I would question the positioning of gas as a transition fuel.  The process of producing fracked gas, in particular, also produces a lot of methane.  Taken in the round, fracked gas is as damaging to the atmosphere and to efforts to deal with climate change as oil.  Surely, paying for and establishing the infrastructure to facilitate gas as a so-called transition fuel is investment that could be going elsewhere.  There is an opportunity cost involved in investing in infrastructure for gas and not investing in our universities to develop renewable energy technologies, for example.  One comes at the expense of the other.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Deputy said it but it is clearly a fossil gas and not a transition fuel in its own right.  The idea of gas being a transition fuel is based on a comparison with using oil or coal, which have higher emissions.  If one switches to gas, one is still using a fossil fuel but one is producing less emissions.  In the longer term, as my colleagues in the Department said, one builds biogas infrastructure and produce biomethane through taking agricultural and food waste, digesting that to produce biogas and upgrading it to the equivalent of natural gas.  Then one has a net zero-emission fuel.</p> <p>  The Deputy's opening point was that the carbon tax allows one to pay to pollute.</p></speech>

However, that policy, as Professor FitzGerald stated, has not been successful.  The idea of that envelop of carbon credits has been diminishing and is diminishing further .  It was like our proposal for the carbon tax, which was to give a long-term vision of when the credits would decline.  In other words, a series of increases in carbon tax are announced in order to allow households to adjust behaviour.  In addition, it is also announced that carbon credits for industry are going to decrease.  The idea was to encourage companies to operate in a less carbon-intensive way.</p></speech>

The United Kingdom is upping the ante by stating that it will reach net zero by 2050, but that will involve gas-fired generation and pumping the emissions back into the ground.  One could not do that with oil because one will not collect the emissions from the exhaust of a lorry or car and pump them into the ground.  Gas is a transitional fuel.  The Deputy made that point that we do not want to invest in this.  In the context of the transition, people should be investing in heat put rather than gas boilers.  Investing in a gas boiler is not the way to go, it is a waste of money.  In terms of electricity generation, it may well be that we will still have significant gas-fired generation in 2050 but that we will achieve net zero emissions by pumping the gas back into the ground.  Some gas may well be part of the solution.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had a clashing engagement at the start of the meeting today and that is why I could not be present.  I thank Deputy Lahart, who took the chair for the opening part of the meeting.</p> <p>  To follow up on what Professor FitzGerald stated, if the logic is that natural gas will be used in years to come and that emissions will be pumped back into the ground, then there is obviously a benefit to the country in having a natural gas supply, particularly if we are going to use it and can capture emissions by means of the process he outlined.  There would obviously be a major cost to us if we had to bring that gas from somewhere else.  Effectively, continuing to allow gas exploration is a plus-plus situation.</p></speech>

If we do our job in the context of decarbonising, then the level of gas consumption in 2040 or 2050 will be much lower than it is today.  Dr. Curtis is the expert in this area.  There would be more biogas.  Therefore, some of it will be renewable in that sense.  Still, the amount of gas involved, if it is much less than we are talking about today, and with a European market where there are many different sources, would be bought at a rather similar price by importing.  However, the security of supply in having our own source would be beneficial if we were to continue to consume gas.  We are probably talking about less gas than we are using today.  There is an advantage but in terms of the overall benefits of spending a lot of money on going looking for it off the west coast, I would want to consider that.</p></speech>

On the basis of known technologies today, we would be anxious for the Department to lay out the trajectories to 2050 to do what the British and the Danes have done.  It is highly likely that if one does so - I refer to the work done by University College Cork on this - a significant part of the solution to getting to 2050 will be gas fired.  If one gets to 70% renewables, one will still need 30%.  Where one pumps the gas emissions back into the ground, it will be expensive to do so.  However, there is research being done on this.  We have an empty Kinsale oil field and a pipe that goes out to it so that the possibilities of doing so are there.  This is work in progress in terms of research but it is highly likely, on the basis of current known technologies, that part of our solution will be a limited amount of electricity from gas with carbon capture and storage.</p></speech>

Considering Gas Networks has 600,000 households on its network, if one wants all those households to install heat pumps, one has to get 600,000 decisions of individual households to upgrade.  However, if one can switch the natural gas over to biogas, although we may not have the capacity for 100% substitution for natural gas, it is essentially a corporate decision by Ireland Inc to produce more biogas and put it into the network.  One does not need to have all those 600,000 households make that active decision and put their hand in their pocket.  If it were entirely biogas, it would produce zero emissions but it is too ambitious at this stage to talk about that.  We have not the capacity in terms of waste, anaerobic digestion and all the feed stocks to go to 100% biogas in the future but there is an opportunity in that regard.  In the case of households, we have spoken here about such matters as EVs and retrofits and so on.  It is individual households that must make all these changes together.  There are many such decisions.  The number of individual decisions is up in the millions.  That is one where one can hopefully make a corporate decision that might get rid of several hundred thousand individual decisions by households.</p></speech>

There is always a benefit then, if they improve the efficiency of the house, from them using less of that biogas and it could go further.  Someone from the Department might be able to say, but I think SEAI has done some assessments of the potential feedstocks that are available to produce biogas.  It could be 15% or 25%.  It is not an entirety.  However, there is much going on, particularly in UCC, looking at opportunities to produce biogas, whether from algae or the sea, or on-source woody biomass.  A big opportunity - we spoke briefly about agriculture - is where we may produce low-carbon intensity beef and milk but over half the beef sector is unprofitable.  We may be producing low-intensity beef but farmers are not making money out of it.  However, the grass they produce to help grow cattle could potentially be a feedstock also to produce biogas.</p></speech>

In terms of the way that gas would go into the network and who would pay for it, there is a cost differential.  Producing biogas is more expensive than fossil fuel gas.  That is set out in the plan.  We want to set a target for it.  We have not set a specific target yet because there is more work to do on it, but it is looking at how that could be funded.  There are a number of ways that could be done.  One way would be an Exchequer fund for injection into the gas grid.  Another would be similar to renewable electricity, namely, some sort of public service obligation, PSO, levy.  An interesting one would be something similar to the biofuels obligation scheme.  Even though we all fill our cars with fossil fuel at the moment, we are not selecting a biofuel or a fossil fuel handle.  Approximately 5% of the fuel in both petrol and diesel cars is biofuel and it is placed as an obligation on the suppliers.  That takes from the point Dr. Curtis was making about consumer choice.  We are not asking drivers to pick the biofuel or the fossil fuel handle.  It is an obligation on fuel suppliers.  Biogas has been successful in a number of countries but it is a question of how we would support it and increase that biogas into the network.</p> <p>  In terms of the level that could be reached, in the draft national energy and climate plan a level of around 3% of the heat usage in the country was flagged.  Gas Networks Ireland is talking about levels of 20% or 30%.  There is a good deal of potential in this area, and Ireland has one of the highest potentials for biogas because of our agricultural sector in particular.  However, in terms of how we would fund that and put it through, that work needs to be done over the next period.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to allow me contribute.  I published a paper on biogas almost two years ago in which we examined what was happening in other countries.  The driver behind that was the need for climate action, but what was also in mind was our very large agricultural sector.  We are an agricultural country, which is fine, but we have a serious issue with agricultural waste.  We are not long back from the EU having pleaded for another derogation on slurry spreading because we are churning it out by the megaton.  That is having other environmental consequences in terms of rivers, water quality and so on.</p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald might deal with this question.  We have only one plant in the State that injects biogas into the grid.  As far as I know it started doing that recently.  It was just about to do it the last time I visited the plant, which is more than a year ago.  That is pumping into the town of Athy.  The injection point is where the Cush Inn used to be, in Kildangan.  On the one hand we have this serious problem with agricultural waste.  We have a substantial beef industry which produces a very large amount of waste.  We have a substantial hospitality industry which produces a very large amount of food waste.  If one stands in the plant in Nurney and looks at what is going in, it is all that type of waste.  There are many odours in the area also because there is a pig farm adjoining it but there are not many odours around the plant.  There are more than 6,000 of those plants in Germany.  We are not Germany but we are a big agricultural producer for a country of our size.</p> <p>  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, published a paper, Powering Ireland 2030, last year.  We tried to get the media to take some interest in it but I am afraid we were unsuccessful.  Something more important was happening on the day.  In that paper we stated that 10% of our energy needs could come from biogas.  Mr. Brady referred to 20%, which may be possible over a longer term.</p> <p>  We also have the problem with farm incomes.  In northern Italy, farmers have a milk or a beef income but they also have an income from slurry because they are joined together in co-operatives and the slurry is being dried.  Rather than having huge tank loads of wet slurry going out and destroying land and land drainage pipes in the middle of winter, and anybody who knows anything about farming will know about that, they simply spread dry fertiliser.</p><p>They use the anaerobic digestion process in the plant to dry the slurry and pellet it, and it is then sold.  They are selling gas and fertiliser and they continue to sell their beef, dairy or whatever.</p><p> We have a major problem with farm incomes.  If we did not subsidise them, most farmers would go out of business.  They cannot survive without the single farm payment and the other range of subsidies.</p></speech>

I previously worked with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and one of my work projects was to try to encourage anaerobic digestion for all the areas the Deputy spoke about such as emissions capture, water quality improvements, dealing with waste from the food sector and so on.</p> <p>  The Department has stated that the cost of producing this biogas is more than the cost of fossil fuel at present.  If a plant is set up, the cost recovery for profit is not there.  Something needs to drive it to make it more cost competitive.  One way to do that is through a carbon tax, when the profitability of these plants, versus natural gas production, will improve.</p> <p>  In terms of the sector, I mentioned earlier that farmers in beef production regard it as a vocation.  They do not want to move away from what they do but, on average, beef farmers are producing beef at a loss.  It is a matter of trying to encourage them to diversify their activities.  It is not to stop beef farming but to move into diversification by being energy producers as well.  The skeleton in the closet, so to speak, is that 30% of emissions are from agriculture.  The real pinch on that sector may come when they have to try to reduce that, but that is a matter for another day.</p></speech>

First, the support scheme for renewable heat, the second phase of which opened for applications earlier this month, supports the use of slurry or food waste in anaerobic digestion and the combustion of that gas to produce heat.  If a pig or poultry farmer has this waste he or she can put it in an anaerobic digester and combust that gas to use for heat for his or her own use.  That is supported under the support scheme for renewable heat.</p> <p>  The second route to market is taking that biogas, cleaning it, upgrading it and putting it into the natural gas grid.  That is what we call biomethane.  We see two main pathways to that.  The first is where it is used in transport.  It is similar to the biofuels obligation.  We are consulting on this in quarter 3; it is set out in the plan.  For instance, compressed natural gas, CNG, trucks, which I mentioned earlier in response to Deputy Pearse Doherty, running on biogas can essentially fulfil a requirement under the renewable energy directive and that cost is socialised across all of transport.  In many ways that is one route to market.</p> <p>  The other route is the heat sector.  The key challenge in the heat sector is that this gas is more expensive than natural gas.  Natural gas might be 2.5 cent at the wholesale rate, whereas biogas might be three times that.  Most consumers would not choose to move to that so the question is how we bridge that gap.</p><p>We also need to answer the question of whether it is a role for the Exchequer.  That would involve a large cost over a long period.  Is it something that could be fulfilled by a public service obligation, similar to what happens in the electricity sector where we see use of the letters "PSO" on our electricity bills?  Could it be considered to be an obligation similar to the biofuels obligation but in the heat sector?  This has not been decided, but they are the different funding areas.  To be very clear, the barriers to using bio-methane and injecting supplies into the grid are the cost differential and how the cost would be funded, which is key.</p></speech>

We originally intended to undertake stakeholder engagement on this Bill in November 2018 and sought written submissions at that point.  However, as formal consideration was then commenced by Seanad &Eacute;ireann it was not possible to do it at that point.  We therefore agreed to write back to those who had made written submissions asking for updated submissions.  I thank our witnesses for those submissions.</p><p>Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is very important.  It provides services to 582 providers including 441 further education and training providers, 52 higher education and training groups and 89 English language training providers.  I do not underestimate the importance of the work we have to do.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the witnesses.  They are: Dr. Jim Murray, director of academic affairs and deputy CEO of the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA; Mr. Lewis Purser, director of learning at the Irish Universities Association, IUA; Dr. Attracta Halpin, registrar of the National University of Ireland; Ms Tara Farrell, chairperson of AONTAS; Mr. Chris Anako, manager of Study and Protect; Mr. David Russell, chairman of the Progressive College Network; Ms Colette Godkin, secretary of Unite the Union; Mr. John Connaughton, training services manager for Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM; Dr. Bryan Maguire from QQI; Mr. William Beausang, head of higher and further education and training policy at the Department of Education and Skills; and Mr. Patrick King, who is the mediator to the English language sector with the Department of Education and Skills.  They are all very welcome. </p><p>The format of this part of the meeting will be as follows.  I will invite witnesses to make a brief opening statement lasting a maximum of three minutes.  I ask the witnesses to respect that limit because nine groups are represented here.  This will be followed by engagement with the members of the committee.  Members should bear in mind that to facilitate the progress of this legislation Committee Stage debates will take place a fortnight from today. </p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I also advise the witnesses that any opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p></speech>

As indicated in its submissions of 5 October 2018 and 31 May 2019, THEA is supportive of the broad thrust of the legislation in two key respects.  First, it holds out the prospect of strengthening the national quality assurance and qualifications systems in education and training by addressing a number of issues that have been identified as impeding QQI in fulfilling its intended statutory role.  This is important to guaranteeing a quality experience for all learners across further education and training and higher education and training; clarifying and strengthening aspects of the operation of the National Framework of Qualifications; and ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a favoured destination for international students is protected and enhanced.</p> <p>  Second, the Bill provides for the granting of award-making powers, excepting doctoral awards, to all of the institutes of technology.</p><p>In so doing, together with the recently enacted legislation on the establishment of technological universities, it will put all of the institutes on a more equal footing with the designated awarding bodies and create a more coherent quality assurance and qualifications space among all public higher education institutions.  </p><p> On the strengthening of the national quality assurance and qualifications systems, they are largely provided for in section 23 of the Bill which amends section 55 of the principal Act by the insertion of nine new sections, sections 55A to 55I, inclusive.  The new sections represent the most complex changes to the principal Act and set out the processes whereby awards acquire the status of being included in the national framework of qualifications, NFQ.  Since THEA&rsquo;s initial submission to the joint committee last October, a number of changes have been made to the nine new sections, one effect of which is that the public higher education institutions, whether they are designated as awarding bodies or providers to which QQI has awarded delegated authority, will not now undergo the same process for the inclusion of their awards as the new category of awarding bodies provided for in the Bill, the so-called listed awarding bodies.  THEA welcomes this change, as it recognises and acknowledges the fact that the awards of the public higher education providers have been in the national framework of qualifications since its establishment in 2003-04.  THEA also notes that the Bill provides for a new, formal procedure whereby designated awarding bodies will make more transparent how they determine the levels at which their awards are included in the national framework of qualifications and how this information is communicated to and ratified by QQI, the custodian of the framework.  In principle, THEA does not object to the introduction of this transparency mechanism, but it argues that it should be integrated as far as possible into the existing quality assurance infrastructure overseen by QQI and that it should not lead to the introduction of a new and onerous bureaucratic process.  In that regard, THEA is committed to working with QQI and our fellow public providers in order that the new statutory provision will be given appropriate effect in the implementation phase. </p><p> Apart from the changes mentioned, THEA notes the introduction of a new section, section 37, which provides the authorisation for an education provider to use the description "university".  As predicted in our submission of 31 May, the provision has attracted some debate, given that the context is drawn precisely and that, overall, the provision appears to have been conceived within a defined focus.  THEA notes that any such authorisation will be underpinned by a review process which will use the criteria employed to evaluate a technological university ahead of designation.  In general, this is a sensible approach, although it is not clear to the technological higher education sector why the critical initial criterion required to be met by institutes of technology that seek technological university designation, namely, merger, is absent in this instance.  </p><p> THEA makes these points as general observations and wishes the committee well in its deliberations on what is complex legislation.  We also thank it for its continuing support for the growth of the technological higher education sector.</p></speech>

We particularly welcome the proposed provisions that will facilitate the introduction of the international education mark, the establishment of a learner protection fund and the establishment of procedures to prevent the provision or advertising of cheating services.  These are all welcome in order to ensure the highest standards in Irish education and uphold our strong international reputation.</p> <p>  There are, however, a number of issues with the Bill which we have raised, section by section, in previous correspondence.  For the purposes of this meeting, we will concentrate on the most serious of them which are contained in the amended section 55B(3) and (4) which will introduce additional and unwarranted layers of duplication and cost for QQI, the universities and other designated awarding bodies.  The amendments mean that the universities and other designated awarding bodies will be required to notify QQI in writing of each of the awards made by them.  QQI will then express its agreement or otherwise and notify the university in writing of each of the awards to be included within the national framework of qualifications.  QQI will charge a fee to the university for including each of the awards within the framework.  While on the surface the amendments appear to be eminently reasonable, to ensure there is a verifiable and reliable method for the placement of university awards in the national framework of qualifications, there is, in fact, already a process which ensures this and has operated successfully since the inception of the framework in 2003.  It is managed through the statutory quality assurance process according to QQI&rsquo;s statutory quality assurance guidelines and is explicitly referenced in QQI&rsquo;s current and ongoing CINNTE external quality reviews of all universities and other designated awarding bodies through the European standards and guidelines for quality assurance in the European higher education area.  The details of the explicit referencing can be found in the endnote to this opening statement, a copy of which members have before them.  So far the QQI external quality reviews have not found any evidence of university awards not being correctly placed in the national framework of qualifications.  Likewise, senior QQI staff, when explicitly asked by me and other representatives of designated awarding bodies, have not raised specific concerns about the current process for the inclusion of university awards within the national framework of qualifications.  We have also agreed with QQI that, if such concerns were to be raised at some stage in the future, it would be a simple task to adjust the QQI terms of reference for the external quality review process and other more frequent QQI quality assurance processes to take any such possible future concern into account.</p> <p>  The universities and other designated awarding bodies pay an annual relationship fee to QQI to cover the cyclical external reviews of quality and other more regular services.  In recent years the annual relationship fee has ranged between &euro;450,000 and &euro;616,000 for the designated awarding bodies alone.  The fee covers all aspects related to the maintenance of the national framework of qualifications, including ongoing work to create a register of qualifications in the  national framework of qualifications, on which the universities are actively working with QQI to ensure the register will be complete, up to date and fit for purpose.  From the universities&rsquo; perspective, we have a system that has been designed and is overseen by QQI which functions well.  No specific concerns have been raised, either by QQI or the external experts appointed by it to examine this issue as part of the reviews of universities.  We also pay a substantial fee every year to cover the cost of the existing arrangements.  What the Bill, as amended, is proposing is that an additional double layer of administration be added which will bring no added value to the current well functioning processes.  It will, however, introduce an additional workload for both QQI and the universities which are all publicly funded bodies and for which QQI will charge an additional fee to the universities.  </p> <p>  The introduction of this inefficient and additional cost is being proposed in the context of a looming crisis in third level funding.  Members of the committee have publicly voiced their significant concerns about the underfunding of Irish universities.  Immediate additional public investment is needed to ensure the quality of higher education to meet the demographic bulge - an additional 40,000 students, according to the Department of Education and Skills' latest figures - which the higher education system will be expected to absorb in the coming decade.  We would prefer any such investment to be spent to address the needs of these future students, rather than pay for the introduction of inefficient and unnecessary processes which will bring no additional discernible benefits.</p> <p>  I note that tomorrow in Brussels the Irish ambassador to the European Union will host the launch of a significant report which looks at inefficiencies in European universities in recent years and in which the efforts of the Irish university system, universities and the HEA, together, are being highlighted as examples of best practice at EU level.  What is surprising is that I am trying to convince the committee that in a system from which we have been stripping inefficiencies and unnecessary costs for the past ten years, we are planning to introduce an unnecessary, duplicate layer of quality validation, as proposed in section 55B(3) and (4), with the associated doubling of costs.  We appeal to members to remove the associated doubling of costs and unnecessary inefficiencies that it is planned to introduce in the sector.</p></speech>

The NUI is at the centre of a federation of four constituent universities, two recognised colleges and a number of other associated institutions.</p><p>We have followed the progress of the Bill with keen interest.  We welcome the proposed legislation.  We believe that it will contribute to the maintenance of high standards in the Irish higher education sector, particularly with regard to Ireland's international reputation.</p><p> NUI is pleased to note that the Institute of Public Administration, a recognised college of NUI, is now included in the list of bodies exempted from payment into the proposed learner protection fund.  Its absence from the list in the initial Bill was a cause of concern for us and we made representations on it but a Government amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad rectified the omission.</p><p> NUI wholeheartedly supports the provision in the amended Bill for a pathway for higher education institutions to use the title of university.  The title is significant and we appreciate why a careful approval process is necessary.  Although section 37 is couched in general language, we understand that the immediate beneficiary will be the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  RCSI has been a recognised college of NUI for over four decades and is a world leader in medical education and research, fully deserving of the description of university, which it can use internationally.  We look forward to a continued close working relationship with the RCSI when it proceeds through the steps set out in the amended Bill.  We hope that the swift passage of the legislation will allow this process to begin soon.</p><p> NUI would welcome clarification on how the international education mark will apply to NUI linked provider institutions, which are also under NUI's statute recognised colleges of the university.  In compliance with relevant legislation, NUI approves and monitors the quality assurance systems of recognised colleges that are linked providers.  We would like clarification on the following.  Will these linked providers have to apply directly to Quality and Qualifications Ireland for the international education mark or will an application have to be made through NUI as the designated awarding body?</p><p> Finally, NUI shares the concerns expressed a moment ago by Mr. Lewis Purser from the Irish Universities Association on the amendments to section 23 of the amended Bill where it is proposed that designated awarding bodies, including NUI, its constituent universities and the RCSI will be required to obtain written agreement from QQI for an award to be placed on the National Framework of Qualifications.  Given its federal structure, NUI appreciates the importance of maintaining the standard of awards through rigorous approval processes.  However, we are fully confident that the arrangements and processes in place for the maintenance of academic standards and  governance in its member institutions are very rigorous.  We believe that the proposals will introduce unnecessary administrative burden, new layers of regulatory duplication and new costs that will be most unwelcome.  We are grateful for the opportunity to express our view on these issues and wish the committee well in its deliberations.</p></speech>

Our mission is to advocate for the right of all adults in Ireland to access quality learning throughout their lives and promote the value and benefits of lifelong learning.  The purpose of our written submission was to highlight what we see as the undesirable and harmful impacts of proposed legislative changes on community education providers.</p> <p>  In terms of context, community education is adult learning that takes place in local community settings across Ireland and is delivered by professionally run organisations.  The Aontas community education network has 110 members in 24 counties.  Community education has a phenomenal scope and does the following: addresses policy priorities; supports participation in accredited and non-accredited programmes; is socially inclusive; and supports the equality of access to education for under-represented groups, particularly disadvantaged women and women who are economically inactive.</p> <p>  Based on this contextual information, it is extremely difficult for Aontas and its membership to accept the ongoing funding and resource challenges that community education is placed under.  These challenges are made worse by the proposals for a required payment into the learner protection fund for community education providers that is proposed in this Bill, which we fully discussed in our written submission.  I refer to section 29 and specifically the amendment of section 65 of the principal Act.  We are requesting that not-for-profit community education providers be added to the list of providers who are exempt from the learner protection fund.  The current list includes many entities to which many of my esteemed colleagues belong.  I refer to technological universities, SOLAS, Teagasc and the Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland to name but a few.  It is a shocking oversight that community education providers have not been included in the list.  Also the new charities governance code requires all charities to be compliant by 2020 so this could be a means of establishing criteria.  Some colleges have already imposed a 2% levy on student fees that is called the learner protection charge so the burden will fall on students, which is not feasible for community education.</p> <p>  As a community education provider in Longford I can categorically state that additional fees will have a detrimental effect on the provision of community education to those who are furthest from the education system.  Why should it be even more difficult for those learners to access education?  The community education sector has suffered significant and disproportionate funding cuts in recent years.  I work with Longford Women's Link, which provides over 15,000 hours of education provision annually, reaches learners who are most distant from the system and provides meaningful opportunities for them.  Longford is the fourth most disadvantaged local authority area nationally.  Both counties Longford and Wexford have the lowest percentage of persons with a third level qualification at 32.5% and 18% of the Longford population have no formal education or only primary education.</p> <p>  A critical issue for us is the fact that all providers of accredited learning are treated in the same way, despite major structural differences and despite the fact that the Act allows for flexibility, for example, the re-engagement fees under section 80.  </p> <p>  In terms of re-engagement with QQI, there are six Aontas members, including ourselves and An Cos&aacute;n, that have formed a community of practice and are setting the quality assurance or QA standards for our sector and we all re-engaged in 2009.  However, the re-engagement fees involved will impact our provision.  The total intake of fees for the six of us will be between &euro;12,000 and &euro;24,000.  Therefore, a fee waiver would be a small investment in the scheme of things given the impact of continued provision of accredited learning in our communities.  A sum of &euro;5,000 would allow us to deliver a QQI Level 5 award to 20 women in a disadvantaged area in County Longford.  The majority of our learners are women so the impact of additional financial burdens on providers will have serious implications for women and their families.</p> <p>  I ask joint committee members to engage with Aontas and its membership to understand that approval of these new learner protection fund fees and any additional fees will seriously impact the access that learners have to education across the country.  We are wholeheartedly committed to learner protection and it is at the centre of our provision but our issue is with the exclusion of community education from the list.</p> <p>  In May, the joint committee published its report on education inequality and disadvantage.  Conclusion 3 specifically mentions that funding is sparse for adult and community education and recommends that community education is supported to achieve parity of esteem, which is at odds with some of the proposals in the Bill.  </p> <p>  I thank the members for their time and wish the committee well in its deliberations.</p></speech>

We are the leading provider of learner protection insurance in Ireland.  Our policy is underwritten by Hiscox, which is one of the largest insurance companies in the world and has a AA financial rating.  To date, since we introduced our policy, we have insured 50,000 students and in excess of &euro;100 million in course fees.</p> <p>  I wish to make three points on the submission that we have submitted but all concern the learner protection fund.  First, I refer to the set-up.  There is a bonding arrangement between the private colleges and the language schools that is underpinned by a sinking fund.  This is the only means for colleges to provide learner protection insurance.  They would be unable to source a solution from the private sector.  Of course this scheme would be administered by QQI.  While QQI is, without doubt, fully qualified to administer quality assurance we do not believe that it is capable of administering a sinking fund because that would require a full restructure of QQI.  Experience and resources would be required such as underwriters, actuaries, loss assessors, etc.  QQI would have to restructure and become a regulated insurer.  We have done our homework on the Australian model and it provides extensive reinsurance.</p><p>Essentially, it is very expensive to put together, not to mention the administration costs associated with it.</p><p> Last year when a small English language school in Limerick closed, 150 students were affected.  It cost us &euro;250,000 to settle.  We had the insurance policies in place to cover the matter.  We consider our policy to be fit for purpose in that regard and did exactly what we said we would do.  In addition, there is always negative media attention when it comes to school closures and in that case there was.  However, the shining light was the clean-up, what we managed to do in getting the students into a new school within four days, something which had never been done previously.</p><p> The next aspect is the annual charge, which would be a lump sum.  It is proposed that an annual charge be paid into the learner protection fund by all members.  The feedback we are getting from our clients is that they do not know how much they would be expected to pay into the fund considering that they would not be allowed to source a private solution.  They are quite happy with our policy as it is.  On the timing and method of payment, the payment would be required at the beginning of the year.  It would be an upfront lump sum payment.  That would affect cash flow.  The majority of businesses close owing to a lack of cash flow.  Our policy is competitively priced.  It remains the most competitive price in the higher education sector.</p><p> On the layout and how it would work, it is creating a system that incentivises fraud.  That means I could set up a school today and pay the amount into the fund at the start of the year.  I could then recruit all of the students and, knowing quite well what I was doing, mismanage the way we were working.  We could essentially close the school.  </p><p> I thank members for their time and look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

The international education mark, IEM, must entail the implementation of rules and regulations that are objective and impartial.  The Irish EFL sector expects the Bill to be fair and provide clear and transparent information on the IEM.</p> <p>  In the EFL sector in Ireland protection of enrolled learners is an integral part of quality assurance in 2019.  Protecting students must be mandatory.  Currently, in Ireland only those offering learner protection insurance can be said to comprehensively protect students.  The exchange of letters option should be scrapped forthwith; it should never have been accepted in the first place.  The sector has two major insurance providers that are offering learner protection, LP, insurance, with more set to follow.  The proposed LP fund is essentially a veiled tax on the industry.  Questionably and remarkably, it makes the taxpayer directly liable.  The protection and welfare of students and staff are at the core of everything the PCN does.  To that end, we negotiated with our insurer to secure an upgrade to our existing LP insurance which not only indemnifies students but also protects all teachers within PCN institutions.  This means that in the case of school closures, not only would students be assured completion of their tuition but teachers would also be looked after.  This is the first time in the private sector that staff have been indemnified in this manner.  The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill, legislation to follow, QQI and the Minister should not ask us to reduce the level of protection we offer to students and staff.  Forcing PCN members to contribute to the proposed fund would do just that, as it would remove protection for teachers and reduce the protection offered to students.</p> <p>  From its inception, the PCN has been and will continue to endeavour to be a stabilising and driving force in improving working conditions within the EFL sector in Ireland.  Job security and a pleasant working environment are key aspects of all PCN institutions.  We have engaged fully with Mr. Patrick King who was appointed by the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education to look at improving employment conditions for teachers.  We await publication of his findings but remain resolute in our endeavour to continually improve.  I request to be included in any process or procedure that may follow from his findings.  </p> <p>  The focus has to be on allowing Irish businesses to flourish and thrive.  The ELT sector in Ireland is in a great position to reap the rewards of offering top quality English language tuition in our beautiful country.  Ireland is in a prime location on the edge of Europe and, unlike our closest neighbours, within the European Union.  It is time to bring the ELT sector in Ireland to the next level.</p></speech>

I am the secretary of the English language teachers branch of Unite.  I also work as an English language teacher and a teacher trainer in Dublin.</p> <p>  Unite's submission on the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill raised a number of concerns about labour issues.  English language teaching is generally precarious employment, with teachers being paid by the hour and for hours which vary from week to week.  Within the sector there are vast disparities in pay levels.  Most importantly, teachers are only paid for their time in the classroom, which means that time spent in preparing classes, dealing with paperwork and correcting students' work is unpaid.  As a result, teachers sometimes earn less than the living wage.  That said, teaching English can be an immensely rewarding profession where we have the opportunity to make a real difference to our students' work and study opportunities.  Many of our students go on to study in the higher education sector in Ireland.</p> <p>  Many teachers would like English language teaching to be their lifelong career.  Unfortunately, the English language teaching industry in Ireland has been characterised by employment abuses such as the overuse of fixed-term and low-hour contracts and, in some schools, a lack of contracts; no entitlement to sick pay; discrimination against teachers who are not native speakers of English; and the targeting and harassing of union members.  Some union members have seen their hours cut and, in some cases, have been fired for having union membership.  While, as we know, this is completely illegal, these teachers, as precarious workers, may fail to stand up for their rights when it can cost them their livelihood.  That is why we welcome the quality assurance standards in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill and the amendments regarding the international education mark that will ensure any school that wishes to operate in Ireland will be obliged to abide by Irish employment law.  However, the IEM needs to be underpinned by further supporting legislation to address the culture of disregard of the rights of workers which, sadly, pervades what could be a world-class industry.</p> <p>  Unite has been happy to engage with the mediator, Mr. Patrick King, and in the mediation process.  We look forward to sitting down with the employers, with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement on matters such as stable hours, secure contracts, sick pay, pay scales, union recognition and other issues, including sudden school closures which have left teachers out of work and with unpaid wages.  We seek a sectoral employment order, but we are prepared to explore in good faith whatever statutory instrument is best for our members and all teachers.</p> <p>  Through the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill and potentially other legislation, teachers are requesting a strengthening of their rights as workers in order that they can continue to do the work they love in a stable and ethical industry which respects and allows them to make a living to keep a roof over their heads and provide for their families.</p></speech>

BIM welcomes the opportunity to meet the joint committee this afternoon to assure members that BIM is actively re-engaged with QQI on a new quality assurance system that will cater for the provision of seafood industry training.  BIM's skills strategy for 2018 to 2020 will deliver a structured career path through the provision of lifelong, accredited learning to create a professional, educated talent pool for the sector.  The investment in training, with support from the European Maritime Fisheries Fund, EMFF, will create an increasingly skilled and more professional workforce that creates value.  BIM promotes best practice regarding safety and working conditions and protects the Irish seafood sector's reputation through training, to deliver high standards of seafood safety management.  BIM provides targeted training, access and funding where needed to drive skills development at all levels in the sector.  The agency provides business mentoring and leadership to the sector where needed to drive skills development at all levels in the sector.  Skills training for the industry will equip fishers, fish farmers and seafood processors to take advantage of market opportunities and create value.<br/><br/>BIM has developed and delivered seafood industry training programmes for more than 40 years and is a QQI recognised provider, initially agreeing its quality assurance with FETAC in 2006.  The training programmes are aimed specifically at those working in the seafood industry, with specialised training offered to the sea-fishing, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors. Training is available from <i>ab initio</i>QQI level 3 on the framework to higher diploma at QQI level 8.  Modern facilities in the National Fisheries College of Ireland, in Greencastle and Castletownbere, are supported by mobile coastal training units around the coast.  Work practice and supervised experience on training vessels, fish farms and fish factories are augmented through innovation in seafood business development at the BIM seafood innovation hub in Clonakilty, County Cork.  All BIM training is monitored through the administrative hub and quality oversight function based in BIM headquarters in D&uacute;n Laoghaire. <br/><br/>I thank the members of the joint committee for updating us on the passage of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill currently before the D&aacute;il.  I also thank the Chair and members for inviting BIM to consider updating, amending or withdrawing its submission made in October 2018 based on the latest text of the Bill.  Having examined the latest version of the Bill as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann, there is no substantive reason we would alter our submission, which we restricted to three specific sections of the Bill.  We are happy to leave it stand.  We will not, therefore, be making an updated or amended submission.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bryan Maguire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#F00400"><p>I thank the Chair and members.  When QQI was established in 2012, we launched a comprehensive policy development programme to implement all the functions laid out in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012.  It became evident, however, that there were gaps in the Act which impeded QQI from fulfilling its intended role in relation to the quality assurance of the further and higher education sector and the English language sector.  We engaged with the Department at an early date to discuss the changes necessary to make QQI fully operational.  The amendments proposed in the 2018 Bill are intended to enable QQI to discharge all its functions and respond to newly emerging threats.  Many of the amendments proposed were informed by consultation with QQI stakeholders.</p> <p>  Education and training in Ireland operate within an international environment.  Students come from overseas for English language and higher education programmes; Irish graduates take their qualifications abroad; Irish providers seek to offer qualifications of overseas awarding bodies; and persons from outside the State own and operate schools in this country.  Those are all good things.  Unfortunately, it is also the case that international networks of crooks facilitate cheating in our institutions through Internet-based essay mills.  This international context provides one of the common threads motivating these amendments.  Like its peer agencies in other jurisdictions, with which we are in frequent contact, QQI needs additional powers to secure the quality of Irish education and the standards of qualifications. </p> <p>  Since its launch over 15 years ago, the national framework of qualifications has become recognised at home and abroad as signifying worthwhile qualifications offered by quality assured providers.  Inclusion in the national framework gives reassurance to learners, funders and other regulators that an award can be trusted.  This legislation gives QQI powers to extend that recognition to additional awarding bodies and their associated providers.  It also strengthens QQI's hand to test the good intentions of private providers and awarding bodies, making sure that they are fit and proper persons with appropriate resources to carry out education and training, whether for Irish students or international students, and that they have demonstrated compliance with relevant laws, including those relating to the employment of staff.  QQI welcomes the provisions that give legal clarity to the arrangements whereby any awarding body's qualifications, whether new or existing, are to be included in the framework.</p> <p>  Many providers of education and training are in the private sector.  In the past, students have been left stranded when providers have suddenly gone out of business.  In some cases, these closures may have been due to the actions of unscrupulous providers, but any business venture carries the risk of failure due to fluctuations in trading conditions.  Even with closer scrutiny of the providers by QQI, as enabled by this Bill, private schools may fail in the future.  The learner protection fund to be operated by QQI will ensure that it is the private sector educational industry as a whole, rather than the individual learners in the schools affected or the Exchequer, that bears the cost of any such failure. </p> <p>  We welcome this Bill and look forward to playing our part in implementing it when it is passed.</p></speech>

I am grateful to the Chair and the joint committee for the invitation to discuss the QQI Bill.  As has been mentioned, the main purpose of the Bill is to further empower QQI as the regulator of the framework of qualifications and to strengthen the agency's role in ensuring high standards across Ireland's education system as a whole.  It is important legislation for the Department and the Minister because it will enable QQI to realise the full potential of the 2012 Act and facilitate the introduction of important policies envisaged in that Act relating to the quality of higher education in the State.  It will clarify and strengthen existing quality assurance policies and make their operation more efficient.</p> <p>  The main amendments to the primary Act can be summarised as follows, and have already been mentioned by previous witnesses.  The Bill gives QQI the explicit authority to list awarding bodies and include their qualifications in the framework.  It provides a legal basis for QQI to examine the bona fides and financial capacity of providers, a very important issue when listing those bodies and their qualifications in the framework.  It will facilitate information sharing by QQI with other State bodies, strengthen and improve the approval process for quality assurance and, importantly, facilitate the introduction of the international education mark, an important innovation in the internationalisation strategy of education in Ireland.  It will provide a national scheme for the protection of enrolled learners, which will play an important role in protecting their interests.  As Dr. Maguire already mentioned, it provides the power to prosecute essay mills and other forms of academic cheating.</p> <p>  During the passage of the Bill through the Seanad, several Senators raised concerns about employment practices in the English language education sector and the scope for reputational damage to the education sector from the closure of English language schools, as has happened in a number of instances.  </p> <p>  The Bill contains measures that will strengthen QQI's role as the regulator in this sector, in particular through the introduction of the international education mark, IEM.  To obtain the IEM, providers must first undergo corporate fitness assessments, which will examine their financial resources, corporate viability and so on.  Providers must then demonstrate compliance with robust quality standards that will be established by QQI under the code of practice.  In addition, during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad the Minister introduced amendments to ensure that providers that hold the mark are in compliance with employment law and that the mark will be withdrawn where non-compliance is found.</p> <p>  In response to the Seanad debate, the Minister appointed Patrick King as a mediator to work with employer and employee representatives to seek to arrive at an agreement on employment standards in the sector.  The Minister is seeking to promote a quality English language training sector, and it is important that that is underpinned by appropriate employment standards.</p><p>The Minister is anxious to ensure continuing engagement in the mediation process, with the aim of reaching an agreement that will benefit the sector in the short and longer term.</p></speech>

There are a couple of issues on which I wish to hone in.  I will ask my questions and the delegates may then respond.  I will not revert to each of them.</p> <p>  Ms Godkin stated that at one point the union was looking for a teacher protection fund similar to the learner protection fund provided for in the Bill.  Are the trade union staff still seeking that fund?  It is probably beyond the scope of the Bill.</p> <p>  On the learner protection fund in general, I have serious concerns that it is a major insurance operation that has been slipped into the legislation.  I wonder whether it has been fully thought through.  I invite Dr. Maguire and Mr. Beausang to explain it to me.  There is private insurance in that respect.  Does Mr. Beausang know whether there has been a problem with the private insurance sector in that regard which leads him to believe a different system needs to be put in place?  Has the private insurance market failed on this issue, leading us to require a learner protection fund operated by QQI?</p> <p>  Dr. Maguire has stated he does not wish this to be funded by the Exchequer, but a subsection of the Bill gives a blank cheque to QQI from the Exchequer.  Section 31 proposes the insertion of a new section 66A into the original legislation.  Section 31(4) provides: "The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may pay into the Learner Protection Fund, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister thinks appropriate".  That amounts to a blank cheque.  Why is it necessary if it will pay for itself?  In particular, why is it necessary while there is insurance in place?  Mr. Beausang may wish to outline problems with that insurance.</p> <p>  There is another issue which the delegates may wish to explain to me.  When a protected programme default event occurs, the provider of the programme is required under the legislation to notify QQI about it within two working days.  As I understand it, a default event includes an institution going bust or a person running away from his or her obligations and leaving everybody in the lurch, as we have seen happen often recently.  I have joined staff and students at protests against such situations.  It seems that the legislation requires such individuals to notify QQI about default events in order to get the learner protection fund up and running.  Am I misreading it?  Perhaps the delegates can give me some comfort in that regard as I am very worried about this issue.  I know that this is the system used in Australia.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Maguire consider QQI to be ready for this?  Does it have expertise in operating an insurance fund?  If it does not, what steps is it taking to ensure it will be able to carry out this work?  This is a brand new operation.  I have never seen a situation where the State has taken over the role of formally providing insurance.  For example, some countries operate a state mutual no-fault car insurance model whereby everybody pays into a system and the state pays out.  Why is it proposed to institute a regime such as that in this area but not in the area of car insurance?  There may be a very simple answer to my question and I am willing to listen to the views of the delegates, but this issue has gone under the radar.  I accept that we need to do everything possible to protect the reputation of Irish education, but I am worried about this proposal.  It would be very useful for Mr. King who did not make an opening statement to update the committee on his general progress and the very important work he is doing in response to these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#G00600"><p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their submissions.  We should also thank those who provided written submissions but were not invited to appear because they generally had not updated those submissions.  </p> <p>  That brings me to the point of why this engagement is taking place.  Ideally, the committee would have held this discussion far earlier in the process, but because the Bill was very quickly referred to the Seanad, we did not have the opportunity to so do.  It is important to ay that because we are very late in the passage of the Bill at this stage.  Second Stage in the D&aacute;il has been completed and the Bill has passed all Stages in the Seanad.  All that remains are Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  Nevertheless, I welcome some of the strengthening of the Bill by the Seanad and wish to ask some questions about what we might be able to do on some of the issues of concern to the delegates.</p> <p>  I will address first the Aontas presentation because community education should not have to pay what are relatively substantial amounts of money for the sector.  The issues surrounding re-engagement fees, etc. have already put a lot of pressure on it.  I do not know if it is possible to address that issue at this stage.  Obviously, we cannot submit amendments.  Perhaps the delgates might elaborate on the effect on the sector of being included in the learner fund.</p> <p>  I take the point made by the Chairman that we are not strictly responsible for employment law.  However, in her contribution in the D&aacute;il last week the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, specifically referred to it and Mr. King's appointment, which I welcome.  Like Deputy Thomas Byrne, I am interested in hearing from Mr. King on the progress that is being made.  It seems that there must be agreement on employment law rights from the various parties involved.  I understood from the Minister of State that if there was agreement, it would be subject to employment law.  I seek clarity on exactly how that will work.  I take the point that the employment law aspect is not within the remit of the committee, but as it is in the Bill, we need to get answers on it.</p> <p>  I refer to the issue raised by Deputy Thomas Byrne that, essentially, the good operators within the system will end up paying the costs of the bad operators.  There is a lot of tightening up in the system in how English language schools, in particular, can operate.  Obviously, they cannot do the things that were done in the past.  I should acknowledge that I was involved in the early stages of this process.  I presume standards are already high as a result of the international education mark.  What size of fund will be needed if we already have strict procedures to be registered for the mark?  That is something we need to know.  Will the sector have to pay a substantial amount of money or are relatively small amounts of money envisaged in comparison with what is in the sector?  Mr. Anako made a fair point about whether these measures will act as encouragement for people that things will be okay, even if they do something wrong because somebody else will bear the cost.  Is there an issue as to why the State is taking this burden on itself?  How will those with private insurance be affected by the new regulations?   </p> <p>  A point was raised by the university sector, by Mr. Purser in particular, about duplication in registering with QQI.  Dr. Murray spoke about the transparency mechanism.  Do the representatives of QQI or the Department consider it necessary to place this extra requirement on the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#G00700"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I wish to pick up on two points which have been addressed.</p><p>On community education, I fully support the call by Aontas for an exemption and I am not sure if that is something we can do as a committee.  We can use the opportunity now to say directly to the Department, since it is represented here, that definitely community education providers should be included in the list of providers that are exempt from the learner protection fund.  I thought Ms Farrell's presentation was excellent, particularly how she spoke about women.  We have a great history in this country of negatively impacting women and children whenever cuts are made.  It is always women and children who suffer the most.  Community education is key to getting people either progressing in a career or getting into the workforce in the first place.  We cannot put a value on that.</p><p> I came across the Longford Women's Link through different work I was doing with the early years sector and childcare workers.  The work it does is invaluable.  I definitely think that, if others are entitled to an exemption, as a committee, we should be supporting that call for community education exemptions.  I thought I was reading it wrong because I thought it could not be the case that exemptions do not apply.  I would be surprised if everybody here did not support the Aontas call for an exemption.  Many things are said at this committee, as Ms Farrell said, about supporting community education.  Now is our chance to do something proactive about that.</p><p> I wanted to touch on a point about the unions.  We often come across stories about people who are taken on in September, let go in December and taken on again in January.  One cannot have any quality of life if that is one's work environment and one is not seen as a permanent worker.  We have dealt with the unions in the past and I welcome the fact that a mediator is now present who will look at this and resolve many of those issues.</p></speech>

Some of the questions I was going to raise have already been asked by other members.  I will follow up on a point which Mr. Purser made before I left and I am interested on the view of the Department on it.  He seemed to make the reasonable point that there is unnecessary duplication and I wonder what are the Department's thoughts about that at a time when, as Mr. Purser said, resources are finite.  What is the Department's view on that and can it be avoided?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#H00300"><p>I also apologise because I had a previous engagement and was a little late coming in.  I have been closely following this topic.  My concerns revolve around worker's rights.  I have come across first-hand horror stories of what has happened in this sector.  I am interested in what Mr. King has to say about this.  It occurs to me that, without a commitment to union recognition, we are not going to move in the way we need in order to ensure a safety net for everyone, staff and students.  I want to understand if that is likely to happen because, if not, a massive hole will remain in this sector.  It is a sector that, warranted or not, has a really poor reputation when it comes to how staff are handled and precarious work is the predominant theme.  I am interested to hear the update from Mr. King and the view of anyone else because I would like to think that everybody here would agree that union recognition should be a cornerstone of respectful relations between staff and the organisations with which they work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#H00400"><p>I will add a few comments and questions.  I share Deputy Thomas Byrne's thoughts on insurance matters.  Is there an element of anti-competitiveness if insurance is to be taken out of, shall we say, the wishes of the operators?  Will companies have the option to go with private insurance or will they have to go with the State insurance?  I would like feedback on that.</p> <p>  Mr. Anako was talking about protecting students and the fact that, within four days, he was able to get them into other schools.  That is great but protecting the teachers is every bit as important.  This committee has a strong record and has engaged on supporting teachers and non-teaching staff.  Those things are to the forefront of our minds.</p> <p>  I appreciate that Mr. King is going to give us an update.  It was agreed in the Seanad debate that the international education mark would not be given unless the employers signed up to support the employees and employment law.  I know Mr. King will go back to negotiate with employers about that.  I would appreciate feedback about that.  I thank Mr. King because I know he has been doing sterling work.  We have all heard that and know it is an important role he has.</p> <p>  My final comment is to Ms Farrell about community education.  It is the heartbeat of many rural communities.  The Longford ladies group made a presentation in Buswell's Hotel last year as part of the Irish Rural Link network.  It is a strong organisation.  The members of this committee will give their full support to that.</p> <p>  Deputies will have the opportunity to submit amendments to the Bill before Committee Stage next week.  We normally ask witnesses at a stakeholder engagement if they would like to send us any further material but, because of the time element, that will not happen in this case.  We will have an opportunity and, as Deputy Funchion said, there is no doubt that we all support the inclusion of community employment organisations among the exemptions.</p> <p>  I am going to go back to the stakeholders for feedback now, starting with Mr. Maguire, who might address some of the issues that have been raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.392" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Bryan Maguire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#H00500"><p>Deputy Thomas Byrne raised questions about how the learner protection fund might operate.  This is being introduced on a statutory basis for the first time.  There have been arrangements under the 2012 Act, the preceding legislation, to provide for mutual support and letters of exchange as referred to by one of the previous witnesses.  This simply does not give sufficient robustness, particularly in cases of dramatic closure, as Deputy Byrne mentioned.</p> <p>  The reason the two days' notice is there is that not all closures are dramatic.  Some businesses wind down in an orderly fashion.  Businesses fail and schools have to close.  The fund could be drawn on in such cases when a provider gives notice of that in good faith.</p> <p>  How was the fund set up and does Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, have the capacity to administer such a fund?  Our proposal is that, while QQI will have a monopoly on establishing a national fund, the procedures whereby we administer that will be subject to procurement so we will be procuring the necessary professional services in specialised areas that are outside our standard area of operation.  Nevertheless, providers are being compelled to have insurance and QQI has a range of other engagements with those providers on things like the capacity to check, on a statutory basis, their corporate bona fides and compliance with the various laws, including employment laws, and those kinds of powers which do not exist for an ordinary insurance company.  We also have ongoing monitoring functions in respect of the education and training being provided by those providers, whether in the English language or higher or further education.  We have additional information which can be used to judge the ongoing risks to which the fund is being exposed and that would not be available to private sector insurers.</p></speech>

I do not want to delay the meeting.  Dr. Maguire is proposing to have an insurance policy in place but QQI, through public procurement, decides who provides it.  Instead of being like motor insurance, where there is a legal requirement to have a policy of insurance, QQI is going to say there is a legal requirement to have the policy of insurance that it provides.  Would it not be simpler to have a legal requirement that insurance be in place and let the market dictate it?  Would that not take all the administrative hassle out of it?  I am not here to represent insurance companies and I do not think I have met them about this, although they have certainly communicated with me about it, but everyone to whom I have mentioned this cannot understand why the State is taking on this responsibility.</p></speech>

As mentioned, this is the arrangement that has been introduced in our competitor jurisdictions in the Anglosphere, such as Australia and New Zealand.</p></speech>

As we do not know how many of the schools will come into the scheme at any one point in time, we do not know how quickly we will have to roll out the scheme.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2019061800002#J01300"><p>I am happy to respond to that question.  The Deputy can take it as given that these provisions were not included in the Bill lightly.  There is a significant reputational issue in safeguarding the interests of students issue that arises.  There were arrangements put in place under the previous legislation, which were referred to earlier by Dr. Maguire.  They are complex.  Whether they would meet the needs of a significant failure or a set of failures in the sector is open to question.  They provide for a refund of fees but we are interested in students being able to continue their studies.  There have been situations where QQI has had to assist small providers which had to withdraw from programme validation because they were not able to meet the cost of insurance.  What I am saying in a roundabout way is that the assessment we have to come - one cannot be definitive about this - is that there is a market failure here and the State in this situation has a responsibility to intervene, particularly in a scenario where the State is taking a much more active role in regulating the sector and the quality of it.  It is relevant to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question on the moral hazard issue.  We will have to see how it plays out.  As the INM is a quality standard, one would expect that into the future, if regulation works, there would be fewer failures than there were in the past.  I do not have to hand the number of schools that have folded over the last extended period.  Dr. Maguire may have the number.  A very significant number of schools have closed.  Having looked at this closely with QQI, the Department is satisfied that the financial arrangements would deliver in the event of a significant number of programmes ceasing.  They have not been tested.  I know there are some good practises that the insurance industry representative referred to but I am speaking about a sector that is very important in terms of the reputation of the education system more generally in this country.  We are not prepared to take that risk.</p></speech>

Over the last couple of years, a large number of schools folded, students were left stranded and we were scrambling around looking for responses.  The State takes risks.  In the case of deposit insurance, the State risks.  The Deputy can be assured that this is not something the Department or the Minister agreed lightly or without adequate consideration.  It is a step that is being taken because of the risks that exist and the importance of maintaining the reputation of the sector.  The Irish Universities Association, IUA, representative spoke about the funding of the higher education system.  As the committee will be aware, a large measure of the recovery in the income of the higher education system has been international fees.  It is an open question whether that would be maintained in circumstances where the reputation of Ireland Inc. in education was damaged by large numbers of closures in the English language training sector.</p></speech>

We do not yet have guidance in place in that regard but it would be sufficiently lengthy to enable the company to be able to justify the cost of investing in the actuarial predictions and so on and sufficiently limited so that there would not be an incumbent effect that would make it impossible to repeat procurement after a specified period.  For services such as this, it strikes me a period of four or five years would be likely but we have not tested the market yet.</p></speech>

Under the current system, there are a number of different options, as outlined by Mr. Beausang.  We have options from mutual cover to paying into funds or putting up a bond.  The whole idea of a fund like this is the pooling of the risk.  In having a single national fund there is a bigger pool and so that should reduce the cost overall.</p></speech>

We conduct an extensive auditing process, which is basically an underwriting process whereby we obtain the accounts of the company, the lease agreements, tax clearance certificates, CVs, business plans and we then sit down with our in-house actuaries in Hiscox - the underwriters - to determine the risk we are opening ourselves to.  We then put a rate to that risk and give that to the client.  Our current rate, at in and around 2% of course fee per student, in the higher education space in particular, is the most competitive out there at the moment.  The cover is purchased on a gradual basis throughout the course.  As a student enrols, the cover is purchased.  There is no lump-sum payment at the start of the year, which would cripple the institution cashflow-wise.</p> <p>  On top of that, in regard to reputation, off the back of the praise we received in the press last year we are now engaging with a number of accrediting bodies throughout Europe to solve their issues in regard to solvency funds and the like.  It is something that they are viewing as a solution.  However, we are getting knocked back here for the good that we believe we have done.</p> <p>  In regard to the failures, we have not seen any failures.  In 2017, we were approached by an English language school seeking insurance.  We did not refuse it cover but we asked it to make a personal commitment to the school.  Those involved had come to this country to set up a language school.  They had no proof of funds.  Is that a risk that should be automatically underwritten by the State under the QQI fund?  We asked for a commitment but they were not willing to give it.  I do know that that school no longer exists.  This is what we are dealing with.  </p> <p>  There are many insurance models out there: we are not the only one.  As a broker we are constantly being contacted by a number of underwriters who are looking to get into this space.  The only deterrent is what is going on in regard to this looming national fund.  In regard to the holes in the sector, there is a bunch of providers that would not have something like this in place.  However, the providers-clients that we deal with in the English language space and the higher education space are completely secure.  The concept of insurance is transferring risk.  Hiscox has hundreds of millions of reserves readily available at any one time.  That is its job.  Even if there was a school messing around, Hiscox has put its name to that school such that if anything happens all students are covered.  This could involve the transfer of the course to a different provider for the remainder of the course or a full refund of all fees paid.</p><p>That is the difference.  Again, it is a transfer of risk.  It is not as though a course fee will be put into a fund; rather, a fraction of a course fee will be put into an insurance policy.  All students receive a policy certificate and, in case there is a closure, there is a number people can call to contact us.  Sedgwick, with 350 staff, has a disaster model in place, while there are 65 staff in O'Driscoll O'Neil's Study &amp;amp; Protect to assist in all closures.  We believe that is a suitable number-----</p></speech>

There was also a handful of closures in higher education.  The policy was designed for students only but we want to get teachers involved and create some sort of solution for them.  The only problem is whether we are treading on redundancy and that we are not sure what we are insuring, although we are completely open to insuring teachers.  The history of O'Driscoll O'Neil and Study &amp;amp; Protect is releasing niche products.  We are the first provider of learner protection in Ireland and we created a medicover policy, which is medical insurance for international students.  It is now a statutory requirement and all the universities take it up, although in that regard we are appearing before the High Court for another matter.  It is all about creating a niche product, which we can do.</p></speech>

The development of the next further education and training strategy will provide an opportunity for further engagement, which I am sure has been ongoing on SOLAS's part in examining this important aspect of the further education and training sector.  There is no obligation on providers to engage with QQI and it is only when they want to have their programme validated that they must contribute to the learner protection fund.  The community and voluntary sector, as the committee will know, is homogeneous.  Approximately 130 providers are self-declared as community and voluntary, and there is a diverse cohort of learners.  QQI has advised us that some self-declared community and voluntary providers operate on a for-profit commercial basis and charge fees to students for programmes.  Protection for enrolled learners is necessary to ensure that payments made by students are safeguarded.</p> <p>  Some community and voluntary providers will be exempt from the fund.  QQI estimates that 25% of providers in the category deliver programmes up to level 3 on the national framework of qualifications, which are largely in community education.  They are programmes of less than three months' duration.  Similarly, any programmes where moneys are not paid by learners will be exempt from the fund.  That includes programmes funded by the Exchequer, back-to-work schemes and upskilling programmes offered by ETBs.  The learner protection charge will only apply when a provider accepts moneys from or on behalf of a learner in respect of a programme with a minimum duration of three months.  There will be further engagement by QQI with stakeholders on the development of criteria for the learner protection fund and QQI will be required to undertake periodic reviews of it.  I hope that information is of benefit to the committee.</p></speech>

My terms of reference were to explore the scope for agreement on minimum employment standards leading to some form of registered, statutory employment agreement.  I wrote to all the stakeholders, that is, the providers, employers and trade unions involved.  A difficulty at the beginning was that there is no single management representative body.  One organisation, Marketing English Ireland, MEI, represents approximately 66 schools but it is a marketing organisation and does not consider itself an employer body.  Its initial reaction was not to get involved in the process but it subsequently did so and I have met its representatives on several occasions.  A second group, Progressive College Network, which is represented here, was involved from the beginning and was positively disposed towards the process.  It has been supportive of a positive outcome and remains so.  A third, informal group of employers is engaged with me, although it is not affiliated with any organisation.</p> <p>  I convened public meetings of providers in Dublin, Galway and Cork that were attended by more than 90 people representing schools.  A wide variety of opinions was expressed of the meetings, some of which I will give the committee a taste of in a moment.  On the other side, I met the trade unions that are active in English language schools.  The main one is Unite the Union, which is represented here and whose senior officials and sector branch I met.  I also met SIPTU, which is involved, to a lesser extent, in some of the university colleges that provide English language courses, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  The committee will not be surprised that ICTU is supportive of reaching a destination that will provide statutory protections for employees in English language schools.  I think the individual employers, on the other hand, are reluctant.  This week, the MEI will ballot its membership on whether to continue engagement leading to some kind of statutory agreement.  </p> <p>  To give a taste of what the employers said to us at public meetings, some of them saw the mediation as an unhelpful intervention or a knee-jerk reaction to the closure of Grafton College, some said the State was generally unhelpful to English language schools, while others believed that their should be State subsidy for English language schools.  All sides, that is, that of workers, trade unions and management, wanted strict accreditation.</p><p>They all wanted the IEM rigorously applied, along with financial backing and an inspection regime.</p><p> Some of the schools referred to others in fairly derogatory terms, mentioning schools opening, undercutting, cherry-picking, profiting and then leaving the country.  They said some schools were reputable but others were behaving recklessly.  That comes from employers.  On the standards of employment, schools were saying that some have best practice while others do not.  They said an agreement on minimum conditions will not work and many schools already have above-average conditions and teachers are not complaining.  This was said to me by employers.  I was told that if legislation is changed to apply minimum standards, it will lead to more closures and threaten jobs.  It was said that teachers like the flexibility in schools, including the uncertainty about hours, etc., that have already been mentioned.</p><p> On the employee side, I met representatives of unions and I met and received communication from well over 100 teachers.  I am grateful to them as many said they found it very difficult to speak up and join trade unions.  They did not want to be recorded as having met me and they did not want to be identified.  They wanted standards of inspection and complained about pay.  They stated that most teachers were on short contracts and that nobody in their schools was permanent.  Many stated that they were on zero-hour contracts, although the legislation has changed in the meantime but some say that it has still not been implemented.  They stated that their hours change without warning and they face uncertain conditions.  One teacher told me she had nine contracts in two years, conditions are getting worse and she is not permitted to work in another school in order to augment her salary.  She said the pay was measly and that it is not a living wage so she cannot afford to have children.  I was also told that teachers live on the poverty line and so on.  This is a reflection of what they said to me.</p><p> These are two very different perspectives.  The teachers speak of low morale and a toxic environment in schools, with teachers feeling helpless and afraid to speak up.  They say that if they get actively involved in a union, they will not be rehired.  That kind of comment was also made.  The teachers stated that they had no leave entitlement and cannot get sick because there is no employment security.  I was informed that teachers go to school on Mondays wondering if the school will be open.  One teacher told me of a plan to leave the country because there is no future in English language teaching here.  The teachers I met are very proud of their profession and I was very impressed with them.  There are very passionate about the job and I was told that although they love the job, it is not a viable career and the industry is losing quality teachers.</p><p> It is possible that by next week I will know exactly where the employers stand in moving to the next stage, which is agreement to proceed to a position of statutory engagement, with involvement from the Labour Court and a possible sectoral employment order dictating minimum standards, leave entitlements, pay and so forth.  There could be a joint labour committee that would also set minimum standards and which would ultimately have the force of law.  I am advised that if there was a sectoral employment order, it would apply to all schools, regardless of whether they engaged in the process.  It would help to prevent the business of one school undercutting others.</p></speech>

We could end up with one side saying we should move to the next stage and parts of the other side saying we should or maybe we should not.  The option is there for the Minister, under legislation, to ask the Labour Court to set up a joint labour committee and move ahead even without the agreement I am seeking.  The ideal position would be one of agreement.  One of the management groups has been supportive all the way along but it is the smaller of the groups.  The larger group represents 66 of the well over 100 schools and I will know next week where it stands.</p></speech>

I saw a couple of people nodding when listening to it.  There are real concerns about the sector.  What type of employer would oppose statutory protection for employees?  Surely every good employer could agree to that.  This poses real questions about people that would vote against further engagements in the process.  I compliment Mr. King on shining a light on both sides of the equation.  Fair play to the Progressive College Network for taking a positive stand and it would be a very poor reflection on the other organisations if they fail to join the Progressive College Network and do what needs to be done for the sector.</p></speech>

Many of us, particularly the six Community Education Network members who are re-engaging at the moment, are delivering programmes from level 3 to level 6.  In Longford Women's Link, for example, we do not deliver anything at level 1 or level 2 as there is not enough demand for it in the Longford area.  I will reinforce the point that there are structural differences between our services and universities or higher education institutions, yet we are being treated in the same way.  The one-size-fits-all approach just does not work.  We are not in a position to charge large fees.  We are not-for-profit organisations.  On revalidation fees, I accept that one is not obliged to pay fees until one revalidates one's programmes but we are obliged to revalidate our programmes.  We are obliged to re-engage if we want to be a QQI provider.  We simply do not have a secret pot of money to pay those fees.  They will have a massive impact on our provision, which will ultimately impact on the learners.  I thank the Deputies for their supportive comments.</p></speech>

The great majority had negative comments to make.  Some made positive comments, praised their school and praised their employers for being good, supportive and communicative.  It is not all schools.</p></speech>

The Minister who can apply for the establishment of a joint labour committee is the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It would be a matter for the Minister for Education and Skills to make a request of that Minister.  The IUA representative raised the question of who is the custodian of the national framework of qualifications.  To be fair, that area has evolved over the years since the framework was first established.  The framework of qualifications is a really important part of our infrastructure in education generally.  We have come to a point in the decision-making process that has been the subject of discussion this afternoon at which there must be a final decision-maker as to who goes on the framework.  That is what has guided the approach of the Department and the Minister in this regard.  We understand the perspective of the university sector.  Fortunately we were able to satisfy the concerns of the technological sector.  It might be a very extreme situation but legislation has to cater for any eventuality and we cannot have a situation in which a higher education institution could override the regulator established under statute and put a qualification on the framework the regulator did not believe should be on it.  As I said, this is an extreme scenario and it is not possible to conceive of it happening in today's university sector, but legislation has to cater for such an eventuality.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Beausang, on behalf of the Department, to provide the committee with a further update.  We would certainly appreciate that.</p></speech>

The question of how many schools had closed was raised.  As far as I know, 24 schools have closed in the past five years.  Even during the week in which this legislation was before the Seanad, another school closed.  Although we hope no more schools will ever close, the existence of the learner protection fund acknowledges that possibility and we therefore think a fund should be in place to protect teachers and other staff in such an event.</p></speech>

With regard to Mr. Beausang's last point, we have no intention of overriding the concerns of the regulator, far from it.  We work very closely with the regulator and it has a number of other statutory mechanisms to meet all of its concerns.  We are trying to prevent the unnecessary duplication of the administrative, regulatory, and financial burden for the benefit of both the regulator and ourselves.  We have engaged extensively with the regulator and it has never raised any concerns in this area but if it does have concerns, there is a mechanism in its statutory quality assurance processes to deal with this specific scenario.  It could do so now without any new legislation.  There are internal mechanisms in place which we believe we currently meet to all our mutual satisfaction.  There is no question of trying to override the regulator.  We respect its authority but there is no point in introducing unnecessary duplication and cost at a time when we are all trying to do more with less.</p></speech>

That process happened very simply without any unnecessary bureaucracy.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Maguire could respond to it.</p></speech>

Far from duplicating the bureaucracy, the intention is that the administrative arrangements for obtaining information from the universities and other designated awarding bodies about the qualifications they have on the framework will be put on a statutory basis to eliminate any uncertainty about the legal standing of those awards under the framework, because the framework has acquired additional regulatory responsibility, for example, in respect of the international education mark.  It is not a duplication.  It is a replacement of what has emerged and been agreed to with statutory certainty.</p></speech>

I will certainly be discussing it with my party colleagues, although I cannot speak for them.  If one were to table an amendment to this legislation necessitating that a private insurance policy be obtained by students on accredited courses, with the insurable risks being those outlined in the legislation, what would be the problem with introducing that provision in place of the fund that has been set up?  I presume QQI has looked at both.  What would be the problem with obliging colleges to arrange private insurance for their students to cover such default events?</p></speech>

In that sense, it is rather different from the question of health insurance, which has also emerged.  The individual colleges are the risk that is being insured against in this instance.</p></speech>

Whichever way we do it, each individual should be insured.  The difference is whether it is done through a private insurer or the State-backed arrangement provided for in the legislation.  What would the difference be from the point of view of QQI?</p></speech>

Another difference relates to the other regulatory functions of the QQI and the information that arises from our quality assurance and monitoring of providers, which informs our understanding of the risk profile, both current and emerging over time, associated with the area.  We have a number of statutory engagements with each of these providers in addition to that specifically related to learner protection.  We find out how many students they are registering, how they graduate, and so on.  We have an additional flow of information around student practices in the industry.</p></speech>

I am head of financial advisory at the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and I am responsible for the agency&rsquo;s financial advisory roles in the housing sector.  I am joined by my senior colleague, Mr. Gerard Cahillane, deputy director.  To assist the committee in its discussion on the topic of affordable housing, I welcome the opportunity to address its questions and give it clarity on the nature of the NDFA&rsquo;s role in the schemes currently under way.</p> <p>  The NDFA is providing financial advice to a number of local authorities seeking to develop housing schemes on their lands.  Its role is twofold.  First, it is to undertake financial modelling in respect of potential schemes.  This work is undertaken pre-procurement to assist each local authority in determining tenure mix options for the sites in question.  It also provides financial advice during the procurement phase.  This entails providing advice on the tender documentation and development agreement contracts, undertaking financial robustness assessments and performing the financial evaluation of submitted tenders.</p> <p>  On affordable housing specifically, the NDFA is assisting Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council on a number of schemes under way.  These are O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens in Dublin 7, where final tenders have been received, with 20% proposed for affordable purchase; Oscar Traynor Road in Coolock where dialogue with short-listed candidates has commenced, again with 20% proposed for affordable purchase; St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Dublin 8 where outline design is under way, with 70% proposed for affordable rental; and Ballymastone, Donabate, County Dublin, where dialogue with short-listed candidates has commenced, with 20% proposed for affordable purchase.</p> <p>  All policy matters relating to affordable housing fall under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The NDFA has no role in determining affordable housing policy.  Our objective is to assist as many local authorities as possible in support of housing delivery across the country.  In relation to affordable housing, this is taking the form of affordable purchase and affordable rental. </p> <p>  I trust this clarifies the extent of the NDFA's involvement in affordable housing to date and we look forward to assisting the committee this morning.</p></speech>

Critical to this is that everyone is able to live in a good quality and affordable house.  This morning I intend to focus on two areas relating to affordable housing.  These are affordable purchase housing and cost rental housing.</p><p> It is widely recognised that there is a need to address housing affordability issues faced by low to middle-income households, particularly in Dublin and other main urban areas.  As a general rule, housing costs should be below one third of a household's income and in the long term, below one quarter of income.  Households on very low incomes may require social housing or other housing supports to meet their needs.  Other households with higher incomes have adequate means to purchase or rent at market prices.</p><p> The new affordable housing purchase scheme aims to target lower to moderate-income households living in areas of the country where housing affordability issues are greatest.  The scheme lowers the initial purchase cost of a home, making it more achievable for low to moderate-income households to access homeownership.  The new scheme follows the commencement of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  The first set of regulations under this legislation were commenced in March, allowing local authorities to establish a scheme of priority under section 85 of the Act.</p><p> An important feature of the new scheme is that the discount offered to purchasers, which will be up to 40% of market value, will be retained by the local authority as equity in the property.  When this equity is repaid the moneys can be reused to provide more affordable housing.  While the local authority stake in the home must be repaid in full, households will have a large degree of choice about the timing of the repayments of these repayments.</p><p> Cost rental and the Vienna model have been the subject of a lot of discussion recently.  This is a model of rented housing where the rents charged are linked to the cost of delivering, managing and maintaining the properties.  This differs from private renting where rents are set by the market, which may lead to high rents in high-demand areas.  In cost rental, rents are not driven by market demand and are more stable over time.  This is expected to result in rents that are more affordable for lower to moderate-income households.  It is also different from social housing where the rent paid by these households is linked to income levels.  Cost rental has the potential to deliver secure and more affordable rental accommodation for lower to moderate-income households.  Over the longer term, as cost rental homes are delivered at scale, cost rental is likely to have a stabilising effect on the broader private rented market.</p><p> With regard to the importance of affordable rental accommodation, one of the primary aims of the national planning framework under Project Ireland 2040 is to encourage compact growth in our towns and cities.  Up to 40% of future housing development is to be built within or close to built-up areas, using infill and brownfield sites or publicly owned lands.  Housing densities need to be increased to make public transport and other infrastructure more viable, reduce urban sprawl and make our communities more sustainable.  Building affordable, secure and well-planned rental accommodation is critical to achieving these goals.  Households can be offered the choice to live in secure and affordable accommodation within walking distance of local amenities and with access to good public transport.</p><p> In recent years, more households are renting and are doing so for longer, either by choice or because they cannot afford to buy or have yet to find a home to purchase.  Cost rental could be an attractive form of tenure for these households.  A steady support of secure, affordable accommodation is also a key element underpinning our economic competitiveness.</p><p> There are a number of essential elements which must be put in place to ensure that cost rental housing is affordable.  These include the provision of land at no or low-cost, designing good quality housing to achieve reasonable delivery cost with long-term maintenance in mind, a State contribution to development costs and the removal of infrastructural constraints, and we have the serviced sites fund to do this, and the availability of low-cost, stable finance that is paid back over a long period of time, often over more than 40 years.</p><p> I will now discuss the Enniskerry Road pilot cost rental project, which is the result of collaboration between D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, the housing associations Respond and Tuath Housing, and the Housing Finance Agency.  Financial support is also being provided through the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The project includes 50 cost rental homes and 105 social homes, a community centre and green spaces at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside, Dublin 18.  The site is near a wide range of amenities, public transport, public facilities, schools, health services and local community and sports groups.</p><p>The cost rental homes are being funded through the provision of grant funding for site infrastructure works under the serviced sites fund and a long-term loan facility using competitive European Investment Bank, EIB, rates through the Housing Finance Agency.  The land has been provided by the Housing Agency at no cost.  Following the completion of the development, expected in late 2021, tenants will pay &euro;1,200 per month to live in a two-bedroom home.  This rent is based on the cost of delivering and maintaining the homes and is significantly below market rent for similar homes in the area.  The objective is to reduce the rental cost closer to or below &euro;1,000 per month in future developments.  Additionally, the homes must remain in cost rental use for at least 70 years to help ensure the value of the State&rsquo;s investment is passed to future tenants.</p><p> The Housing Agency has also provided three additional sites for development to the Land Development Agency and is setting specific requirements for the provision of long-term cost rental housing on these sites.  The first two of these will be in Skerries in Dublin and in Naas, County Kildare.  In both cases delivery will be for developments of approximately 200 homes, which will be a mix of social housing and cost rental housing.</p><p> These projects will provide valuable lessons for the development of a national cost rental sector in Ireland and help to determine what structures and supports should be put in place at the outset of these projects to achieve cost rental housing that is affordable to a wide range of households.  We need to learn from these early projects and adopt a long-term approach to cost rental.  There is much more information we can provide on affordable housing and we are happy to answer any questions members may have or to provide further details as required.</p></speech>

A number of us on the committee today are looking to get into the detail of the projects from the Housing Agency perspective.  I know the Enniskerry Road project is being developed now.  Without straying into policy areas, we also want to try to get a handle on some of the financial modelling on which the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, has been advising.  I will start with a couple of technical questions.</p> <p>  The key to this is how we make the purchase or rental units genuinely affordable and part of our difficulty arises because there is not a clear definition of what we mean by "affordable" that is agreed by all actors.  We should relatively soon have the affordable housing schemes for purchase agreed by local authorities.  That has not yet happened and we have no scheme yet for the affordable or cost rental initiatives to know how affordability is defined.  It is a bit of a movable feast.</p> <p>  One of my concerns about the Enniskerry Road project is that entry-level rents are not affordable for a large cohort of people at whom this kind of housing is targeted.  Affordable cost rental is aimed at people who are above the thresholds of eligibility for social housing but are priced out of the market.  The &euro;1,200 figure is a high rent.  It might seem to be not as high as the very excessive rents but it is very high and any household earning &euro;45,000 or &euro;55,000 would be paying well above a third of its net disposable income if that is the rent being charged.  There is a problem in that.</p> <p>  I am not asking witnesses to argue for or against this but I would like to understand how the figure is derived from the financial modelling.  Loans must be paid but as the witness indicated, in other European countries they are paid over 40 years or longer.  I assume that here the loan would be paid over a shorter period, which is one of the reasons the entry-level rent is set so high.  Are other costs mixed into this?  Has D&uacute;n Laoghhaire-Rathdown County Council added costs for works already completed on the site, for example?  Is the cost just derived from loan financing and management or maintenance?  Do other costs push up the entry-level rents?</p> <p>  I ask a purely hypothetical question of the NDFA that does not stray into policy.  If, for example, we looked at a model with entry-level rents from &euro;700 to &euro;900, which would relate to the Housing Agency's definition for the cohort of people with household income of between &euro;45,000 to &euro;65,000, how would it be modelled?  Would it just be a longer loan term or would EIB loans be mixed with soft loans from the State, for example?  Would it be looking at an upfront capital contribution from the State?  What are the options?  I am not looking for the witnesses to state a preference but we would like a read on the matter.</p> <p>  There is a serviced sites fund available for the Housing Agency so will that fund be accessed for the Enniskerry Road project to try to bring down its cost?  If a type of loan like a capital bank loan facility were available to approved housing bodies, as there is with social housing, it could deal with the loan period issue.</p><p>Have these options been discussed with the Department and has any progress been made?</p><p> Will the delegates, please, explain how the equity stake will work in the case of the affordable purchase scheme and serviced sites fund.  Is it set at &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000?  Will it be index linked with inflation or other factors?  I would like to know because there is a lack of clarity on the matter elsewhere.</p><p> Will the delegates, please, explain the densities proposed by the Housing Agency?  I am broadly supportive of the proposition and the planning framework for the national development plan.  In order that people in D&uacute;n Laoghaire or Dublin city will understand the sites involved, from and to what densities are we moving?</p><p> Why stipulate a period of 70 years?  I like the covenant idea as it is the right way to go, but I do not understand why one would set a time limit.  Given that it is a public asset, I would have thought the time limit would be indefinite or open to regular review.  Will the delegates, please, explain the rationale behind setting a time limit?</p></speech>

There are different options and levers available to the State to make rents as affordable as possible.  In the case of St. Michael's estate, we looked at long dated loans and having a portion of them interest only, for example.  It is really about looking at the levers available to the State.  We analysed them to make the product as affordable as possible without considering the private market and the additional equity requirements and returns, etc.  We are considering this measure from the point of view of the State and how we can, potentially, deliver this model.  To date, we have not modelled a subsidy or an upfront contribution.  The Deputy is right that those aspects would contribute to a reduction in rents, as would, potentially, the serviced sites fund mentioned by him.</p></speech>

Is that financially possible without a subsidy by stretching a loan over a longer period or mixing a European Investment Bank or EIB loan with a soft loan from the State?</p></speech>

The one condition is, without going through a procurement process and with no other construction costs, there are requirements in terms of apartment numbers at the core, car parking bays, etc.   It obviously does have a driver and the cost has an impact on the funding needed for the project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Baneham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019061800002#H00500"><p>The questions posed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin have a number of elements, all of which I intend to cover as best as I can.  </p> <p>  The initial question was how had we arrived at a figure of &euro;1,200 in rent.  At the beginning 155 dwellings were designed to be built on the site.  The site is rocky and located on the side of Ticknock Hill or Three Rock Hill in the Dublin hills.  Therefore, it has some issues in how it would be developed.  The genesis of the scheme is as follows.  Part 8 planning permission was granted in 2007 and included car parking and underground car parking spaces.  If one were to start with a clean sheet of paper, one might not necessarily include such parking spaces, but they were included and there are certain costs associated with same.</p> <p>  On the overall scheme, the cost of the tender, including VAT, is &euro;45 million, which is significant.  There was a process engaged in with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in which certain costs were stripped out, while others were pared back.  I understand the county council will bear some of the costs.  Because of its nature, the scheme presents certain challenges.  Unfortunately, there is an issue with eradicating Japanese knotweed, while I have referred to other bits and pieces.  The cost of the scheme must be funded over a long period.</p><p>The Deputy asked if the loans had to be paid down over a short period of time.  The loan period with the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, is 40 years, which is unique in this context and is a significant element in keeping costs down.  The cost per unit is quite high in that scheme, even allowing for the fact that we have been able to access serviced sites funding, which was another part of the Deputy's question.  Serviced sites funding is being allocated to the scheme.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was successful in getting an allocation of &euro;4 million of Exchequer funding towards that.  Taking that into account and just looking at the 50 units which are cost rental units, because only they are eligible for the affordable element, the cost per home or apartment is still around &euro;260,000.  The units are apartments which, by their nature, are expensive, there are issues with the site and they have to be managed over a long period of time.  <br/><br/>I do not want to stand on anyone's toes in terms of the cost modelling but the long-term maintenance of those apartments, that is, keeping them in good condition over the long term, has been included in the modelling.  At periodic points over the 40-year model, allowance has been made for significant works to be undertaken to upgrade properties.  That is included in the rent.  Ignoring something like that could lead to problems down the line but that issue was not ignored.  In terms of the operational costs of the approved housing bodies, AHBs, involved, they looked at their costs and reduced them a little.  They took about 25% off their normal operational costs.  Again, it is an area that is somewhat unknown for them because they have not managed cost rental housing <i>per se</i>in the past.  There were a number of different aspects involved in bringing costs down.  The three main elements involved in bringing the quite sizeable capital costs down were the serviced sites fund, which was &euro;4 million over the 50 units; the 40-year cost of finance delivered by the HFA; and economies that were delivered by the AHBs in terms of paring back various costs.  While it would be nice to have a lower rental cost per unit, quite a lot of work went into getting it down to &euro;1,200.<br/><br/>Moving on to other issues raised, the question of using a capital advance leasing facility-like loan for cost rental has been discussed.  There has been interaction with the Department on that as a possibility.  Indeed, the Housing Agency's first paper on that possibility dates back to 2015.  There have been various iterations of cost or affordable rental models over the last number of years.  At the moment, the main tool that can be used to reduce costs is the serviced sites fund and that is what is being proposed at the moment.  The next question related to clarity on the equity charge in the affordable purchase scheme.  I will try to explain it simply.  If the equity at the outset is 25% and that equates to &euro;70,000 in terms of the price reduction today, it stays at 25% so as costs go up, it is indexed to market prices rather than inflation <i>per se</i>.  If the price of that house in ten years' time has gone up by &euro;100,000, the equity stake has gone up by &euro;25,000.  Basically, that is the way it works.  <br/><br/>The Deputy also asked a question on densities.  I am not a planner so I am not the most competent person to talk about densities.  That said, I did a few quick calculations relating to Enniskerry Road.  The density there is about 55 per hectare.</p></speech>

It is a seven acre site, roughly.</p><p>Probably post the national planning framework we will be looking to increase the density from that level on a site like the Enniskerry Road.  In terms of the restrictive use covenant of 70 years that has been put into the deed of transfer, there was a lot of back and forth in respect of the legal transfer of the site.  It was quite complicated for various reasons.  This might not be a great answer to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question but it ended up at 70 years.  In hindsight, we would like it to be longer.  The main lease that is currently in effect with the two approved housing bodies, AHBs, is a 150-year lease.  In future, we would link the two of them and have a longer covenant in terms of their use.  I think I have covered all the questions.</p></speech>

I will comment on the rental issue before I deal with affordable purchase.  In both presentations we are talking about getting a pilot project up and running which was announced in 2015.  We need to put the project in that context.  If we are going to deliver cost rental in real terms that will make a significant difference to people, we cannot continue at the pace we are going at present.  When one looks at the rental costs on the <i>daft.ie </i>report on rent affordability, one sees why this is crucial, particularly in Dublin as well as throughout the country.</p><p>In areas such as Walkinstown, Crumlin and Drimnagh, the average rent is approximately &euro;1,427 per month.  To purchase a home, if one were able to get a mortgage for a home of the same value, it would be about &euro;710 per month.  One is looking at a difference of just over 100%.  That is an example of how broken the rental market is.  That brings me back to affordable purchase.  A major part of resolving the crisis will be allowing people to be able to buy their homes.  I will revert to Mr. Baneham on the criterion for the affordable purchase scheme.  That scheme itself has not been fully agreed but I would be interested to get Mr. Baneham's opinion on it.</p><p>The National Development Fiance Agency, NDFA is assisting the local authorities on the following schemes, O'Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road, St Michael's Estate and Ballymastone.  Has the NDFA concluded its financial model and its work on that scheme with the local authorities?  I know the local authorities are engaging in the tender stage.  Is the NDFA happy that its financial model is completed or is it open to further change?  I ask Mr. O'Neill that in the context of the presentation.  If I take Ballymastone in particular, there is mention of 20% proposed for affordable purchase.  My understanding is that there is 20% social housing element in that scheme as well.  That is not mentioned in the presentation so I ask Mr. O'Neill to clarify the position.  Also in all of these schemes there is a Government model - one that my party does not agree with - which is that, effectively, we are looking at selling the remainder of the land.  In the case of Ballymastone, 60% of that estate will be private development.  In St Michael's estate, 70% is proposed for affordable rental and then there is the remainder of that site.  The Oscar Traynor Road site has been a long time on the go at this stage, 20% of which is proposed for affordable purchase.  What is happening to the remainder?  What does the financial model allow for that part of the site?</p><p>I ask each of the witnesses about the interaction of their agencies with the Land Development Agency, LDA, which is not set up on a statutory footing as of yet.  We are still awaiting the legislation to see how that agency will operate.  I know that Mr. Baneham of the Housing Development Agency has mentioned to the LDA specifically the areas of Naas in County Kildare and Skerries in County Dublin, which are effectively additional sites for development.  What is the LDA telling the Housing Development Agency what it wants to do with those two sites?  Cost rental housing has been mentioned.  Is that cost rental housing for delivery based on the Enniskerry Road pilot scheme?  Do we wait to see how the pilot scheme works when it gets up and running before we start to deliver the other cost rental schemes?  When one considers rents of &euro;1,200, I understand the rent that can be charged is just below market rate, which is not a great deal below market rate in many of these areas when one looks at the <i>daft.ie </i>report for the fourth quarter.</p><p>If this cost rental accommodation is delivered at &euro;1,200 a month, while it is welcome that it is less than the market rent, in many areas it will not be significantly less.  That is particularly the case in the areas where the accommodation is being built.  Perhaps the model needs to be looked at with reference to the term of the loan or subvention.<br/><br/>On the affordable purchase scheme, when do the agencies, particularly the Housing Agency, see the first affordable house actually being delivered?  This is a source of great frustration for me.  I do not want the delegates to stray into a policy area, but the negotiations to increase the serviced site fund to &euro;310 million over three years took a lot of time to complete.  It was not just to allow for a reduction in cost but also to establish the scheme.  I know that the four local authorities in Dublin have accepted and approved broad criteria for the scheme, but is Mr. Baneham happy that they are clear enough to allow him to cost it properly?  <br/><br/>As I have pointed out before, the income threshold for affordable housing for couples has been set at &euro;75,000.  That is a good combined income, but in many instances two people with decent jobs will have a combined income above that threshold.  They then find themselves in a situation where in Dublin they pay on average 40% of their net take-home pay in rent, if they are lucky enough to be able to rent.  Based on average income, a single person in Dublin pays rent equal to 58.8% of his or her net take-home pay.  That is based on the <i>daft.ie</i>report for the last quarter and does not take recent increases into account.  Nearly 60% of such a person's take-home pay goes on rent.  That is why it is really important that we give people other options in the areas of affordable rent and particularly affordable purchase.  The income threshold for an individual is &euro;50,000, which is fair, but the threshold of &euro;75,000 for a couple will knock many out of the affordable purchase scheme.  The Department tells me that this matter is under review by the Department of Finance.  Will Mr. Baneham advise me on how far he believes it has progressed?  <br/><br/>Is there a willingness to move above the threshold of &euro;75,000 or even to allow for regional affordability in the same way as it is allowed for under the housing assistance payment scheme, to which I will turn?  Could discretion be allowed at the level of the local authority on the basis of income levels and purchase prices in the relevant area?  The affordable housing scheme on which he has worked and which worked previously would allow for an equity stake.  Under that scheme it should be possible to sell houses for between &euro;160,000 and &euro;210,000, although they would be mainly sold for &euro;210,000 to &euro;230,000.  When does Mr. Baneham foresee the scheme being established across the country, particularly in areas in which there are issues of affordability such as in Dublin, Cork, Galway, and Waterford?  These issues are spreading across the country.</p></speech>

His first comment was on the pace of the project on Enniskerry Road.  It did take a long time.  Ideally, it would have been completed more quickly.  </p> <p>  On other schemes to deliver cost-rental accommodation, something the Deputy mentioned with reference to the Land Development Agency, it is not intended that everything will stop while results from the Enniskerry Road project are awaited.  How long should one wait after the scheme is operational as there is a need to press on?  That is definitely the aspiration of the Land Development Agency and the Housing Agency.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's more general point about the affordability of rent and mortgages, in many parts of Dublin renting is certainly more expensive than obtaining-----</p></speech>

The sites in Skerries and Devoy Park in Naas are of a manageable size.  Approximately 200 dwellings will be developed in each case, with a mix of social and cost rental housing.  Both sites will be retained in some form of State ownership.

It was not implemented for a period of time because it was felt during the recession that there was not as much of an affordability issue.  It was implemented more recently.

The four Dublin local authorities have in principle adopted the broad criteria for a scheme because each of them wants to have an affordable purchase scheme in its area.  Does the fact that the scheme has not been concluded make it difficult to cost it?  That is what I asked.  There is no final scheme.  Mr. O'Neill has spoken about schemes such as the Ballymastone scheme.  I referred to whether the financial model had been concluded because I am aware that the final scheme has not been concluded.</p></speech>

The modelling generally feeds in before the procurement phase is reached.  It depends on the tenure mix with which each local authority decides to go.  The Deputy is right in what he says about what the affordable element will look like after the procurement stage has been finalised.</p><p>The way we help local authorities and structure the competitions in terms of the evaluation we undertake is by making the social or affordable housing costs as keen as possible.  Local authorities take various views of the cost of affordable housing being bid for by developers or the prices being set by a local authority.  Differing approaches are being taken in that regard.</p></speech>

There was discussion of it being an income limit, but it has not been enacted and is not in regulations.  The legislation is more flexible in how it describes the way in which income limits are calculated.  There is a degree of complexity.  I might ask Mr. McCarthy to explain a little about it because it is not a one-size-fits-all policy.  That is how it is described in the legislation.  Obviously, it must be enacted in the regulations.  Mr. McCarthy may provide more detail in that regard.</p></speech>

It refers to mortgage payments not consuming more than 35% of the net annual household income and outlines what the notional mortgage payment would look like.  Such a payment has a 90% loan-to-value ratio and is based on the average purchase price a first-time buyer would pay in an administrative area.  That is the flexibility element to which Mr. Baneham referred.  It does not lend itself to strict national income limits.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I thank Mr. O'Neill for his very concise three-page report which is one of the shortest that has been presented to the committee.  He referred to his experience of working with Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, but he did not mention South Dublin County Council or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Has he been involved with the latter two councils or is he doing any work with them?  Perhaps it is optional and they do not require the assistance of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  As I do not know how it works, I ask him to touch on how the NDFA interfaces with county councils.</p> <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien raised the issue of the Land Development Agency not being a legal entity.  The Government indicated that it required at least 30% of land released from central controlled bodies to be utilised for affordable housing.  In addition, it stated provision woull be increased by the 10% Part V properties and could be further increased through co-operation with landowners.  The importance of the Land Development Agency and its relationship with other bodies, including local authorities, is critical.  There is a suggestion legislation dealing with the Land Development Agency will shortly be brought through the Houses, which is very important and must be welcomed.  Great fanfare accompanied the launch by the Government of the Land Development Agency, with the allocation of &euro;1.25 billion which was to be used to quickly develop 150,000 new homes.  There was great excitement and press releases were issued.  Of course, that took place in September 2018 and progress has been slow since.  I send that broader message to Members of the Houses.  </p> <p>  Mr. Baneham referred to land in Enniskerry that was provided for the Housing Agency at no cost.  However, there was a substantial cost attached to that land.  Is he aware of the initial cost of it? The suggestion in a one-line throwaway remark that it was given to the Housing Agency at no cost is correct because there was a cost somewhere along the line.  When considering the unit cost of properties, we must bear in mind the overall cost of a site.</p><p>Yes, there were constraints.  I acknowledge that the Housing Agency did a lot of work and everyone involved helped to pare back the cost substantially, which fed into the delays.  However, I welcome the fact that we are now going to see units there.  Perhaps the witnesses could talk about the acquisition costs and tell us again the cost of each of the residential units.</p><p> I refer to the developments in Skerries, Dublin and Devoy Park in Naas.  Again this concerns the role and function of the Land Development Agency or other State interests.  That ultimately will determine the outcome.  For example, I refer to the 30% requirement I mentioned, the additional 10% accounted for by Part V properties and the additional units that will become available through the co-operation of landowners.  That is all critical.  The Government has major landbanks and resources.  Those belong to the State.  We need to maximise their potential for affordable and social housing.  While the Land Development Agency has a commercial remit, we have to be realistic about that.  Everyone welcomes the mixed tenure and mixed housing which is envisaged.  That is important for a range of reasons.  However, we need a lot more clarity.  Will the representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, elaborate on the agency's relationship with the Land Development Agency?  The witnesses have told us that the agency has agreed to provide these three sites in Skerries, Dublin and Kildare.  On what conditions are these sites provided?  The NDFA set specific requirements for the provision of long-term cost rental housing on these sites.  What conditions have been set?  Will the witnesses elaborate on those?  How can the NDFA be sure they will be enforced and adhered to?  I ask the representatives to tell us that in the context of Government policy on the use of State lands.</p></speech>

I am not competent to talk about certain elements of the Land Development Agency.  Some questions are more appropriate for the Land Development Agency itself.  However, I can certainly talk about our interaction with it.  Before I go on to that, Senator Boyhan asked about the cost of the land on Enniskerry Road.  He is correct.  It does have a value.  There is a cost to the State in providing it for zero cost.  A recent evaluation undertaken for our own accounting purposes valued the site at around &euro;8 million.  It is being provided for social and cost rental purposes with no additional costs being passed on to the project, but it is worth at least &euro;8 million.</p></speech>

The Senator also referred to the cost of each residential dwelling within the scheme.  The overall cost of the scheme is between &euro;53 million and &euro;54 million and this includes construction costs of around &euro;45 million or &euro;46 million, design team fees, contributions to utilities, development levies and a plethora of other costs, some of which are associated with the construction period such as finance etc.  This divides into approximately &euro;340,000 per unit, on average.  Because of the typology of the site and the dwellings, they are not the cheapest homes that can be delivered.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan also asked how we might place controls over the transfer of lands.  Enniskerry Road was an example of this and we intend to do something similar.  As for where we are with the LDA, we do not have a legal document setting out in detail what the constraint would be.  Naas is an example of what we want to happen, as the owner of the land.  It has capacity for approximately 200 homes, close to the existing town centre and to the local authority offices.  There is not much in the way of apartments or rental accommodation in the middle of Naas.  We would like to have 10% as social housing, as is required by legislation, with the balance to be cost rental accommodation, meaning the land would be entirely a rental development.  The long-term ownership of the site would be kept within a State entity.  The LDA is receptive to that and has not raised any objections of which I am aware.</p></speech>

Are there any sites where the agency has failed to come to an arrangement that is financially viable in any local authorities?  What is his general opinion of the whole procurement process?  Is it delivering value for money or is it delaying the delivery of housing?  I believe the procurement process is one of the stumbling blocks to the delivery of housing.  The four projects we are looking at are all on State land but a significant proportion will be given to the private sector to deliver housing.  Is this the correct use of State land?  Is it the correct policy?  As a State, should we not be able to deliver our housing on our own land?  We all accept that cost rental is cheaper than market rent but it is still not affordable, at &euro;1,200 for a two-bedroomed house.  Can Mr. Baneham say what measures do we need to take to get it to affordable rent?  What are the stumbling blocks in relation to affordability?  We can all talk about red tape, regulations, development levies, utilities etc.  Is land cost not the single biggest issue challenging us today?  What do we need to do about that?  Until we face up to the cost of land, we will never get to affordability, either in the context of renting or purchasing.</p><p>What do we need to do in relation to land?</p></speech>

He mentioned land costs but I would add the construction market and construction costs to those as well.  The sites we are looking at are viable but the cost depends on the tenure mix and the delivery model, be it cost rental or affordable purchase.  To give an example, affordable purchase for apartments may not work because of the requirements relating to the cost of building, whereas the cost rental model, given the rental yields, may be a more attractive model in that respect.  It is about looking at the different options.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that procurement processes probably take too long and we see it across all the delivery models on which we are working.  They cannot be avoided, however, and while they are difficult, we try to bring to bear our experience of other delivery models and try to make them as streamlined as possible.  There are, unfortunately, set requirements, be they 12, 15, or 18 months longer for procurement delivery on these projects.  From a policy perspective, we are advising on various different products and offerings on these sites.  We are certainly not saying the sites we mentioned are a panacea or a way to deliver everything.  While there is a private element to these sites, the State is getting back a contribution for that private piece which it can use to reinvest.</p> <p>  There is a significant social element to these schemes.  To answer the Deputy's question on the social mix, there is generally 30% social housing on these sites as well.  Local authorities also specify the nominees for the ultimate purchasers of those sites, which is important.  The procurements are not structured in such a way that the private sector or market just runs and develops the private piece as it sees fit.  That is the benefit of the procurement process.  The sites have to be progressed in line with the aspirations, technical and planning quality, and tenure mix the local authorities have in mind.  The local authorities bring that element of control throughout the development process.  </p></speech>

At the moment, the Enniskerry Road land is in the ownership of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, but the arrangement will pass the ownership on to approved housing bodies, AHBs, which are regulated social housing providers.  That is an example of land being managed long-term by AHBs.  The intention with the other proposals in Skerries and Naas is that their long-term ownership will be controlled by the State and will not be passed on.  We have other models, and there has been some interaction with the NDFA on one of them.  It relates to market purchases on the site in Westmeath but it could be adopted or rolled out further in respect of affordable purchases, where a developer will undertake a development but the land is only transferred to the ultimate purchaser and the developer does not take possession of it at all.  The person who gets the land after the dwellings have been built is the person who is buying the house.  There are definitely ways the State can keep control of land into the future and only pass it on to the end user.  That is an operational scheme.</p> <p>  There are particular constraints regarding the Enniskerry Road site in terms of making cost rental more affordable.  The other sites are more benign in their characteristics and consequently, we are optimistic that we could achieve better results in that regard.  The land we are using is from the land aggregation scheme, so the State did pay for it, and in passing the land on at no cost, the State is effectively providing a subsidy.  That is the case with the Enniskerry Road site, as well as with the other sites I mentioned.</p><p>Where a large parcel of land is being passed on, as with the bigger development in Balbriggan, for instance, it might be deemed appropriate to have a private-purchase element or a price put on it.  Alternatively, there might be a commercial element, as it might be deemed appropriate for a parcel of land large enough to have an Aldi, Lidl or other development to have an economic value put on it.</p><p> On the broader issue of land, the focus of the Land Development Agency is trying to assemble land from the NDFA, some local authorities and other commercial entities from the State sector.  Land values are definitely a significant barrier to affordability.  I do not have a simple answer as to how to deal with that, unfortunately.</p></speech>

Affordable housing is important, particularly now that we are in a housing crisis.  The main issue facing us is that of the people who fall between the cracks.  They do not qualify to go on the local housing list and therefore are paying up to &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 per month and do not qualify for a mortgage.  This has left a massive hole in housing, particularly affordable housing.  Progress needs to be made as quickly as possible because there are those who have no help and are caught.  This is the only area in which we can give back to them.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Neill said the NDFA is providing financial advice to a number of local authorities seeking to develop housing schemes on their lands.  He only mentioned four in particular, which are, of course, Dublin-based.  I am aware that we are very much focusing on Dublin here but I always feel rural areas need to be considered also.  We have 31 local authorities, all of which have landbanks and all of which provide a massive service to everybody.  What other local authorities are being dealt with?  It is important that we do not focus on Dublin alone.  I understand we need to focus on it but, when the notes suggest everything is Dublin this or Dublin that, the rest of Ireland always feels forgotten.  As a Carlow person who is always making representations, particularly regarding affordable housing, I believe this needs to be addressed.  What other local authorities are being dealt with?</p> <p>  Let me talk in general.  One of the major issues is that there are many landbanks around Ireland.  Do the delegates often come up against resistance to development?  Recently in my area, certain builders were dealing with the approved housing bodies.  This is another area on which the Government seems to be focusing, rather than building itself.  It seems to be looking to all the approved housing bodies.  What can we do better with landbanks through legislation?  Is there anything we can do to help local authorities?  Is there anything we can do to make this go quicker?</p> <p>  When affordable housing is mentioned, it is felt we are helping those who are not able to get on the housing list or obtain the mortgages they are looking for.  Could the delegation come back to me on the landbanks?</p> <p>  We must not have circumstances in which developers have no incentive to provide affordable units.  We need affordable units, as we need homes.  Are we providing them?  What incentives are we providing in this regard?  We need to make sure the homes are built and are built really quickly.  Could one of the witnesses revert to me on that?</p> <p>  One size does not fit all.  Many individuals were speaking to me lately about housing and building houses.  We need to consider a broader range and affordability but we also need to give people the option of having an affordable house that they want and can afford.  A lady said to me recently she had to move out of Dublin because she cannot afford a mortgage.  She cannot even afford an affordable house because she is renting.  She cannot afford to rent in Dublin.  What we are doing is basing everything on one particular area.  Instead, we need to deliver in others.  We need to deliver affordable housing in Carlow and other areas where people are crying out for it.  The delegates might respond to these points as many of the questions I was going to ask have been answered.</p><p>I believe the issue of affordable housing will be of great significance in the future.  It is significant for young people starting off.  Nurses and teachers, for example, who are paying between &euro;1,300 and &euro;1,400 a month in rent, cannot save and, as a result, cannot get a mortgage from the banks.  We need to ensure these are the people who get affordable housing.</p></speech>

We are trying to support as many local authorities as possible.  To give the Senator a flavour, we are working with Westmeath, Kildare, Wicklow and talking to Sligo, Donegal, Kerry and Cork county councils.  We are trying to stretch ourselves out as broadly as possible.  The Senator can rest assured in that respect.</p> <p>  We spoke about affordable policy and when that will come into play.  That will happen but the biggest enemy, to me, is time.  It is about the length of time to get these schemes to procurement.  From our perspective, we are encouraging local authorities, which are looking at sites to start the ball rolling by getting master plans and planning prepared for them.  Not only does it de-risk sites, it gets the process up and running as quickly as possible.  That is the key message we are giving.</p></speech>

Initially, when this was made available, the first call for proposals was restricted to ten local authorities.  It was then broadened to 19 local authorities.  It has not been made available to all local authorities, however, including the Senator&rsquo;s.  It is a tool to assist a local authority in being able to make housing more affordable for people in its locality.</p> <p>  The thinking behind the restriction is to concentrate on areas where the affordability issue is at its most pronounced.  The Department had a circular in October last year where it sought submissions from local authorities to demonstrate the affordability issues they had in their areas.  This allowed the Department to decide whether it needed to broaden this out.  It did but, unfortunately, Carlow was not included.</p> <p>  In making housing more affordable, the current tool is the serviced sites fund.  We understand there will be a further call and it might be made available to other local authorities.</p> <p>  We are in favour of people having an option to purchase, as well as to rent if the cost rental model gets off the ground and becomes a bigger thing.  On incentives to private developers to deliver affordable housing, the legislation is in place with Part V but it is not currently activated.  It is focused on social housing.</p> <p>  The agency has some lands in Carlow and will have a meeting with the local authority next week to try to develop them.</p></speech>

I look at a site like Shanganagh and wonder where the hell the houses are.  This goes on and on.  There are interesting conversations going on about financial modelling but nothing happens.  I, along with the people in the area, wonder when this nonsense is going to end.  I am trying to get to the bottom of this.  I admit I have learned some stuff and thank the witnesses for their presentations.  At the end of it, however, I still cannot quite figure out what is the problem in getting people onto a site in Shanganagh where the local people have been screaming for housing for six years.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Neill of the NDFA earlier stated it had some involvement in advising the council on financial modelling.</p><p>Can that issue be elaborated on?  What exactly is going on?</p><p> Reference was made to the site on Enniskerry Road and a cost rental figure of &euro;1,200 a month, which is ridiculous.  People who need affordable rental properties but cannot get on the housing list because their income is too high cannot, for the most part, afford to pay &euro;1,200 a month.  That will not work for them.  All of this work has been done and there is all of this complexity, yet at the end of the day the cost is not affordable for those who need affordable rental properties.  I would like to get to the bottom of that conundrum if the delegates have any comment to make about it.  </p><p> This is ultimately a policy matter, but would the following observation have any relevance?  With reference to every single site, the delegates are saying they must take into consideration the particular costs associated with the site, market conditions in terms of rent and the question of what is actually affordable.  That is completely the wrong way to go about it as it complicates matters.  It means that the position on every single site becomes extremely complicated because one has to take into account all of the different things.  Surely it would be simpler to ask what is affordable relative to people's incomes.  It is 30% or 35% of income.  It is the same in the case of affordable purchase - 30% to 35% of income.  We should simply put in the necessary capital, or extend the loans, or provide for a combination of both, to ensure every site will deliver affordable housing with a definition that is universal.  In other words, it would not depend on those specific conditions because, if it did, it would not be affordable in many cases because of the particularities of the site, site servicing costs or the cost of dealing with Japanese knotweed.  It is ridiculous that the cost of dealing with Japanese knotweed is going to change the level of affordable rent.  Do the delegates agree that it is ridiculous?  We must say what is actually affordable for the people for whom we are trying to deliver affordable housing, whether for purchase or rent.  I would appreciate a comment on that issue, specifically about the site at Shanganagh.</p><p> I have two other brief questions.  To what extent, if any, is either of the agencies interacting with NAMA on sites?  Is it not at all?  To what extent, if any, is either of the agencies dealing with the affordable component of private developments where there has been local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding?  What is happening is unclear.  The State is putting LIHAF funding into strategic development zones and other developments, private developments in some cases and a mix of both in others.  There is supposed to be an affordable housing dividend, but it is unclear how many affordable houses we are actually getting for LIHAF funding.  It seems to be linked with market conditions.  What does "affordable" mean?  There does not seem to be clarity on that issue.  In the original documents the Government put out, LIHAF funding was to be used to deliver a figure of 40% on any development approved for the provision of such funding to provide affordable housing, but that has vanished.  We do not have a clue what we are getting for LIHAF funding.</p></speech>

It was really about presenting the council with different options which might or might not work.  I cannot say much more.  It is a number of months since we made that analysis which is now with the council for decision or progression.  We have not done anything in that respect for the past few months.</p></speech>

We are still trying to progress these schemes.  We are waiting for the legislation to come through to see what can potentially work on these sites.  From my perspective, on that particular site, cost rental emerged as a really viable opportunity for that site and from the perspective of keeping it in State ownership as well.  It ticks a number of boxes.</p> <p>  Returning to the Deputy's second point, there is a distinction between cost rental and affordable rental.</p></speech>

The concept has to be proven.  Mr. Baneham referred to Enniskerry Road as the pathfinde, if one likes, with St. Michael's and Shanganagh, maybe, to follow.

That is what it set out in legislation in terms of the affordable purchase scheme.  In our opening statement, the aspiration is that this is one's limit at the point of entry for paying one's mortgage or rent and that, over time, that would a become lower proportion of one's income.</p> <p>  In terms of the theory behind affordability there is a good understanding of what we are trying to achieve.  Regarding a rent of &euro;1,200 in Enniskerry, I have discussed this on a number of occasions.  There are households in that area who will be very keen to access that.  They would have to be just a little bit further above the income limits for social housing.  For a couple earning a particular income in the region of, maybe, &euro;55,000 at the point of entry, they could still be paying 35% of income, or slightly less.  Could we get it lower on another site?  Yes, I would hope that we would be able to get it lower.</p> <p>  On the broader point made by the Deputy that the current system that we are trying to operate is based on specific site characteristics and local market conditions and then trying to achieve what is affordable, that is essentially what we are trying to do.  There is not what the Deputy might describe as a broad brush approach towards setting a standard across the country and backfilling the funding behind that.</p></speech>

I am aware that this point has been brought up elsewhere.  In the case of the Enniskerry Road location, the neighbouring apartments are much more expensive to rent.  There is little risk when putting those on the market but that they will be rented.  In other areas &euro;1,200 is more than the market rent so they would not rent there.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that there is a degree, if not quite a lot, of complexity in the way it is being developed at the moment.</p></speech>

We can make light of things but that is not the big cost on the site.  One is hitting pure granite on a sloping site there, the excavation of which is very expensive.  It would set us back a number of years in terms of getting on site if one was to take out the underground parking. </p></speech>

I am delighted to say that when I passed by the site at the weekend, although it was not operational, there were two machines on site.  They were doing mainly site investigation work and I am happy that this is happening.  There is momentum to make it work.  Ideally, we would be further down the road with the affordable purchase side of things but it is happening after a period of delay.</p></speech>

For the local authorities where there is natural affordability, is the agency asked to help in any shape or form?  Is there a requirement to intervene?</p></speech>

There is a natural affordable element to that site but it has only a private and social mix.  We are advising multiple other local authorities outside Dublin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.588" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019061800002#V00500"><p>I have a couple of supplementary questions.  To labour the point, on the basis of the Housing Agency's own definition of affordability given at the start, and the generally accepted definition, someone would need a monthly net income of &euro;3,650 or a weekly income of &euro;842.  I emphasis that because Enniskerry Road will happen; it is on-site.  The next big project will be St. Michael's and it seems that everyone in the room is suggesting it would be much better if the rents were lower than &euro;1,200 a month.  We need to try to make sure that with St. Michael's, that is achieved.  Although St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore does not have the site-specific problems of Enniskerry Road, the European Investment Bank loan is over a much shorter time.  The challenge therefore is less to do with the site-specific stuff and more to do with the financing.  That is why these contributions are so important.</p> <p>  I have a couple of technical questions about Enniskerry Road.  Will the witnesses from the Housing Agency talk us through the management and maintenance formula in order that we can get a sense of what that adds to the tender price mentioned at the start in terms of the overall costs?  The tender price mentioned was &euro;45 million.  Is that just for construction, is it for construction and site servicing or are other costs built in to that?  It gives a unit price of around &euro;300,000, which is substantially above the average cost for apartments built by the state.  Is it, as the Chairman suggested, to do with the granite and the car parking or are other costs rolled in?  </p> <p>  In relation to Enniskerry Road, and specifically St. Michael's, how do we get the price down?  Entry-level rent gets cheaper over time only if one's income rises.  For a lot of modest-income workers, their incomes are the least likely to rise sufficiently over time.  There is no guarantee that somebody will get much benefit ten years in if their income remains the same.  For example, with Enniskerry Road, if the site service allocation had been doubled to &euro;8 million or &euro;12 million, how much would that have allowed the entry-level rent to be brought down?  I am exceptionally concerned about St. Michael's.  Whatever about the peculiarities of Enniskerry Road, if St. Michael's comes in at &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,200, people will see cost rental as an unaffordable option. </p> <p>  Is it a 25-year EIB loan and will that cause difficulty for entry-level rents?  By how much would the maturity of the loan need to be extended to bring rents below the &euro;900 mark?  By how much would the serviced sites fund need to be increased?  I am not asking for an opinion, but the committee needs to hear the options.</p><p> Finally, I would love to see some of those spreadsheets for the different options and I imagine other committee members would as well.  I do not know if the agency representatives are in a position to share them with us but, if so, the committee would benefit from sight of them.  For example, could we could see the details of the Enniskerry Road development after it is all signed and completed?  The more detailed information we have, the better we will understand it.  The crucial question with the Enniskerry Road and St. Michael's Estate projects is what it would take to bring the figures down to between &euro;700 and &euro;900 in terms of increased capital or longer loan maturities, especially in the case of St. Michael's Estate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019061800002#W00200"><p>I wish to follow on briefly with a question on cost rental.  Let us consider the figure of &euro;1,200 for Enniskerry Road in the context of the average income in Dublin.  As a percentage of net take home pay, that figure is approximately 42% for a single earner.  It is far above what would be deemed the affordable level of one third, or between 30% and 35%, of net take home pay.  That is significant and the agency representatives get the picture from the members that this is a concern when we are discussing a Government scheme of cost rental.  The figure is less than Dublin market rates.  However, if we take the average throughout all of Dublin, as per the Residential Tenancies Board, we are nearing a figure of &euro;2,000.  The view that it is below market rate when the market is so inflated is a problem and I think the agency representatives understand that.  That is one point.</p> <p>  I wanted to ask the NDFA representatives specifically about St. Michael's Estate.  A total of 70% is proposed for affordable rental housing.  Who gave the figure of 70% to the agency?  Was that a direction from the Department?  Mr. O'Neill might wish to answer that.</p> <p>  I have one final question for Mr. Baneham.  He referenced Castlelands, which is a large site in Balbriggan.  We found out today that it is not currently with the LDA and is still with the Housing Agency.  A master plan was issued and published by Fingal County Council.  It is closed for public consultation at this stage but it will come back to the local authority in September.  What percentages of rental and cost rental housing are proposed for the Castlelands site?  What percentages of social and affordable and private purchase housing are proposed for Castlelands?  What is the figure for the total number of units from the perspective of the Housing Agency?  I realise that is rather parochial, but it is important because it is the largest site in respect of which there is a proposed transfer to the LDA.  Obviously, we must ensure that we take into account the wider issues in the area when we are considering cost rental, affordable and social housing.</p></speech>

The Housing Agency and NDFA representatives might not have specific answers to some of the questions.  That is okay, but they may wish to send them to the committee afterwards and we can then circulate them to members.  Senator Boyhan is next.</p></speech>

No one disagrees with that and the point is worth emphasising.</p> <p>  Is the Housing Agency still in the business of acquiring lands or properties?  If so, is there an inventory of those properties?  The agency was involved in the past in acquiring properties.  There is always a conflict when State agencies acquire built properties.  There can be an issue in terms of affordability, the market and competition.  I acknowledge circumstances have changed in recent years but it was an issue with the Housing Agency previously, as was the issue of how the agency acquires property.  Is there an inventory of housing sites?  Reference was made to a site in Carlow, and that came as a surprise to my colleague.  Is there a national inventory of Housing Agency sites and properties?  If so, can it be made available to the committee?</p></speech>

The projects mentioned by Mr. Baneham and Mr. O'Neill are more like pilot schemes for the rest of us to learn from.  It is crucial that they are done right and that they give people the opportunity to afford a house.  All of us will probably learn lessons from them from now on.  They will be pilot schemes for the rest of the country.  It is crucial that we get them right.</p></speech>

What are the different sources of finance and what sort of variability is there in the cost at different times and overall in these projects?</p> <p>  Elaborating on an earlier question, everything that the agency is doing seems to be based on particular sites.  It makes me, and others, think that it does not have a remit for dealing with the overall crisis in affordable housing, but only for particular sites.  Will Mr. Baneham explain, because it seems quite random?  The agency gets particular sites, but why does it get those and not others?  How does it fit into some sort of overall plan to deal with the crisis in affordable housing and rental?  Does it relate in any general sense to the targets, such as the national housing output targets of 25,000?  Is the agency supposed to deliver a certain amount of cost rental or affordable housing as part of that output on a year-by-year basis?  If so, what is it?  Does the agency select the sites?  Does the Government select the sites for it?  I am not clear how it fits into a bigger project to solve the housing crisis.</p></speech>

The construction cost is &euro;45 million including VAT.  That is what was tendered, the bricks and mortar, concrete and so on.  Other costs such as fees are outside that.  On the operational side, we have a base model with approved housing bodies for how they model and maintain social housing stock.  That was the starting point when we looked at Enniskerry Road and where the proposals came in from Tuath and Respond.  It is quite similar in that many of the same things happen.  One must replace the windows after 20 years or whatever.  That type of model was the basis and they have their own operational and overhead costs, etc.  That was examined and pared back a bit, particularly in terms of the overhead costs.  Things that were not pared back include the replacement of infrastructure, which was left unadjusted.  Over time that is a significant element in overall costs, but I cannot give the Deputy a quick figure.  I may be able to follow up with something in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about what could make a big difference.  I was thinking about making a quick calculation but am nervous about doing so.</p></speech>

On the serviced sites fund, &euro;4 million over 50 units is &euro;80,000.  If that was &euro;120,000 it would definitely make an impact.  It would be at least &euro;100 a month.  I will have to come back on that.  We might come back with a scenario case, where if it was another amount it would have a bigger impact.  The length of the loan did have a big impact.  Our initial modelling was 25 years and went out to 40 years.  For loans longer than 40 years, modelling has been done.</p><p>The NDFA has examined modelling on 50-year terms.  One can model a loan for any period but one has to get somebody to give the loan.  We had to get something in place with the HFA in that regard.  Longer loans reduce the cost and the payback per year or month but one has to get a lender to give one the money.  We could give examples of that.</p><p> With regard to &euro;1,200 being 42% of income in Dublin, I am guessing that may be an individual's income.</p></speech>

We are not buying land.  The land we have was transferred through the land aggregation scheme or through the NBA, which we effectively absorbed.</p> <p>  We are buying property.  We are buying housing under Rebuilding Ireland.  I will not talk too much about that but it is actively happening under the &euro;70 million fund.  We also do some specific work for local authorities in regard to homelessness provision.</p> <p>  With regard to getting a national inventory of the agency's land, it is in a couple of places.  Rebuilding Ireland has a map on a website and one can look at more than 700 parcels of land owned by local authorities.  The Housing Agency's land is a subdivision of that.  It is on the website so one can go to any local authority area and see what we have by clicking a little icon.  We also have a document.  I was just checking our website, which I probably should not have been doing.  I cannot find out where it is; it has changed in the past couple of days.  We have put on it a strategic development management plan that covers all our lands and gives quite a bit of detail on each site.  That is available for anybody to download.</p> <p>  I will let the NDFA talk about the cost of finance.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on there being no joined-up plan, while we consider individual sites, the high-level framework exists under the legislation.  The regulations are partially in place and the rest will be in place in the autumn.  That is a framework in respect of approaching affordability regarding purchases.</p> <p>  With regard to cost rental, we are at an earlier stage.  It is a pilot stage.  The policies are still not developed but there will be a framework in place.  I hope it will make that a bit clearer in due course.</p></speech>

That would have been decided in discussion with Dublin City Council, which asked us to model on that basis, with the remaining 30% for social housing.   We modelled on the basis of 25 years for the EIB.  To be open about it, this was done last year.  To go back to Mr. Baneham's point about interest for the Pathfinder project, it is looking at it on a longer basis, and that is what we are trying to do too.</p> <p>  It might be helpful for the committee if I go back to the point about timing.  In St. Michael's, the design is being looked at; then it has to get planning; and then a developer has to come in.  We are talking about years.  We are aware of that, and it will be quite some time before we lock in that funding.  Our role is to make sure that it is as competitive as possible.  That is why we are looking not at the private sector but at what is available to the State, whether through the HFA or the EIB lending directly to local authorities.  We look at whatever gives the State the best options.  </p> <p>  Upfront capital funding was mentioned as a potential way to reduce the rents.  We have looked also at interest-only portions of the debt in recognition that the assets have a capital value at the end of their life as well.  </p></speech>

I am joined today by Ms Catherine Keenan who is the director of housing for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has historically been and remains one of the most expensive parts of Dublin, and indeed the State, in which to purchase or rent a home.  The county has excellent transport links in the form of the Luas and the DART.  That transport infrastructure is one of the key drivers for premium prices.</p> <p> D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council saw the fastest surge in prices in the capital in July 2018, with prices rising by 9.8%.  In contrast, South Dublin County Council saw an increase of just 5.2%.  The median price for Dublin as a whole was &euro;360,000 in July, while in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council it was &euro;527,000.  That compares with &euro;320,000 for Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council.</p><p>The affordability problem is therefore particularly severe in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and it is very important that the council would seek to maximise affordability on its own lands.  The council approved an affordable scheme of priority at its meeting of 13 May 2019.  Further regulations are required from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government with regard to qualifying criteria and income limits.</p><p> D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has a limited landbank comprising 55 ha, of which 42 ha are available for housing, including the Shanganagh Castle site which is 11.2 ha overall, of which 8.7 ha are for residential purposes.  One third of the portfolio is classified as urban infill and is served by public infrastructure and facilities necessary to provide housing.  However, a significant proportion of the land portfolio is located on unserviced land.  The southern part of the county and adjoining areas in north Wicklow have major water supply and foul drainage network deficits.  Proposals for new water supply and sewerage schemes are being progressed through Irish Water.  Lands at Old Conna, Rathmichael and adjoining areas in north Wicklow, which have major water supply and drainage deficits, will be serviced as part of the future implementation of the Old Conna-Woodbrook water and drainage schemes which is needed to unlock the development potential of the area.  It is expected that analysis of the capacity of the foul drainage network will be completed in late 2020.  Irish Water received planning permission in January 2019 to construct the Ballyman reservoirs and associated trunk main.  Roads infrastructure in these areas also need to be addressed.</p><p> With regard to current projects, I am aware that the Enniskerry Road site was referenced by the Housing Agency earlier today.  That scheme is a pathfinder project in Rebuilding Ireland and as such is a cost rental pilot supported by the Department.  The project will see the first of the homes delivered under the cost rental model in the country, commencing on site in June 2019 with full completion expected at the end of 2021.  The project, which had prior Part 8 planning approval, was developed up to tender stage by D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for construction of 155 social and affordable homes, a community facility and green spaces, and it is the result of a collaboration between D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Housing Agency, Respond and T&uacute;ath housing associations, and the Housing Finance Agency.  Financial support is also being provided by the Department through the serviced sites fund for the cost rental homes.  Respond and T&uacute;ath will carry out the project as development agents for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on land provided by the Housing Agency under the land aggregation scheme.  The Enniskerry Road scheme comprises 50 cost rental homes and 105 social homes to be apportioned between Respond and T&uacute;ath.  The homes will be a mix of one, two and three-bedroom properties.  All of the 50 cost rental homes will be two-bedroom apartments.  The Department intends to develop a national policy approach to cost rental in Ireland based on the learnings from the cost rental pilot in Enniskerry.</p><p> D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is working in partnership with the Loughlinstown Co-operative Housing Society and Co-operative Housing Ireland, CHI, in an innovative approach to housing delivery which will provide for 42 homes, comprising eight co-op and 34 social homes, on lands provided by the council at Loughlinstown Wood.  CHI has obtained planning permission for the overall scheme and the project has been tendered.  Tender evaluation is currently taking place.  CHI has obtained planning permission for the 42 dwellings and is in the process of tendering the contract.  CHI will also project manage during construction.  On-site construction is expected to commence in quarter 3 of 2019 with completion in quarter 2 of 2021.</p><p> In consideration of future projects, the lands at Ballyogan Court are residual lands left over from the construction of the M50 motorway.  The proposed development provides for 119 quality dwellings with a mix of home types comprising 52 apartments and 67 houses.  Part 8 planning was approved by the council on 7 June 2019.  The scheme will be progressed as rapid build and preparation for tender is under way.  A serviced sites fund application has been submitted to the Department for the provision of infrastructure associated with the affordable homes.  The scheme will provide a mix of social and affordable dwellings for sale, cost rental or both.  The number of each home type, size and location will be informed by the outcome of the second call for the serviced sites fund, the financial model and the development route.</p><p> St. Laurence&rsquo;s Park is the current home of Stillorgan library and 16 vacant maisonettes, recently fully de-tenanted, which are in need of extensive refurbishment.  The site is adjacent to the Stillorgan Leisureplex and the N11 Stillorgan Road.  The library, housed in a prefabricated building, is one of the busiest in the county.  The proposal for the development of the site provides for residential development of 89 social and affordable homes and a new library.  The scheme will provide a mix of social and affordable housing for sale, cost rental or both.  The number of each home type, size and location will be informed by the outcome of the second call for the serviced sites fund, the financial model and the development route.</p><p>The council commissioned a revised cost-effectiveness analysis, as requested by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which informs the stage 2 application which has been submitted.</p><p> The Shanganagh Castle lands are located on the southern side of Shankill.  The local area plan, adopted in July 2017, cleared the way for detailed master planning in the area.  Residential development is being supported by the provision of substantial new road and rail transport infrastructure under the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and by the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Woodbrook-Shanganagh is also a major urban housing delivery site.  The Woodbrook-Shanganagh local area plan requires the delivery of a new DART station at Woodbrook, midway between Bray and Shankill, with a cost of between &euro;4 million and &euro;5 million.  The NTA&rsquo;s Transport Strategy 2016-2035 includes the provision of a rail station at Woodbrook.  On road infrastructure, there are localised improvements or upgrades required to the Dublin road corridor between the Wilford interchange and the Woodbrook-Shanganagh local area plan lands, which will be informed by the outcome of the NTA core bus corridor study.</p><p> A cross-party proposal for 200 social and 340 affordable homes was agreed at the council meeting of 4 September 2017.  As part of the development of the project, the need to establish strong governance procedures and protocols is required.  A cost-effectiveness analysis in conjunction with a multi-criteria assessment was undertaken on the proposal.  The analysis was submitted as part of the stage 1 approval.  It highlighted that there were difficulties with affordability, in particular with apartments.  The estimated cost of developing the Shanganagh Castle site is approximately &euro;132 million without any affordability subsidy.  The executive has been working with the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, and the Land Development Agency, LDA, to examine delivery options.  It is intended that the scheme will comprise a mix of social, affordable purchase, and cost rental.  The master plan for the site is nearing completion, and thereafter preparations will commence for planning.  It is expected that the project will be ready to proceed to planning in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p> D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council welcomes the prospect of delivering affordable homes in the county and is working actively in collaboration with the development partners on two mixed tenure sites, which will deliver 50 cost rental homes and eight affordable purchase homes.  Future projects at design and planning stages will provide mixed tenure sites with provision for between 400 and 420 affordable or cost rental homes.  The number of each home type, size and location will be informed by the outcome of the second call for the serviced sites fund, the financial model, and the development route.  The council has already maximised or is at design stages for the bulk of our viable serviced lands.  The provision of housing, both social and affordable, on the remainder of council lands is dependent on major infrastructure being in place.</p><p> Ms Keenan and I between us will be happy to take questions of this submission.</p></speech>

Our paths have crossed.  I am familiar with them and, I am sure, they are with me.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the enormous work of housing authorities and their personnel, which we do not say often enough and despite what others may say.  While many of us are passionate and make strong cases for people who are on social housing lists and are seeking affordable housing, we all have personal experiences and stories and we bring them to the table.  In all of that, exchanges can be quite heated but people are always motivated by trying to help others, which is important.  On the other side of that is the front-line staff housing, which I acknowledge.  That is sometimes lost on me, speaking for myself, but in the heat of the moment we all want to do things.  I am constantly being contacted by people outside of Dublin with major issues that go way beyond housing needs.  There are complexities around housing needs and homelessness, as our guests know well.  I wish to put on the record today the enormous work being done under very difficult circumstances.  It is not a nice place to be at a hatch turning people away all the time.</p> <p>  I want to keep to broad brush strokes and am conscious that there are two local authorities here.  The one thing that we all agree on is at that the cost of land is a barrier to affordability.  Affordable housing is what is on the agenda here today.  We are conscious that there are landbanks in both authorities present.  I am particularly interested in a number of matters, one of which is that I have been constantly tracking the auditors.</p><p>The local government auditor recently appeared before the committee and addressed concerns related to how we documented, mapped and took account of State properties, particularly in each local authority area.  What progress has been made in that regard?  Is there potential to submit or surrender this land or make it available?  I have no ideological hang-up about who builds houses, whether they are public, private, social, affordable or co-operative development.  All present accept that we need more housing.  We know that the Government has stated that at least 30% of land released from central bodies and local authorities such as those of the delegates should be set aside for affordable housing or developments that have an element of affordable housing, with an additional 10% to be developed under Part V.  Where possible and practical and with the co-operation of all parties involved, that percentage could be increased.  What are the possibilities in that regard?</p><p> I ask the delegates to outline their views on their councils' experiences in interfacing with NAMA in the release of properties that could be made available for affordable housing.  Many figures are bandied about, but what are the practicalities?  The audits have been undertaken; the councils have looked at properties and properties have been rejected.  I do not wish to rehearse these arguments because the delegates know them as well as I do.</p><p> On the practicality and affordability of the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, I wish to focus on the Cherrywood strategic development zone, SDZ.  I do not consider any of the properties in that development to be affordable.  I have no difficulty with the fact that it is a private development, but I do not see how affordable houses will be delivered there.</p><p> On land banks, IDA Ireland, Irish Rail, the HSE and the port companies hold substantial amounts of land.  I am familiar with the port companies in the representatives' administrative areas.  Clearly, the councils do not have control over all of these lands, but they have some input in terms of planning and, I am sure, knowledge of them.  Do Mr. Keegan and Ms Poole as chief executives see potential in that land or how can we have a multi-focused approach to harnessing some of it?  The more land we have, the better.  If we can reduce its cost, we can reduce the cost of developing houses and, ultimately, properties to purchase or rent.  It goes back to the issue of affordability.</p><p> I will finish on that point.  I have asked broad-stroke questions which are central to how we can address the issue of land costs and the barriers impacting on affordability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-06-18a.639" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Philomena Poole" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019061800002#EE00200"><p>I will take the questions in reverse order.  The LIHAF funding for the Cherrywood site referred to by the Senator is &euro;11.39 million.  If we were to spread that funding across all of the homes due to be delivered, it would be such a miniscule amount that it would have no substantial impact on affordability.  It will contribute to the affordability of 300 homes over the lifetime of the Cherrywood scheme.  The LIHAF funding of &euro;11.39 million divided by 300 homes allows us to reduce the cost of these units by approximately &euro;40,000, although the exact figure depends on the size of the unit delivered.  We will probably primarily concentrate on smaller units.  Work on the town centre has commenced and will be completed in 2021.  The LIHAF funding will help to deliver 300 homes over the duration of the Cherrywood scheme.</p> <p>  I think the Senator asked whether land being given for free was a consideration.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is something of an outlier in that respect as it is a far more expensive place in which to buy, build, deliver and rent housing than most other local authority areas.  For that reason, we will not put a cost on the land against the Shanganagh site.  That will bring down the cost of the land further.  That is not something every local authority would be in a position to do or that my local authority would be in a position to do across every site.  The decision stems from the nature of the county and the urgent need to deliver through that development.</p> <p>  On our discussions with other agencies, developments in counties must be delivered in the round.  It is important that we have IDA Ireland lands because we want investment to be able to deliver a range of things.  Lands in the public realm are also important, as is land held by the HSE.  Some plots of land have the potential to contribute to resolving the housing issue.  The Senator referred to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.</p><p>Clearly, it will have a dramatic impact when it comes to bear.  We are in discussions with the LDA and have certain thoughts on it from a planning perspective.  Ms Keenan may be in a position to provide detail on the HRI lands about which we have engaged in discussions.  There are no dramatic plots of IDA Ireland land in the county where land tends to be privately owned and there are few large industrial parks where such land may be made available, as may be the case elsewhere.</p></speech>

We very much welcome the establishment of the Land Development Agency because we recognise that there are substantial lands in public ownership.  The Senator referred to Irish Rail.  Dublin Bus is another big landowner, as is the HSE.  There is certainly scope for those lands to be used more efficiently and some to be released for housing.  That would require an agency with significant capital resources.  We have engaged extensively with the LDA on particular sites.</p> <p>  The city council has limited land resources in direct ownership.  As outlined in our statement, the bulk of that land will be used to provide social housing, which is our primary obligation.  We are making land available for affordable housing schemes.  The challenge is that if we were to seek to recover the cost of that land, even where we are not proposing to make any charge for it, it would be difficult to produce affordable units because there are constraints on some of the sites in terms of the cost of building generally.  Although we can guarantee we can deliver units below market price, that might not match people's expectations in terms of affordability.</p></speech>

In St. Michael's estate in Inchicore it is 70% cost rental and 30% social.  We are using various models.  If land costs are thrown into the pot, it is just not affordable.  We work very well with NAMA and took everything it wanted to give us a few years ago, except for two small schemes and we had reasons for not taking them.  As Mr. Keegan stated, we very much welcome the Land Development Agency because we have limited land available and it may have the potential to tap into the other lands referenced by the Senator.</p></speech>

Ms Poole and Mr. Keegan mentioned the Land Development Agency, LDA, and welcomed its establishment.  It was announced in September last year, but no land has been transferred to it.  It is not a legal entity and does not have legislation to guide it at this stage.  What interaction do D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council have with the LDA?  Are they identifying land banks?  Has the LDA asked them to help to identify land banks held by other agencies such as those mentioned by Senator Boyhan, including the HSE, CI&Eacute;, etc?</p><p>In fairness to it, CI&Eacute; is one of the State agencies that is better at using its own land portfolio.  I am aware that Dublin Bus is seeking to decamp from some of its depots in the city, which will also help to free up land.  Will the delegates address that point?</p><p> I thank the delegates for the detailed statement on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  The average price in the area is way out of reach of any first-time buyer, even using the bank of mum and dad.  The average price - &euro;527,000 - is staggering.  What are the delegates' concerns about the demographic trends in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown as a local authority area in the absence of a workable affordable housing scheme and workable cost rental and affordable rental schemes?  I have attended meetings in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and have spoken at housing meetings there.  I have noted that there is significant concern among those in the area about their inability even to think about ever owning a house or an apartment, let alone anything else.  What are the concerns of the local authority about the demographic trend in its area?</p><p> The priority scheme for affordable purchase was passed by the four Dublin local authorities, but Ms Poole is still awaiting the specific criteria to be used.  Has she had further contact with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the specific criteria to be used?  The delegates from Dublin City Council might answer the same question.  My party has made the establishment of an affordable purchase scheme a priority, but we are still awaiting completion of the criteria to be used.  The threshold of &euro;75,000 is problematic as confirmed today by the Housing Agency.  It is evident from the original legislation that we are not actually bound to a figure of &euro;75,000 for a couple.  How close are we to having a real scheme established under which people could apply in each local authority area?</p><p> Is there any planning for the delivery of affordable housing in each area?  About what numbers are we talking?  I acknowledge that the land banks are limited in both cases.</p><p> Unless I missed it, there was no mention of how many were waiting on the social housing list in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown administrative area.  Dublin City Council has a total of 26,000 families between the housing waiting list and the transfer list.  It is a staggering number.  I am seeking data for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown area.</p><p> Let me address the implications of not having an affordable housing scheme and the ability to cost.  Let us consider the examples of Cherrywood and O'Devaney Gardens, where the affordable housing proportion is 20%.  There is no scheme fully in place.  How has it been costed with the Housing Finance Agency, with a view to it being put out to tender?  Has the local authority decided on the affordability levels?  Has it decided on what the subvention will be or the equity stake to be taken by the State?  What guidance is the authority being given?</p><p> Let me refer to Mr. Kenny's statement on O'Devaney Gardens.  He gave figures for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Road and St. Michael&rsquo;s estate, namely, 140, 160 and 150, respectively.  Are these the totals for each estate?  The figure for O'Devaney Gardens is 140.  Is that the maximum?</p></speech>

I understand exactly from where he is coming because it is difficult for a first-time buyer in an area such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  I came from a place where it was very difficult to find the second-time buyer.  When people upgraded, they moved from the area.  Therefore, I do not have a great concern about a younger cohort moving into the county because the affordable housing arrangement will, as we move through it, get us first-time buyers in so far as it can.  When people upgrade, that is the county towards which they gravitate.  That will give us the intermediate band, as it were.</p><p> We have one of the highest older populations in the county.  There are people in larger homes who might choose to move, but not necessarily from the area. We have brought in a number of schemes for downsizing, specifically in respect of social housing built in an area to allow people to move out of the family home into smaller, more modern, easier-to-maintain houses.  This allows the bigger houses to be given to younger families.  Therefore, there are a number of things that we have done to address the issue.</p></speech>

The proposed legislation will make it a commercial State body.  That is my understanding.  We have had involvement with the agency in terms of our Shanganagh site.  We are working with it on how the transfer might take place.  We have a proposal for a workshop with the councillors next week to update them on our Shanganagh lands.</p> <p>  An average price of &euro;527,000 was quoted.  That is the average price in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown but it takes into account the market price.  It takes into account all the big houses in addition to the others.  With regard to achieving affordability on our lands, the price would not be anywhere near the price quoted.  It is a question of considering the cost of building and the operational costs.  There would be a subvention under the served-sites fund so the figure would not be anywhere near &euro;527,000.  That is just a market price.</p> <p>  With regard to affordable homes, the priority scheme is such that the advertisement takes place three months before the houses or apartments are ready.  It would be closer to when they are actually being built.  Three to six months before that, they are advertised.</p> <p>  We have 4,500 on the social housing list.  In reality, however, approximately 1,000 of those households are on other local authority lists, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is their second preference.  If they are removed, there are approximately 3,500 on the social housing list.</p> <p>  On affordability, our rough guide is 30% to 35% of income.  That is how we look at it at the moment.</p></speech>

We are working with it and liaising with it on a number of other State-owned sites in the city.  We have asked it to examine a site we own at Cherry Orchard.  It has significant potential.  It is doing a feasibility study on it.  There is a possibility of it developing the site for a full-scale cost rental development.  We work very closely with the agency.</p> <p>  Ideally we would like to have a scheme for both cost rental and affordable housing but the current position is not stopping us from progressing.  While we will be announcing the scheme in respect of O'Devaney Gardens, we are still two years away from houses being built there.  We deem an affordable price to be from &euro;250,000 to &euro;270,000.  We have applied for a lands service grant from the Department.  If we get that - we are hopeful - we expect that 20% will be in that price range.  That is necessary.  It is really a matter of construction and construction costs.  We believe the O'Devaney Gardens development will work very well, as will the Oscar Traynor Road development.</p></speech>

I have a number of different questions for both councils.  With regard to the cost-rental and affordable purchase projects, could the delegates give us the current position in the pipeline in terms of design, planning, procurement, the expected construction dates and, ultimately, expected tenanting?  I refer, in particular, to those developments are the most live, including those in Enniskerry Road and St. Michael's Estate, the Ballymun project and some of the more recently announced serviced-site fund projects that have been approved.</p> <p>  We had a very detailed discussion with the NDFA and the Housing Agency on Enniskerry Road and St. Michael's Estate.  Given that the Enniskerry Road project is the very first, the pilot, it is an important one.  St. Michael's Estate is also important because it is such a large project.</p><p>Its success is very important and the committee has a long record of supporting it.  The big concern many of us had during the earlier session was how we can bring down the cost of rent.  I appreciate that with regard to Enniskerry Road the entry rent is set at &euro;1,200 and while I would like to be able to suggest there could be a mechanism to reduce it, I am not doing so.  I have a hypothetical question relevant to the question I have asked Dublin City Council.  What would it take to reduce the cost of the Enniskerry Road entry rent from &euro;1,200 to, say, &euro;900?  The Housing Agency was very clear about the peculiarities of the site and clearly there is not much more that can be done there.  The loan is for 40 years so there is not much that can be done there either.  How much extra from the serviced sites fund would it take to reduce entry rents in that project to below &euro;900?  Is this something that was looked at at any stage?  Do the witnesses have any advice to offer those of us looking at other sites?<br/><br/>In its final comment, the National Development Finance Agency made pretty clear to us that if there is a 25-year European Investment Bank loan and the serviced sites fund allocation is in the order of what it is for Enniskerry Road, the rent will not reduce to below &euro;1,200.  It was very straight about that.  Clearly its view is that the only way to decrease the rent is through a greater portion of capital upfront or some form of mixed loan finance combining the EIB with the HFA or both, or perhaps having interest-only HFA loans and some restructuring of the capital end of the HFA at the end of the 25 years and so on.<br/><br/>Given the significance of St. Michael's Estate, if we do not reduce the rents it will colour people's view of cost rental at a more general level.  This is in no way a criticism of Dublin City Council because I am very supportive of the direction in which the project has gone but if the witnesses were with the Minister or Department or were getting us to raise issues with the Minister and the Department, what would they say is needed that is different to Enniskerry Road to reduce the rents in St. Michael's Estate?  If one looks at rent as approximately one third of net disposable income, one is looking at entry rents of between &euro;700 and &euro;900 if it is to capture those people above the threshold for social housing eligibility and, at the top end, with a gross household income of perhaps &euro;75,000 or &euro;80,000.  What is needed to decrease those rents with regard to the serviced sites fund or the structuring of the loan or both?<br/><br/>With regard to the eligibility criteria for affordable cost rental, every time I raise this with the Department it seems to suggest it is a matter for local authorities and Ms Keenan very clearly indicated her understanding is that there is a working group in the Department.  I know the eligibility criteria are a little way off but I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses on what they think should be in them.  Should there be a lower income limit whereby the only people eligible for affordable cost rental would be those not entitled to social housing?  We would have that bottom line, which would mean social housing tenants would not be in an affordable cost rental unit supplemented by housing assistance payment.  Is that something the witnesses think would be desirable?  At the top end, do they think &euro;70,000 or &euro;75,000, as it is for the affordable purchase scheme, is the right point?  Do they believe there is an argument to say it should be increased to &euro;80,000 or &euro;85,000?  I am interested to hear the thoughts of the witnesses on this.<br/><br/>With regard to affordable purchase, local authorities have begun to receive awards for the affordable purchase serviced sites fund.  <i>The Irish Times</i>has quoted figures from Dublin City Council of price ranges between &euro;116,000 and &euro;237,000.  This reporting does not necessarily mean it is accurate but what do both local authorities hope will be the lower and upper end of the price range?  I know it is difficult to answer and subject to change because of the cost of construction but I am interested to hear what are their hopes or expectations.  We have seen significant affordability in the &Oacute; Cualann project in Ballymun and this could be replicated elsewhere in the city and county, which would be valuable.<br/><br/>We have been speaking about affordable cost rental or cost rental since Deputy Kelly's Social Housing Strategy 2020 and it was mentioned again in Rebuilding Ireland three years ago.  There is a lot of frustration in communities, in the House and, I am sure, among the local authorities and their staff at the fact we are still speaking about only a couple of pilots.  While I appreciate the number of pilots is increasing, it is nowhere close to meeting the level of need for affordable purchase or rental accommodation that exists.</p><p>I am sure both local authorities are aware of the ESRI study that referred to 30% of households having affordability problems with mortgages or rent and people, some of whom spend as much as 40% of their net disposable income on housing, not being eligible for social housing.  Crucially, the same report identified that 75% of the lower 25% of income earners experience high housing costs.  These are people who are not eligible for family income supplement, housing assistance payment, rent supplement or medical cards.  Having 40% of net disposable income going on housing is huge.  Given the large volume of need for affordable housing, do the witnesses believe what is in the pipeline is sufficient?  Do they have a read in their local authority areas as to what would be an efficient scale?  Do they believe we need to move to multi-year targets, not unlike the Rebuilding Ireland social housing targets?  Do they have a sense of what they would be in their administrative areas?</p></speech>

We hope to have cost rental around that point.  In Shanganagh we hope to be on site in 2021.  That will take a number of years to complete.  It is a large site so we are probably talking about 2024 at the earliest.</p> <p>  Reducing the cost rental will probably require a combination of things.  We are speaking about a greenfield site and perhaps rapid build delivery, a serviced sites fund increase, lower borrowing rates and the length of time for the borrowing.  In a sense, we are restricted in terms of our lands.  We do not have that much serviced land.  If we rely on local authorities serviced land to produce affordability there will be a restriction.  With regard to affordable rental, if we go up as far as a gross annual income of &euro;90,000, the net income of 35% of that income would be in the region of &euro;1,800.  That is a lot higher than the &euro;1,200 for &euro;1,300 we are speaking about.  The amount of &euro;75,000 is probably more in line.  The Deputy is right that there is an imbalance between people who qualify for social housing and those who cannot afford it and then we have affordable housing.  Cost rental could bridge that gap.</p></speech>

Oscar Traynor Road is a few months behind this, with a developer due to be selected in September.  We are finalising a provisional framework plan for St. Michael's Estate covering all of the physical issues that have had to be dealt with.  That will form the brief for the selection of a full design team, hopefully during July and August and certainly during the summer.  It will mean we will have a full design team that will begin work immediately.  There will be a strong element of consultation and I hope that by the spring of 2020 the developer will be submitting an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>  We are into the second stage of procurement in some of the other schemes advertised on the market in Cherry Orchard and Ballymun.  We cannot give a real indication of the start date but we are making progress.</p> <p>  With regard to the cost, all of the indications and calculations we are doing on cost rental suggest it will work out at between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,200 a month, which will be fine for a lot of people but certainly will not be affordable for others.  Reducing that will mean an intervention.  The non-service initiative may not be sufficient.  Perhaps when it comes to borrowing we will borrow over 40 years rather than over 30 or 25 years.</p><p>It certainly needs some intervention to bring it down and we are working on that.  We are not overly concerned that there is not currently a scheme there.  We are doing a great deal of work on it and we hope to be able to make recommendations to Government on it in the coming months.<br/><br/>We are keen to see the income limit for eligibility to be a little higher.  It might be a better mix in Inchicore or O'Devaney Gardens.  We would like to see the threshold increased to about &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.<br/><br/>The article in <i>The</i><i>Irish Times </i>was clarification on issues on which the developers had expressed an interest.  There is no way we will build homes in Ballymun from &euro;160,000.  It will be considerably higher than that.  It is similar to the point raised earlier.  It is the area of &euro;250,000 or &euro;270,000 where people qualify for the national home loan that we are trying to reach.  That was just an indication of market values in the Ballymun and Cherry Orchard areas and taking 25% off them.  Ultimately, the price will be very much dictated by the cost of construction.</p></speech>

I know that some of these are difficult to answer because they are projects that are not going to happen for maybe one to three years, but it is still important that we get a sense of it.</p> <p>  This might be an unfair question, but I have a specific question on Enniskerry Road for Ms Keenan.  If the entry-level rents were to have been reduced, knowing everything we do about the site, the only thing that could have brought the cost of those units down would have been an additional serviced sites fund.  I am trying to understand how much extra capital upfront would have been necessary to bring it down from &euro;1,200 to &euro;900.  For instance, instead of &euro;4 million, would &euro;8 million or &euro;12 million have been enough?  If Mr. Kenny's problem in certain sites comprises loans and the serviced sites fund, then we need a sense of how much would make a difference.  It is important that we know if an extra &euro;4 million would not make that much difference.  Perhaps Ms Keenan has not worked out those calculations but a ballpark figure would be helpful.  After that I have some more questions for Mr. Kenny. </p></speech>

The further up the income ladder, the more able people are to cope with the 30% or 35%, whereas for those hovering at the social housing threshold, it could be quite a large amount.  Is any consideration being given to having several bands of affordable or cost rental in a particular development?  For instance, in St. Michael's, would it be possible to have two or three bands, depending on where people were in the income scheme, that between the three would cover the full cost recovery but would be somewhat more equitable?  Is that administratively complex?  Is that something that is being looked at?</p> <p>  I know that Enniskerry Road is a pilot and it is 50 units.  However, single people are particularly disadvantaged in the current market.  If there are no single person units or the price range is done in such a way that it is only accessible to two-income households, that excludes a very significant portion of people.  Is a broader range of household types being examined for future cost rental schemes?</p><p>Finally, there is the thorny issue of accountability.  I appreciate some of this is not Ms Keenan's responsibility, but some of the timelines she just outlined are incredibly long.  I know when one works in the area, one can become accustomed to those but for anyone in an affordability crisis listening to those timelines - Enniskerry Road in 2021, which is the year after next, then Shanganagh is 2024 - they are a long way away.  What can be done to reduce that timeline?  Are there changes that can be made to procurement or to building type?  How can we accelerate these projects?  In the case of some, such as O'Devaney Gardens, there is probably not much that can be done to accelerate at this stage, but when new projects emerge are there ways that Ms Keenan could recommend to the committee in which we could get the newer projects up and running and delivered much more quickly?  I return to the one question which Ms Keenan and Mr. Kenny did not answer, namely their estimation of the level of need versus the very small number of projects that are currently in the pipeline.  If we are delivering very few of these units - and we are delivering them exceptionally slowly - that is not good news for all the people out there stuck with unaffordable accommodation or who are unable to access affordable accommodation.</p></speech>

There is probably potential for more than that.  There are also 1,650 earmarked for cost rental.  One problem for us, as identified earlier, will be that our preference has to be for social housing.  We have 17,500 on the waiting list and we only have a limited amount of land.  There are only certain parts of the city where we can do affordable housing.  Trying to get affordable, cost rental and social housing will be a challenge.  Those are the numbers but we think there is potential for more.</p> <p>  The timelines are very frustrating.  O'Devaney Gardens or the Oscar Traynor site estates are major projects, for example.  They were only finally approved by Dublin City Council in January 2017.  That is two years ago and we are now ready to go which is not bad compared to other projects.  The process of public procurement, design, consultation, cost benefit analysis and so on just has to be done.  It is up to us to streamline it as much as possible, which is what we are trying to do.  Having frameworks in place, with design teams and contractors does make a difference.  Having only been approved in January 2017, their progress is not bad for big projects of their nature.</p></speech>

Because of that, we had to do an environmental impact assessment report.  A huge amount of work is involved in that between landscape design, rationales, and all sorts of assessments we must undertake.  I think I told another meeting of this committee that this would take about nine or ten months.  We are nearing the end of that but when all the investigation work is complete, we now have to do the master plan design element and prepare for planning.  It will go directly to An Bord Pleann&aacute;la for a site of that size, which could take six months to a year.  Then we have to go to detailed tender stage.  We are no different from the private sector in these things.  We must undertake all stages and have the proper governance in place.  That is why it takes that long.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point about one-bedroom units in Enniskerry Road, however we will have one, two and three-bedroom cost rental units in the Shanganagh proposal.  It is also important to say that supply brings down affordability.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown we have 23% of the planning activity so that should bring down the affordability costs. </p> <p>  The cost rental model is based on the cost.  As others have said, it is based on the tendering process and what those costs come in at.  It is somewhat outside our control in that sense.  There are other ways that one might look at cost rental.  Some countries might do a differential rent type of cost rental scheme but the one that we are modelling is cost rental based on costs. </p></speech>

If one pays it over 20 years, the impact on the tenant is significantly different than if it is over 40 years.</p><p>I know many of those aspects are not within the control of the witness but given that she is on the front line of delivering the projects perhaps she might have strong views on how that could be improved.  </p></speech>

That is a long period and we are still at &euro;1,200.  It is complex.  Regarding different rounds, at the moment it is &euro;1,200 based on the costs and there is no difference for different levels of income.</p></speech>

It would be very difficult administratively to implement different bands.  We are not considering that option, at least not at the moment.</p></speech>

If we take the Housing Agency's definition of affordability, which is about one third of net disposable income, that would mean that for the cohort of people we are talking about entry rents would need to be somewhere in the region of &euro;700 and &euro;900 a month.  Do the witnesses share that view and would it be their desire to try to move the rents down into that range?  Would the witnesses also be able to give us some more detail about the planned consultation with the wider community, once the work of the design team is complete?  I presume that will be sometime around September.</p></speech>

I made a point at the very beginning about one of the difficulties we are facing.  Even on sites where we are supplying the land, we are confident that we can deliver below a market price.  That does not, however, really meet our concerns as to whether it is affordable.  There are real challenges in that respect and that is on sites where we have the land.  On sites such as Poolbeg West, which is earmarked for more than 600 houses, we do not own the land.  We have negotiated to buy the land from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, at well below the market price but it is still a substantial cost.  That is proving very difficult.  We are very conscious of the difference between being affordable and just being below the market price.  That is a major issue.  We will be going back to the Department to try to address how we can make these homes affordable as opposed to just below the market price.</p></speech>

Are there things it would be helpful for us to emphasise with the Department to make those prices affordable?  I take from what Mr. Keegan is saying that the &euro;700 to &euro;900 band would be much more in line with what would be affordable.  We are quite happy, as a committee, to try to put pressure on the Department to achieve that, subject to us agreeing that in private session of course.  What is Mr. Keegan's key ask?  What does the Department need to do in pounds, shillings and pence to assist with bringing the rents down to the required level?</p></speech>

All of the calculations assume &euro;1,200 per month.  We would like to bring that cost down to &euro;700 or &euro;900 and that is going to need some kind of intervention.  That may be a need for some kind of subsidy and perhaps something similar to what works at the moment with the approved housing bodies.  We are not sure but some intervention will definitely be needed given construction costs in Dublin.  We are not otherwise going to be able to produce houses with rental costs in the &euro;700 to &euro;900 band.</p></speech>

There were some political difficulties for the Minister at the launch of St. Michael's.  There is no need to revisit that.  It has, however, created concern in the local community that those political difficulties might cause a delay or perhaps some cooling in the attitude of Dublin City Council towards the project.  My understanding is that is not the case, the council is fully committed to this project and it is going to happen, subject to all of the legal requirements.  It would be great to get the view of the representatives from Dublin City Council, however.</p></speech>

I will be parochial, for a moment.  It is dramatic where we have come from in the space of two years.  That is particularly the case when it comes to delivering social housing.</p><p>I concur with the remarks made by Senator Boyhan regarding the staff in both local authorities represented here today.  The compassion with which they deal with people is to be commended.  I have had many dealings with both local authorities regarding people in very difficult circumstances.  We appreciate all that the staff do.  Sometimes we hear bad stories but I have not had any experiences like that.  I want to acknowledge that.</p><p> Regarding affordable schemes, the complexities involved and those being site specific, I think Mr. Kenny mentioned this before.  A tight site will mean that the costs of construction will be much higher than at a site such as Shanganagh, which is vast and flat.  It does, however, have other complications.  It needs services, road infrastructure, a DART station etc.  No two sites are ever the same.  We can talk about having a range of bands, having one cost and all of the different things mentioned earlier.  When it comes down it, however, these issues have to be dealt with site by site, with all of the complexity, or perhaps lack of complexity, involved in that.</p><p> Turning to Cherrywood, it was mentioned that there would be around 300 units.  The council also owns a site there.  I expect there will be delivery on that site also, when development there becomes possible.  That will happen on a phased basis.  Overall, I acknowledge where we have come from in the space of two years.  Much of the detail, under the water, as it were, has been completed and now we are going to see the resultant development.  Little emphasis is placed on the amount of work required before building can commence on a site.  It can be frustrating how slowly housing is delivered.  As public representatives, however, we also have to recognise the level of detailed work that goes into getting a site ready.  That work is rarely seen.  Those are more comments than anything else and concern the front line staff in particular.  They work in difficult circumstances and are rarely commended.  We should acknowledge the work they do.</p></speech>

Mr. Keegan mentioned Poolbeg.  The Bord Plean&aacute;la ruling has been delivered and that is helpful.  Will he give us as much information as he can on how it is hoped to deliver affordability on that site?  The State is contributing significantly to the development of the site, not just via the serviced sites fund but also with additional infrastructural funding.  There is still a concern that, even with that significant subvention, house prices will still come in at a high level.  What is Mr. Keegan's hope or expectation regarding the ongoing discussions between NAMA and the receiver?</p></speech>

It might be better positioned to do that.  There is a substantial gap in funding notwithstanding the contributions from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and the National Transport Authority, NTA, towards the infrastructure.</p></speech>

That is a large development so the subsidy per unit is modest enough.  It is a difficult site.  Even though the land we are in the process of purchasing from NAMA for affordable housing is fully serviced, the nature of the land as a former landfill requires the provision of basements.  That will still be needed even if we do it with the parking.  It is just going to be very expensive to build those units.  In our view, it is essential that we have affordable units everywhere and not just on the outskirts.  That, however, is going to pose a financial challenge.  We are in discussions with the Department concerning how we can bridge that gap.</p></speech>

The receiver controls the site and will not develop it as per the strategic development zone, SDZ, area.  Is the receiver going to sell portions of the land?</p></speech>
