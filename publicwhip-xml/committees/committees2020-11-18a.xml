Are they agreed?  Agreed.  As previously agreed, the minutes will be published.  I propose we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters before resuming in public session to deal with correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.6" nospeaker="true" time="16:30:00" ><p>The committee went into private session at 4.33 p.m. and resumed in public session at 5.24 p.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.7" nospeaker="true" time="16:30:00" ><p>Mr. Seamus McCarthy(An tArd Reachtaire Cuntas agus Ciste)called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#F00100"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. McCarthy, the permanent witness to the committee.  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  The next business is the financial statements and accounts received.  Nine sets of financial statements and accounts were laid before the D&aacute;il between 2 and 13 November 2020.  The Comptroller and Auditor General issued a clear audit opinion in all cases.  However, attention is drawn to a material level of irregular expenditure in respect of the Social Insurance Fund 2019.  The account was laid before the Houses before we engaged with the Department of Social Protection last week but because we consider the statements and accounts fortnightly, we are just considering it now.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to elaborate on the irregular expenditure in the Social Insurance Fund 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#F00200"><p>It is an issue we discussed last week.  I was drawing attention to a level of irregular payment in a number of significant schemes funded by the Social Insurance Fund.  These include the State pension, contributory, and illness benefit in particular.  The point is that the fraud and error surveys that the Department has undertaken indicate that there is a level of excess payment, whether it is due to error or to fraud, but that it does exist and I was simply drawing the committee's attention to that in the audit certificate.  I am obliged to do that by law.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#F00300"><p>Do members have questions on that?  No.  Is it agreed that we note the accounts and statements?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next business is correspondence.  The first category of correspondence on which members have flagged issues for attention is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to previous meetings of the committee.  No. 179 was held over from the previous meeting and is from Ms Mary Lawlor, senior communications and public affairs manager of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and it is dated 28 October 2020.  She is providing information requested by the committee on Project Nantes, arising from a meeting on 8 October 2020.  I propose to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is Nos. 189 and 195.  We will take these together as they both relate to Caranua.  The first is from Rachel Downes, chief executive of Caranua, dated 4 November 2020 and it provides further information requested by the committee arising from consideration of previous correspondence with Caranua.  We requested answers to a number of specific questions.  I expressed an interest in the matter, as did Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy.  Does Deputy Carthy wish to comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#F00400"><p>No, you can go first, Chairman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#F00500"><p>I am happy enough for Deputy Carthy or Deputy Murphy to speak first on it.  We raised issues at the meeting when Caranua was in attendance and some clarification was provided to us.  Members can address those.  There are 26 applications outstanding by survivors on their initial or repeat applications and a final 50 where the completion of the applications process is awaited.  The estimated wind-down cost is &euro;300,000.  My concern is that the legislation to wind down Caranua could come before the House quickly.  The sum of &euro;110 million was provided by the religious congregations for the survivors of the Magdalen laundries and the other institutions.  We do not want Caranua to be wound down while cases have still to be resolved.  That is the concern.  Whoever wishes to contribute can do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#F00600"><p>There are a number of concerns.  This is a particularly vulnerable group.  We knew from the outset that there would be a limited amount and it was not going to be added to by the State.  That is confirmed in the letter.</p> <p>  It was my understanding that the Department of Education would take on board any residual issues that were not addressed by the time Caranua was wound up.  It looks to me like there is a surplus of &euro;111.38 million.</p><p>Will the Comptroller and Auditor General confirm that, because I would have expected that all of the money would have been spent?  With regard to my second issue, we have to be concerned about where people will receive services.  Caranua was providing them with some support.  It is not a matter for this committee but it may be an issue we can refer to another committee, probably the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science because Caranua falls under its remit.  I also wanted to raise a third issue with regard to the date for winding down.  There is a hard date set which must be complied with.  What happens at that point?  I am mainly asking about the numbers, however.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00200"><p>With regard to the figure of &euro;111 million, the contributions promised totalled &euro;110 million.  The extra &euro;1.3 million comprises interest that was earned while the money was in bank accounts.  The total amount available for Caranua to disburse was &euro;111 million.</p> <p>  On the cessation of its business, if there are any cases in which an award has been made but the payment has not been executed for whatever reason - perhaps there were invoices to be produced - the Department will process that payment.  The Department will not, however, be in a position to make any additional awards from any residual amount.  If there is a residual amount after all commitments made by the board have been honoured, I understand that it is, by law, due to be paid to the children's hospital.  That is my understanding of the matter.  It was expected that Caranua would have ceased to operate earlier in the year, but between Covid and other matters, it has continued to operate and the Department has not yet taken over.  I understand it is likely to cease operations towards the end of the year, but the Department could confirm that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00300"><p>There are a total of 76 cases outstanding.  Some 300 survivors received additional supports, the final 50 of whom are currently in the process of completing their applications.  On top of that are the 26 survivors who are on an initial or repeat application.  There are, therefore, potentially 76 cases outstanding while there is only &euro;300,000 left in the kitty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00400"><p>The correspondence is fairly comprehensive but I do not think the issue of payments which have been inordinately delayed is adequately addressed.  I have two questions.  Caranua is to come before this committee, is it not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00500"><p>Yes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00700"><p>It certainly could end up happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00800"><p>Perhaps the Chair could offer guidance as to how to respond to that.  I have a question for the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When these matters are transferred to the Department of Education, is there any fear that accountability measures will be lost in translation?  In other words, if issues arise subsequently in respect of due diligence or best practice, will the Department be able to wash its hands of the matter and say they relate to a body that no longer exists, which would mean that there would be no accountability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G00900"><p>Accountability should transfer to the Department.  In other words, it will be responsible for providing explanations for what happened.  With regard to the people who were involved in making decisions, they may no longer be available to the committee.  The Department will have effectively assumed responsibility for providing answers to questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01000"><p>I do not mean to cast aspersions, but it appears to be a recipe for disaster.  Questions arise.  One can almost write the script for Department of Education officials coming before this committee in two or three years' time.  We know what they will say.  It will be so easy for them to say that something related to a previous body and that the Department was not involved.  We are talking about large sums of money and very vulnerable people.  The money was assigned to ensure it got to those people.  I do not know how to deal with that issue or what the implications of it might be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01100"><p>To be helpful, there is further correspondence on this issue, No. 195, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education.  In this correspondence, it is set out clearly that legislation is required.  The Department has sent the draft general scheme of the residential institutions statutory fund (dissolution) Bill 2020 to Government.  This provides for that dissolution.  The fear is that, if the legislation goes ahead, business may be left unfinished.  There are questions or unfinished business in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01200"><p>My question is similar to Deputy Carthy's on the transfer of information and any subsequent questions this committee or another body may have after the winding-up of Caranua.  I have a few points to raise.  One is about the date on which Caranua is to appear before the committee.  With regard to our earlier conversation about the national children's hospital, there is a date earlier in December we might utilise.  I note that, in its correspondence, Caranua says that all survivors' applications will be completed by 11 December.  Depending on when the legislation the Comptroller and Auditor General has mentioned, which is required to wind up Caranua, is to be enacted, we may need to get the organisation in as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General may be able to answer a question for me.  There is an estimated operational wind-down cost of &euro;300,000 as of the end of October.  Is there anything to suggest that cost would increase given that it is now to wind down at the end of the year?  Is he familiar with that matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01300"><p>I am not in a position to answer that question.  It is a 2020 issue.  We will be looking at it in arrears.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01400"><p>That is fair enough.  I suggest that we use that date in early December, if it is available, to bring in Caranua.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01500"><p>I know we cannot get into policy and that kind of stuff here.  I am just throwing this out as a thought.  We know that Caranua is winding up and we have concerns.  Notwithstanding that it is coming before the committee, we can take it that what is in this letter will be its position when it answers questions in December.  Although it would be up to the committee to decide, perhaps the clerk can advise whether the committee would be within its rights to write to the Department expressing our concern at this stage, in advance of the legislation, that there will be consequences as a result of the deadline and the cliff edge ahead.  If the committee is agreeable, perhaps we could express our view that a review of the winding-down process is needed as regards outstanding victims.  The questions I raised involved two cases which have not been alluded to in this response.  That is just a suggestion.</p></speech>

They have, however, suffered enough.  We must do our best as public representatives to ensure that the remaining applicants are dealt with.  Nobody on this committee would disagree with that.  The Deputy's suggestion that we make some kind of an intervention with the Department in that regard is worthwhile.  The other suggestion, that we consider the 3 December slot for the meeting, is also worthwhile.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020111800002#G01900"><p>I will tread the same line as Deputy MacSharry and try to avoid straying into policy.  We now have a letter from Caranua.  I refer specifically to section 3(d).  This letter to the Oireachtas highlights that the provision of ongoing services for survivors of institutional abuse is a matter for Government.  It then outlines a number of steps.  If, after the winding-up of the fund, there are any funds left, they should be used to progress that issue.  There are many survivors who had a very difficult relationship with Caranua, but I imagine many also felt that it was the only port of call they had in respect of a range of issues.</p><p>It is important that we look at the remaining fund and the wind-up process and that we are cognisant of the transfer of some responsibility to the Government.  I stress that point because we launched the diaspora strategy today and there are people abroad who may not see the difference between one committee or another and the Government and they will want a smooth handover.

One is that we endeavour to bring Caranua in on 3 December to try to deal with these issues.  We will ask the clerk to arrange that and to get back to us as quickly as possible.  The second suggestion is that we also write to the Secretary General of the Department of Education on the Bill to point out our concerns and to say that there needs to be an orderly wind-down, even if the process has to be delayed a bit.  The main point is the concern for these 76 outstanding applicants which have yet to be resolved.  Deputy MacSharry mentioned two others that need to be sorted as well, one way or the other.  We will ask that that be done.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

Some things are identified as being required, like medical cards, easily accessible counselling services, advocacy supports, trauma-informed care and support for survivors.  The second letter from the Department is saying that these are a matter for the Government.  It would be appropriate to send our concerns to the Minister rather than the Secretary General because the continuation of these services has been identified as critically important and we are afraid that they will fall through the cracks.</p></speech>

The committee is confined to two-hour meetings twice a week on two separate days.  That includes dealing with all the private matters, as committees are required to do.  There have also been attempts via Standing Orders to curtail the questions this committee can put to witnesses.  That has the potential to undermine the very historic and honorary role this committee has previously played in securing public accountability on behalf of the Irish people.  It would be remiss if we did not record that.  We discussed some of the ways we might be able to address some of these very clear deficiencies during our private session but people have a right to know that this committee is working under very restrictive conditions at the moment.  That must be addressed.</p></speech>

I know the secretariat is extremely busy but did anyone consider it?  Did the legal team consider it?  A lot of work has gone into it and the author believes there is a serious issue that needs to be visited.  He has probably contacted all of us in different capacities through the years.  I hate to just note it without doing anything else.  Are we asking an awful thing?  Could it go to the legal team for it to summarise the issues it feels are pertinent and may warrant investigation?  Clearly, a huge amount of work went into it and not many of us would have the time individually to go through it in that sort of detail.</p></speech>

If members want, we can ask for the issue to be pencilled in on our long work programme.  Would members be happy with that?  It would give us a chance to consider the issues that have been raised around this matter in the meantime.  There are some good things about the school transport system as well.

Deputy Catherine Murphy has flagged this matter and it is an issue that other members have come across.  The different types of bonds can become an issue, and it is one I have come across when bonds were not really bonds.  Does Deputy Murphy wish to comment?</p></speech>

It is for the local government auditor, and perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General would give us some guidance on that.  To be honest, I am sure the local government auditor has looked at the bonds in perpetuity as these were only issued by Anglo Irish Bank and all other bonds were for seven years.  However, it is not an issue for this committee because we do not have a remit in regard to local government.  Is it the local government auditor who would look at this?</p></speech>

The taxpayer had to pick up the tab and local authorities, out of their own budgets, had to finish off the estates.  The bonds literally evaporated and had no great legal standing.</p></speech>

By the time they started work, the bond had expired.  There is a responsibility on the part of the builder but also in regard to planning.  It is a planning condition that the builder is complying with and the local authority, by not insisting on the work being done in a timely manner, is allowing planning regulations to be not complied with in full.  It then ends up with the local authority and the taxpayer is picking up the tab because of that.</p></speech>

I know of situations where the bond that had been secured was of a value much less than the value of the outstanding works, and the developers just walked away and said, &ldquo;Keep the bond&rdquo;, which resulted in a large bill for local authorities.  Yet, the same developers at the same time would have planning applications in for a new development, and one part of the body could not take into account the fact this was clearly an entity that had failed to live up to its commitments.  In terms of our work and how it relates to the Committee of Public Accounts, it is in regard to those issues of how we can make propositions that better allow one public body, or one section of a public body, to take into account a company's previous track record with regard to these issues.</p></speech>

Where a developer had been less than compliant in terms of completing the estate and where there were issues with the bonds expiring, given most of them were issued for seven years, some of the local authorities had been smart enough to look for cash bonds as opposed to insurance bonds.  As I said, the only ones that were ever available in perpetuity were Anglo bonds.</p> <p>  It probably strays into the policy area in regard to what guidance the Department gave, but at the end of the day, the funds that local authorities have available cannot be used for things that are properly the responsibility of a developer who has not completed the estate.</p> <p>  I concur with Deputy Colm Burke in regard to the timeline to complete estates in a satisfactory manner and the level of oversight.  However, the local authorities probably have not had the resources to do that in recent years.  It is a local government matter rather than a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

It is an issue we will ask the Department to deal with when it is before the committee.  It is to be hoped we can try to make some headway with it on that day.</p></speech>

The union alleges that the company that employed the workers has maintained that it was finding it difficult to operate because it needed NAMA&rsquo;s authority to do its day-to-day work.  As the letter is to NAMA and there is no specific request to the committee, it is proposed to note this item.  Deputy Carthy had flagged this.</p></speech>

We know NAMA has been entrusted with a huge level of portfolios and loans that can be either a force for good or bad in terms of how they are utilised and the circumstances involved.  A trade union has made very serious assertions that the actions of NAMA have resulted in the loss of its members&rsquo; jobs.

We will meet with the Revenue Commissioners tomorrow and engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage over two days, 25 and 26 November.</p><p> I propose that on the first day we take Vote 34 &ndash; Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Local Government Fund 2019, and chapter 2 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2019, which concerns central Government funding of local authorities and local property tax.  On the second day we will take chapter 11, measuring performance for Exchequer spending on social housing; chapter 12, progress under the land aggregation scheme; and chapter 13, the pyrite remediation scheme, which was noted by some of the members.  Is it agreed that we deal with that over two days?  Agreed.</p><p> There has been a slight change to the next item.  We had proposed to bring in the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board on 3 December but due to events today we feel that we want to get more out of this meeting and therefore are proposing to defer that to a date early in January.  The suggestion is that we bring in Caranua, if it is possible to do so, on that date.</p><p> The following week I propose that we again engage over two days, this time with the Department of Justice and the Irish Prison Service.  It doubles the time we have to examine accounts.  If members are happy with this approach of having a double session, I propose that we use it more often in the future.  It links in with our conversation earlier that people feel they want to get into the questioning of witnesses in more depth.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Given the amount of ground to cover with the HSE it might be best to hold that over until January and to do it over two days.  If members decide to move the meeting with the HSE on 17 December to a double session, we need to decide on our priority.</p></speech>

Noting what the Comptroller and Auditor General has just said about Vote 21 and chapter 7 being taken together, presumably, Vote 24 would be taken on the Wednesday and we would deal with the other element of that on the Thursday.  Can the Chairman clarify for me if the Department of Justice will be in attendance for both days, as well as the Irish Prison Service?  I am conscious that there will be a cross-over in terms of some questions.  We do not want to have to say at that meeting that a particular question was for yesterday's session and that today's session is only questions for the Irish Prison Service.  We need to be careful of that with the new format we are proposing.  As long as both agencies will be present-----</p></speech>

Invitations are sent out but there is always tick-tacking with the secretariat.  The clerk and his staff will move quickly on that to try to separate those out as much as possible.  That is the Irish Prison Service.  The proposal is that we try to use that double session approach where we have a substantial piece of work to do with guests.</p> <p>  The outstanding issue is the remaining engagement on 17 December.  We were talking about having the HSE come in before the committee.  Do members want to proceed with that, which would be a single session, or do they want to move it to a later date?</p></speech>

I request that Members sit only in their permitted seats and in front of available microphones to ensure they are heard.  This is important as not doing so causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  I also remind them to maintain social distancing at all times during and after the meeting.  Members are asked to use the wipes and hand sanitiser provided to clean seats and desks, to supplement regular sanitisation in the breaks between meetings.  As usual, documentation for the meeting, including the Minister's opening statement, has been circulated on Microsoft Teams.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il ordered on 11 November that the further Revised Estimate for Vote 32, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, be referred to this committee for consideration.  Today we will discuss this with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who I welcome to his first trip to our committee.</p> <p>  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and to the practice of the Houses as regards references made to persons in witnesses' evidence.  They are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action taken based on what they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are defamatory to an identified person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with this direction.</p> <p>  I invite the T&aacute;naiste to make brief opening comments on the Revised Estimate.</p></speech>

I express my appreciation to the committee for taking our Revised Estimate this evening.</p> <p>  The further Revised Estimate presented today seeks to incorporate into our Department&rsquo;s Vote the &euro;1.969 million in funding arising from the transfer of certain functions to my Department; the additional &euro;450 million in funding agreed in the Government&rsquo;s July stimulus; and the additional &euro;2 million in funding for this year agreed for the Tyndall Institute in the budget.  The Estimate also seeks the reallocation of moneys between certain programmes to meet excesses on the humanitarian relief and credit guarantee schemes, and the change in the title of the Department&rsquo;s Vote.  The &euro;1.908 billion being sought effectively doubles the Department&rsquo;s 2019 Revised Estimate.  It will also increase the allocation voted to my Department by the D&aacute;il last June by over &euro;450 million.</p> <p>  The &euro;1.551 billion in capital funding in the Estimate is almost &euro;930 million greater than the capital allocation provided the original 2019 Revised Estimate.  The vast majority of this increase is to enable the Department and our agencies to continue assisting business in the current Covid pandemic and in preparations for Brexit.</p><p>Some &euro;550 million is being provided for the restart grant, which has been of major assistance to businesses in reconnecting to the marketplace and taking employees back on.  An additional &euro;10 million is being provided for Enterprise Ireland's, EI, seed and venture programme, &euro;14 million in further moneys for the online retail programme, for which, 330 retailers have been approved to date, &euro;12 million to EI&rsquo;s hubs and incubation centres and &euro;20 million for the "ready for customs" grant scheme, which is particularly important given the imminent reality of Brexit.</p><p> The &euro;25 million being provided to the innovative joint IDA-EI Covid-19 life sciences products scheme will not only facilitate the research and development of Covid-19 products, but also deliver additional direct employment and other benefits for the economy.</p><p> As Deputies will all agree, local enterprise offices, LEO, work closely with local businesses that have been particularly impacted by Covid-19 and Brexit.  The additional funding allocated to the LEOs has allowed them to continue to meet the increasing demand for their services through the business continuity voucher scheme, the trading online voucher scheme and their tailored mentoring programmes.  The Estimate also provides almost &euro;100 million in "access to finance" supports, including more than &euro;41 million to Microfinance Ireland and &euro;56.96 million for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland's, SBCI, working capital and future growth loans schemes. </p><p> These Government backed loans demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensure businesses, particularly small businesses, can readily access the necessary working capital and finance facilities to enable them to come through this difficult period.</p><p> The Estimate also includes an additional &euro;2 million in capital funding for the Tyndall Institute, as announced in the budget, and increases my Department&rsquo;s total funding to the Institute this year to &euro;9 million.</p><p> The current expenditure allocation of &euro;356.87 million in the Revised Estimate represents an increase of &euro;27.76 million on the Department&rsquo;s 2019 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, allocation.  Some &euro;10 million of this is being provided to IDA Ireland to enable it to ramp up its promotional and awareness activity.  Some &euro;6 million is being provided to EI, LEOs and the Department to ensure we have the necessary staffing itself in place to administer all the new schemes and interventions.</p><p> Almost &euro;2 million of the current expenditure allocation in the Revised Estimate reflects funding related to the transfer of functions from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Social Protection.  It also includes &euro;490,000 for the Low Pay Commission.</p><p> Finally, the Revised Estimate recalibrates expected savings on the Department&rsquo;s INTERREG programme to meet additional funding required in some other areas.  Some &euro;250,000 is being provided to the humanitarian relief scheme to fund claims under the scheme arising from severe weather events, particularly in the south-west.  An additional &euro;500,000 is required by the credit guarantee scheme to meet additional costs arising from the entry of a number of additional lenders into the scheme.</p><p> The Further Revised Estimate is essential to ensure my Department has the necessary funding to enable it and its agencies to continue to provide the funding, loans and advice vital to businesses trying to overcome the twin challenges of Brexit and Covid-19.</p><p> I hope the information provided to the committee this evening, and the briefing provided by my officials, demonstrates how this funding is being spent.  Above all, it is about helping workers to hang onto their jobs and keeping businesses open.  I look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

First, I will be a small bit parochial.  I very much welcome the funding for the Tyndall Institute.  It is not in my constituency, as members will be aware.  I mean parochial in a different way.  I used to represent the workers in the Tyndall Institute so I am happy to see some money going to them; they are good people.</p> <p>  With regard to some of the schemes underpinned by the additional funding, some appear to be doing well and others have a low uptake.  For instance, does the T&aacute;naiste have any indication as to why the Covid-19 life sciences products scheme and Covid-19 products scheme have had such low approval and pay-out leaves to date, with &euro;1.9 million of &euro;20 million and &euro;500,000 of &euro;5 million, respectively?  The same goes for the ready for customs grant where &euro;3.3 million has been approved and paid out of a fund of &euro;20 million.  I would have thought schemes that deal with providing medical and scientific products would be keenly taken up.  It is most concerning that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme has only approved &euro;52.8 million worth of loans out of a scheme total of &euro;2 billion.</p> <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe anything can be learned from the terms of the future growth loans scheme that could be applied to the credit guarantee scheme?  That scheme loaned out &euro;444 million from a total of &euro;800 million, which is more than 50%.  The others do not seem to be reaching this numbers.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have a view on why that might be?</p></speech>

It was always envisaged there would be a pipeline.  The money was only announced in the past few months.  It is really next year that we expect the big drawdown to happen because there is a pipeline in terms of those investments actually happening.  It is, however, one of the areas where EU state aid rules have been relaxed and we want to grab the opportunity so that other countries do not get ahead of us.</p> <p>  There is a customs fund of &euro;8,000 for companies to take on staff for customs.  There has been a low uptake and I am a little worried about that, quite frankly.  I would like to believe it indicates that companies are ready for customs on 1 January.  I am, however, a bit sceptical that is the case.  We have written to every company, produced advice and there will be TV advertisements next week.  The financial support is there.  I will say to companies again that free trade agreement or no free trade agreement, business will change on 1 January and they need to be ready for that.</p> <p>  On the Covid-19 guarantee scheme, as of last Friday, more than 2,000 applications had been progressed to credit departments and 920 loans had been sanctioned to the value of &euro;122 million so there is still a significant amount to be drawn down.  Much of it is due to a lack of appetite among businesses to borrow at the moment.  Most small businesses have no debt.  Whether they do or not, however, there is not a large appetite to take on debt because of the uncertainty about the future.  I still believe, however, it is important the facility is there.</p></speech>

There is a nervousness.  I encourage the T&aacute;naiste to track those schemes and track the uptake.  There is an explanation and, as he said, he is worried about some of them so I encourage him to keep an eye on those.</p> <p>  Does he believe enough funding has been given to LEOs?  His constituency and mine are covered by Fingal LEO, which does fantastic work.  Given the volume of businesses that contact them to seek advice and guidance at the moment, however, most of them are run off their feet.  They do not have the financial or human resources to deal with the volume.  Do LEOs, EI, InterTradeIreland and others have sufficient resources and staff to deal with Brexit on top of the Covid-19 crisis?  Does he think they will need more funding, specifically targeted at staff, over and above that?  Is he actively monitoring that to ensure it is addressed in the event they do?  I believe we will all agree they do fantastic work but they need to be resourced.</p></speech>

Any time we launch a new scheme to provide money to business, somebody must administer it; that is the staff in EI, LEOs and InterTradeIreland.  This Estimate, therefore, provides additional current funding for staff costs in those agencies.  There will be more money next year.  We will see how it goes.  In the budget for next year, we have set aside a large recovery fund of &euro;3.5 billion, which we can dip into for additional funding for additional staff if we need it.</p></speech>

I am aware of the volume of calls that are coming in and the number of companies seeking their assistance because they are good at what they do.   That will cause a major problem.  It will be welcome to know a review mechanism is in place and the possibility of additional funding, should it be required, will be there for the LEOs, in particular.</p></speech>

Some &euro;3 million additional current funding is approved for this year, which I hope the committee will approve this evening.</p><p>There is more money for 2021 and there is a possibility to dip into that fund for more funding for staff if needed.  We will keep that under review.  I would be dishonest if I said I could guarantee that every agency will say it is adequately staffed.  I have yet to come across one that has said it was adequately staffed or overstaffed, but that is not to say we do not understand that they have been asked to do a hell of a lot more in the last year or two, and have been doing it well.  Where extra staff are needed, I will try to get the resources to make that possible.</p></speech>

The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is an advanced tax credit scheme.  The recipients will essentially pay back the money, as it is not a grant.  I have been contacted by businesses without fixed premises, such as Event Labs, which organises events such as Bingo Loco.  I am not quite certain what that is as I have never been to it, but I know it is all over the State.  Such businesses are significant employers and taxpayers and bring enterprise to nearly every county.  They have been excluded from the scheme.  The same goes for Mind Body Experience events.  Furthermore, suppliers are affected upstream by the shock waves of the lockdown on their downstream customers.  These people, who are not at the coalface but provide goods and services to those who are, have all been excluded because of the narrow and prescriptive nature of the scheme.  Are there plans to broaden the scheme out so that businesses which are seriously suffering can access funds through the CRSS?  I ask particularly in light of it being an advance tax credit scheme.  It is not a bonanza or anything they will not have to repay at some point.  Is the Minister amenable to examining the criteria to allow the premises that are now excluded but which are significant taxpayers to benefit from it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2020111800002#C00300"><p>The scheme is run by the Revenue Commissioners through the Department of Finance rather than my Department but I am across it as I must be because it impacts on business a great deal.  While it is a tax credit, and it is taxable, businesses will only end up paying it back if they start making profits so in many cases it will not be paid back.  If companies return to profit in the years ahead, they will repay it then, but much of it will not be paid back.  It is a tax stream similar to the restart grant, for example.  It is designed to cover the fixed costs of having a business that is closed, such as utilities, security and insurance.  While many companies do not qualify for it, they may qualify for other things such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The whole idea of the CRSS was to cover the fixed costs of a premises which the Government told business owners they must close.  Companies that do not qualify do not have a premises that must be closed, but they may have other fixed costs not related to a premises that must be closed.  We are trying to help firms in areas such as the event sector in another way.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, has a very substantial budget and is trying to develop schemes that might help companies without a premises that has been closed.  I think there will be a few businesses that fall between stools.  One which occurred to me was the chauffeur limousine sector, which has been very badly hit.  I am thinking of those who serve the airports, for example.  Another group of people who might not be covered are those who run exhibitions.  They do not have premises so they do not get anything from the CRSS and will not benefit from the arts and events schemes which the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, will develop.  We will have to return to this when we have a better fix on which companies fall between stools.</p></speech>

Is the Minister agreeable for me to forward him the names of some companies that have contacted me?  I expect he will be across most of them already.  This is not to intervene on an individual basis but as a means of demonstrating how those companies are falling through the cracks.  They are in need of help but there does not seem to be anything that they can specifically access now.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by many business people who have said that without the supports put in place by the Department they would have been completely wiped out.  It has helped them to survive and stay in business and many have said they are extremely grateful for that.</p> <p>  There are a number of novel issues that have arisen.  A massive amount of money is involved.  The Minister spoke of the destructive innovation fund which is being increased by &euro;10 million.  That sounds very interesting and I like the idea of destructive technology.  What is the thinking behind that?</p> <p>  The trading online voucher scheme is something I have received a lot of positive feedback on.  There have been 14,000 applications and approximately 11,000 were approved, under Vote 32.  Has the Department received feedback on the scheme's effectiveness?</p> <p>  Another innovative item is the lean business continuity voucher.  That is quite new.  Will the Minister tell us more about that?</p> <p>  There were 98 applications for the enterprise centre scheme.  We do not know how many have been approved or when that might happen.  How does that work?  Is it through the local authorities?  What types of enterprise are involved?</p> <p>  I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste's support for the open doors initiative, which was launched two years ago.  Many companies have come together to support people on the margins and people from disadvantaged backgrounds who find it hard to get employment, such as migrants, Travellers and people with disabilities.  That initiative has been extraordinarily successful.  I note the transfer of employment functions from the Department of Social Protection.  The T&aacute;naiste's Department is now the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to take a look at the open doors initiative.  It has been so successful.  It could do with some support.  It is helping people to get jobs and to get training and internships, etc.  There might be a way of assisting it.  </p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about people without premises.  I have been contacted by several such businesses, most recently a man whose livelihood involved going around various festivals, concerts and similar events.  He was working from a van, selling doughnuts and that kind of thing.  He was completely self-sustained and had never looked for support or help from the State, but he is now under ferocious pressure because there are still costs with insurance on the van and so on.  There does not seem to be a fund where he can get help.  He can get the EWSS and that kind of thing but he is caught with the fund for fixed costs.  The hospitality sector is another area of interest.  Upstream, the suppliers into the hotels and restaurants need a lead-in time to gear up but are also a bit stranded.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on that?</p> <p>  We are faced with two major shocks, with Brexit at one end and Covid at the other.  One of those on its own would be bad enough but the two together amount to almost biblical proportions.  It is hard to figure out what will happen because it has happened so fast.  I commend the Department for what it has done.  I have pointed many businesses to the Department's website which is excellent.  It gives a lot of information in a simple way and many businesses have been very grateful because it can be difficult to figure a way through the maze of what is available.  How the website is presented is very good, and it is updated constantly so that it is up to date which is hugely important.</p></speech>

Businesses and higher education institutes get together and bid for funding for a particular project they may have.  It is the Government taking a punt and supporting a project that might turn out to be the next big thing or the next new invention, but is something that we really want to do.  It is a &euro;500 million fund spread over ten years.  There have been 43 projects approved so far under call 1 and call 2.  Some &euro;140 million has been awarded.  The extra &euro;10 million is just a small bit extra for next year.  Call 3 was launched on 24 September, with a deadline for applications on 17 December.  We expect to be able to issue the next round of funding from that in March 2021.  Hopefully it will spur some interesting new inventions and services that turn out to be big successes.</p> <p>  On the training online voucher, I believe it has just been transferred over from the Minister, Deputy Ryan's Department to ours.  It had previously operated from the Department with responsibility for communications rather than from the Department with responsibility for enterprise.  Feedback has been positive.  It is simple to apply for and a grant of &euro;2,500 is available, but two grants up to &euro;5,000 are also available.  It has helped many businesses to go online that were not online before.  Consider takeaway businesses, for example.  We have all had that experience of ordering our takeaway on our phones through an app, which we may not have done so much in the past.  We are shopping more online now.  Now people must book appointments in advance with their barber, when previously one could just walk in.  A lot of that has worked very well but we probably need to do a little bit more of this.</p> <p>  An example was given of the man who works from a van and sells doughnuts.  Those kinds of very small businesses can sometimes fall between stools.  There are some grants available.  If he had been on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, there is an advance one can get to come off the PUP.  If he was not on that payment there is a small fund called the micro-enterprise assistance fund, MEAF.  It might be possible, especially if he has an employee of some sort, for him to get a grant of up to &euro;1,000 for vouched expenses to get back on the road or back into operation.  I will be doing some publicity on that grant soon because there has been very little uptake of that.  People do not know that it exists.  It was set up for those very small businesses that did not qualify for the restart grant because they did not have a premises, and we wanted to do something for them.  I believe that only 10% or 14% of that fund has been drawn down so far.  We know it is small money, a couple of hundred euro to &euro;1,000 vouched, but for somebody running a micro business that could make a big difference in getting going again.</p> <p>  The enterprise centres are operated through Enterprise Ireland.  That fund will also be announced in the next couple of days.  Some 80 enterprise centres around the country will receive funding of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;150,000, which is largely designed to modernise the enterprise centres from a health and safety point of view so they are Covid ready or Covid proofed.  We should be in a position to make that announcement in the next couple of days.  There are 85 centres spread across the country so I would imagine all parts of the country will benefit from that.</p> <p>  I have had a good engagement with the Open Doors initiative.  Deputy Stanton and I were at that event together - I cannot remember if it was at the Guinness Storehouse or elsewhere - and it was one of those really heartwarming events where one sees people who are given opportunities they may never have had before.  People who may never have thought they would go to college or never thought they would be able to hold down a job or a career are helped and mentored in that way.  I have had engagement with them since I have taken over this brief and I look forward to continuing that.</p></speech>

We are in unprecedented times, without a shadow of a doubt.  If I may, I will jump around on a few of the different issues before I address some of the aspects of the report.</p> <p>  The leisure and hospitality sectors have been particularly badly hit and are wondering if they will be able to open over Christmas.  Consider the bar trade at the moment and furloughed staff receiving PUP.  If there is a signalling that we will open up for Christmas and staff have to come off the payment, and if we then have to go back into a lockdown in January, they will not be able to reclaim the PUP again.  They would go onto jobseeker's allowance.  This will stop pubs from being able to get their staff back to work.  Could the Minister look at some sort of derogation or an exception to allow people to recruit, and see where we can end up on that?</p> <p>  On the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, we have communicated on this and the Minister has highlighted that it is for exposed businesses who have fixed costs related to their premises that are closed.  However, festivals, caterers and circuses are excluded.  There are many businesses that have fixed costs but do not operate a premises.  There is a major catering business in Dungarvan, for example, that employs up to 80 people when it is at its busiest but who are furloughed at the moment.  That business is not able to claim anything under the crisis.  They are suffering because they have leases running on equipment.  Catering equipment can be terribly expensive.  They are looking for support.  Can we look at some way to offer a hand up for these specific sectoral businesses?  They are facing very difficult times, like everybody else, but they have been excluded under CRSS.  They thought they would have got money from it, and maybe it could be examined.</p> <p>  I also wrote to the Minister on some of the activities of the Companies Registration Office.  The Minister kindly responded to a parliamentary question on it.  I was specifically referencing the requirement for auditing for small businesses that fail to make their returns within their annual return date.  The Department came back and said they had guidance that 70% of businesses were reporting on time and that 30% were due to report but it would be impossible to have visibility on that 30%.  We have to recognise what is happening to businesses out there.  People in small businesses, some of which have been closed, are trying to collect debts, they may have VAT overhangs, they may have rent overhangs, they are trying to file returns and they are not getting them in on time.  Straight away, because they have missed their annual return date, they are into an automatic audit for two years.  It will cost a small business anywhere from &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,500 to have this done.  It is a huge and stressful thing.  I ask again if we could not look at providing some derogation on that requirement for the next six or nine months to get out the other side of where we are going with Covid.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to the expenditure being voted.  The 2016 OECD report, which I have mentioned before in a different committee, highlighted that Ireland had one of the least effective parliamentary engagements on budgetary oversight.  There is unprecedented expenditure in this year's budget.  Given Covid, and I am not saying anything about that,  it is certainly appropriate that we need to see where the State is going.  I ask that the Department would provide an information note for data users and a county breakdown of the drawdown of the various Covid subsidies that have been given to date so we can have transparency, and to make sure we are hitting all the regions in all the sectors as we should be.</p> <p>  Another item I will bring to the Department's attention, which has been mentioned before, is the issue of forbearance.  To be fair, the banks have been treating the larger SMEs with a fair amount of forbearance, but I do not think it is extending to the smaller ones.  There are smaller businesses that owe small amounts of money and they have no cash flow at the moment.  Again, maybe a communication to senior people in the financial sector to say "Look, you cannot get blood from a stone" might help.  These people need to get back in business and to be asking them to start making payments when they are out of business is ridiculous.  It is putting huge stress on people.  Whether it is to do with mortgages or leases, surely there must be some way of getting forbearance there.</p> <p>  The Covid rapid response in life sciences projects are both really good.  I approve of them and they are a fantastic way to get people up and going.</p><p>However, there was no project approved under the Covid rapid response for the south east.  I do not know the reason for that, but that seems to be the return on it.  I previously mentioned the South Eastern Applied Materials, SEAM, technology gateway in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to the T&aacute;naiste.  It is the only technology gateway of 15 in the country that has remained open throughout Covid.  It is liaising with industry in Ireland and abroad.  An X-ray machine required by this facility and approved by Science Foundation Ireland two years ago still has not been funded.  The cost is approximately &euro;2.5 million.  There is a huge volume of business being done at this facility.  The SEAM technology gateway is currently submitting patents for new respiratory masks for ICU care.  I do not know why we have fallen between stools.  In regard to the x-ray machine, I would like to know if another request for funding could be made.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to ensure an X-ray machine is funded for this technology gateway, which is one of the highest performing in the country.  As I said, this facility is open and operating to try to build its business and it makes perfect sense to provide that funding.</p><p> In regard to the innovation hubs and the enterprise centres, I heard a discussion on radio this morning about the importance of broadband provision to all houses.  I disagree.  The priority should be to get broadband into every village and small town and to locate an innovation centre or hub in each of those villages and towns.  Many people working in small businesses do a lot better when working remotely if they can do so from a local community centre with other people in the company.  This is far better for the business and much better in terms of creativity and innovation.  We should be putting emphasis on this first and let the broadband-to-home follow.</p></speech>

There will be a meeting of the Cabinet Covid sub-committee and a Cabinet meeting and we will have advice and up-to-date data from NPHET.  We will be giving Ireland a few days notice as to what 1 December is going to look like.  As everyone knows, the numbers are not what we would like them to be.  The number of new cases fell rapidly but they have pretty much stopped falling in the last week.  There is another week or two to go yet.  NPHET has set a target of having the R number at 0.5 and cases at around 100 but that is not a target that the Government endorsed.  It is a target we noted, but not one we endorsed.  The target we have set is the R number being consistently below 1 and cases falling.  The Taoiseach has said, and I very much agree, that the aim is to get to some form of level 3 at the start of December, which is less than we might like it to be but there is flexibility within level 3.  There are more things allowed in level 3 that people may necessarily think and we can ease things from there.  We all know what is going to happen once we ease restrictions; namely, the number of cases will start to rise again.  We want to, if possible, reach a steady state so that we do not need to have a third set of tough restrictions in January or February, and allow us to buy time until we have a vaccine available and deployed.</p> <p>  On the CRSS, one of the examples that comes up a lot is the home catering sector.  While people in this sector can benefit from the employment wage subsidy scheme, they would not benefit from the CRSS because they may not have a premises.  They can reclaim some corporation profit tax from last year if they were profitable.  It is one of those areas that we will take a look at.  Even though they are not technically closed because of the restrictions the Government has imposed, they are de facto closed as a result of the restrictions the Government has imposed because the premises that they would serve are now closed.  We need to be cautious because if we start opening up CRSS to the entire supply chain, the cost of that may be very high</p> <p>  On the CRO, there is some flexibility being offered already.  The CRO has eased a number of obligations under the Companies Act but we would be happy to look at further possibilities in that regard.  I call on the CRO to engage with companies that may have difficulties filing returns for good reasons.  It is not there to catch them out but we still require companies to fulfil their statutory obligations.</p> <p>  In terms of the different financial supports that the Government provides, whether it is grants or loans, we do publish, weekly, how much is being paid and the drawdown for each scheme.  I take the point that it would be good to do that on a county or regional level so that we know that there is a fair distribution of it around the country.  That is easy to do for initiatives such as the restart grant because that was done through the local authorities, and we can publish that and make it available, but it is sometimes harder to do for a company that might be headquartered in Dublin or Cork with offices all over the country and so on.  It is not always as straightforward as it may seem but the point about making as much data as possible available at NUTS 2 or 3 level, is one I support and endorse.  We had planned to do a project on that anyway.  We will do that and follow up on the point made.</p></speech>

In terms of the numbers, I do not have the exact numbers.  In terms of inspections done, from 18 May to 6 November the HSA undertook 6,271 inspections and investigations, of which 4,271 addressed compliance with the Return to Work Safely Protocol.  The finding was that 92% of workplaces were broadly compliant and had measures in place, 77% had response plans in place and 70% had a lead worker representative.  In the same period, over 18,000 inspections were carried out in compliance with the protocol.  To cut a long story short, the additional money is for extra staff to enable the HSA to do more inspections.  I will try to get the Deputy a bit more detail on what we expect in terms of outcomes.</p></speech>

This most clearly was the case in the meat plants when the alarm was raised and very many complaints were made, but no inspections took place until six weeks later.  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that the HSA was under-resourced and is it, therefore, his intention to make sure it is properly resourced into the future?</p></speech>

By and large, the outcome of the inspections has been that businesses, including meat plants, have been broadly compliant.  The impression may exist that all or most meat plants were flagrantly violating all of the regulations but that would not be a fair characterisation based on what the HSA and the Workplace Relations Commission are saying to me.  There are 2.3 million people at work in Ireland across tens of thousands of businesses.  Clearly, there are not enough inspections and there should be more.  If the Deputy is asking whether we need to resource those bodies better so they can take on more staff to carry out more inspections to ensure the laws we passed are actually enforced, the answer to that question is "Yes".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2020111800002#E01400"><p>Good.</p><p>A part of that would be having clarity that an important part of this budget should be resourcing the HSA properly.  I would also say we should be empowering the trade union movement to carry out inspections, as happens in some countries.  Therefore, it is a bit disconcerting that we do not have figures for how many inspectors we will get but I welcome getting that information.</p><p> On the role of the HSA, something I have asked about previously and confirmed is that the HSA does not do unannounced inspections on whether employers are unnecessarily bringing people into work.  If people watch the NPHET press conferences that are on twice a week, they will often hear a message that if people can work from home they should do so.  The problem in many cases, however, is that it is all very well for an ordinary worker to think he or she should do the responsible thing and work from home but if his or her employer says that during this level 5 lockdown as opposed to during the last lockdown, employees must come into work, then employees have no choice but to do it.  Quite a number of workers have approached me saying they feel they are being pressured to come into work in a situation in which they do not feel it is essential for them to come in.  NPHET has made this point as well.  The Google location activity indicators would suggest that significantly more people are travelling into work during this level 5 lockdown than during the last lockdown.  Could this be revisited to make sure people are not being forced to make unnecessary journeys into work and potentially putting themselves and their communities at risk?</p></speech>

Sometimes it has to give short notice because it is going into a particular workplace where it is not possible to just arrive with a bunch of health and safety inspectors because that would create safety issues in itself.  Most of the inspections it does are either unannounced or are short notice inspections and that is a good way to do things.  The approach it tries to take is one that encourages compliance.  The HSA is not there to catch employers out, unless the abuses are flagrant.  It is trying to detect failures and to work with employers and businesses to correct them.  Where an employer is in gross breach of the law, the HSA has enforcement powers and it uses them.</p> <p>  On people being pressured to come into work when they do not need to, there are people who could work from home and perhaps feel they are being pressured into coming into the workplace when that is not necessary.  I have come across some examples of that myself which people have contacted me about.  To date we have pointed them in the direction of the Workplace Relations Commission, which is the appropriate body that can deal with complaints from people who believe they can work from home and are being told they have to come in when perhaps they do not have to.  I have not seen many outcomes from those complaints yet.</p></speech>

The HSA is responsible for health and safety at work in general but it is also responsible for implementation of the Covid-19 guidelines, as has been set out.  Is it not something the HSA could proactively do if it was properly resourced, as opposed to leaving it in the hands of the individual worker to have to go through the process of going to the WRC, taking into account the fears a worker might have around that?</p></speech>

There are 2 million people at work in tens of thousands of workplaces across the country.  Any agency can only be so well resourced.  In a perfect world, it would carry out an inspection of every workplace every week but the Deputy and I both know that would not be practical to do.  We have to find the balance between what is practical and what is affordable and we need to make sure agencies are not so underresourced that it is too easy to break the rules.</p></speech>

They released a powerful open letter today and I would encourage the Minister to read it.  It gives a picture of this invisible army of workers who are doing essential work, which allows social media and the Internet to function but who are significantly undervalued.  We are talking about over 1,000 workers in Ireland.  For Facebook, essentially all of them are outsourced so that they do not work directly for it.  The letter outlines the ways in which, in general, they are not treated properly, not offered hazard pay, not offered real healthcare and psychiatric care and quite poorly paid.  They have been particularly put at risk in terms of Covid-19 and how they have been treated.  I know the Minister said to Deputy O'Reilly that he would be happy to meet those workers and their representatives, or both.  Is that something that can happen relatively quickly?  There is a particular group called Foxglove, which has co-ordinated the open letter.  This group is in Britain and it is working specifically on that issue.  Does the Minister have any response on those issues in general and can he confirm that he is happy to meet them?</p></speech>

It is tough work and somebody has to do it.  Artificial intelligence can only do so much and I would be interested to hear from them about their experiences.  One of the issues was that some of them wanted to work from home but they were being told they had to come in.  When people are looking at that kind of content, perhaps there are good reasons they should not be looking at it at home.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that this meeting can be set up.  I would not agree with the Minister on the issue of them working from home.  They should be given the choice to be at home.  The problem a lot of them have is that they are under a confidentiality clause and they are not allowed to say where they work.  That would make working at home particularly difficult if they had to try to explain to the people they were living with what they were doing.  That in itself is a huge problem so I very much welcome the fact that there will be a meeting.</p> <p>  This is a new form of work.  I am going back to my trade union days to try to find an analogous grade or a comparator and the only one I could come up with would be members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who would be detailed with investigating incidents of child pornography.  By virtue of their job, they would have to view similar images but I am also aware that content moderators do not only view offensive and horrible imagery but that there is also other work involved.  That would be the only comparator so I would encourage the Minister to look at the terms and conditions those people have in terms of their mental health and well-being, as a part of the work that is already done.</p><p>I know that is not what we are here to discuss but given that it was raised, I wanted to address it.</p><p> The T&aacute;naiste talked about a person who may have been told by his or her boss that he or she has to go into work, where he or she might have been told previously that he or she did not.  All the data suggest that more people are now going into work and one does not have to be a genius to figure out why that is.  They are being told to go into work because some bosses do not think that people working at home can be productive, although we know that productivity has increased.  When the T&aacute;naiste stated that those people can go to the WRC, I point out, with respect, that people must wait a long time to get a hearing at the commission.  The hope is - let us all cross our fingers - that we will not be in this pandemic forever, or certainly for much longer.  While we are, however, there is an urgency around this.</p><p> Every night we hear the figures and see the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and members of the Opposition telling people to stay at home but these people are being told they cannot.  They are putting themselves, their families and everyone else at risk, and we know that the virus moves only when people move.  There is a case to be made for increasing the funding to the WRC, whether to bring back persons with an expertise who have retired or people who would be able to hit the ground running by not needing to skill up and could provide that service now.  Otherwise, it will be too late for all those people.  If I was told by my boss that I had to go in to work, even though I thought could work from home, and I made a complaint to the WRC, it could be a year before that complaint is heard, by which stage, fingers crossed, the pandemic will have finished, but that person will still have to go in to and out of work.  Is there a possibility that additional resources to the WRC could be deployed quickly for the temporary or short-time deployment of staff to deal with cases of this nature, and specifically people who are told they have to go to work, even when they think they should have a right not to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2020111800002#G00200"><p>There are definitely more people going to work now than in the original lockdown of March and April but there are many different reasons for that.  First, there is a wider definition of "essential work" and we now include construction, manufacturing, international trade and services and supply chains.  Hundreds of thousands more people are deemed essential, including those in childcare and education, which were always essential in our minds but were not deemed essential in March and April.  That is the main reason that more people are going to work now and the traffic counts are higher than in the spring.</p> <p>  A number of people want to get back into the office.  The Deputy knows them and I know them.  I have heard from employers, even in the public service, about people being allowed back to the office for mental health reasons because they were suffering at home for reasons relating to their mental health, relationships or being in overcrowded housing accommodation.  There may be many different reasons that people are back at work and I do not think the main reason relates to employers pressurising people to come to work when they could work from home.  That is not to say that does not happen, but I do not have a sense that there are a large number of cases.  I would like to know the figure but I do not have a sense that a large number of cases are awaiting a hearing.  I will check to see how many complaints have been made to the WRC on that.</p> <p>  From a public health point of view, it is worth saying, and can be seen from the figures, that the vast majority of people who get Covid do so in their own or someone else's home.  One is actually statistically safer in school or a workplace than in one's own home or someone else's home, and we should not forget that.  It is often people who pick up Covid in the home who bring into the workplace or the school, not the other way round.  That is just a fact of where we stand.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's general point, which Deputy Paul Murphy also made, of whether we need more staff and resources for the WRC and the HSA in order that they can carry out more inspections, the answer is "Yes".  In the two years that I hope to hold this job, part of my mission will be to better resource those agencies to ensure that the laws we pass will be upheld in the workplace.</p></speech>

I get a sense that the figure might be a bit larger than the T&aacute;naiste thinks but I too would be interested to know those figures if they are attainable from the WRC.</p> <p>  I turn to the issue of public money and the need for that to be spent on businesses that adhere to the protection of workers' rights and their terms and conditions.  I have said repeatedly that workers' rights cannot be bought because, eventually, the price will get too high and we should not get into that kind of trade-off.  Some companies, however, are in receipt of significant sums from the State through the grant schemes such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  One such company is a large cleaning company called Noonan's.  I am aware there is a dispute not too far from Leinster House regarding outsourced services.  Staff were outsourced in 2019, Noonan's took over and they have now been told they have to accept lesser terms and conditions than those that were red-circled for them.  These companies are in receipt of significant amounts of State money.</p> <p>  I am giving this as an example and am not asking the T&aacute;naiste to comment on an individual case, but is compliance measured?  There is not much that workers can call on in terms of legislative protection, unfortunately, but the transfer of undertakings should protect those workers.  The facility I mentioned, however, is not protecting them, yet this company and several others like it are in receipt of large amounts of grant money, and justifiably so because their business has been hit.  They are not respecting the rights of those workers who continue to work.  Does the Department have a budget to monitor that compliance and to ensure that workers' rights are being protected where the State is spending and advancing significant sums?</p></speech>

One relates to tax compliance, whereby we are not going to give large amounts of public money to companies that have not paid or do not pay their taxes.  Another area is compliance with other laws.  I think that in those scenarios, there would have to be a legal finding against the company that it had breached employment law.  I do not think it could be refused the money on the assumption or allegation that it had.</p></speech>

I understand that initiative is now under the remit of the Department and I welcome that because that is the right place for it to be.</p><p>I invite the T&aacute;naiste to say something about that, and his plans and hopes for it.  </p><p> In the documentation on the equality budgeting objectives and performance indicators, the target for the number of female-led, high-potential start-ups last year was 22  and I think the outcome was 12.  The target this year is also 22, although I am not sure what the outcome is.  Perhaps the T&aacute;naiste could comment on the equality budgeting objectives of his Department.  </p><p> Allied to that is the gender pay gap, in which I know the T&aacute;naiste has a particular interest.  Earlier this year, I read reports that the gender pay gap is widening in Ireland.  Where are we with that?  Considerable work was done in the legislation on reporting the gender pay gap.  That approach was effective in the UK.  Another pay gap is emerging, namely, the ethnicity pay gap.  I bring that to the T&aacute;naiste's attention as it might need some focus.  </p><p> I spoke about the Open Doors initiative.  The reason for bringing that up is that the Department is extraordinarily good and well known for highlighting and working with people at the high end - entrepreneurs who are creating jobs, technology, business and so on - and that is the way it should be.  I would like the Department to focus on the people who find it very hard to get jobs at the other end, for example, those who are disadvantaged, people with a background in the Traveller community, those with disabilities and so on.  Across government, we should focus on those and support them to get jobs because it is heartwarming when it happens.  I encourage the Department to help out there and focus on that because with a little bit of help, an awful lot can be achieved in that space.</p></speech>

At the time, I think it was a creature of the then Department of Justice and Equality but I took a personal interest in it and responsibility for it is to be transferred from that Department to my Department.  I will continue to take a personal interest in the initiative.  It is all about increasing the number of women serving on the boards of big companies, starting with those that are trading on the stock exchange.  It came out of the work we did on State boards, on which there is now a reasonably good gender balance.  Between 40% and 50% of people on State boards are women.  Although that is not necessarily the case on individual boards, when one looks at them in the round, nearly 50% of board members are women now, and the majority of people appointed to State boards-----</p></speech>

It still seems to be the case that economic committees and boards tend to me more male.  I am not sure why that is - actually I know why that is, but it is not right.  I got the first report a couple of weeks ago.  It shows progress and that the percentage of women serving on company boards has increased in those companies which had none, or where representation was very low.  That is positive and we will stick with it.</p> <p>  On the gender pay gap, the legislation now falls to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, following the change around.  That area moved with equality to the Minister's new Department.  We need to get that work done.  As the Deputy knows, it will require companies to report on their gender pay gap and also to produce plans to close the gap.  The reason the gap exists is complex and I will not use our short time talking about it.  We really need to get that legislation done next year.  I am disappointed we did not get it done this year but we lost months because of other things.</p> <p>  On the issue of equality budgeting, the Department was one of the first to pilot the equality budgeting programme, and we are going to continue to progress our equality metrics in relation to all of our programmes.  </p> <p>  To return to the Balance for Better Business initiative, it has been suggested that I mention - I think it is a good idea that I do so - that we are not just going to look at the issue of female representation on boards but also in senior management positions, which is just as important, if not more important.</p></speech>

I think he said, in response to Deputy O'Reilly, that in respect of Covid, one is statistically safer being at work than at home.  Did I hear the T&aacute;naiste correctly and, if so, could he explain that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2020111800002#H00600"><p>That is what I said, but I am not sure it is quite what I meant.  What I meant to say is that for quite a while now, the majority of clusters have been in private homes and that is where most people have been getting Covid, rather than in schools and workplaces.  That is not to say one is more statistically like to get it in a school or workplace.  I stand corrected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2020111800002#H00700"><p>On the T&aacute;naiste's second point, and he is the doctor and I am not, but Covid does not come out of nowhere in a home.  It is brought into a home and then infects everyone in that home.  It is seeded somewhere, be it in a workplace, school, social activity, church or elsewhere, but it originates outside the home and someone brings it into the home where it spreads.  Therefore, what may start as one transmission to one individual becomes a transmission to four people when that person brings it home and spreads it.  It does not just arrive in the home from nowhere; it comes from somewhere.  Is that not the case?  If we all just stayed in our homes, which is the idea behind partial or full lockdown, we would not get Covid because it does not originate out of nowhere, people have to give it to each other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2020111800002#H00800"><p>It does not just arise in the home either; it has to come from somewhere.  We could all stay in one place.  If we all stayed in one bubble, we would either not infect each other or we would all infect each other and it would peter out.  If we all just stayed in the one place, for example, if we all just stayed at work for X number of weeks, it would have the same effect as us all staying at home for X number of weeks, but obviously that is not practical.  However, what happens in homes, as we all know, is that social distancing tends to break down a bit more; of course it does, with one's own family and friends.  I know that no home visits are happening at the moment but they were happening up until a few weeks ago.  In the real world, we all know from our own lives and experience that when we are with our families and friends we are much less likely to keep the 2 m distance in somebody's kitchen or sitting room that one would at mass, in a factory or in the workplace.</p></speech>

The virus spreads in workplaces and that is the reason we shut down certain parts of the economy at a big cost to society and the economy.  It is necessary to do that if we are to stay on top of the virus.  That is the reality.  For all the lobbying in favour of reopening, the position is exactly as the T&aacute;naiste described.  If we reopen in willy-nilly fashion, we will be back to a third, fourth and fifth lockdown until we reach a point in which a vaccine is available.  Workplaces are a crucial part of that.</p></speech>

However, what we know is that there are differences.  The numbers from schools are very encouraging and there is not a lot of transmission, particularly from children to adults and <i>vice versa</i>.  We also know that when it comes to homes and social gatherings, where there is a lot of interaction, there is also a lot of spread, and when it comes to other scenarios, the spread is much less.  Very few cases are related to gyms, believe it or not.  I am an advocate for the gyms to be open so I could be totally biased, but there are different settings and scenarios.  It is not the case that it is all the same, whether it is a household, school or restaurant.  There are differences between types of workplaces and gatherings.</p></speech>

The kinds of workplaces where people work closely together with poor ventilation are quite a problem. </p></speech>

To the extent that we have research now, and we are still learning a lot about the virus, it shows that the issue in the meat plants was much less about living conditions and transport and much more about the meat plants themselves and the way they organise their airflow.  I think it is linked to the temperature, where it is quite cold, and also the airflow, which is quite fast.  I read about this weeks ago and I may be getting it wrong, but the way airflow is managed in meat plants, where it is cold and fast, means that it is more likely to spread there.  The larger issue in the meat plants appears to be the way air is managed and much less about the housing conditions or transport arrangements, although they are a factor too.</p></speech>

The rate of infection among meat plant workers is extraordinary when compared to most other sectors, with the exception of healthcare, where it quite obviously not an issue of ventilation but of repeatedly being around the virus.  That is true not just in Ireland but in America and elsewhere.</p></speech>

One area the Department might look at is companies' preparation of business plans.  I am particularly thinking of applications for e-tenders and to Enterprise Ireland.  It is very difficult to put applications for Enterprise Ireland together, particularly for small enterprises.  They do get help with identifying market opportunities but they get very little support with the applications.  It is left up to them to provide the information that provides the basis for evaluating whether they should be given grant aid.  To a certain extent the same is true for e-tenders.  The Department should provide local enterprise offices with funding to run mentoring or consulting courses to help.  I am aware of many small businesses that have given up on tendering to local authorities.  This includes moderately-sized builders who no longer submit e-tenders.  They find it takes too much time and they have a poor success rate.  This probably comes down to the way they fill out the applications.  We should examine this, particularly in the context of European tenders.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste noted that the Covid restrictions support scheme provides an opportunity to warehouse tax.  Corporation tax cannot be warehoused.  For a lot of businesses, what they owe in corporation tax is cash on their balance sheet.  If they have to pay it they may have cash flow difficulties.  Looking into that would help businesses.  At this late stage in the year a lot of firms have corporation tax bills to pay.  They could certainly benefit from holding onto that money for a little while. </p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste stated, in the context of the Covid restrictions support scheme, that we cannot open up to everything.  I wrote to the Minister on a related matter recently.  He responded but I did not get an answer to my question, which concerned greeting cards.  Greeting cards are relevant to mental health.  They represent the ability to convey good wishes and let people know that significant dates have been remembered.  Retailers are not supposed to sell them at the moment because customers tend to peruse them before buying.  I have seen them on display in the front of garages.  I do not think that is a bad idea.  Can we re-examine this?  Wales has already done so and allows people to sell greeting cards.  A large percentage of our older population are not good with technology.  They are not online.  They may or may not use smartphones but they are used to writing a message on a greeting card and sending it.  </p></speech>

I think we should do something to send a message to our older people, who are more used to writing.</p> <p>  I refer also to vaccine deployment.  We have to look ahead and hope that we will see steps on this soon.  The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at -80&deg;C.  There are huge technical challenges in storing and distributing it safely, as well as a great deal of regulation.  As for the Moderna vaccine, its storage requirements appear to be closer to ambient temperature.  Will the Department look at issuing calls for providers that can meet these logistical needs?  We must avoid a situation where we have vaccines but we cannot deploy them.  </p> <p>  Last week the HSE finally produced a tender for antigen testing.  That falls into the same space.  I brought the issue of antigen testing to the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, six months ago, but let us leave that aside.  In Spain, vehicles are being fitted out for mobile antigen testing.  There is a full bespoke test.  A vehicle pulls up and a large number of workers can be screened.  </p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has previously discussed insurance reform.  Does he have an update on a revised book of quantum?  Is there any light at the end of the tunnel for businesses hoping for a reduction in insurance premiums next year?</p></speech>

Some supports are available from Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland and the local enterprise offices to help vendors prepare tenders.  A financial planning grant of up to &euro;5,000 is available for businesses to get an accountant or consultant to help develop a recovery and resilience plan.  Local enterprise offices also issue business continuity vouchers for financial planning.  Some supports are available to help businesses draw up business plans and thereby access tenders, grants and finance.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to note that corporation tax cannot be warehoused.  However, if a firm makes a loss this year but made a profit last year, it can get 50% of what it paid last year back as cash flow.  There is a similar provision for the self-employed.  That was announced quite a long time ago. </p> <p>  A vaccines task force is now up and running under the chairmanship of Dr. Brian MacCraith, who many of us will know.  Plans will be put in place to ensure the vaccine is made available as quickly as possible.  It is really encouraging to see so many companies developing vaccines.  We would hope to have a few vaccines and cover people quickly by issuing some people with the Pfizer vaccine and others with the Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines.  The residents of nursing homes will have to be the first priority.  They account for more than half the deaths in Ireland, as well as in Northern Ireland and across western Europe.  The priority will be to vaccinate them and healthcare workers, who have occupational exposure.  The next priority will be other people who are in congregated settings, such as prisoners and some other groups.  While the Pfizer vaccine has to be stored at -80&deg;C, it can be refrigerated at a normal temperature for up to five days.  The Moderna vaccine does not have to be kept so cold.  However, these vaccines are new.  Messenger RNA vaccines are totally new.  I am very optimistic that we will be able to vaccinate those most at risk of contracting or spreading the virus in the first quarter of next year.  That will totally change the R number.  Science will save the day.</p> <p>  I am pleased to hear the news on antigen testing.  I had not seen the HSE tender.  I read the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment, HTA, on antigen testing.  To be honest, I was disappointed.  I had hoped it would be better.  It has real limitations.  If it is administered by someone who is not trained the results are much weaker.  While it might be good at picking up positives, it misses a lot of cases.  Some of the data from the UK indicate that antigen testing misses up to half of cases.  It has a role but it seems to be vastly inferior to polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing.  I am not sure it is the right technology to use for screening for travel or things like that.  Interestingly, Slovakia has tested its entire population.  We will see the outcome of that. </p> <p>  I hope to publish our action plan on insurance reform next week.  That sets out all the actions we will take on insurance in the next two years.  Some are already under way.  The Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 is currently going through the Houses.  The Deputy mentioned the Judicial Council's revised guidelines for injuries.  We anticipate that they will be issued in the first few months of next year.  In theory that will result in premiums going down, but people may dispute that.  We do not yet know what the Judicial Council will come up with.  The new guidelines may reduce awards significantly and bring them more in line with other countries or may simply tweak the existing situation.  We reserve the option of legislating to cap awards.</p><p>It is significant that the Law Reform Commission has produced a report saying that we as the Oireachtas can do that as long as we allow a judicial get-out clause for a judge to make an exceptional award in exceptional circumstances.  I chair the ministerial committee on insurance and I am determined to get things done on this issue.  I do not know when that will turn into reduced premiums but I hope it will be in the course of this Government, if not sooner.</p></speech>

Figures from 2020, up to September of this year, are very low compared with 2019 and 2018.  Is the Minister concerned that businesses are not being properly prepared for Brexit and not picking up on that scheme?  I understand that it is difficult to prepare when we do not know if there will be a deal or not.</p></speech>

I see this across the board and across schemes.  I do not blame businesses.  They are struggling with Covid, a serious recession, and the fact that we had so many periods where people were marched to the top of the hill or brought to the edge of the cliff and Brexit did not happen.  I am a little worried that some businesses may think that we will agree a free trade agreement, FTA, in the next few weeks and things will be like they always have been.  They will not even if there is an FTA.  Things will change.  I have written to all 250,000 registered businesses in the country, setting out on two pages what they need to do and what help is available.  We will run newspaper advertisements and television advertisements in the next week.  I am getting worried that Brexit is only six weeks away and there are still a good chunk of companies that trade with Britain and think it is Y2K or will go away, when it will not.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware that on 23 September, trade union representatives withdrew from the Low Pay Commission on the issue of the minimum wage.  Has the Minister had any interaction with the unions since that happened?</p></speech>

Today, we had a Labour Employer Economic Forum meeting, LEEF.  Patricia King, Laura Bambrick and Liam Berney were on the call.  We did not go into much detail on low pay.  We were talking about various other issues.  I understand their position, which is that they do not accept the recommendation.  Looking back over the years, recommendations have ranged from 10 cent to 60 cent, and on all occasions in the past, unions and employers accepted the recommendation, as did the Government, whether it was at the higher level or the lower level.  On this occasion, the unions have decided to withdraw from the Low Pay Commission, which is regrettable.  I have said to them that the programme for Government envisages us moving towards a living wage.</p> <p>  There is a question of how the living wage is defined.  Using the UK model, the living wage would be lower and obviously nobody wants that model.  There is a different model, run largely by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and others, which excludes employers.  I do not think we can do that either.  We will have to come up with our own model of what a living wage is and how it can be phased in.  I would like the Low Pay Commission to be the body that does that, and therefore it needs to have union representatives at it.  I would hope to start that conversation with them with a view to them being able to re-engage with the commission and being part of designing that living wage for Ireland.  Membership turns over in a few months anyway, so that might be the opportunity.</p></speech>

I have a quick final question following from Deputy Paul Murphy's question about inspections.  The Minister said there was 92% compliance, so 8% did not comply.

We look forward to our discussions and I am sure they will be of mutual benefit.</p> <p>  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I wish to advise that witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precinct note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether, or the extent to which, the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  The person giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of the domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter they should respect that decision.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Professor Quinn to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am delighted to attend virtually today.</p> <p>  I am the incoming UN special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities.  Part of the role involves constructive interaction with Governments and, indeed, Parliaments and other key institutions.  I see this as by far the most important part of the work, which is another reason I am delighted to be here today with the committee.</p> <p>  In preparation for today I was reminded of the famous publication of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, maybe three years ago, on the role of national parliaments in monitoring the implementation of the UNCRPD.  This Parliament is among the first parliaments in the world to do so and is to be highly commended.  I believe Iceland will follow soon.  It would be nice, in time, to see this committee engage with other committees around the world to share experience and know-how.</p> <p>  I also note a recent consultative report of the Law Reform Commission, LRC, on the implementation of treaties in Irish law.  In its report, the LRC highlighted the growing role of the Oireachtas not merely in the ratification process but also in the domestic monitoring process.  The committee's work helps to advance that useful trend in the Oireachtas and it is to be commended for that.</p> <p>  At the end of the day, a treaty is just a collection of words - a collection of majestic generalities.  They have to be translated into concrete lines of action.  There is a world of difference between the law in the books and the law in action.  They have to reach the small places where people live in their own lives whether as students, workers, carers or family members.  That is where the committee comes in as it is the bridge between the high aspirations of international law and Irish life whether it is in Kinvara, Athy or Crossmolina.</p> <p>  In the time available I will focus on three things very briefly.  First, I will say something about the core foundation pillars of the treaty.  To me, they are a commitment to personhood and equality.  This goes to what the witnesses who attended here last week described as the "attitudinal" changes that the convention seeks to bring about.</p> <p>  Second, I will say something about how to characterise the many rights in the UNCRPD.  There are many ways to slice and dice them but I will put forward a simple way of doing that.</p> <p>  Third, I will say something about a core distinction in the treaty.  Some of the committee's witnesses in previous testimony have touched on the distinction between obligations of immediate effect and obligations of so-called progressive realisation.  That may sound very academic but, believe me, it will become a core part of the committee's work in the months and years ahead.</p> <p>  First, I will discuss the core of the treaty.  We all thought when drafting the treaty that it would be another equal opportunities act, like the Americans with Disabilities Act or the British Disability Discrimination Act.  It is to a large extent but something happened during the negotiations.  Civil society began asking why is it that we are treated unequally in the first place and insisting that we deal with the underlying cause and not just the symptoms.  To me, that is why the personhood provisions of the treaty are front and centre.  To use a bit of jargon, they go to the very object and purpose of the treaty.  We have made a lot of headway in Ireland on the two key personhood rights: the right to autonomy, legal capacity and supported decision-making; and the right to independent living.  What the committee heard last week was that although some progress has been made, much more remains to be done.  It is key to remember that the reason these rights are so important and central is that they carry the essential message of the treaty, which is that persons with disabilities are not objects to be managed and are subjects with rights just like everyone else.</p> <p>  Second, I will discuss how one characterises the rights in the treaty.  Obviously one starts with the personhood rights, with the foundational, and then builds outwards.  The drafters of this treaty did not want to create new rights.  There is no such thing as disability rights.  There are human rights that apply to everybody.  What they wanted to do was find ways to give equal, effective access to exercise these rights by and for persons with disabilities.  That is why the concept of equality in the convention is absolutely central.  This is not equality in a traditional, narrow or legalistic sense.  This is a concept of equality that takes account of accumulated disadvantages.  It seeks to correct for those disadvantages and build a more inclusive future.  The treaty takes this broad conception of equality and applies it to all of the usual rights of education, employment, health, the right to life and so forth.</p><p>It innovates by emphasising multiple disadvantages or discrimination based on gender, age, indigenous groups and so forth.</p><p> Lastly, the committee in its work needs to be aware of a key distinction in international law and this treaty is no exception.  All obligations associated with civil and political rights, such as freedom of expression, are to be immediately achieved - no excuses, no delays.  There is no excuse for not providing the right to a fair trial.  On the other hand, obligations associated with economic and social rights are to be progressively achieved over time with appropriate resources.  This is very important to the committee's work because many of the more important obligations in the treaty are of this character.  Most of the rights in the treaty blend the two sets of obligations.  For example, it is obvious with respect to inclusive education that it is not going to be achieved immediately in a lower income country, but there are some important limiting principles.  States are expected to use the maximum available resources and to be mindful of the impact of retrogressive steps.  Retrogressive steps should never intrude on the inner core of a right.  What really matters is the forward dynamic of change, that is, measurable progress over defined timelines with dedicated resources.  Measuring this progress &ndash; this is what the committee's guests were talking to it about last week - and judging whether enough has been done or more can be done is the essence of the committee's job.</p><p> Most people focus on the substantive rights in the treaty, such as education, employment and independent living, and rightly so.  The process innovations, however, are really key, as some guests of the committee mentioned last week with respect to Article 4.3 of the convention, and will be key to the committee's future work too.  Unlike most similar treaties, the UN disability treaty envisages, sets out and maps a domestic institutional architecture for change within particular states involving: power, which is governments and parliaments; voice, which is civil society; and ideas, which concerns the providers of innovative ideas for change.  It is this co-production of change that really counts in the long run.  I would add that this goes to legitimacy, for sure, but also to deficiency.  For example, if people with disabilities had been consulted at the beginning of the Covid crisis, many of the predictable problems probably would not have happened.  Parliamentary committees like this one have a key role to play in bridging abstract ideals, bringing them home and giving them reality in people's lives.  After all, our Republic was founded on the idea of equal rights and opportunities for all our citizens, and I like to think the treaty is a spur for us to think more deeply about our national conversation and what equality means for all our citizens with disabilities.</p><p> The committee's work will become even more important as the world recovers from Covid.  The World Bank recently emphasised the need for a resilient and inclusive recovery.  What it had in mind was the sheer fragility of support systems for many different vulnerable groups, including in particular people with disabilities, and the need to build in more robust and continuous modes of service into the future.  For these and many other reasons, I greatly welcome the establishment of the committee and wish it every success in its work.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his appointment as UN special rapporteur and wish him luck going forward.  It is a very important role.  As he pointed out, our committee has a very important role.  I think, based on the meetings we have held, that we are determined to work cohesively to progress the implementation of the UNCPRD but to do so in a focused way and by engaging with all the key personnel, such as Professor Quinn and others who have appeared before us, including the Minister and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues, as well as others we will work with in the near future.</p> <p>  What does Professor Quinn consider the key aspects that we need to reflect in our terms of reference?  It is something we are working on and want to finalise by the end of December.  We are one of the first parliaments to set up a committee to monitor this issue, as the professor noted.  What does he think will impact the implementation and progress of the UNCPRD?  Are there lessons to be learned from other countries or international best practice?</p></speech>

I have no doubt, in light of what he shared with us, that he is the right person for the job.  He outlined the whole notion of bridging abstract ideas and making them pragmatic and practical on the ground.  That is his role, working with us, and I have no doubt we can work together really well.  He talked about the committee having been set up and being one of the first of its type in the world.  At our previous meeting, we said we wanted to show ambition and leadership and to make a difference to the lives of people with disabilities.  How can we reflect that in our terms of reference?</p> <p>  Professor Quinn mentioned the optional protocols and how important they are.  We have discussed them in recent meetings and would appreciate the advice he could give us in that regard.  One of the key ways in which we want to do our business really well is by hearing the voices of people with disabilities, and we have received more than 180 submissions from people with disabilities, which is great. We want to ensure we go through them all in detail.  Is there anything else that Professor Quinn feels we should do to ensure that the voices of those with disabilities are heard?</p> <p>  Will the professor elaborate on the key process innovations he mentioned?  We would love to engage with other parliaments to ensure we can learn from them and they can learn from us.  While we have a national function, globally we need to work to ensure that people with disabilities are accepted throughout the world and have opportunity throughout the world.</p></speech>

I was thrilled to see him appointed as UN special rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities.  I pay tribute to him on all the work he has done over many years at the National University of Ireland, Galway, and on an international stage to progress the rights of persons with disabilities in law.  It is so important.  I thank him for the great presentation and the emphasis he put on equality and the practical import of our committee's work and of the convention.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin pointed out that the committee is keen to ensure we are representing and hearing the voices and lived experiences of persons with disabilities in our work.  With this in mind, I want to focus my question on the issue of decongregation.  Professor Quinn made a point in his legal memo on segregation and segregated facilities in respect of conflicts.  It appears there are conflicts regarding the implementation of the convention between the right to independent living and the use of EU funding to build and refurbish long-term residential institutions.  Professor Quinn has said Articles 5 and 19 of the UNCRPD clearly establish that long-term care residential institutions are a form of discrimination.  How do we address this, particularly where we have seen concerns expressed by some organisations and individuals that a one-size-fits-all policy of decongregation may not have regard to individual wills and preferences of persons with disabilities?  It is one of the areas where we may have difficulty in finding a balance and I would love to hear Professor Quinn's views on this.</p></speech>

With respect to Deputy Tully's question on the terms of reference, I suggest she goes back and has a look at the Inter-Parliamentary Union report on the role of parliaments.  There are two or three other parliaments in the world that are very active, including the New Zealand Parliament.  The European Parliament has a group on disability.  It does not match exactly what a national parliament does but nevertheless it would be worthwhile to have conversations with colleagues in those settings to get their view.  My sense of it, having watched previous proceedings of the committee, is that Ireland had been doing pretty well.  We have a lot of law on the books.  It has not been commenced and for whatever reason it has been held back.  One of the committee's initial jobs of work will be not just to expose that this has happened but to ask why and ask the deeper questions about what are the inhibiting factors holding this back.  Then it will be for the committee to make a judgment on whether there has been sufficient progressive realisation of the rights in Ireland.  The UN committee can make this judgment from afar but it is much better that this committee makes it in Dublin and puts it finger on what systemic changes are needed to unleash the process of change.  Whether the committee likes its or not, probably one of its first jobs of work will be to try to figure out what is going on, why these things are being held up and whether there is a way it can actually fix them.</p> <p>  With respect to Senator O'Loughlin's question on voice and including people with disabilities, let me backtrack a little bit.  Most international treaties set out a number of benchmarks and norms and then it is for governments to figure out how to apply them and work them out.  This treaty is a bit different.  It states there is a transmission belt between New York and Dublin, or Berlin, Johannesburg or wherever, or between Geneva and Dublin, which requires Dublin to get its act together.  It actually imagines what the process for domestic implementation and domestic monitoring would look like.  This is Article 33 of the convention.  It is a very unusual provision in any international convention.  Arguably, it should have been in all of the other conventions, and many people say the disability convention actually delivers on the original intent of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, going back to the 1940s and the 1950s, which got sidetracked by the Cold War and other elements.  It is a very simple construct.  It is that governments act smartly and that there would be a focal point and co-ordination mechanism within government.  We can go down a rabbit hole on the technicalities of this but the thinking behind it is simple.  It is that if regular people fall between the cracks, so what as they will recover, but for people with disabilities and people living on the margins, falling between the cracks is a luxury we cannot afford so we have to have more smart governance in place to try to deal with this.</p> <p>  Governments have to actively collaborate with civil society on the production of policy.  This is what a lot of people call the co-production of social policy.  It is probably the future anyhow for many different issues and many different groups.  It just happens to be mandated by the treaty.  In the drafting of the treaty, many civil society groups turned up and governments were very fearful of this at the beginning but towards the end of the process they were competing with one another to say they had listened better and had taken on board better what the various groups were saying.  Suddenly the penny dropped that this is the way to move forward.  This is why Article 4.3 is written into the convention.  It requires active consultation with people with disabilities and their representative organisations.  One of the tricky issues here is what is a representative organisation.  Even if it is representative, are there some voices that are not heard to which we should reach out?</p> <p>  The convention imagines there would be a reality check in terms of an independent framework for monitoring progress made in implementation.  This monitoring framework is the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission alongside two or three others.  When I was listening last week, I was struck that the legislation that specifically posits this in place has still not been enacted.  The convention requires this legislation be enacted.  In an ideal situation we would not want to be before the UN committee defending setting up the framework without having the legislation in place.  This is part of the catch up the committee will have to have a look at.</p> <p>  By the way, and I was trying to figure out how to make this point before the committee, there is another article that the committee might want to have a close look at, perhaps in conjunction with the foreign affairs committee.  Article 32 of the convention requires countries such as Ireland to make sure its foreign policy and development assistance programme is also inclusive of people with disabilities.  Why is this relevant?  Ireland's development assistance builds schools in Africa.  Are they inclusive?  Is the education system being put in place inclusive?  This is a question of value for money for the Irish taxpayer as much as anything else but perhaps there is a way the committee can examine it with the foreign affairs committee.</p> <p>  I thank Senator Bacik for her kind words.  With regard to community living and the right to live independently and be included in the community, the reason we did not call it independent living in the text was because everybody was aware of what happened in the early 1980s with people with disabilities and others being dumped on the streets in various countries.  We thought the language was a little bit debased and, therefore, a separate language is applied, which is living independently and being included in the community.</p> <p>  There are many tensions and one of the most important is between autonomy rights, that is, the right of people to choose where they live and with whom they live versus the mandate for community living.  One of the arguments made before the task force on ending congregated settings way back in 2010 and 2011 was that we cannot assume a person will not choose to live in an institution, therefore let us keep the funding stream going to enable them to live in an institution.  This was actually taken seriously back then.  To its credit, the committee on ending congregated settings dismissed this argument and said the right to live in the community is the right to choose how to live in a community and not whether to live in a community.  I was very mindful listening to the testimony last week that some people were making a distinction between the cultural shift and some of the technical interpretations of the culture shift.</p><p>The way I saw the report on the ending of congregated settings is that if it is viewed through the cultural shift, valuing people living and flourishing in the community, then that magic figure of four that was mentioned last week really boils down to two, that is to say, one choosing to live with somebody with a disability while the other would be people without disabilities and not the service providers.  That was very important.  That was the original vision of the report on ending congregated settings.  Some countries around the world have used it as a model and are now far ahead of us.</p><p> I will end by saying that the controversy about the Structural Fund continues.  This is taxpayers' money that is being used in some countries to build institutions for people with disabilities.  They are not called institutions anymore.  They are downsizing to what they call hostels, of 12 to 14 people, in some countries, but to us they are institutions.  It is a running scandal within the European institutions about how to end this.  I am sorry that they were long-winded answers but the questions were really good too.</p></speech>

I have a number of quick questions.  He touched on the matter relating to one of my first questions, about whether the current legislation is fit for purpose both in terms of its definition of disability and in supporting the work of this committee.  Professor Quinn has spoken a bit about that.  I am interested in his opinion on whether the charitable status of section 38 and 39 organisations, which are such a major provider of services in the State, has an impact on our ability to conform to the requirements of the UNCRPD in the future.  I think in particular of our inability to audit them through the Comptroller and Auditor General, which we would be able to do if they were Government bodies.  I am interested in whether Professor Quinn would see the non-State status of some of the services we provide as a barrier.</p> <p>  Professor Quinn is correct.  The energy in the committee is brilliant in terms of making this really meaningful for the community of people with disabilities, but I fear that we will focus more on the Article 4.3 side of things and listening to people's experience and less on the monitoring side.  For it to be meaningful, I think we need to start talking very early in the process about the metrics and how we are going to measure this.  I am interested in hearing Professor Quinn's views on that because I am aware that the convention requires states, in accordance with their legal and administrative systems, to maintain, strengthen, designate or establish a framework to promote the text and monitor implementation of the convention.  I was wondering about the use of the small word "or".  In Professor Quinn's estimation, what is expected of us in two years' time or whenever we make a report on the UNCRPD?  What would the evaluation look like?  I want to make sure that we are really effecting change, that the change is measurable and that we can hold people to account.  For me, that means having fairly hard data.  I am interested in that area.</p></speech>

I hope everything is well in Galway.  I will be down there tomorrow night.  I ask him to keep it safe for me.  His opening remarks were very critical in terms of the language he used.  As the Chairman said, there are many lines we can take from it for the committee.  One of my questions also concerns what Deputy Hourigan said about measuring progress.  Last week, we heard that surveys are not really the way to do it.  We need to talk to people and let them tell us, but we also need to dig deeper than just to get people's feelings or what they believe is happening.  I would welcome Professor Quinn's thoughts on that.</p> <p>  How do we get the legislation on a trajectory where we can see what is happening when and that we ensure we get it over the line?  In terms of dealing with disabilities, what local authorities say is that they will do it if they have the resources.  It gets done if it is the law, so we need to make sure that we get the resources but also that we back things up with the law to ensure progress.</p> <p>  The committee will have to interact to a significant extent with people with disabilities and their families right across the spectrum from when children are born to when they are older.  In my experience of public life, I have seen many issues arise.  Professor Quinn alluded himself to the fact that the law is words on paper, as is the UN convention, but they require implementation and action.  What seems to happen is that gaps appear in every facet of service provision at the transition point, for example, from young children to teenage years to adulthood.  At each stage families have to start again because of the gaps.  Families have to fight for everything.  I would welcome Professor Quinn's views on that and how we can put the teeth that are required into all of the words that we have.</p></speech>

I welcome Professor Quinn to the meeting, congratulate him on his appointment and thank him for all of the information he has provided, especially his legal memo, which was very informative.</p> <p>  We all want the same kind of information.  I had questions on the terms of reference and other issues that have been raised already, so I will try to focus on something a little bit different.  People want to see action.  Legislation has not been enacted but was just left on the shelf.  I am concerned about the optional protocol.  I accept that we have set up the committee and we are leading the way in Europe in that regard but, at the same time, we are the only member state that has not ratified the optional protocol.  My question concerns how Professor Quinn feels the situation is developing at the moment.  I know we have to report at the end of the year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has committed to looking at ratification in January.  Is that realistic, given that legislation has not been enacted?  Professor Quinn has already stated that we have to expose the irregularities or discrepancies in legislation but at the same time to push for them to be enacted first before the ratification can take place.</p> <p>  In his submission, the professor mentioned about how the retrogressive steps should not ever intrude on the inner core of a right.  In our reaction to Covid, the shutdown of day services was a violation of the human rights of people with disabilities.  That is how it felt to them every single day.  Until the ratification takes place, is there anything Professor Quinn could suggest we can do to ensure that does not happen again?</p></speech>

It is a great pleasure to have him with us.  It is an extra pleasure for me as I am a graduate in law from NUIG.  For the many years I was in Galway his reputation among students and staff was high, both academically and personally.  It is fantastic to have him here.  I congratulate him on his new role.</p> <p>  His opening remarks were most inspiring.  They filled me with possibilities about the what-ifs and the many successes we can and must have in this committee.  We must make sure that the committee is wide reaching and that we take the opportunity to be transformative.  Professor Quinn referred to a line in the Proclamation about equal rights and equal opportunities.  I used to read that line endlessly as a child and believe that nothing was beyond me.</p><p>I was able to live that line.  Not everybody is able to live it.  It has driven me for my entire life.  We now have the mindset change to bring about change and regard everyone in society as equal.  I realise there are many challenges regarding the implementation of the UNCRPD because there are so many complex issues and dynamics involved.  We must generate the commitment in both civil society and the Government.</p><p> Many questions have already been asked.  I would really appreciate Professor Quinn's comments on how we can best move forward from policy to implementation, and on how we can monitor and evaluate our progression in this regard.</p><p> Article 8 of the convention alludes to awareness raising.  This is a huge issue for me.  No child should leave school without disability awareness training.  We should all receive it as public sector workers.  In Professor Quinn's opinion, what is the best way to do this?  I refer to change from the bottom up.  How can we best achieve a kinder society for everybody?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2020111800002#E00200"><p>I join the others in extending to Professor Quinn my warmest congratulations.  I was delighted that he was appointed to his role.  Of course, I am delighted as a Galwegian but, most important, we are now in our national roles and Professor Quinn is in his international role.</p><p>It was interesting that Professor Quinn commented on foreign policy.  In his new international role, I encourage him to engage with us always where there are points of policy coherence.  He mentioned overseas aid and the question of how we can be consistent in championing these issues.  Are there other areas he wants to flag in terms of international policy coherence, not just concerning Ireland?  I am thinking of areas where these issues are forgotten and where the relevance is sometimes neglected.</p><p>I want to focus on what Professor Quinn said about &quot;obligations of immediate effect and obligations of .... progressive realisation&quot;.  As I understand it, civil and political rights are the obligations of immediate effect.  Could Professor Quinn give some examples?  The right to private and family life and the right to choose where and with whom one lives, for example, are important.  Questions of participation, including public participation, arise in this context.  Education, as a very large bloc, and the health system and transport are easier areas in which to speak of rights but I am referring to civil and political rights such as the rights to political or civil participation and social and cultural participation.  Do they fall into that space?  How can we address them?</p><p>I would really appreciate it if Professor Quinn could comment on regressive steps.  While, on the one side, there is the work on progressive realisation, designated resources and the momentum or direction of positive change, are retrogressive steps more than just steps that attack the rights of somebody?  When major steps forward as a State, such as substantial capital expenditure on schools, as Professor Quinn mentioned, or on social housing, fail to take account of or acknowledge the rights of persons with disabilities, do they become regressive?  I am not referring to a step that is simply hostile <i>per se</i>but to one that involves negligence through omission.  Can it be read as a retrogressive step?</p><p>Deputy Hourigan rightly pointed out the problem whereby so much is dependent on procurement and outsourcing within Ireland.  Some outsourcing is to the voluntary sector and some is to the private sector.  How do we ensure our resource allocation as a State is responsible and cognisant of the UNCRPD?</p><p>Could Professor Quinn comment specifically on universal design and how it might be incorporated?  It is the very literal part of the architecture of change.  I am definitely noticing what Professor Quinn mentioned regarding Article 33.  How we intersect with other treaties will be important.  It could be that a stronger implementation mechanism for the UNCRPD and rights could set a useful example.</p><p>I thank Professor Quinn.  I hope this engagement will be ongoing.</p></speech>

May I put him on the spot?  We will be deliberating over the coming weeks on the terms of reference we want to set as a committee.  I speak for everyone who has attended our meetings recently and acknowledge they are passionate about what they want the committee to achieve.  We are trying to advance the case of people with disabilities in Ireland and internationally.  We have been challenged to implement the treaty in front of us.  Could Professor Quinn state, in a sentence or two, what he would like to see reflected in our terms of reference so we may achieve the best outcomes possible for people with disabilities in the State and abroad?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2020111800002#E00400"><p>Those were fantastic questions.  I will make one or two comments before I deal with the individual questions.  It seems to me there was a culture shift, or what was described last week as an "attitudinal" change, among some of the witnesses before the committee.  It is very easy to achieve at a headline level but it is very difficult to have it percolate down into how systems behave and function.  It has always seemed to me, or to a close reader of Max Weber, that systems take a lot longer to change than might be envisaged and that they harbour within them the DNA of old ways of thinking.  They are not even conscious of that.  We have done a pretty good job at headline level but it has not really percolated all that deeply.  The litmus test is a crisis, like Covid, whereby one can see the old way of thinking coming directly to the surface.  The real challenge concerns how we can bring about systems change so attitudinal change will become a natural reflex of the system, not something to be imposed after the fact and so forth.</p> <p>  The added value of the committee is that it is not just a passive recipient of testimonials from civil society; it has space for deliberative reason.  Members can ask the hard questions about what is really going on, identify the blockages, get them out into the light of day and figure out a way of trying to resolve them.  That is a great service to government and civil society.  In this regard, value is added to the testimonials from civil society.  Therefore, I do not regard the committee solely as a passive recipient of the testimonials.  I consider the testimonials to be prodding members to ask the harder questions, go deeper and unleash the dynamics for genuine systems change in the future.  One reason I believe there is close chemistry between the UNCRPD work that the committee is about to do and the work on the UN sustainable development goals is that the latter are much more intentionally directed at the systems change that needs to be brought about.</p> <p>  Deputy Hourigan talked about how we measure progress and asked what the metrics are for progressive achievement and progressive realisation.</p><p>The committee can learn from the international work being done, but at the end of the day it is down to it to decide whether, given X, Y or Z - committee members will know what X, Y and Z are - the Department of Education, for example, is doing enough on inclusive education and so on.  There are a lot of metrics out there for slicing and dicing the convention.  Sooner or later, one goes down lots of rabbit holes and misses the actual dynamic of change.  It is a very tricky thing.<br/><br/>I would say - this comes across in some of the questions, indirectly at least - we have yet to see a real change in service design and delivery in Ireland.  This cuts across the board, not just for people with disabilities but for older people as well.  We have begun a few things.  We had the task force on the individualisation of budgets and services.  It seems that is not going as fast it could and that this points to a break-up of the existing architecture for service delivery.  It is, almost, an invitation to very different kinds of providers to enter the market.  People are talking at the moment about the &quot;Uberisation&quot; of services for people with disabilities and the &quot;you go out there, you discover what suits you&quot; response.  This might not necessarily be a traditional service provider but the individual can tailor what is useful to him or her at the end of the day.  This has proven itself to be responsive and, also, very efficient and not a waste of taxpayers' money.  Somebody asked earlier what the ambition is.  That could be a wonderful ambition for Ireland.  Ireland will find many allies in the European Association of Service Providers who want to see revolutions in how services are delivered.  <br/><br/>On the optional protocol, it is a bit of a mystery to me because Ireland ratified a revised treaty on economic and social rights in the Council of Europe system in April 2000.  At the same time, not one day, one year or five years later but on the same day, it also ratified the optional protocol under that convention allowing for complaints.  <i>A priori</i>, there is no reason known to me that the optional protocol could not be ratified within the next five minutes.  That does not take legislation; it just takes a resolution from both Houses enabling the Government to ratify and so forth.  I see an inconsistency in the approach between the CRPD optional protocol and the approach taken under what is called &quot;the revised European Social Charter&quot;.  Both optional protocols allow for the ventilation of complaints that deal with economic and social rights, which moves this into the debate about progressive realisation.  If it was not an obstacle for one ratification, I am not so sure why it should be an obstacle for ratification of an additional protocol.  The Government may have been worried that this would be an indirect route to the judicial enforceability of economic and social rights but that cannot be the case because ratification of this international instrument, by no stretch of the imagination, confers extended jurisdiction on the Irish courts to litigate, as it were, these kinds of rights and complaints.  I think that was the issue for Deputy Wynne.  <br/><br/>The point Senator McGreehan made about equality is interesting.  There is a tendency to see the treaty as an external imposition.  To me, it is not.  It is about reminding us we have already committed to doing this.  It is a roadmap that helps us to ask the right questions and to own the process of change.  It is not about Geneva or New York dictating but about us internalising these values very deeply.  In that sense, I see the treaty as an aid to that process of internalisation.  This is something we should be doing.  Sometimes, it is not a good idea to do things because the law or an international treaty states we should do it.  One has to do something because one believes in it.  <br/><br/>Senator Higgins asked a lot of interesting questions, one of which was on development assistance.  There is a guidance note being prepared by our development aid people on how to take into account disability in how we spend our moneys, for example, in Africa or places like that.  It would be well worth the committee's time to follow that work in conjunction with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i>in how this committee would do that but it is a very important piece of work.  We will have to answer on that before the UNCRPD committee and so it would be a very interesting piece of work to look at.  Senator Higgins also asked what are the other big issues.  There was a resolution last year before the UN Security Council, which Ireland is about to join, on protecting civilians with disabilities during armed conflicts.  It is an historic resolution.  Unfortunately, there are 16 armed conflicts around the world today.  The plight of people with disabilities in those countries can only be imagined.  There is an ongoing conversation, particularly about peacekeeping operations in disabilities but also about the laws of conflicts and people with disabilities.  NATO is doing a lot of work on this issue.  It would be nice if Ireland could be encouraged, via this committee or otherwise, to keep this issue on the agenda at the level of the UN Security Council.  It would be fully in keeping with our traditions for peacekeeping throughout the world.<br/><br/>As to how one distinguishes between obligations of immediate effect and those that have to be progressively realised, which is the hard question Senator Higgins threw at me, it is complicated and complicated further by the fact that the treaty does not separate them out.  Each right is a blending of the two.  It is sometimes really hard to disentangle.  For example, is everything under Article 12, which deals with legal capacity and assisted decision-making, to be implemented immediately or can a country progressively achieve the supports system we need to put in place to enable people to exercise their rights?  It is a bit academic in that context because it is pretty obvious that there are delays in putting support systems in place.  Even if one decided that that side of the provision is only to be progressively realised, Ireland is falling short.  There is no straightforward answer.  It depends on how one reads each particular article.  I would be guided by what the UNCRPD committee says in its jurisprudence.  Also, retrogressive steps are not necessarily with hostile intention.  Periodically, we go through economic ups and downs and this will have implications for resource allocation.  International law makes allowance for that.  One cannot legislate against economic retrenchments; they just happen in economical cycles.  There are limiting principles in how far one can go.  The squeaky wheel sometimes gets the oil, but on the other hand, the wheel that does not squeak is punished first.  That is something to be avoided at all costs.  Hopefully, we are going to bounce back after Covid but even beyond that, there will be some retrenchments within Departments as distinct from between Departments.  That is a very interesting issue to look at.<br/><br/>There were one or two other issues raised.  The speaker did not use the phrase &quot;outsourcing either to municipal authorities or to private actors&quot; but I am going to use it.  There is an important point of principle here, which is the notion of what is called &quot;state responsibility&quot;.  Even if one delegates to a third party to do X, Y or Z, one cannot avoid liability and answerability for their deficits on the international stage.  I remember one country famously took this to mean that when it came to all of the economic and social stuff it had given to private parties, it had no answerability.  That is wrong; it retains full answerability.</p><p>That is not just under the treaty, it is under general principles of state responsibility in international law.  As to universal design, I am not an expert on that but I know it is important.</p><p> Reference was made to public procurement debate.  The UN has produced a disability inclusion strategy.  We are trying to make sure that all its specialised agencies are also inclusive of disability and one of the big debating points is the role of public procurement in making that happen.  There are many interesting debates happening around the world on public procurement that we can easily tap into.</p><p> Last but not least, getting back to the issue of systems and structural change, we should be looking at the approach of the Australian Government, which is that we should view disability and even old age as a natural contingency and make explicit allowance for it in terms of insurance programmes so that we can adequately fund what is needed into the future.  That is the way they are rolling out the personalisation of services in Australia and it is proving to be quite successful so far.  It is certainly worth exploring in an Irish context because it would help to get around the stranglehold of very traditional support service structures in this country.  I am sorry that I have been very long-winded with my answers.</p></speech>

I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on the extent to which evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call on Professor Laffan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I will make two contextual points and three core points about the conference itself.  As to context, the idea of a conference on the future of Europe was one of President Macron&rsquo;s <i>grands projets</i>for Europe but it really only became a possibility when Ursula von der Leyen, the new Commission President, proposed it in her engagement with the European Parliament before she was voted on.  The reason she needed to do it was that she had not come through the Spitzenkandidaten process, like Juncker had, and, therefore, in order to get the support of the Parliament, she needed to offer something that the Parliament wanted.  Therefore, the Parliament is very interested in the conference on the future of Europe.<br/><br/>It also linked to her three core political priorities - the green deal, digital and Europe's role in the world.  Of course, the whole context of the conference has been dramatically altered by Covid-19 and its impact on our societies and economies.  The focus of all governments and parliaments across Europe now will be on the recovery from Covid.  The question is how much bandwidth politics and public policy will have in Europe over the next two years to engage with the future of Europe.  There is cause for concern that the timing is bad or, in other words, that it will look as if this is very disconnected from the everyday experiences of the people of Europe.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it is going to happen, I think, and, therefore, it is very important that it concentrates on Europe's big challenges.  Of course, it has not got off the ground yet.  There is still a discussion on its scope, on its organisation and on who should chair.  The German Presidency has worked on it but has not managed to secure agreement on the <i>modus operandi </i>of the conference.<br/><br/>I will move to my three substantive points.  First, as I said, this conference should concentrate on substance.  It should concentrate on how we address climate, on the digital transition and on Europe's new political economy, given Covid has accelerated and accentuated important trends in our economy, on public health and on Europe's role in the world.  These are the imperative, compelling issues.  I would not want a conference on the future of Europe at this stage to really engage on the nitty-gritty of institutional roles and inter-institutional bargaining.  This is not a time for battles about how Europe does its business; it is really about what Europe should do.<br/><br/>Second, it is very important that the process is as participative and deliberative as possible.  This should not be a Brussels insider process.  There is a very important responsibility and opportunity for national parliaments to play their full role.  National parliaments have two important roles, first, to engage actively in the conference over its duration but, second, and this in some ways is almost more vital, to educate the public, to interrogate the positions of governments and to ensure the public knows about this.  In terms of engaging with the public, to use dialogues, forums and all of the techniques we now have - which, of course, are mostly digital given the times we are in &ndash; to engage both organised civil society and the broader society will be extremely important.  I would also add that there should be a European perspective, not just an accumulation of national perspectives.  We need both; we need the national but also the European.<br/><br/>It is far too early to assess the outcome and the scope, but it could well be that the conference will end up with recommendations and then, subsequently, treaty change that will require a referendum in Ireland.  Therefore, from now, from the beginning of this conference, it is extremely important that the Irish electorate is informed about what is going on.  Why?  It is because we know, as the data and the research has told us, that one of the most fundamental reasons in Ireland for voting against treaty change has always been a lack of knowledge.  In other words, &ldquo;Vote 'No' if you don't know&rdquo; is a very compelling argument.  Therefore, there is a particular issue, given we are referendum country, for us to be attentive to the educational role from the beginning.<br/><br/>I will leave it at that.  I look forward to our discussion.</p></speech>

I am more than happy to take questions on the broader issues that were included in the invitation afterwards.<br/><br/>I would like to frame my remarks around two questions: first, whether what is proposed in the conference would require treaty change; and, second, whether treaty change is desirable.  Based on what is proposed in the documents issued by the institutions, I do not think treaty change is necessarily required.  I break this into two elements, namely, institutional and policy-based.  On the institutional dimension, two proposals are mentioned - the Spitzenkandidat system and transnational lists.  The Spitzenkandidat system can operate as a political practice as we saw in 2014.  Whether this is a good idea is a different discussion.  The question of transnational lists might require treaty change.  The treaty is somewhat ambiguous about this.  This can happen with the European Commission's communication which refers to how it would require a decision of the European Council at least.  I am happy to go into that in some more detail.  That is probably a bit premature at this stage, but if members wish me to cover that, I am more than happy to do so. <br/><br/>Regarding policy areas, there is some competence for the EU at the moment in most policy fields that are mentioned.  Of course, the conference might propose to increase the competences, particularly in fiscal areas covering health in light of Covid, but that would require a more detailed assessment.  If the conference decides to increase the competences of the Union, I outline in my written remarks a couple of different options.  More than likely, it would require use of the ordinary revision procedure, which is the standard full-blown treaty revision procedure.<br/><br/>On the second question as to whether treaty change is desirable, I make a number of remarks rather than point in any particular direction.  As I said, it will probably require the ordinary revision procedure which might involve a convention and an intergovernmental conference, and it might be difficult to keep that restricted to discrete reforms.<br/><br/>In recent decades, different actors have become involved in treaty negotiations and in particular adoption.  It is not just referendums, but also constitutional courts and parliaments.  Sometimes the parliaments require super-majorities.  There are a number of different veto points and a number of points at which any treaty could fail.  There is, of course, a risk of failure of any major treaty reform with political damage to the Union.<br/><br/>This is not to say that treaty change should never be considered.  However, we should be mindful that any treaty change must navigate various obstacles of a political and legal nature throughout the 27 member states.<br/><br/>This is an era of populism, although that is changing.  The European Union, as a transnational organisation, might be a particular target.  While treaty reform may provide a symbolic constitutional moment for the Union, generating political mobilisation and commitment, it also raises the possibility of the Union being the target of contestation and repudiation in national parliaments and electorates. <br/><br/>I would not rule out treaty reform <i>a priori</i>.  This is because of the citizen-led nature of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  The process of involving EU citizens and the process of the Conference on the Future of Europe may be as important as any particular outcome.  I see an intrinsic value for the legitimacy of the Union in that process of citizen deliberation.  Ruling out any particular outcome in advance would risk undermining the bottom-up deliberative nature of the conference.  A major treaty reform may not be necessary, given the existing competences and there are risks involved in this route.  However, citizens should have the option of proposing treaty change if that is what decided after careful deliberation.  This is based on the process itself and the need to keep options open for citizens.  I look forward to any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I will keep my remarks short to allow time to engage with committee members.  I have provided a more comprehensive briefing document for members of the committee which I hope will act as a useful reference point for today's session.</p> <p>  For over 65 years, debating and engaging people in Ireland on our relationship with Europe has been the overarching mission and core objective of European Movement Ireland.  To that end, we are passionately determined to ensure the success of the Conference on the Future of Europe in its delivery and outcome.  It is a crucial part of our work and outreach.</p> <p>  The conference has emerged as a priority of the present European Commission and importantly is supported by both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.  It is vital that the conference is meaningful and an effective forum for European citizens at its very core.  It also needs to engage with the challenges and opportunities facing the European Union.  Earlier this year, in our annual RED-C poll on Ireland and the EU, when asked if respondents felt their voice was heard in the EU, 48% disagreed and only 33% agreed, with a very high proportion, 19%, saying they did not know.  The conference represents a chance to change this finding and it must do so.</p> <p>  The coronavirus pandemic understandably delayed the launch date, which was due on 9 May, Europe Day, earlier this year, coinciding as it would have then with the 70th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration.  The German Presidency of the Council of the EU has prioritised its getting off the ground during its term, which may be ambitious.  However, consensus seems to have settled on the conference being a three-way undertaking, involving the Parliament, the Commission and the Council overseen by an independent chair.  Unfortunately, political machinations on who should assume the chair position has delayed things further.</p> <p>  When I had the honour to present to this committee in October, I pointed out that the polling of EU citizens on how the EU was dealing with the Covid-19 crisis demonstrated that when the European Union acts in a co-ordinated and effective way, citizens respond positively as seen by greater levels of support.  That is also the case regarding the conference, which needs to start urgently.  Further delay has the potential to undermine the process before it has begun.  In the poll on Ireland in the EU earlier in the year, just 20% of the respondents had heard of the conference.  European Movement Ireland believes the conference should deal with the substantive issues facing the European Union and it should be citizen led.  We are broadly supportive of the themes that have already been identified and outlined.</p> <p>  Current proposals envisage that as well as those policy issues, the conference should also address institutional matters.  While we believe this is appropriate, institutional change or reform should be considered as a means to deliver results on the policy issues and not an end in itself.  In an Irish context, institutional reform gives rise to the question of treaty change.  We believe it would be counterproductive to set narrow terms of reference that preclude treaty change as an option.  However, it is our preference that the deliberations focus on the real and substantive issues that affect the lives of people across the European Union, rather than a very academic debate on inter-institutional relations.  That being said, treaty change may be necessary in the future for the EU to deliver on the substantive issues we have outlined.  We should not shy away from that.</p> <p>  European Movement Ireland has a very proud record of engaging citizens and stakeholders on European issues.  That informs our view that the position of citizens must be core and underpin the Conference on the Future of Europe.  In 2017, we were delighted to work with the then Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to deliver an ongoing national citizens engagement programme on the future of Europe in Ireland and where we saw Ireland's place in the EU post-Brexit.  How did we do that?  It involved travelling the length and breadth of Ireland and engaging with people through concrete town hall debates on Ireland's place in Europe.  Done outside the traditional political sphere, it provided platforms for debate on people's feelings and our relationship with Europe, but crucially was supported and engaged broadly at a cross-party consensus level.  Thousands engaged digitally and more than 800 people attended the various physical events in the world before Covid.  The programme was launched in the Science Gallery in late 2017.</p><p>From there, in 2018 we travelled to Galway, Cork, Letterkenny, Navan, Kilkenny and Cavan, culminating in a national citizens' dialogue in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on Europe Day.  Who did we engage with?  Different communities.  There was an open call for people to come along: people who had lived abroad; EU citizens living in Ireland, a tribute and testimony to the multicultural and multiethnic communities we have in our country; young activists; trade unions; student groups; civil society organisations; senior citizens; elected representatives.  All together they created a dynamic and evolving conversation about how we as a country and a people might develop Ireland's place within the EU. </p><p> Complementing this very tangible on-the-ground series of town hall dialogues was an active social media campaign.  Over 400 million impressions were generated across social media channels, amplified through various stakeholder channels, and we featured the town hall debates through the means of local and regional media outlets, which was crucial.  The events took place in a guided round-table format, with each table having a moderator.  A rapporteur reported on all the citizens' dialogues, ensuring consistency, and we used Slido technology throughout the dialogues, which was really useful in terms of questions and answers and engaging the audience.  That engagement shaped and turned Ireland's submission to the 2019 European Council Sibiu report, where the EU's strategic agenda for 2019 to 2024 was agreed and the subsequent Sibiu declaration published.  Further information is in committee members' briefing packs.</p><p> Ireland's approach is seen as best practice from a participatory democracy perspective and we have been delighted to share our expertise and insights as to how we have engaged people in this country on the future of Europe and the ongoing debate and dialogue.  The work of the Government, as well as the European Commission and the European Parliament in this country have been crucial to supporting and maintaining this ongoing conversation.  It is crucial that the dialogue does not cease.  Of course, Members of the Oireachtas and this committee in particular have a crucial role to play and we look forward to working with and supporting Members and this committee in anything that can be done to further increase awareness and engagement on the conference of the future of Europe in Ireland.</p><p> One of the important elements of this conference and its goals is that it increases the effectiveness and awareness of the EU from an Irish perspective and how important it is for us to input our views in that regard.</p><p> I trust that is a good overview and I look forward to engaging with the committee and answering any questions they may have</p></speech>

I will call on two members at a time and the first to indicate is Deputy Calleary, to be followed by Deputy Richmond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1602" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I also thank our three speakers and welcome them.  I was struck by a line from Dr. Coutts' presentation when we briefly touched on the idea that we live in an era of populism, which targets international and transnational organisations and politics and that we should propose simplified forms of nationalism.  In this context, the EU may be particularly vulnerable.  It might be nice to get that printed on a t-shirt and send it as a going-away present to a certain former prime ministerial adviser.  It feeds into the debate we are all having.</p> <p>  Professor Laffan touched on the point that the convention should be about what Europe should do rather than how it does it.  Are not the two inextricably linked?  We have it shown up this week when one sees an emergency Covid-relief budget, which is something the EU can do well if it is unified, being targeted because the values of the Union are being undermined by two of its member states.  They can use the method according to which the Union works to block something the Union should be doing.  Unless we look at all of the issues, will we undermine the convention?  I believe we need to focus on what Europe should be doing but until we look at how it does it, I believe we will be operating with our hands behind our back.  I would like Professor Laffan's thoughts on that.</p> <p>  Second, the model Ms O'Connell used was interesting but I was struck by a point that Professor Laffan made that only 20% of Irish people - who are incredibly supportive of the EU and its aims, if we look at the figures  - knew about this convention.  To an extent, have we failed already in terms of engaging people?  Does it show Professor Laffan the work we have to do, in the event of treaty change, to get them on the journey now?</p> <p>  Finally, I ask the three witnesses, who have a lot of experience in this area, how confident and hopeful are they of a successful outcome to this process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#E00400"><p>I thank all three witnesses for their wonderful presentations.  Deputy Calleary has asked a couple of the questions I had in mind so I will pivot on my feet.</p> <p>  I will touch on one of Dr. Coutts's remarks.  He mentioned that we might not require treaty change, but rather treaty amendment.  Digging into the legalities of that, would an amendment to the Lisbon treaty, as opposed to a brand new treaty, require a referendum in Ireland, in Dr. Coutts's opinion?  It ties into the point Deputy Calleary made about how confident we can be of getting a treaty passed.  I would put it another way: should we fear treaty change?  After what we have gone through in the past five years, looking at our nearest neighbour, the argument that a lot of people muddied when it came to the European project in previous referendums is perhaps more simplified because we have an alternative.  We know what the alternative to European integration is now.  Communism has long collapsed but the alternative is clear, namely, that nascent populist nationalism we see quite close to home and not so close to home.</p> <p>  Getting into the process at hand, I was struck by Professor Laffan's reference to expanding the role of national parliaments.  Professor Gavin Barrett went into this in quite a bit of detail last week in this committee and it is something I am passionate about.  I will talk about the citizen-led aspect in a second, but when we talk about everything to do with Europe, many people allow it to be solely a Brussels-focused discussion, that only MEPs and only the institutions can talk about European issues.  There is something lacking, given that national parliamentarians do not take it upon themselves to talk about Europe, except when they have to, when there is a crisis, a referendum or a difficulty.  The last few months have shown us how much we rely on the EU, when we look at the announcements in relation to potential vaccinations and the block orders the EU has made that Ireland as a small member state would not have been able to have done if we were not in the EU.</p> <p>  I raise the role of national parliamentarians beyond discussing this and having conversations like we are having this morning, which are useful, in crafting the conference, formulating what the outcome might be, be it treaty change or not.  We do not automatically assume we will go there.  I asked Professor Barrett last week what role might the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliament of the European Union, COSAC, play in this.  How do we get that co-ordination?  The witnesses rightly talk about the large issues.  As one goes from member state to member state, the big issues change slightly.  Brexit is a massive issue for Ireland; it is less of an issue for Bulgaria.  Migration and the refugee crisis is a massive issue for Greece; it is less of an issue for Ireland.  What are the big issues where we may need to reform and renew Europe?  Health competence is topical at the moment. </p> <p>  Professor Laffan talked rightly about the importance of dialogue and making it citizen-led and Ms O'Connor talked about how European Movement Ireland has been to the forefront of that citizens' dialogue and pushing through that engagement, even though we still have the result that only 20% are aware of this conference.  Is that number similar in France?</p> <p>  I will put two questions to Ms O'Connor.  What sort of international comparison does she have through the European Movement International network of what other member states are doing and what stage they are at in discussions?  What are the big issues that are uniform across the 27 member states?</p> <p>  We talk about how everything has to be done virtually at the moment and this meeting is an example of that.  We probably would not have Professor Laffan's presence if we were not doing this virtually so I will talk about the benefits.  Are there potential opportunities within dialogues of being able to use technology we are all now so accustomed to in order to reach out further?</p><p>It is not all about coming into one central location, be it Dublin, Brussels or Rome, but everyone being able to do it from the comfort of their own home or workplace.  The flipside of that, as Deputy Calleary noted previously, is the question of whether we are losing a certain cohort, be it geographic or generational, who might not be as engaged with the online process, and how we maximise the opportunities while not neglecting those who might not have the same level of access.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brigid Laffan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#F00200"><p>I thank Deputies Calleary and Richmond for their questions.  I must say thanks to digital technology.  It really is lovely to see everyone.  I am sitting here in Florence so it is very nice to hear Irish voices and engage on Irish topics.  The questions are all really important.  I do not want to be misunderstood when I say that the EU needs to focus on substantive issues.  What I worry about is that whenever there are conferences on the future of Europe, intergovernmental conferences or conventions of one kind or another, those who know a lot about the EU are privileged and EU nerds tend to talk to each other about the niceties of this or that article or this or that method of election and, frankly, people do not care.  People want the EU to succeed in terms of substantive issues.</p> <p>  In respect of what Deputy Calleary said about eastern and central Europe, it is profoundly damaging to the EU that there are two countries that are authoritarian, do not adhere to the rule of law and have become a cancer within the EU.  The fact that both Warsaw and Budapest are vetoing the recovery fund as we speak is a Rubicon.  They must change their minds or pay a high price.  If in a pandemic, Budapest and Warsaw, which have received billions of euro from the taxpayers of Europe, engage in this kind of political posturing, they do not deserve to be EU member states.  I would put it that strongly.  </p> <p>  We should not be surprised that 20% do not know about the Conference on the Future of Europe because why would the public know about it, particularly given the pandemic?  In addition, the conference has not happened and we do not know what the structure is.  It does not surprise me at all.  If the Irish electorate is to be informed of this, there may or may not be a referendum and I will leave that aside, and knowledge and information matter, we must find hooks.  We should ask why it is important to talk about the future of Europe rather than this grandiose abstract thing called the future of Europe.  It is also important for us to be cognisant of the fact that the future of Europe will also be worked out on how the Biden presidency works and how relations between Europe, the US and China work, etc.  Am I hopeful of a successful outcome?  There must be sufficient ambition to do something substantial but not so ambitious as to be in the realm of fantasy.  It is that judgment between serious things but not trying to remake Europe because one will not remake Europe.  One will change Europe but not remake it.  Transformational power is not available.  </p> <p>  Regarding the role of national parliaments, it is hugely important, which is why this committee is so important so that nodes of knowledge and interest in these issues are within all national parliaments.  It is not enough for governments; it must also involve parliaments.  I stress two roles.  One is the committee's role as a participant in this conference through representation and co-operation across COSAC but also the educational role it has - the fact that it is talking about and interrogating it.  One of the issues with which this conference will deal will be public health.  Citizens across Europe now understand public health matters as do co-ordination and European capacity.  Europe will deliver the vaccine so that is also very important.  </p> <p>  Regarding how to harness the digital, one of the upsides of Covid, of which there are very few, is the proactive nature and capacity of our public institutions, including our parliaments, to leverage the digital.  That can certainly be accentuated and deepened but, of course, and I say this having held stakeholder forums for one of my research projects with Warsaw, Budapest and The Hague in the past month, we also need to return to a face-to-face world because of the nature of deliberation online.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Coutts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#F00400"><p>I will take the questions in the order in which they arrived and more specifically, the ones directed at me.  The question of broader institutional change is a very good point to make.  Clearly there are problems with the Union, the amount of vetoes and the different points at which vetoes can be used by particular states.  I echo Professor Laffan's points about the serious damage to the Union caused by the behaviour of Poland and Hungary.  Regarding my confidence in whether they will be successful, that depends.  We are at the beginning of this process.  It depends on the outcome but, more importantly, it depends on what one's criteria for success are.  As I said, there are two things here.  One is the process itself and as a means of legitimacy of the Union by increasing the role of citizens in the overall governance of it.  That in and of itself might be important, particularly if it leads to a lasting citizens' assembly that will be on a standing basis to allow participatory democracy to feed into the Union.  In terms of the outcome, if it can be proved that the Union is responsive to citizens and can come up with a deliverable plan that can make a meaningful difference, that would probably be successful.  It is very early to say at this point.</p> <p>  Regarding the questions around treaty change, I apologise if I gave the impression that I see a distinction between treaty change and treaty amendment.  I am not that much of a lawyer.  I would see the use of those terms as being more or less synonymous so my apologies if that impression was given somewhere.  Regarding whether or not a referendum in Ireland would be required, there are two ways of approaching this - one is legally and the second is politically.  Legally speaking according to the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, not every amendment of the European treaty requires a referendum and the amendment of the Irish Constitution.  This is only the case when the new treaty delegates or gives up further sovereignty or law-making power to the Union or any international institution.  It depends on whether the scope of the Union's activities is being increased, for example, competences.  That would require an assessment of the particular amendment that is being proposed.  Legally speaking, it is not automatic that a treaty amendment will lead to a referendum in Ireland.  We saw it with the use of the simplified revision procedure to amend Article 136 to establish the European Stability Mechanism.  This took place without a referendum, which was completely appropriate in that case.</p><p>The committee will know as well as I do, and probably better, that it has become almost a political norm that there will be a referendum in Ireland on major treaty changes.  I cannot really speak to whether that could change or whether it would be possible somehow to circumvent that in appropriate circumstances.</p><p> On whether we should fear treaty change, I have sympathy with the perspective that maybe we should not and that we should be more confident in facing the public more broadly in relation to treaty change if that is what is required.  I would say that, first of all, one can answer this question in the Irish context.  In the Irish context, we have experience with referendums.  Of course, sometimes it has failed but, as Professor Laffan pointed out, that has been frequently down to an information deficit rather than any inherit Euroscepticism on behalf of the Irish public.  It would depend on the process.  It would depend on the information.  If it is done in a way which leverages the deliberative nature of the Conference on the Future of Europe and if we look at the lessons that were learnt from other referendums, including the use of Citizens' Assembly in the case of the repeal of the eighth amendment, there could be a way of approaching it in a manner which would be productive and constructive and would contribute not only to the adoption of a new treaty amendment, but also to a better discussion about Europe, a greater knowledge about European Union affairs and reflection among the broader electorate.</p><p> Of course, the question arises not only in the case of Ireland.  As for whether we should fear treaty amendment in the broader European context because, as I said, it can fail in multiple states and in multiple ways, I cannot speak to that in any great detail.  There are risks which, I suppose, we are not aware of.  There is a risk in a failure of a major treaty amendment.  We saw this with the constitutional treaty when it failed.  There is a damage that would be done.  As I said, it would depend on the process.  If we approach it properly, treaty amendment should not be ruled out.</p><p> I would like to return to a point I made in the opening remarks.  When citizens are given the opportunity to feed into a particular process but are told they cannot have some things they might want - for example, an increase in the competence of the Union in environmental matters - because the specific treaty article does not provide the necessary legal basis, that is frustrating from the point of view of citizens.  That is why I would not rule it out straightaway.</p><p> The final point in relation to the impact of Brexit on any of this is a good point.  It has shown a greater appreciation for the European Union which would shape a debate on any EU matters and any treaty amendment.  I would be reluctant to frame it as a debate on whether a member state is going to be in or out of Europe, or to suggest that if it rejects this treaty amendment, the train is leaving and it is not getting on.  Even though Brexit is important for the appreciation of what the Union does and the foundations of the Union as a mechanism of transnational co-operation among people - that has certainly cut through to people's consciousness - I would not use Brexit as an example by suggesting that a member state might be out of the Union or something like that.  I would be careful about framing any treaty amendment in that way.</p></speech>

I will begin with Deputy Calleary's question about the 20% awareness.  He asked how confident and hopeful of success we are and queried whether we have failed before we start.  I want to be a glass half-full person.  There is a real opportunity, and not only that.  If not now, when?  Because of the Covid pandemic, what we have seen, as Professor Laffan has mentioned, through digital platforms is a greater availability and opportunity to engage people and increase that knowledge and dialogue.  We know from what we have seen and from our experience that Ireland cannot afford to take the foot off the pedal.  We have seen across the water that 40 years of negative discourse and diatribe cannot be reversed in a six-week referendum campaign.  It proved impossible.<br/><br/>What is vital in terms of the Conference on the Future of Europe is to keep the momentum going and ensure the public in Ireland are informed and engaged.  In our Red C poll, 84% of people in Ireland wanted Ireland to remain a member of the EU and only 7% felt that it was not in our interest to remain a part of it.  There is an increasing awareness and appreciation of the value and importance of our membership of and relationship with the EU, but we cannot afford to take that support and engagement for granted, and nor can we afford to take it lightly.  That is why it is so important to maintain the momentum we built up during the citizens' dialogues.  The Government, the Oireachtas and the committee have a unique opportunity to seize that momentum and harness those synergies to ensure that the Conference on the Future of Europe taking place in Ireland is meaningful, that it matters and that we contribute as a country to how we see the EU and how we see our role and place in it.<br/><br/>On Deputy Richmond's question of fearing treaty change, an organisation such as European Movement Ireland has a strong track record of engaging and dealing with the nine EU referendums we have had in this country.  We should not necessarily fear it, but nor should it be the optimal solution.  The outcomes and the outputs are more important.  The whole process of that debate is meaningful and adds value to citizens in Ireland and across the EU.  We should not get too hung up on the technicalities.  It should not be a top-down initiative.  It really has to be led by the citizens at the grassroots.  That is what we saw, tangentially and concretely, when we were travelling around the country.  People were motivated to come along, take part and have their say.  Not everyone who participated was in favour of Ireland remaining a part of the EU but they all wanted to debate, engage and learn more about some of the key policy themes that will form the core part of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  People left feeling that they were better informed and, crucially, that their opinion counted and was valued and that they had their say.  If we can hang on to those key nuggets, that will make a success of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  We say frequently that we have a tendency here to nationalise success and Europeanise failure.  We do not want that to happen with the Conference on the Future of Europe.<br/><br/>Deputy Richmond asked where this process is at in other member states.  Interestingly, my own umbrella organisation, European Movement International, holds its federal assembly this week.  I would normally be in Berlin for the next three days, as it is the German Presidency, but instead we are all coming together digitally.  For Professor Laffan's information, it is taking place over Zoom this year.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see where our fellow European movements and national councils are in terms of the whole Conference on the Future of Europe.  There is an impatience.  Equally, there is a sense of urgency that the conference must start while recognising that the EU institutions, quite honestly, did not have the bandwidth to initiate this Europe-wide debate on the Conference on the Future of Europe against the backdrop of the Covid pandemic.  Interestingly, since the time of the Juncker Commission, that is, preceding the term of the current President of the Commission, Dr. von der Leyen, but also including it, the European Commission has been involved in 1,570 citizen dialogues across the different member states.  Almost 200,000 citizens across EU member states have taken part in those European Commission-led dialogues.<br/><br/>What we are seeing now is the different countries putting forward their own proposals.  It is a little <i>ad hoc</i>at present.  Once the conference gets formally started and once the impetus and momentum officially kicks in and is instigated, the buy-in is there and it is officially launched, we hope we will see an increase in our figure of 20% of people in Ireland being aware of it and we will have an opportunity to participate.  Equally, and in response to Deputy Calleary's well-made point about respect for the rule of law, we need to get our own house in order to ensure the means and mechanisms are in place institutionally to allow such a conference to take place in a meaningful way across all member states.</p><p>What we do not want is buy-in and support from particular member states and for others not to be fully engaged.  This is about every one of the more than 450 million citizens of the Union.  It is going to affect all citizens of the EU and it is important that they all feel they have a voice in their respective member states and an opportunity to engage meaningfully in the future direction of the Union.</p></speech>

I was struck by Professor Laffan's view that the timing of this convention is bad.  We are where we are and we have to make the most of it.  Hopefully, it will succeed.  Professor Laffan spoke about the need for participation, engagement and education with reference to the citizens.  That is absolutely crucial.  Given our experience in Ireland, we have, as others stated, reasons to fear a referendum.  It is vital that we engage more with the citizens.</p> <p>  That brings me to my question to Ms O'Connell, with whose work I am familiar.  She described her involvement in organising the citizen dialogues on the future of Europe.  Were any lessons learned from the dialogues about how we might approach this new aspect of the future of Europe?  Civil society really engaged with that process.  Could we do anything more to engage with citizens and get them on board with the process?  How might the consultation process be improved?</p> <p>  I may be wrong but I got the impression that Dr. Coutts is not too enthusiastic about treaty change or the need for it.  Public health is obviously a huge issue for the EU on foot of Covid-19.  Can the existing treaties be further utilised to address it?  Are any areas of the existing treaties crying out to be utilised more?</p> <p>  Sometimes I wonder how the EU functions at all.  It is quite a cumbersome organisation.  One wonders how decisions finally get made.  Regarding the rule of law, for example, a recent headline announced that Hungary and Poland were blocking the EU's coronavirus package.  This arose as a result of a meeting on Monday.  Some other speakers have dealt with this.  Do we have any reasons to be cheerful about the future of the European Union?  Dr. Coutts made a throwaway comment about the rise of populism ceasing.  What are the chances of success for this conference on the future of Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#H00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  I wish to say that I might have to leave early.  It will not necessarily be because I do not like their answers.</p> <p>  It has already been stated that people see the necessity for harmonisation in pandemic supports, and in some cases want to see such harmonisation.  Those supports may be followed by a Marshall Plan-type fiscal stimulus.  That will go along with the European Commission's involvement in vaccine procurement and other health issues.  Dr. Coutts spoke about health and fiscal competencies.  How far can European integration be pushed under the Lisbon strategy before treaty change is needed?  That is not necessarily where I want to go.  There are fears of loss of state sovereignty.  There are sometimes fears that Europe is overly interested in privatisation and is against state intervention.  This has been turned on its head lately.  There are also fears of possible militarisation.</p> <p>  We all welcome further engagement and see the necessity for it, particularly in the context of the matter to which I have already referred.  This engagement should also concern Brexit and European solidarity on the issues of the Border and the Good Friday Agreement.  People see the necessity of the European Union, but they still have the worries they had ten or more years ago about how Europe dealt with the banking crisis.  As a committee, we accept that we need to raise our game where interaction is concerned.  We must build our capacity to scrutinise European legislation and see where the drift is.  How we can play a part in the further engagement of citizens?  I like the idea of the standing citizens' assembly to which Dr. Coutts referred.  How would he envisage that working?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brigid Laffan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#H00400"><p>Let me deal with the big-ticket items.  Deputy Haughey asked if we have any reasons to be cheerful and whether any sovereignty issues are lurking out there.  Our world is at one of history's seminal switch points.  It happens every couple of hundred years, in long cycles.  The fundamental political economy and the balance of power and force is shifting across the world.  Digital technology is altering so much about how we live and who we are.  In those periods of major shift, it is extremely important for countries, especially small countries, to be rooted in environments that provide them with anchors, shelters and scaffolding.  After Brexit the EU will be Ireland's anchor, scaffolding and future.  There will always be those who hold an almost fantastical view of sovereignty.  We see this belief playing out in the United Kingdom.  It is very damaging.  In the end, sovereignty is about the ability to make the world better for our citizens.  In the world we live in, Europe is one of our major anchors.  However, it is an anchor that allows us to open to the rest of the world.  I would never advocate restricting Ireland's view solely to Europe.  Rather, Europe is Ireland's platform for the future.</p> <p>  On the question of reasons to be cheerful, the EU is a very different institution now to what it was prior to the euro crisis.  It has become hardened by crises.  It has had to confront one crisis after another.  It has managed to deal with all those crises, although it has always done so suboptimally because that is the reality of compromise.  Politics is a messy business.  I have never seen a utopia or nirvana in my life.</p><p>On the fundamental capacity of the EU, the recovery fund, where common borrowing was seen as not possible and then suddenly became possible, is extremely important because apart from everything else, it will allow Europe to have a safe asset and will help build capital markets union and help protect Europe in a world of financialisation.</p><p> Have we, as a small state, reasons to fear?  The EU is a political system and, like all political systems, it is characterised by power, and small states are just part of a Union of 27.  If we ever need to worry about Ireland's capacity to influence or have a voice, all we have to do is to interrogate our own experience of the Brexit negotiations.  It should not have been possible for Ireland to put its issue on the agenda, maintain it on the agenda and get outcomes that were preferable to other alternatives, unless small state voice and influence matter in the EU.  It is really important how we frame Ireland's relationship with Europe.  Europe is not over there; Europe is part of Ireland and we are part of it.  I say this really strongly because of the nature of the world we live in today.  There is no future for Ireland unless it engages with, influences and participates in that evolving European Union.  It is the available scaffolding and anchor.  If 19th century Irish nationalists had been told that there was a union in which Ireland could participate, with a seat at the table that was not dominated by the UK, Irish nationalism of the late 19th century would have thought that it was close to utopia.  We need to be careful how we frame this and our relationship with Europe.</p><p> As to whether or not I am cheerful about the EU, I am an analyst so I am never cheerful but we should not underestimate the resilience and robustness of the EU at this juncture.  It is partly because in the world we now live in, one that is dominated by great power competition between China and the US, the EU is Europe's essential arena in which to protect its interests in that world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.254" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Coutts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#J00200"><p>I will take the questions in the order that they were asked.  I am a bit ambiguous, and like Professor Laffan, as an analyst and academic, I am always wary of drawing very firm conclusions.  That may also have something to do with my personality.  To broadly characterise my position, and I think this view is shared by the other witnesses, treaty change for the sake of treaty change is not a good idea and it is a high-risk strategy but, at the same time, I would not preclude it necessarily.  In terms of the existing treaties, I am afraid I cannot go into a huge amount of detail because on the competences of the Union, in order to determine exactly what the Union can do, it is not enough to say that the Union has competences in any one policy area, be it fiscal, environment or consumer.  One has to look at the very specific policy area and specific legal bases that are provided in the treaties to see exactly what the Union can do.  That would require detailed study, which we have not done in particular policy areas.  My own narrower area is citizens' rights, and I can certainly speak to that.</p> <p>  Broadly speaking, environment policy is a shared competence, as is consumer policy, but fiscal matters are quite restricted and the competences are very frequently characterised by the unanimity rule.  Health is not even characterised as a shared competence but as a co-operative competence on which the Union simply co-ordinates the member states.  As I said, I cannot speak exactly to the Union's competence in those specific areas at the moment and whether they are being utilised.  Members would have to ask an expert more specifically, for example, somebody working in environmental law.</p> <p>  There seems to be an assumption that in order to achieve some sort of a policy outcome that the Union itself has to be adopting the legislation.  The Union can also play a really important role in co-ordinating member states' competence, so one can use both the member state and the Union competence in any particular area to achieve a desired result.  That is also a possibility that is worth emphasising.</p> <p>  There are also other options that would be short of treaty change which might be able to effect some increase in the efficiency of the Union, for example, greater use of the enhanced co-operation mechanism.  There are also the passerelle clauses which allow the Union to shift from unanimity to qualified majority voting in certain areas.  There is a general passerelle clause and there are some specific ones in particular areas, for example, in environment and in social matters.  The use of those clauses requires unanimity initially, as there must be a unanimous decision in order to make that change in the decision-making process, so that is a possibility that can be used.  For particular areas which are frustrated by the operation of unanimity, for example, fiscal matters, the decision-making process could be changed, but that would involve overcoming the hurdle that unanimity is required in the first place to do that.</p> <p>  On the question of the standing citizens' assembly, this was just a remark that I made and I mentioned it somewhere without having personally thought it through in any great detail.  What I would say is that much more careful consideration would have to be given to something like this.  Some of the issues that would have to be considered would be the formation of any such assembly; its representative nature; how the agenda would be controlled; that it is properly resourced, which is very important in any of these arrangements; and what the outcome would be - whether it would be legislative proposals or something else.  It would also have to be placed within the institutional structure of the Union and care would have to be taken about how it would fit within the broader institutional structure of the Union because the institutions are balanced in a very careful and delicate way.  Careful consideration needs to be given when introducing new elements into it.  I am thinking in particular about the operation of the European citizens' initiative, ECI, and how that fits within the broader law-making process of the Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#J00300"><p>I thank Deputies Haughey and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for their questions.  I will first answer Deputy Haughey's question on what lessons we learned from our own perspective.  It is fair to say that, throughout the citizen dialogue in the future of Europe process which we completed on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs, best practice for us was ensuring that the outcomes were a citizen-led, inclusive, accessible, transparent and impartial format.  Most important was that follow-up and that the issues were engaged with, and that people did not just turn up at 6 p.m. on a Thursday evening, participate really actively for two hours and that was the end of the matter.  We were very clear that their views were part of the overall report and structure that fed into the Government's submission in Sibiu.  We were able to concretely demonstrate that at the national event, inviting all the participants in the regional seminars to take part in the event in Kilmainham.  That element of trust and confidence that people had that the conference and their participation will yield positive change and lead to something happening was really important and it was crucial for us to ensure that was imparted throughout the process.</p> <p>  We think the citizen dialogues worked in that they were grassroots driven and reflected public policy.  We did not judge.  Rather, we were there to listen.  If people had specific questions and answers, they were able to have their say, and the audience was very enthusiastic and constructive.  It was important to have well-informed facilitators so that at every table, each with about ten people where we ensured gender and demographic balance and mix, the conversation was able to flow without influencing any outcomes.</p><p>The importance of the supporting buy-in from stakeholders was a big lesson for us.  We saw it at each of the dialogues.  If Members of the Oireachtas, county councillors or Members of the European Parliament came, it added value in terms of the practical, tangible engagement for the citizens.  It also enabled those parliamentarians to explain the work that they were doing.  That was important.</p><p> Another lesson that we will take away was about the disparity in knowledge, if I can put it that way, regarding the role of the EU and what was a local competence, what was a national competence and what was a European competence.  That certainly was a challenge in some of the locations.  The table facilitators, overall rapporteur and moderators were quite supportive and constructive in bringing the conversation back to the issues at hand and explaining the differences in competencies.  That can probably act as a reminder of the importance of educating, informing and having an informed conversation on European issues and matters among the wider public in Ireland.  We cannot just speak about it in abstract terms.  We wanted to ensure that we were reflecting people's views, rather than judging them.  That is particularly timely as we, as a country, approach the symbolic milestone of the 50th anniversary of our accession to the European Economic Community - notwithstanding that we are going to be losing a classmate that joined at the same time.</p><p> There are forces of populism in our increasingly geopolitically multipolar world.  Speaking to Professor Laffan's point, Ireland has a role to play.  We are at the heart of Europe.  There are going to be challenges on that next year and into the future.  We have to be on the offensive.  We must engage constructively in terms of how we see our place, our role, and how we engage the people in this country on that debate.  That is why it is so important that the ongoing conversation takes place but also that ongoing ownership of the conversation takes place and people feel their views are listened to, heard, valued and understood.</p><p> I will speak to what Dr. Coutts and Professor Laffan said.  As committee members might be aware, European Movement Ireland has hosted approximately 16 webinars since the pandemic began.  We have engaged with the European Commission and the European Parliament.  We did an event with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, on the German Presidency last week.  We engaged with the European Ombudsman.  We did a Brussels connection event with the Minister of State with responsibility for EU affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, who spoke to Irish people newly arriving to Brussels as interns in the EU institutions.  We have had close to 10,000 online views and engagements with more than 1,500 people logging in.  Instead of having 80 people in the offices of the permanent representation of Ireland to the European Union, we had 200 taking part in an online forum.  There are pros and cons, but our obvious preference would be to get back to a hybrid version that maximises the advantages of the digital world.  That is a lesson we can take away from the citizen dialogues.  We also need face-to-face engagement because that is really where the connection and creativity comes in.</p></speech>

The idea of a conference on the future of Europe is very good.  I like the idea that we would be engaging more directly with citizens to get their views on how they want their Europe to work and what should take place.  The Brexit situation has had a twofold impact on Ireland.  It has, in some ways, made us appreciate the European Union more and being a part of the bigger bloc because of the support we have received.  I think Professor Laffan spoke about a small country getting its issue to the fore and keeping it there.  Citizens in Ireland have heard a lot more about the European Union in the past three years than they would have done previously because it has been in the national media consistently, almost every week, before Brexit has dominated.  Before Covid-19, Brexit was the key issue and it is still teetering away.  That has made citizens here more aware of the EU.  They appreciate the fact that we are a part of a bigger family and the supports that come from that.</p> <p>  It has also made us look at some of the shortcomings of Europe.  I am sure other member states feel the same.  Ultimately, a very large member state has left and many of its people voted to leave.  They did so for varying reasons but they obviously felt that their interests were not being properly served by the European Union and did not want to be a part of it anymore.  There is a question for every member state.  We must ask why that happened and what we need to address.  We must have an introspective look at the European Union and what we need to do better.  This conference is, therefore, very timely.</p> <p>  It is good for Ireland that we are more connected to Europe because of the Brexit process.  My concern is that trying to engage with citizens in every member state across the board is a mammoth task.  How will that be done?  How is the information that is collected then collated and distilled?  Ms O'Connell spoke about her future of Europe project and pointed out the difficulty of ensuring it is not just a two-hour engagement but has an outcome and product at the end of it.  I am concerned about the practicalities of running this conference in a meaningful way.  How will it even be run?  What will it look like in Ireland?  It cannot be just any one thing.  It is not just going to be a series of Zoom calls or town hall meetings because if we want to reach out to everybody, we are going to have to use several mechanisms to do so.  After that engagement, how do we collate the information and send it up the line at an EU level to ensure that Ireland's views are represented in the overall outcome of this?  I would welcome our guests' practical ideas as to how this conference might look in Ireland.  What shape will it take?  There is a risk that the conference might be a little too high level.  I do not mean that in a disparaging way.</p> <p>  I thank Ms O'Connell for her document because I love how she has set out, in bullet points, the priority areas for each of the three institutions.  I have a page on which I have written what I think citizens in Ireland associate with the European Union.  The first is the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget because farmers are very interested in CAP.  I think that even those citizens who are not involved in farming associate the EU with farming and agriculture.  It has become synonymous with how we do our business here in terms of funding the production of food and the agricultural sector.</p> <p>  Citizens will also think of defence policy, and maybe not in a very positive way, but it comes to mind.  Dr. Coutts outlined why treaty change, while we do not want to rule it out, can be difficult because something like defence policy tends to pop up and no matter what is being discussed, it is interpreted as referring to an EU army.  Citizens associate European treaties with discussions on defence.  The other topic is migration.  The committee has recently been discussing the new pact on migration.  Citizens here would think of that issue at a European level.</p> <p>  Citizens here also look at climate and environmental policy as coming generally through directives from EU level.  Those are the big issues that Irish citizens would associate with the European Union.  Perhaps they also associate taxation with the Union, to a lesser extent.  We have been hearing a little bit about that, perhaps as a result of the Apple tax case and a push at EU level for us to change how we organise our tax system.  Those are the topics that will likely occur to Irish citizens.</p> <p>  There seem to be predefined topics for the conference.  The Commission, the Council and the Parliament have identified their priority areas but have done so in isolation from citizens.  We are coming to citizens with predefined topics that they want to discuss.  One can see straight away that the Parliament is more connected to the grass roots and citizens because it has mentioned taxation, the environment and security.  It has identified those as topics likely to pop up in member states.  The bullet points that Ms O'Connell has prepared for the Council and the Commission's priorities include things such as an economy that works for people.  What does that even mean?  It means different things to different people.  It is very high level.  If we start a conference on these hifalutin, broad, sweeping topics, people will zone out.  They will not know what something means or how to input into a conversation about it.</p><p>If we have a clear engagement at an EU level on climate policy, the EU CAP budget or how we fund our food production - something more defined - then we might find the engagement to be more meaningful.  It may reach beyond what Professor Laffan referred to as the EU nerds who talk about the different treaties and articles.  That would have a value for the ordinary citizen.  I agree they do not care because it does not affect them in their daily lives.</p><p> I apologise if I have rambled on.  There are two issues I am discussing.  In a practical way, how do we run this conference in Ireland?  What does it look like?  How do we ensure people believe their input will be passed up the line and become part of the overall output of this conference?  How do we identify topics that will interest people?  How do we ensure this is not a high-level broad academic discussion on Europe's place in the world and that kind of thing?  We need to bring it back down to how the EU affects people and decide the topics we are going to discuss.  We should be happy to discuss difficult topics rather than avoiding them.</p></speech>

I will make one or two comments to follow on from what Senator Chambers said.  I spent 15 years in the European Parliament meeting, canvassing and talking to people as well as taking part in various events and functions, etc.  Senator Chambers put her finger on it when she said that people are genuinely interested in what interests them.  For farmers it will be the CAP.  For carers it will be work-life balance.  People who are interested in the environment will look to the Green New Deal and the biodiversity strategy.  Young people might be more interested in Erasmus.</p> <p>  Then there are cross-cutting issues.  People are interested in consumer policy and rights.  Some people are interested in data protection.  We have the cross-cutting issue of climate change.  Healthcare and taxation were mentioned.  Someone mentioned a specific topic: the economy and how it works for each of us.  People will be interested in specific rights that workers have and, for example, how they relate to redundancy or the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  All these issues mean something to people on a practical level.  My experience in trying to get people interested involved finding a hook.  When we find a hook, people will be interested in listening, talking and engaging.</p> <p>  I have a general question.  I know we are not discussing the row at the moment around the budget and the fact that two member states are not accepting the conditionality that is being attached to it.  I know it is out of scope, but I am interested in the views of the panellists on that and where we go from here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.260" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Brigid Laffan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#L00400"><p>These are crucial questions.  There is no easy way of democratising political space across a continent with 450 million people plus.  Yet, that is the political system that our system is involved with.  It is necessary, therefore, to engage.</p> <p>  We were asked how it should be run.  I believe there will be two dimensions.  The first is the national dimension.  Member states will be asked to organise discussions, debates, dialogues and forums within their territory.  I know from the people who are thinking about it in the Commission that there will be pan-European citizens' assemblies of some kind.  We have to think nationally and pan-nationally in both a national and a European sense.  We will have two levels.  All of that, of course, only relates to the part to do with citizens.  Parliaments and governments will be involved as well.  It is not simply going to be a free-floating engagement only with citizens.  I image the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union will be involved, etc.</p> <p>  How to collate what comes out of this?  That will be driven by substantive issues.  Not everything in the EU will be debated because, as we know, the EU has considerable policy competence.  Most of it will remain the same and will not be discussed.  One issue that will be on the table is public health.  The pandemic has driven public health up the agenda.  How can Europe and the member states be ready for a future pandemic?  How can they have the PPE and the capacities, etc?  Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world.  Of course it affects everything and it is cross-cutting.  It affects how we all live and breathe and how our cities and countryside will work, etc.  Climate will be important on the agenda.  Migration will be important on the agenda because Europe finds itself in an unstable neighbourhood.  I have learned from living in Italy during the past eight years that the pressing Mediterranean problems are far away from us in Ireland, but they are highly pressing in the Mediterranean coastal states.  Interestingly, CAP will be seen through environment and security because the CAP budget is effectively decided now to 2027.  What about security and defence?  I believe we will get far more European emphasis on cybersecurity through PESCO and defence but NATO will continue to be the dominant defence organisation in Europe.  Of course, this will require a shift of European NATO member states because the US under Mr. Biden, and not only under Mr. Trump, will expect the Europeans to do more.</p> <p>  We know the substantive issues.  What we do not yet know is how the conference will be used to engage on these issues or what the purpose of all of it is.  Taxation and political economy will be on the agenda as well.</p> <p>  Deputy Harkin made a point about the MFF and the Hungarians and Poles.  I said something on this earlier, but I believe it is now time for the governments of the other member states to put maximum pressure on Poland and Hungary.  This is the Rubicon.  They cannot be allowed to get away with it.  They cannot be allowed to stymie the recovery fund.  We must remember that both these countries have received billions of European taxpayers' money during the past cycle.  They, therefore, have to be stopped.  It is difficult legally to do this and it is difficult to do it via Article 7, but I believe maximum political pressure has to be brought to bear in making the point that the quality of their membership will be damaged - I would put it that strongly - if they persist in undermining the continent at this precise moment of pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.261" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Coutts" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2020111800002#L00500"><p>Professor Laffan has touched on some of the points I wanted to make so my comments will be brief.  I wrote down that it will be a two-level process.  Individual member states will draw on their democratic experiences and mechanisms and do things their own particular way.  There will be a pan-European or transnational dimension as well.  Why I believe that is important is precisely because of the issues listed by Senator Chambers.</p><p>There are all these different issues and member states will have different opinions, and not just the Governments of the member states but also the populations of the member states.  Consider taxation, for example.  Ireland is almost totemic in that we have to maintain our sovereignty regarding corporate taxation in particular.  The completely opposite point of view is present in a lot of other member states and among their populations.  It is important to have at European level a pan-European transnational citizens' assembly so that citizens can come together and recognise that compromise will probably be necessary in particular policy areas, and that national interests will have to be reconciled.  This is why there are benefits at a national level, precisely because that is where democracy takes place and it is where debate typically takes place.  Member states have their own mechanisms and histories in how they involve citizens in decision making.  The pan-European dimension will also be really important precisely to bring out the fact that in policy areas reconciliation will have to take place.  That is the purpose of deliberative democracy: that people can hear the point of view of other people, can be informed about it in a reflective and proper way, and can come to more considered opinions having taken into account the views of others.  If that takes place at a European level it can be really beneficial as well.</p><p> On the agenda and who controls it, I believe this is a key point that needs to be worked out.  Obviously, a certain amount of issues need to be put on the table but I would hope there is some scope for citizens to bring other things to the table that are important to them, and that nothing is really excluded that is a priority.  In a context where citizens are made aware of where the powers are to do particular things and how it would take place, Noelle made an interesting point about having to explain the competencies of the Union.  I will come back to the example of the ECI, the European citizens' initiative.  A number of these have failed simply because they proposed things that the Union does not have competence to do.  That is very frustrating for the people who have signed up to these initiatives.  It seems as though their ideas are being rejected on a technical issue but it is actually very important.  It is important that there is some agenda control on the part of the citizens' initiatives but how that happens has to be very transparent.  What the outcome will be must also be considered and I note there are some differences between the different institutions on precisely how they foresee the outcomes of these deliberations.  Again, I would not say they should lead to directly binding legal proposals in any way.  That would not fit within the Union's legislative structure.  There should, however, be some commitment to a proper consideration of the outcomes and a response to them, absolutely.</p><p> My final point is on the budget and the current issues around the multiannual financial framework, MFF.  I would echo absolutely everything Professor Laffan has said.  I believe this has gone on for far too long.  This is a long problem now and there have been problems in dealing with it due to the political system in the EU.  From a lawyer's perspective, the European Court of Justice has taken a number of actions against Poland in particular, and the Commission has taken the infringement actions, but that route is very limited.  It is limited in the legitimacy it has in the affected member states and they are also very discrete actions.  While it is very important that the European Court of Justice underlined why this is very damaging from a constitutional perspective and to the Union's legal order, it is limited in what it can do.  There absolutely needs to be a political response.  The article 7 procedure is fatally undermined by the requirement for unanimity where there are two states willing to support each other.</p><p> The financial conditionality is a really important tool.  As has been pointed out, these states are huge beneficiaries of the EU budget.  Of the parties concerned, EuropeFides is a huge beneficiary also of the EU budget.  That is the lever the EU has.  The EU does not need a police force and it does not need an armed force.  It dispenses huge amounts of money and that is a huge opportunity for leverage.  It is precisely the kind of tool that is necessary to address this matter.  It is long overdue that a way be found to push forward with this .  As was pointed out, it is a cancer and it needs to be dealt with head on.</p></speech>

They were great questions from Senator Lisa Chambers and Deputy Marian Harkin.  Conscious of time, I will be brief.</p> <p>  I absolutely agree with Senator Chambers on the practicalities.  Fundamentally, it has to be framed within a context of communicating the issues in a way that resonates with people.  We also need to be very clear on the parameters with regard to expectation management.  Similar to the comments made by Brigid and Stephen, it is not just going to be a national dialogue here in Ireland, there also has to be that pan-European element.  How we input the Irish dimension into that is going to be very important to ensure it is considered and taken into account.  I have been asked to present the Irish viewpoint to the French National Assembly's EU affairs committee, and also in Lithuania.  It was really interesting to share that experience.  It is very important that it is pan-European and is fully reflective of the diversity of the different member states.</p> <p>  On a practical level in Ireland, do we look at it as a form of citizens' assembly light?  It might not be an all-day event, as is the current Citizens' Assembly.  We did it previously in two hours.  We ensured that people were engaged, that there were ample refreshments, and that it was very accessible.  On the point made about the hook, that is exactly it.  I was moderating all of the dialogues.  On the point made about the economy, we drilled that down to jobs and what that means for families, communities and regions.  Deputy Harkin spoke about education.  We covered young people, job opportunities, Erasmus, languages, and living, studying and working abroad.  No one size fits all so we have to allow in best European practice a degree of subsidiarity, as Brigid alluded to, and that the issues of primary concern in Mediterranean countries are perhaps somewhat different from some of the concerns and focus here.  That flexibility has to be unbuilt.</p> <p>  On Deputy Harkin and Senator Chambers's point, we were talking about the environment, climate change and CAP.  Those are key fundamentals that direct and focus on how we all live and the food we consume.  Keeping it very simple and at a tangible and practical level was how we ensured the buy-in and the engagement on the ground.  It was not too highfalutin and it was very practical.</p> <p>  Security and defence was probably the most interesting takeaway for me, if I can be really honest.  Whether we were in Cork or Letterkenny, Kilkenny or Galway, it was interesting to see the evolving views and perspectives on security and defence.  I heard words during discussions on cybersecurity and cyberterrorism.  Interestingly, the most recent Eurobarometer in October shows that 63% of us in Ireland favour a common defence and security policy.  The EU average is 77%.  We are not too far off that EU average.  At 63% that Eurobarometer finding is a significant increase from our own poll back in April and March of this year that saw 49%.  It is interesting to see that level of debate and engagement.</p> <p>  We also have the flexibility of having an open-mic session and a little bit of wriggle room opportunity for people to raise questions that may not necessarily be aligned to the five core themes, as I outlined in our briefing note.  That flexibility is important but it is also important that it is fed up the chain very concretely, and is seen to deliver at a European level and pan-European level the Irish input.  That will be really important.  We see it as marrying the best of the bottom-up grassroots initiatives and ensuring we continue to offensively engage and have our say, not rest on our laurels or take a step back, and proactively input into this wider debate.  It is vital that we do that.  We have a real opportunity now.  Given the uncertainty of the future we face and the uncertainty of the Covid pandemic, the onus and responsibility is on us to proactively seize this moment to make it a better and more effective Union for all of our citizens across all member states.</p><p>I thank the witnesses and members for joining the debate this morning from Dublin, Cork and Florence, Italy.  It was a really engaging debate and it is worth pointing out that the responsibility and the challenge set out, in particular by Professor Brigid Laffan in relation to our education role and the importance of our parliamentary function through this committee, have not been lost on us.  While the witnesses were making those suggestions and setting out that stall and challenge, I contacted a school to see whether it would be interested in joining in online and it was.  I thank the principal of St. Mary's Holy Faith Secondary School in Killester, Ms Evelyn McLoughlin, whose third year CSPE class joined in with their teacher, Ms Crowley.  This shows how quickly and instantaneously we can reach out and bring people in.  We had the third year class join in and listen to the witnesses' and members' contributions.  I decided to be very non-parochial.  I was tempted to contact a school in Donegal but I decided to stick with the capital here.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey gives a big shout out to his constituents in Killester.</p><p> The debate sometimes revolves around where we get started and how we get started, but this debate has already started.  Sometimes we spend a lot of time looking under the EU bonnet to check the engine.  The engine is going well in many respects and recent Brexit discussions and conversations centred on solidarity in Europe and Ireland's continued participation.  The witnesses' job has been very well crafted today in analysing the situation.  They reflect very well that there are fears and trepidations around what the answer might be if one put a treaty change question to the people.  Parliaments in Europe have to change tack and, as parliamentarians, we must focus on the opportunities and the exciting challenges that lie ahead.  If there are third year students in Killester listening in this morning, then they need to hear about the opportunities in Brussels and Strasbourg, and the important participatory role we will have in the future.  We can reach out and engage.  We have the platforms, the technology and the communications and we have to realise what is on our doorstep, whether it is at a local authority level or community engagement level.</p><p> Everybody is doing very well but the big thing to take from today is that it is no longer a question of when we will start the conversation on the Conference on the Future of Europe.  It has already started and the committee is grateful for the witnesses' contributions today.  We have been at this for a number of weeks.  We are going to compile a report on this and I think the starter's gun has gone off.  What is needed, post Covid-19, is talk about hope.  The opposite of hope is despair and we have nothing but hope to talk about within the European project.  In order for us to mould a new future, we must reach out to the younger generation, the older generation and people who have felt excluded from the conversation up to now.</p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcoiste agus leis na finn&eacute;ithe as an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.

This is important as it causes serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  Members are reminded that if they speak from positions that do not have microphones their contributions cannot be included in the Official Report.  This applies to the committee rooms.  For the purposes of the Official Report I have been requested to identify members when they are called to speak.  Members are also requested to remove their face coverings when speaking to ensure their contributions can be recorded adequately, before replacing their face coverings.</p> <p>  I welcome members, and the viewers who may be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV, to the public session of the Oireachtas Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  For this purpose the parliamentary precincts are considered to be the accommodation assigned to members in Leinster House, any other location in Leinster House, Leinster House 2000 or the Convention Centre, Dublin on days on which the relevant House sits there.  I ask members to note that they may participate remotely in proceedings held in public only from the locations listed above as privilege for their utterances only applies when participating from these locations. </p> <p>  It is also important to note that in order to participate in a division in committee, members must be physically present.  I request that members sit only in their permitted seats and in front of available microphones to ensure they are heard.  This is important because not doing so causes serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  I remind members to maintain social distancing at all times during and following the meeting.  Members are requested to use wipes and hand sanitisers provided to clean seats and desks shared to supplement the regular sanitisation in the breaks between meetings.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#A01200"><p>Section 53 amends section 46 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, which section provides for the submission of tax returns to Revenue.  Section 46 requires the submission of a capital acquisitions tax return where the taxable value of gifts or inheritances within the same group threshold exceeds 80% of the value of that group threshold.  This 80% threshold value is calculated by aggregating the value of the current gift or inheritance with the value of previous gifts or inheritances received by a beneficiary.</p> <p>  Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 provides for agricultural relief.  The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable value of gifted or inherited agricultural property in certain circumstances.  Section 90 provides for business relief, which similarly reduces the taxable value of qualifying business property by 90%.  The effect of these reliefs on taxable value is that high value property can be received as gifts or inheritances without a requirement for the recipient to submit a return to Revenue.</p> <p>  The current group A threshold, which applies where property is transferring from parents to their children, is &euro;335,000.  This means that a person could potentially receive benefits comprising agricultural or business property with a taxable value of up to &euro;2.68 million without having to submit a return.</p> <p>  Agricultural relief and business relief are valuable reliefs and it is essential for the development of capital acquisitions tax policy that the extent to which these reliefs are being availed of, and the cost of the reliefs, is known.  In addition, information about the transfer of significant wealth is important from a Revenue compliance programme perspective which, to operate effectively, requires awareness that the reliefs are being claimed, the examination of returns and follow-up investigation if required.</p> <p>  This amendment to section 46 therefore requires the submission of a return when the gift or inheritance comprises agricultural or business property that qualifies for relief, irrespective of the value of that property.  Given that beneficiaries would not tend to receive multiple gifts of such property during their lifetime, I do not consider that this new requirement will be onerous, and I am satisfied that the value to be gained from this additional information justifies the new requirement.</p></speech>

The amendment is designed to shore up the laws on hybrid mismatches.  However, I am concerned that special purpose vehicles, SPVs, which I have mentioned throughout this debate, could use hybrid financial instruments to refer to profit participating loans, which will not be captured in this hybrid mismatch.  That is why I have tabled the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#B00400"><p>It might be useful to set out exactly what is meant by a hybrid financial instrument.  This is an instrument that is characterised differently for tax purposes under the laws of two or more territories.  For example, a financial instrument that is characterised as debt under the laws of one territory but as equity under the laws of another will be regarded as a hybrid financial instrument.  A financial instrument, therefore, is only a hybrid financial instrument if different territories treat that instrument differently for tax purposes.  While we know how a financial instrument is treated for Irish tax purposes, we would have to know how that instrument would be treated by the other territory or territories that are party to it to know if it is a hybrid financial instrument.</p> <p>  The challenges in identifying hybridity in the context of financial instruments were recognised by the OECD in the base erosion and profit shifting project.  This recognised that due to the wide variety of financial instruments and the different ways that territories can treat them for tax purposes, it is almost impossible to identify and define all those situations where cross-border conflicts might exist.  This explains why it is not possible to report the total number of yearly transactions that use hybrid financial instruments, nor their total annual value, as requested by the Deputy.  On this basis, I do not propose to accept her amendment.</p> <p>  However, as she will be aware, the OECD's recommended approach to address these challenges was for countries to implement anti-hybrid rules.  This is what Ireland did in the Finance Act 2019.  The anti-hybrid rules address a range of mismatch outcomes, including mismatches that arise due to the hybrid nature of a financial instrument, which result in a tax deduction being obtained in one territory without a corresponding amount being included in another territory.  The Irish anti-hybrid legislation contains two rules to neutralise these mismatches as follow.  First, under the primary rule, an Irish corporate taxpayer making a payment under a hybrid financial instrument will be denied a tax deduction for the payment to the extent that a corresponding amount has not been included in another territory.  Second, where an Irish corporate taxpayer receives a payment under a hybrid financial instrument and the payer territory has not denied the deduction under its own primary rule, the Irish corporate taxpayer is charged to tax on the amount of the deduction.</p> <p>  As these rules took effect from 1 January 2020, they will be reflected in the corporation tax returns for 2020 and later years.  Corporation tax returns for 2020 are due to be filed by September 2021 at the latest.  Where an Irish corporate taxpayer makes an adjustment under the anti-hybrid rules, it is obliged to disclose the relevant details in the hybrid mismatches section of its corporation tax return for the relevant period.  In particular, taxpayers must indicate under which of the rules the adjustment is being made and the quantum of that adjustment.  This means that once the corporate tax returns for 2020 and later years have been filed, Revenue will have information regarding the operation of the anti-hybrid rules and the quantum of any corporate tax adjustments required under those rules.</p> <p>  The reason I am not accepting the Deputy's amendment is that from a timing perspective, the information she is looking for will not be available to me by this point and any information that might be available will be incomplete.  There is a case for monitoring the number of transactions that are availing of the anti-hybrid rules that I outlined but it will be another year until we have the information in place to allow that to happen.</p></speech>

Is it not the case, however, that there is an automatic exchange of information between Revenue and taxpayers and that this information is publicly available because it is listed on the Stock Exchange?</p></speech>

We simply will not have the information the Deputy is looking for inside the time period she is looking for it.  If information becomes available under Stock Exchange rules, I would imagine there would be a similar timing issue.  It is unlikely that within the six months the Deputy is looking for, the information would be available through Stock Exchange disclosures either.  I can confirm that later in the debate but I am certain that the information that the Deputy wants for this and that I would expect she would require through the Revenue Commissioners will not be available to us inside the six-month period.</p></speech>

Even if information was made available through a Stock Exchange disclosure inside the six-month period, what we need is to be able to compare transactions across tax jurisdictions.  That information will properly sit with the Revenue Commissioners and the issue is one of timing.  I am sure Is will be in a position this time next year, for example, to be able to discuss with the Deputy how these rules are being availed of and the numbers of transactions and their values.</p><p>While the standard tax rules of taxpayer confidentiality will still stand, the topline information sought will be available at a point in the future but we just will not have it inside six months. </p></speech>

This regime is an important part of Ireland's offering as a location for the conduct of financial services.  Ireland is not unique in having a securitisation regime.  A number of other EU countries have such a regime in place as part of a competitive financial services offering.</p> <p>  The importance of securitisation has been recognised by the European Commission through their work on capital markets union, one of the aims of which is to seek to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.  Securitisations are useful, both for banks in freeing up capital to allow them to continue to lend to individuals and businesses, and for the productive economy as it can underpin the supply of capital market financing to industries and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.</p> <p>  The purpose of the section 110 regime, as with other similar regimes worldwide, is to enable noteholders to invest through one structured vehicle without giving rise to an additional layer of tax as compared to a direct investment in the underlying assets.  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to calculate the amount of tax that would be paid if a company had not submitted a notification to Revenue that it is a qualifying company for the purposes of section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act of 1997.  This would in any case be an entirely hypothetical estimation as it is unlikely that such transactions would take place here in the absence of securitisation legislation.  It is for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.  </p></speech>

With section 110, companies are effectively tax neutral due to an ability to use interest-free payments to write down taxable profits.  It is for that reason I am interested in pressing my amendment.</p></speech>

The movement of goods by road remains the second biggest source of transport emissions after private car use.</p> <p>  At an EU level, the critical need to reduce emissions from transport has led to agreement on implementing increasingly stringent emissions standards for new heavy goods vehicles, together with a broad policy shift away from supporting conventional diesel and petrol technologies.  As part of the transition to EU climate neutrality by 2050, green deal policy objectives include phasing out fossil fuels and transitioning transport to zero or low-emitting alternative vehicle technologies.</p> <p>  At a national level, the transition to low-carbon fuel technologies is not expected to be uniform across the entirety of the Irish freight and haulage sector.  It includes the use of electric vehicles in the light commercial vehicle sector and a range of alternative fuel technologies in the heavy duty sector.</p> <p>  In this respect, the Finance Act 2018 introduced an accelerated capital allowance scheme for capital expenditure on gas propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment used for the purposes of carrying on a trade.  The scheme allows taxpayers to deduct the full cost of expenditure on qualifying vehicles and refuelling equipment in year one as compared to the normal writing-down period of eight years, thereby providing a cashflow benefit to the sector.</p> <p>  Compressed natural gas offers far greater carbon reduction potential than diesel or petrol in heavy goods vehicles.  The introduction of this scheme contributes to the work of the Department's task force on low-emission vehicles, and to achieving our national target to transition to a low-carbon economy.  </p> <p>  The scheme is currently scheduled to cease on 31 December 2021.  Therefore, next year my officials will conduct a tax expenditure review of the scheme.  The review will evaluate the effectiveness of the scheme and make recommendations for its amendment and-or extension.</p> <p>  As the work is already scheduled to take place next year I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.  I want to reaffirm what I said to the committee about the work that is under way, by the Department of Transport, on a grant to support this sector in transitioning towards different kinds of engines because we realise that this is a challenge for a sector that must face other challenges at the same time.  I am sure that there will be an opportunity to get the views of the Deputies on the issue of the grant, its design and roll-out, in different ways in the coming months.  </p> <p>  As I said yesterday, I will see if it is possible to get a little bit more information on the work that is under way on that and will share it with the Deputies on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I understand now that this scheme already exists.</p> <p>  I with to advise that gas vehicles are not particularly relevant to the Irish market.  Some people did partake in the scheme but it has not really been successful.  One will find that with the stakeholders involved they will seek more of an upgrade to a Euro 6 diesel as opposed to Euro 6 gas.  Also, our infrastructure has not been rolled quick enough and is not aligned with Europe where they are moving away from the gas model.

This matter is of interest to every Deputy on every side of the House.  There is unanimous support from both Government and Opposition Deputies right across the midlands for the principle behind what I am proposing here.  Within the next few weeks, both Lanesboro and Shannonbridge power stations will shut down for the last time.  It is the end of an era for peat production and employment right across the midland counties.</p><p>Twelve months ago we had a debate on the need to put proactive supports in place in the midlands.  During the debate on last year's Finance Bill, I tabled these amendments on Report Stage and they were rejected.  The difficulty is that very little progress has been made in the past 12 months.  Kieran Mulvey, who was appointed as the just transition commissioner by the Government, has done an exceptional job and has been very open and frank with communities.  He has made very clear recommendations but, disappointingly, they have not been followed through on by the Government.  We had a very small window and when the just transition commissioner made recommendations, they had to be acted upon.</p><p>One of the recommendations was that changes be sought to the EU state aid rules.  It is up to the Minister to seek that flexibility.  It is not just here in Ireland that it is needed but right across the coal regions of the EU.  Peat in Ireland is very similar to coal in most continental European countries.  The European Committee of the Regions produced a report earlier this year that specifically highlighted the need to introduce flexibility in EU state aid rules in order that the State, its agencies and local authorities could directly invest in community projects.  There is no point in the Government, through the carbon funds, the just transition commissioner and Ministers encouraging communities to think big if there is no mechanism to access the funding needed.</p><p>Some funding has been given to communities through the carbon taxes.  Ballyforan in County Roscommon received &euro;100,000, which was very welcome.  Ballyforan straddles the border between Roscommon and Galway and is a rural community.  It will lose one of the Bord na M&oacute;na workshops down the road from it and that is having a big impact on employment there.  Historically, there were hundreds of jobs in that community between Bord na M&oacute;na and Gowla farm but over time they have diminished and now we will see the final closure of that workshop.  The people of the town applied to the just transition fund and were successful in accessing funding to draw up a plan for their community.  They have a lot of very good, innovative ideas.  However, they do not have the 10% in funding that is required to match what they received and they have no mechanism to raise it at the moment because of Covid-19.  They have turned to the local authority and it has said it is not in a position to help.  As a result, the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is breaking up that grant into smaller pieces but these people still have to beg, borrow and steal to try to get the co-funding aspect.</p><p>This community is acknowledging that there is a problem and rather than going out onto the streets and protesting or putting their hands in their pockets and saying there is nothing they can do about it, these people have proactively rolled up their sleeves and come forward with innovative ideas for the just transition fund.  Those ideas have been acknowledged but they cannot get the project off the ground because of that co-funding issue.  That is just one example but this is becoming a barrier right across the midland counties.  There are barriers, under state aid rules, to the State supporting this just transition where communities are coming up to the mark.  In fairness, each and every community within my constituency and the bordering areas is taking a proactive approach to this and is looking at it as a potential opportunity to reconfigure the local economy but someone has to meet them halfway.</p><p>The other side of this is that we must put incentives in place for the private sector to come on board.  That is the purpose of this amendment and amendment No. 159, to which I will speak later.  They address the 20 Bord na M&oacute;na workshops across the midland counties, from east Galway over to Kildare, down to Tipperary and up to north Westmeath, which will be mothballed by the end of this year.  I am seeking some type of specific incentive to encourage private sector investment in each of those sites.  They have the advantage in that they have the three-phase electricity supply that would be needed.  They are very large sites and there are very large sheds available that can be used for light engineering works and so forth.  The skill sets are also available through the employees who would have worked in those workshops with Bord na M&oacute;na.  We need private sector companies to look at those locations.</p><p>The reality is that the midlands has been the poor relation in terms of investment.  In general, a lot of private sector investment goes to the seaboards, the cities and the urban areas around our island and not to the midland counties.  We have always been the poor relation in that regard, whether in foreign direct investment or indigenous investment.  I am asking that we put an incentive, or a focused, targeted extension system, in place for 20 specific sites in the midland counties to invite the private sector to come and look at these sites.  These sites can deliver on businesses' objectives, the Government will actively support them in coming there and they have the local workforce.  Long-term sustainable jobs can be created at these locations.</p><p>It is frustrating that everyone is talking about the just transition and the move from brown to green.  When I served as a Minister, I fully supported that but the intention was for that transition to happen over a ten-year period and that was also the Minister for Finance's intention when we discussed this.  Now it will happen over a 12-month period.  The mechanisms of Government have not reacted in the same manner in which the decisions have been taken to shut down these facilities.  It is vitally important, therefore, that a targeted, focused scheme is in place to encourage investment in this area.  It is not just on the industrial side.  In fairness to some of the State agencies, they are beginning to look at how we can support the midland counties.  In the next few weeks F&aacute;ilte Ireland will publish its River Shannon master plan, which will hopefully be used as a blueprint to develop tourism along the Shannon corridor.</p><p>It will be producing another master plan for the Beara-Breifne Way, which will deal with another aspect, and a corridor across the midland counties and, specifically, the communities that have been affected by the decision of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.</p><p> However, Government decisions fail to recognise the unique aspects of the midland region.  I can give a practical example, and it is one I raised with the Minister last July with regard to the stay-and-spend initiative.  Everyone welcomes the principle and core objective of what the Minister was doing in that regard, and I accept that it has not got off the ground because of lockdown.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me now or later today what was the projected spend or cost to the Exchequer for the stay-and-spend scheme this year and what the projected spend for the early part of next year would be.  That will give us an idea of what we were looking at spending.  As I told the Minister previously, that scheme deliberately discriminated against the midland counties.  For example, under the scheme, people can only use F&aacute;ilte Ireland-approved accommodation.  There are 155 bed and breakfast units in County Kerry registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There are 15 in County Westmeath, ten in County Roscommon, nine in County Offaly, three in County Longford and five in County Laois.  Straight away, the structure of the stay-and-spend scheme and the requirement to use only F&aacute;ilte Ireland-approved accommodation meant that it did not apply in real terms to the midland counties.  If one looks at hotels or any other benchmark relating to the scheme, we lost out.</p><p> Proportionately, we do not have the same scale of tourism across the midlands, so we are always going to be at a disadvantage.  The reality is that tourism probably had less of an impact in our region than it did in other regions which have a much better developed tourism sector.  However, there was a golden opportunity here to bring people to our region.  It is within an hour's commute from the city of Dublin.  People did not have to travel long distances and it would have been an ideal location for short breaks, but when the structures were designed they discriminated against our region.  I do not believe that was deliberate, but that is the practical outcome.</p><p> My difficulty is that while the Government acknowledges that there is a challenge across the midland counties and has put a just transition commissioner in place, when it comes to practical decisions it is not discriminating in favour of the midland counties, which is the opposite of the announcement originally made when the decision was made by the ESB.  The announcement was that in all Government schemes consideration and weighting would be given to applications coming from midland counties and midland communities that were directly impacted by the closure of the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na facilities across the midlands.  That is not happening.  That is why it is imperative that we put into legislation the specific 20 Bord na M&oacute;na workshop sites distributed across the seven midland counties and state that we want to see investment come to those locations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#E00300"><p>I will speak on amendment No. 159 and the Minister can respond to both.  Amendment No. 159 relates specifically to the two ESB sites in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  I will not repeat what I just said, but I will add to it.  Kieran Mulvey has been frank and open.  While I believe he has been fair to all sides involved, he has been clear in his views on issues.  He knows how government works.  He has said publicly that the ESB should not proceed with the demolition of the power stations at Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  The ESB official policy on this is that while it is advertising and seeking contractors to demolish both sites, it is still considering other options for the sites.  The difficulty is that the ESB is considering options for the sites internally within the company.  If the ESB was a run of the mill private company, I could fully understand that.  However, it is not a private company.  It is a semi-State company.  While it has a commercial mandate, and I do not disagree with that, the fact is that it cannot under any circumstances squat on a site to inhibit investment in a region.  The company was set up for the specific purpose of electricity supply, but it was also about providing employment.  That view is being missed by the ESB.  I do not expect the company to employ staff if there is no work for them, but if it cannot utilise a site to create and retain employment, I expect it to release that site to somebody who will do that, rather than coming in with a lump hammer and demolishing the site, which is the current intention.</p> <p>  The ESB is examining internally the potential use of the sites and stations in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  The reality is that it does not have a use for the power stations in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge.  Every one of us has paid for those two power stations through our electricity bills.  They are fully paid for, and both facilities have a further ten-year lifespan before they require a major refurbishment.  The taxpayers and electricity users in this country have both power stations free of charge for the next ten years.  That was the reason a ten-year transition from brown to green energy was put in place for Bord na M&oacute;na.  These are strategic sites and are extremely useful for other potential investors, but the ESB is saying there are issues relating to title, adjoining landowners and rights of access.  Every excuse under the sun will be raised as to why it cannot or should not dispose of those strategic sites.</p> <p>  If the ESB has no use for these sites in power generation and if it were to demolish those sites, I want a commitment from the Government that the sites must be disposed of by the ESB for employment creation in the midlands.  That is important because if the Government clarifies that, I believe the ESB will think again.  It will not proceed with its plan to demolish the two power stations and, for the first time, will look constructively at other options.  I have been presented with two very viable options for both Lanesborough and Shannonbridge whereby they would produce green electricity.  This time last year, I put forward a proposal, which I still believe is a viable option, for a third avenue, which is to go to 100% biomass in either or both power plants.</p><p>By using the existing Bord na M&oacute;na rail network and supporting local landowners to grow willow and biomass I believe that we can make at least one of those power stations financially viable to consume biomass for power generation and to create a significant number of jobs, as well as sequestering carbon from the environment.  I can go through in detail with the Minister three separate, viable options in terms of power generation on those sites, but they are not being considered by the ESB at the moment.  I believe that is very wrong.</p><p> We had a discussion already yesterday about the challenges we have in terms of power generation and stability on the grid as a result of data centres.  We have a big challenge in that regard, in particular from 2025 on when we will not have enough generation capacity within the country to meet the significant demands that will be placed on the electricity grid by data centres, yet at the same time we are planning to demolish two power stations within the midland counties, which are strategically located on the grid in terms of grid stability, in particular to provide a reliable electricity supply to the north-west of this country.  We are planning to demolish them even though there are viable options that need to be fully considered.  We must ensure that those two power stations are not demolished, that we do look at other viable options and that we put an incentive in place, as outlined in amendment No. 159, to look at viable alternatives for those sites that can create employment and hopefully bring about a different approach from the ESB.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#F00200"><p>Before addressing the substance of these amendments I would like to take the opportunity to advise the committee that I am considering bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage on the matter of accelerated capital allowances for farm safety and adaptive equipment.</p> <p>  The employment and investment incentive, EII, is a state aid measure operating within the EU's general block exemption regulations and, as such, it applies equally to all regions in the State.  A regional variation of EII would require separate state aid approval from the European Commission.  At the moment, areas along the Border, for example, could equally make the point that their SMEs are facing particular difficulties that similarly warrant special variations of measures such as KEEP and EII.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I must be careful not to breach EU rules on regional aid.</p> <p>  The second amendment proposes consideration of the extension of relief in the form of capital allowances on industrial buildings and industries in specified areas in counties Offaly and Longford.  In broad terms, an industrial building is a building or structure in use for the purpose of a number of specified trades, including, for example, a trade carried out in a mill, factory or other similar premises.  A business may claim capital allowances on such buildings, usually at a rate of 4% per annum over 25 years.  There is no geographical limit to this provision.  Therefore, the relief is already available to businesses incurring qualifying expenditure in the towns named by the Deputy.  I note that capital allowances for capital expenditure on plant and machinery for the purpose of a trade are also available, again, irrespective of the geographic location.  If the proposal is to consider widening the scope of relief for industries in the named towns to include buildings that would not normally qualify for industrial building allowances, the committee should be aware that it is not possible for the State to provide geographically targeted tax incentives other than in accordance with EU regional aid guidelines.  These do not allow for the level of targeting suggested by the Deputy and for this reason I cannot accept the proposed amendment.</p> <p>  I listened to what Deputy Naughten said and the various issues that he raised regarding the future of the power station buildings and his understanding of the plans the ESB has for those buildings in the future.  I will pass on the issues to which he referred to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I have visited one of the power stations to which the Deputy referred and I am well aware of the consequences of that building not having a viable plan for future use.  I will raise the issues raised by Deputy Naughten with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p> <p>  As Deputy Naughten acknowledged, the ESB is a semi-State company, which makes decisions in accordance with its own mandate.  I know the ESB is conscious of the impact of the decisions it is making on current and former employees, and it is trying to handle the issues that are at stake here as carefully and as sensitively as possible.</p> <p>  I welcome the clarification from the Deputy on the stay-and-spend programme.  It was not designed to deliberately discriminate against any part of the country and against the counties to which the Deputy referred.  We do have to ensure that if taxpayers' money is being used to avail of a relief, that it is being used by businesses that are registered for the activity against which the relief is intended.  That is a very reasonable position to hold.  As Deputy Naughten clarified, it is not the intention of the Government to discriminate against any part of the country.</p> <p>  I have a brief in front of me on the work that Kieran Mulvey is doing on behalf of the just transition task force and commission.  I know the task force published a report on its work on 22 May and the Government made available a further &euro;15 million as part of the July stimulus plan in order to commence a multi-year programme to rehabilitate 33,000 ha of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands.  I expect that kind of commitment will form the core of how we will look to support the just transition in the midlands region because the Government is aware of the many difficulties that have been emphasised by Deputy Naughten in his contribution this morning.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#F00300"><p>I have listened carefully to the Minister's response and I will not go back over the issues.  We have discussed them before and I have put the case clearly on the record here.</p> <p>  On a statistical matter, I ask the Minister to come back to me with the figures on the stay-and-spend scheme.  I would appreciate that.</p> <p>  I wish to make a brief contribution on the amendment.  This time last year, when the decision was made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse planning permission for the two midland power stations in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge to co-fire with biomass, it had a devastating impact right across the midland counties.  We were effectively given 12 months' notice of the closure of a major industry, which is the equivalent of Google pulling out of Dublin with 12 months' notice.  Had that happened in Dublin, a task force would be put in place and, in fairness, a task force was put in place in the midlands.  I acknowledge that quite a number of members of the Cabinet came down and met the communities and their representatives, as would happen if Google pulled out of Dublin.  The task force has made recommendations.  The difficulty is that if Google were to pull out of Dublin, one could be damn sure that the recommendations would be implemented.</p><p>The Minister said he will not act on Kieran Mulvey's recommendations on alterations to state aid rules that would specifically target investment in the midland counties because he does not want to give preferential treatment to them over any other part of the country, even though we are losing the equivalent of Google.  I have absolutely no doubt that if Google pulled out of the city of Dublin tomorrow morning, some incentive would be put in place to encourage someone into that office accommodation, but the Minister said that will not happen in the midlands.  I am talking about 20 specific focus sites, not an across-the-board issue.  If the Government appoints a task force and it specifically recommends alterations targeted at 20 specific locations along the Border, I will fully support that as well.  However, across Europe, all the communities, government organisations and EU-wide organisations - the European Commission was involved in what we are talking about as well - have made recommendations that there needs to be alterations to the state aid rules, and the Minister is saying he will not make a special case for the midland counties.  That is disappointing.</p><p> In addition, Kieran Mulvey has made specific recommendations that the two power plants in Lanesborough and Shannonbridge should not be demolished and that we should fully explore every opportunity for them.  In fairness, every Deputy, Senator and public representative in the midlands is unanimous that those two power plants should not be demolished until all opportunities are explored.  I have put it to the Minister that there are three power generation opportunities, two with private investors that have approached me and that are interested in getting involved in this and a third which I have referred to previously and which I believe, with the proper governance structures put in place, is financially viable as well, yet the Minister is saying, "Hands off.  The ESB has a commercial mandate."  It does, but the Government is the company's sole shareholder and there is a mechanism for the Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to give a direction directly to the company.  I am not asking it to lose money or to take a penny out of its pocket.  In fact, the ESB, disingenuously, has looked for the &euro;5 million that it put into the just transition fund back.  It has looked for every single electricity customer in this country to refund that to them, which is wrong.  I do not believe that across this country families who are struggling to pay their electricity bills should refund the ESB the &euro;5 million it put into the just transition fund.  If any additional money does come through the PSO, it must be ring-fenced and put into that just transition fund and not onto the bank balance of the ESB.</p></speech>

It is just that, even in that context, the plans to fill a building and to replace jobs would not come through the kinds of targeted tax incentives he is looking for.  We would not do that because for a country of our size, we cannot use tax incentives in the geographically focused way to which the Deputy referred.  Leaving aside issues of size, it is far more effective and far more targeted to use grants and government expenditure to address the issues to which he refers.  Leaving aside the issue of whether we could use tax incentives, and we have a pretty poor track record of demonstrating that tax incentives can work for urban regeneration or the regeneration of towns and villages in the way we would want, the way in which we would do this is through the allocation of funding.  It is more effective, can be made more specific and can be tailored, and that is exactly what is happening.</p> <p>  I have already put on the record of the committee the commitment of &euro;15 million to rehabilitate the Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands and the effect that is having.  In addition, businesses in the midlands have secured &euro;6 million in funding from the regional enterprise development fund.  That money is going into businesses in the counties and constituencies to which the Deputy referred.  We have the regional enterprise plan for the midlands, launched only in 2019.  That is making progress on specific priorities such as an advanced manufacturing centre for the midlands and how we can realise the potential for food and big data in the midlands.  Furthermore, under the rural regeneration development fund, specific projects have been funded that look to make progress on particular projects in the counties to which the Deputy referred.</p> <p>  Even in the circumstances to which he referred, therefore, we cannot, and should not, pretend that tax incentives are the way in which we can make progress.  It is more effective, more targeted and makes better use of our money to spend taxpayers' money in the areas for the purposes the Deputy outlined, and that is what is happening.  Recognition of this was given in our July stimulus plan and in budget 2021, and the issues to which the Deputy referred regarding the use of buildings - again, I have listened to what he said on these matters - I will raise with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  However, they are not issues for progress in the Bill but, of course, the Deputy is fully entitled to raise them in the debate on the Bill, which I recognise.</p> <p>  I will come back to him with information on the operation of the stay-and-spend scheme once I am satisfied with that.  I have been informed during the debate that other holiday accommodation providers that are not legally obliged to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland may choose to be voluntarily listed.  This requires the service provider to make a self-declaration that his or her business complies with all statutory requirements.  The voluntary application process is very simple and quick and incurs only a nominal fee of &euro;1 for both 2020 and 2021.  In fairness, that will not deal with all the issues to which the Deputy referred because that refers only to businesses that are not required to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, but it is still relevant to the issue he raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#G00300"><p>I will wrap up now because we are banging our heads off a brick wall on this.  I understand what the Minister is saying about tax incentives, but he also needs to remember and be conscious of the fact that we are limited in what we can put forward in respect of the Finance Bill.  I am agnostic about the vehicles that are used.  The core principle is that there needs to be specific geographic targeted incentives in these particular locations.  He mentioned the regional enterprise plan.  Of course, the plan does not include Roscommon and east Galway because Roscommon and east Galway are in the western plan.  As we know, whether we like it or not, and whatever way we slice it and dice it, Mayo, Sligo and Galway city have a disproportionate say in that regard, even though it is a regional plan.</p><p>It would make far more sense for Roscommon and east Galway to be part of the midlands plan and the addressing of those challenges.  Even something as simple as that would make a significant difference.  When I was part of the Government, we designated Athlone as one of the growth centres.  Nevertheless, if a person goes over the county boundary on the edge of Athlone, he or she is in a different regional enterprise strategy.</p><p> I accept funding and grants are coming, which is welcome.  I have given the Minister a practical example of the challenges faced by the community in Ballyforan.  I could do the same for Lanesborough, Clontuskert, Shannonbridge and Ballinasloe, where they face the exact same issues.  I gave an example yesterday on another aspect of the fund, which is the retrofitting of local authority houses, and this only happens in mixed housing estates.  No rural houses are being included.  I have no doubt the Minister will ensure that problem is resolved.  It is always the same and we just cannot get a practical, implementable, focused and targeted initiative.</p><p> The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, has said we should hold on to the two power plants.  He has said there should be targeted geographic incentives.  I ask the Minister to mull over this between now and Report Stage.  I will withdraw both amendments, with leave to reintroduce.</p></speech>

For a number of years I argued the research and development tax credit should be increased for small and medium enterprises to 30% and reduced for other businesses to 20%.</p><p>The increase in the research and development tax credit for micro and small businesses was adopted in last year's Finance Act, and I welcomed that change, having called for it in a number of previous years.  However, we know the research and development tax credit is disproportionately availed of by multinationals and large corporations.  The figures show that quite clearly.  We saw the change last year and we will see how that has an impact on distribution in future years.  This amendment calls for options to be brought forward to look at and reform our research and development tax credit regime.</p><p>Given the changes in global tax policy, it is clear our industrial policy must also change.  There must be measures to encourage high value growth in research in our domestic economy as this will be more crucial than ever before.  This amendment does not call for a change, as such, but it seeks a report into the area of tax policy that could further this end.</p><p>A number of reports on this have been done in the past and the Minister accepts and acknowledges the need for this area to be kept under constant review.  As I stated, there were changes last year to supports for SMEs and we need to continue that trajectory.  It would now be timely to have a further report, given the data that will come through concerning last year's change, on how the research and development tax credit could be further strengthened if necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#H00500"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The Irish corporation tax regime contains a small number of tax reliefs, including the research and development tax credit and the knowledge development box.  The focus of these reliefs is on the creation of additional employment and on promoting innovation and inward investment, with a view to generating high value-added economic activity in the country.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty is seeking a report on the research and development tax credit.  I note that the Revenue Commissioners publish a report, entitled Research &amp;amp; Development Tax Credit Statistics, which is updated annually with the latest available data from corporation tax returns.  This report contains a significant volume of data relating to the research and development tax credit, including the overall cost of the tax credit and the number of claimants, the business sector of the claimant, the size of the claimant, based on employee numbers and a reasonable proxy for large and small and medium companies and a breakdown by value of the credit claimed as profiled against the corporation tax liability of the claimant.</p> <p>  As regards future options for the research and development credit, the Deputy may be aware that the programme for Government includes a commitment to continue to encourage greater take-up by small domestic companies, and to examine certain aspects, such as the pre-approval procedures and record keeping requirements.</p> <p>  I am extending the knowledge development box relief for a further two years.  The extension provides certainty for businesses during the current challenging circumstances in the context of a no-deal Brexit and Covid-19.  The knowledge development box is an OECD-compliant intellectual property regime, which provides a corporation tax relief for income arising from qualifying assets, such as computer applications and inventions protected by a qualifying patent.  To avail of the relief, the assets must result from qualifying research and development activities carried out by the company in Ireland.  The knowledge development box will be reviewed prior to its new sunset clause of 31 December 2022, within the five-year timeframe for a measures of this size as recommended by my Department&rsquo;s tax expenditure guidelines.</p> <p>  With regard to the other amendment and the suggestion of a comparative assessment of the benefits accruing from direct public expenditures by the State in research and development against the benefits derived from tax reliefs, I note that these are not directly comparable.  Direct expenditure from the State and tax reliefs are both important policy instruments, and both are being implemented, but they have different objectives and aims.</p> <p>  The objective of tax reliefs such as the knowledge development box and the research and development tax credit is to encourage companies to invest their own resources in undertaking such activities in Ireland and to support higher levels of investment and high-value employment than could be funded by direct expenditure measures alone.  The reliefs also foster synergies with the third level sector.  For example, in the Finance Act 2019, I increased the outsourcing threshold for expenditure to universities and institutes of higher education from 5% to 15%.  This will encourage greater investment and partnership opportunities between industry and the education sector in pursuing practical applications of academic research, with possible spillover effects into the wider economy.</p> <p>  In view of the existing commitments I have made, and as the nature of the companies claiming the research and development tax credit is largely available and published on Revenue&rsquo;s website, I cannot accept the proposed amendments.</p> <p>  It is relevant to the debate to say that in last year's budget, I put in place measures for micro and small companies doing research and development.  As I said in the debate on the Finance Bill at the time, they were subject to a commencement order pending state aid approval from the European Commission, given the targeted natures of measures towards micro and small companies.</p><p>Officials in my Department initiated contact with the Commission promptly on this matter and discussions are ongoing but they have been hampered to some extent by Covid-related lockdowns and other priorities with which we have had to deal.  Therefore, the measures for micro and small companies have not yet been commenced.  There is a need to look at the efficacy of the research and development tax credit in relation to small and micro companies and I indicated my intention to do this in last year's Finance Bill debate.  For the reasons I have outlined, that is, the data being available alternatively or the fact that we still need to commence the measures relating to micro and small companies, it would be more appropriate to deal with the issues to which Deputy Doherty refers by looking at already available data or when these measures are implemented for very small companies and the data is available for them at that point.</p></speech>

I note the Minister's comments that he will look at this further and that there are issues around commencement but that is what the report is about.  Unless I am picking up something incorrectly, I understand that the Minister is going to do what we are seeking to do with this amendment.  Obviously the mechanism here is to ask for a report to be prepared but basically we need this to be looked at in more detail.  On that basis, I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister can give us the latest figures on what is projected for this year in terms of this tax credit but my understanding is that it is approximately &euro;700 million and that has been rising in recent years.  That money is going to private companies and I suspect, largely, to very big and profitable companies.  It seems to me that there is a trade off between expenditure going to those companies whose research and development is focused on increasing their profitability or, alternatively, to our public universities to do research and development that is geared towards societal objectives, that is, things that we as a society decide are important.  We should remember that our universities are very significantly underfunded.  There is not enough money going into research at third level and many of the people working in third level education have very poor wages and conditions of employment.  Many are on temporary contracts and so on.  A lot of investment is needed in higher education and in research in our universities.  The money that is currently going to private companies through the research and development tax credit would be better spent on our universities.  At the very least, we should examine that question and look at it closely to see if there would be more benefit in doing that rather than handing out vast sums of money to a relatively small coterie of profit driven corporations.</p></speech>

However, the total expenditure on research and development is indeed dominated by large, international firms.  Irish owned firms constituted 82% of the total number of firms who conducted research and development in 2017 but the value of the research and development expenditure conducted by Irish owned firms was 31%.</p> <p>  In terms of the trends in relation to costs, it varies year by year because it depends on the kinds of projects that are undertaken in this country at any given point.  In 2012, for example, the cost of the credit was &euro;282 million.  It increased in 2015 to &euro;708 million.  It now stands at &euro;355 million and that is the most up-to-date figure that I have.  I would make the point to the Deputy that it is not a question of either-or.  He is arguing for support to enable research and development through our publicly funded universities and institutes of higher education but that is already happening.  The Deputy needs only to look at the Tyndall National Institute in Cork, for example, and the value of the work and innovation that is going on there.  He should look at the research work that is going on in all of our universities at the moment in everything from life sciences and food to information technology and the use of data.  There is a huge amount of State enabled and funded research going on in our institutes and universities.  Clearly, Science Foundation Ireland plays a really valuable role in that regard.  In addition, it is the case that research and development is taking place within the private sector that is enabled by the research and development tax credit.  That research and development, in turn, plays a role in the creation and retention of jobs within our economy, which is of enormous value.  It is not a case of either-or.  State funded investment in research and development is under way and at the same time, we have important research and development going on in private companies, supported by the aforementioned tax credit.  That research and development plays a role in the creation of tax receipts and the retention of jobs in our country, which is hugely important at this time.</p></speech>

In the recent budget I was quite flabbergasted by the Estimate for health expenditure.  As we know, the Estimate was significantly increased in the context of Covid-19 and rightly so but in the area of health research in the HSE, there was no increase this year at all.  I was absolutely amazed by that because I would have thought that in the context of Covid-19, surely we should be pouring money into public health research, especially given the situation we are facing and our awareness of the importance of research in that area.  That is a further example to illustrate my point.  Do we want to subsidise, with public money, some IT firm to come up with the 15th upgrade of the iPhone or some such, or would we rather that money went into public health research?  I know what I would prefer.</p> <p>  More generally, there is an issue with a lack of funding for our universities.  The Minister is saying that we are doing that as well but the investment, per student, in third level education in this country is abysmally low.</p><p>I remember attending an event held by one of the student unions last year.  It was about the funding of third level education.  It was pointed out that there was more investment in horse racing per horse in this country than in third level education per student.  <i>Per capita </i>investment in our students is very low.  We note that Irish universities have been falling in the international rankings over recent years.  It is very obvious that there are other areas in which this kind of public expenditure would be more beneficial from the point of view of our society than handing it to a relatively small group of multinationals.  I have made the point.  It is obvious that we disagree with the Minister.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#K01400"><p>The EU list of non-co-operative jurisdictions for tax purposes is intended to encourage jurisdictions with harmful tax practices in place to address those features of their tax code in order to enable fair and effective corporation taxation in the European Single Market.  The purpose of the list is to encourage positive change through co-operation.  The listing of countries is based on screening countries through the objective application of agreed criteria comprising international tax standards.</p> <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s defensive measures involve modifying the controlled foreign company, CFC, rules in terms of their application to non-co-operative jurisdictions by turning off existing exemptions so that CFCs located in jurisdictions on the list cannot avail of them.  This will strengthen the application of Irish CFC rules to Irish-resident companies with a CFC resident in a non-cooperative jurisdiction by imposing less favourable conditions and, potentially, imposing a CFC charge which would not otherwise exist.  </p> <p>  With regard to the data the amendment requests to be included in a report, it is not possible to provide this information.  The requested report is sought within a period of six months of the passing of the Bill.  The information sought will only be available in September 2022 at the earliest, at which point it will only be available in a limited fashion.  This is because the section only commences for the accounting periods of companies starting on or after 1 January 2021.  For example, a company with a 12-month accounting period starting on 1 January 2021 will file its corporation tax returns in September 2022.  Companies with accounting periods commencing later than January will file their corporation tax returns in the months subsequent to September 2022.  </p> <p>  The Irish tax code relies on self-assessment and taxpayers will be obliged to ensure they do not avail of the exemptions for CFCs based in listed jurisdictions.  Revenue does not expect that the introduction of these measures will impact on a significant number of companies, but it is considering how best to collect the data.  However, it should be noted that data around changes in the value of cross-border transactions will not be captured under either the existing or amended CFC rules as this is not the focus of those rules.  Rather, CFC rules can result in the income of a foreign subsidiary being subject to Irish tax as if the income was earned by the Irish-resident controlling company, where certain conditions are met. </p> <p>  Ultimately, the purpose of CFC rules is to discourage the artificial diversion of income to low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.  As such, they are not designed primarily to raise Exchequer revenue, but rather to modify taxpayer behaviour, which is in keeping with the purpose of the EU list of non-co-operative jurisdictions for tax purposes. </p> <p>  As the actual risk presented by the existence of corporate structures involving Irish-resident companies and companies resident in non-co-operative territories is thought to be very limited, these defensive measures are intended to act as a deterrent rather than as a revenue-raising measure.</p></speech>

I hope that a report such as I have proposed could highlight any such activity, which is very important.

My amendment relates to that and another connected issue.  A probe was carried out by the University of Bath and some Dutch investigative journalists that cast light on how tobacco companies are lessening their tax liabilities.  There is nothing illegal about what these companies are doing.  We are talking about the four big tobacco companies across the globe.  They are using Irish subsidiaries as part of an elaborate tax avoidance strategy according to this research.  Between them, these companies generate about &euro;80 billion per annum.  Measures have been introduced in this country and every other developed country to try to curb the consumption and purchase of cigarettes by increasing taxes and levies, which, thankfully, has had a resultant drop off in the number of smokers, particularly older smokers; there is still a challenge with younger smokers.  What these companies are now doing, however, is maximising the amount of profit they are generating from their existing sales.  They are using very elaborate tax vehicles to do that, which are within the existing legal structures.  </p><p>What I am looking for is for us to close off these vehicles for tobacco companies.  It is imperative that we send out a clear message about smoking, the people affected by it and its knock-on impact on our health service by, among other things, probably making people more prone to infections like Covid-19.  We also should deal with it at the other end, that is, at the corporate end, and ensure that whatever vehicles are being used, legitimate as they seem to be, are closed off to tobacco companies.  </p><p>There is another cohort of companies to which this vehicle should be closed off, namely, fossil fuel companies.  We have the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018 on which the Minister and I worked closely.  This Act clearly states that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is divesting itself of investments in companies that derive more than 20% of their revenues from the exploration, extraction or refinement of fossil fuel.  ISIF no longer invests in or is divesting from 224 fossil fuel companies.  </p><p>Our law specifically designates fossil fuel companies in which we will not invest so there is already an acknowledgement in this regard on statute.  I am saying that this should also apply to taxation vehicles that may legitimately be used for other purposes and that we should stipulate that fossil fuel and tobacco companies cannot use vehicles and shelf companies to avoid paying their legitimate taxes wherever they should be paid.  We have led on global terms in terms of the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act.  Here is an opportunity to complement that measure in terms of tax vehicles that are being exploited to avoid paying tax in other countries.  This should be done in the case of fossil fuel and tobacco companies.  </p></speech>

This is basically to introduce a general anti-avoidance provision whereby a surcharge of 30% is applicable to Irish company revenue when it is established that Irish companies are using intra-group arrangements to significantly reduce their liabilities through money that is being loaned out or channelled back to Luxembourg and other such countries as part of intra-group arrangements.  We know certain companies have made profits of over &euro;100 million in 2018 and had assets worth billions of euro and accounts filed in Luxembourg.  The bulk of the profits would have been booked and not taxed because of that so we believe it is very important to put forward this amendment.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of intra-group transactions as a very significant example of these huge giveaways to multinationals using labyrinthine structures of subsidiaries to avoid tax.  Up until recently, the Revenue tables showing the tax reliefs and allowances that are available contained a heading labelled intra-group transactions.  The last figure I saw was something like &euro;9 billion and it was rising consistently.  It was one of the largest categories of tax relief and had risen very dramatically over recent years.  I looked recently at the Revenue table on this and the category of intra-group transactions seemed to have disappeared, which I thought was a bit odd because large companies use multiple subsidiaries to avoid tax.  As we need to know the extent of this, could the Minister tell us how much tax relief is being given out under the heading of intra-group transactions according to the latest available figures?</p></speech>

Aggressive tax planning by multinational companies is a global problem that requires a global solution.  We have demonstrated our commitment to being part of this solution by actively participating in international tax reform, enacting domestic legislative changes and supporting the development of effective tax systems in developing countries.  Recent years have seen significant progress in global action to address the issue of aggressive tax planning by very large companies.  We are an active participant in ongoing discussions at OECD level on such matters as how we can address the tax challenges of digitalisation.  In addition, we have worked with our fellow EU member states to agree and implement an unprecedented number of directives on tax co-operation that have been highly successful in addressing aggressive tax planning.</p><p>Domestically, a succession of significant measures relating to corporation have been introduced in recent years.  The work in this regard continues.  The recent budget contained revisions to Ireland's capital allowances for intellectual property in order to ensure that such assets are fully within balancing charge rules, in line with international best practice for such reliefs in other jurisdictions.  The Bill introduces certain defensive legislative measures which will provide that Ireland's controlled foreign company rules apply more strictly to companies with subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions that remain on the EU list of non-co-operative tax jurisdictions.<br/><br/>It is worth reiterating that aggressive tax planning arrangements are not designed by Governments but by advisers, lawyers and businesses that devise complex plans to exploit mismatches or gaps in legislation.  Where instances of aggressive tax avoidance emerge, the Revenue Commissioners rigorously investigate and challenge such cases through the various anti-avoidance legislative provisions available to them.<br/><br/>The third strand of Ireland's resolve to address this issue is our commitment to helping countries in the developing world to enhance their tax regimes.  Ireland's domestic resource mobilisation initiative was launched last year as a collaboration between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department.  The aim of the initiative is to provide practical assistance to developing countries in their efforts to strengthen their tax administrative capacity.<br/><br/>I would also like to inform the committee that in the near future I plan to publish an update on Corporation Tax Roadmap, which was published in 2018.  This update will reflect on the significant measures we have taken and consider what future actions may be needed to ensure that our tax system continues to meet the needs of the modern economy.  It will also provide an opportunity to reflect on the evolving international tax environment and the important work on international tax reform that continues at OECD level.<br/><br/>Regarding the points made by Deputy Naughten and his reference to the recent report in the <i>Business Post</i>, it is not my practice nor would it be appropriate for me to comment on the affairs of individual taxpayers.  However, the study on which the article was based, which was carried out by the University of Bath in conjunction with some Dutch journalists, suggested that companies use the Irish tax system to reduce their liabilities several ways.  Understanding this requires further clarification.<br/><br/>The first of these arrangements is the so-called double Irish.  This issue was addressed in the Finance Act 2014.  The phasing-out period for this measure ends this year.  The report refers to the treatment of intellectual property under Ireland's tax system.  However, the recent budget contained revisions to Ireland's capital allowances for intellectual property in order to ensure that such assets are fully within balancing charge rules, in line with international best practices for such reliefs in other tax jurisdictions.<br/><br/>The study to which I refer also references interest payments into Ireland.  Multinational groups often structure their affairs so that one company performs treasury functions, including lending to other group companies.  The borrower obtains a tax deduction for interest paid while the lender is taxed for interest received.  Lending from low-tax jurisdictions into high-tax jurisdictions can result in a tax advantage for the group.  However, the deduction in the borrowing jurisdiction will usually only be available if the transaction is structured on a commercial basis with a view to the borrower earning profits.  If the jurisdiction of the borrower is not satisfied with the bona fides of the transaction and the commercial rates of interest charged, it can challenge any deduction made.<br/><br/>Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the latest information I have on intra-group transfers.  I do not have that information to hand but I will get it and share it with the Deputy.</p></speech>

For example, we know that one group has companies based in Luxembourg which are used for intra-group financial transactions.  These companies had no employees in 2018, produced &euro;123 million in profits in a recent financial year and paid very little tax.  One of the advantages of using Luxembourg for intra-group financing arrangements is that the taxable profits of companies in other jurisdictions can be reduced by way of payments made to companies in Luxembourg, which, in turn, pay little or no tax.  This is something the Department needs to look at.</p></speech>

This is an enormous and growing category of allowances - or loopholes, in my language - which big multinationals with multiple subsidiaries are exploiting in order to avoid tax.  I understand that he does not have the information now, but I would also appreciate if the Minister could confirm whether there has been a change in the way the Revenue Commissioners list intra-group transactions in their table of allowances, deductions and reliefs for corporate tax.  It would be quite worrying if that were the case.  Information on the extent to which these companies are using this loophole to effectively lend themselves money and pay themselves interest needs to be publicly available.  What is actually profit then becomes a cost, which reduces their taxable profit by huge margins.  This effectively means these firms can write their own tax bills.  It is a scam that needs to be investigated.  At the very least we need complete transparency about the extent of this.  It must be very clearly set out in the Revenue Commissioners' tables on deductions, reliefs and allowances.</p></speech>

I am curious about this.  We know that mandatory disclosure requirements differ across the EU from member state to member state.  Some member states are more transparent and require more in terms of the information that companies are required to file, rather than other questions.  My question concerns the filing of exemptions for intermediaries.  To take a hypothetical example, let us imagine a situation in which a corporate group structure utilises numerous special purpose vehicles, SPVs, in different jurisdictions for cross-border financial transactions and let us suppose that one of those SPVs is based in a jurisdiction with more limited disclosure requirements, while another is based here, requiring more disclosure.  If the Irish intermediary is able to avail of a filing exemption because filing has taken place in a jurisdiction that requires less information, does the Irish regulator seek a copy of the original filing made in that other jurisdiction that is more limited in its requirements and is the Minister concerned that less stringent reporting requirements in other EU jurisdictions mean that this Irish filing exemption could increase the risk of tax and regulatory arbitrage on cross-border transactions?</p></speech>

The requirements are the same and under the agreements that we have now in respect of the exchange of taxpayers' information, it would be open to the Revenue Commissioners to access the declaration that is made in other tax jurisdictions.  This amendment just refers to how the information is filed and who does it; it does not affect the taxpayer meeting the requirements either here in Ireland or anywhere else.</p></speech>

The amount of land that is classified as being vacant in public debates on the matter is overstated.  This is being debated in other reports we have done.</p> <p>  I propose that we have a look at the whole matter of the interplay between taxation and the valuation of land, and the impact that has on housing.  In particular, we will soon set up an independent commission on taxation and welfare, which is a programme for Government commitment.  I propose that one of the terms of reference under that commission would examine the potential for taxation measures in supporting the best use of development land and at dealing with issues relating to vacant properties and unused land.</p> <p>  It is a while now since this matter has been looked at through reports I have been involved with, and I believe that the commission on taxation could play a valuable role in that work.

It could also look at the matter in the context of where the property and land market stands at the moment.

I also want to signal the possibility for an amendment relating to section 44.</p> <p>  On the matter raised by the Deputy, the issue of wealth taxes has been long debated within this committee.  Given the mobility of wealth within an open economy like Ireland, and also given how much wealth is absorbed in property here, which is taxed, I believe that the role a wealth tax could play in Ireland is completely overstated.  It would not be beneficial at all.  Leaving aside my view on the matter, and as I have said we already tax wealth very effectively through, for example, the local property tax, the main reason it would not be beneficial is that reports were done on this in 2016 and in 2018.  The latest report that is available to us is less than two years old, so I do not believe a further report is merited on top.</p></speech>

They all amend the section and relate to new arrangements that will apply for the issue of new Irish securities and the settlement of trades in Irish securities.</p><p>Amendments to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 were contained in the draft Finance Bill and are being further amended now.  The Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 was not amended in the draft Bill and it is being amended now.</p><p>Trades in Irish corporate securities are currently settled in a central securities depository, CSD, in the UK known as CREST.  This CSD is operated by Euroclear UK and Ireland, EUI, a UK incorporated company.  Stamp duty is chargeable on the transfer of securities within the CREST system.  Revenue has an agreement with EUI since 1996 for the collection and payment of this stamp duty.</p><p>Following Brexit, it will no longer be possible for trades in Irish securities to be settled in a CSD that is not based in an EU member state.  The EU has approved a temporary equivalence arrangement for CREST to cover the transition period.</p><p>In October 2018, Euronext, the owner of the Irish Stock Exchange, announced that it had selected another company in the Euroclear Group - Euroclear Bank Belgium - as its preferred long-term settlement provider post-Brexit.  The Migration of Participating Securities Act 2019 has been enacted to enable existing securities to migrate from EUI to the Belgian CSD on 30 March, 2021.</p><p>The main Irish tax impacted by the migration of Irish securities to the Belgian CSD will be stamp duty.  Euroclear Bank is developing the necessary IT systems to enable the collection and payment of stamp duty within its existing Belgian CSD.  My officials and Revenue officials have been engaged in ongoing discussions with Euroclear Bank to agree the new arrangements.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to finalise the stamp duty legislation that would underpin the new arrangements in time for its inclusion in the Bill, as drafted.</p><p>This is now being done in this amendment.</p><p> The current legislative provisions underpinning the stamp duty charge where dematerialised or uncertificated securities are transferred within an electronic settlement system are contained in Part 6 of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  To adapt the traditional stamp duty charge on the execution of a written document to an electronic securities settlement system, the charge is applied to an electronic instruction given by the operator of an electronic securities settlement system to transfer a security within that system.  Such an operator must have entered into an agreement with Revenue for the payment of stamp duty.  EUI is the only operator to have such an agreement.  After 30 March 2021, EUI will no longer be an operator for the purposes of the stamp duty charge and the existing stamp duty provisions will cease to be relevant.  For this reason, new provisions are being inserted into the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999, as a new chapter 2 in Part 6, which are intended to come into operation on 30 March 2021.  While these will be stand-alone provisions, they will to a large extent be modelled on the existing provisions. </p><p> The new provisions will be wider in scope than the existing ones.  They will apply not just to transfers of securities within the Belgian CSD but to any other transfers of dematerialised Irish securities.  They will also apply to certain indirect interests in Irish securities such as depository receipts and depository interests.  After Brexit, it will be possible for trades in depository interests in Irish securities to be settled in the CREST system and transfers of these depository interests will be chargeable to stamp duty.  Both Euroclear Bank and EUI will enter into arrangements with Revenue for the collection and payment of stamp duty.  I may bring forward a Report Stage amendment in respect of this section. </p><p> Amendments to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003 were included in the Finance Bill on publication in section 60(4).  These amendments related to the charge to gift tax and inheritance tax on the receipt of interests in Irish shares.  However, different wording to describe the same matter is now being used for the stamp duty amendments.  To ensure consistency and clarity, the capital acquisitions tax amendments in the Bill as published are now being amended to align with the relevant stamp duty amendments.  </p><p> I recommend these amendments to the committee.</p></speech>

Section 28 of the Act legislated for the TWSS introduced by the Government to provide financial support to workers affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  The scheme enables employees whose employers are affected by the pandemic to receive significant supports directly from their employer through the payroll system.  Section 28(9) of that Act provides that where the Revenue Commissioners have paid an employer a temporary wage subsidy for a specified employee and the employer did not pay that employee an additional amount equivalent to the temporary wage subsidy or was not entitled to receive a subsidy in respect of an employee, the employer is obliged to refund the subsidy to the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p>  Revenue will shortly be conducting a reconciliation exercise on the TWSS.  Arising from that exercise, it is expected that some employers who received a temporary wage subsidy will be required to refund amounts received in excess of their entitlement to Revenue.  Under section 28(13) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, employers will also incur interest on amounts of subsidy to be repaid at a rate of 8% per annum, calculated from the date on which the subsidy was received.  This is the same rate that applies to underpayments of income tax.  Notwithstanding that some employers were not entitled to receive certain TWSS payments or did not pass on TWSS payments received, it is recognised that the 8% interest rate is quite severe, not least in the current circumstances.</p> <p>  This section allows employers to warehouse overpayments due to be refunded to Revenue for a period of at least 12 months.  No interest will be charged during this 12-month period, after which a reduced interest rate of approximately 3% per annum will apply until the Covid-19 relevant tax has been paid in full.  The provision applies to businesses that, as a consequence of the impact of Covid-19 related restrictions, are unable to pay their Covid-19 relevant tax and have complied with PAYE obligations as well as obligations imposed on employers under the TWSS and EWSS.  All small and medium-sized enterprises whose tax affairs are dealt with in Revenue&rsquo;s business division or personal division qualify automatically.  Other employers will qualify if they believe they cannot pay their Covid-19 relevant tax as a result of the effect on their business of Covid-19 and have notified Revenue of that opinion.</p> <p>  As with the tax debt warehousing for VAT and PAYE employer debts, the scheme has three periods.  The first is the Covid-19 restricted trading phase, which commences on 26 March 2020, the first day of the "applicable period" for the TWSS, and runs to the end of the first full bimonthly VAT period after which the business has resumed trading.  Period 2, the zero interest phase, runs for 12 months from the end of period 1 and may be extended by order of the Minister for Finance but can end not later than 31 December 2022.  Period 3, the reduced interest phase, runs from the end of period 2 until the employer&rsquo;s Covid-19 relevant tax is paid in full.</p> <p>  No interest will apply to Covid-19 relevant tax during periods 1 and 2 and a rate of 3% per annum will apply in period 3.  Employers will be able to warehouse debts as long as they continue to file returns, make an agreement before the start of period 3 to repay the outstanding amounts of excess TWSS, and abide by that agreement.  If they fail to do so, the normal interest rate of 8% per annum will be reimposed.  The extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to excess TWSS payments is a vital liquidity support to business.  I commend this section to the House.</p></speech>

The law at present is that the taxpayer has to pay the tax in advance.  The matter is then determined by the Tax Appeals Commission and if the taxpayer is correct and the tax was not payable, the money will be paid back to the taxpayer along with interest at 4%.  However, the effect of section 67 appears to be that the Revenue Commissioners would not have to pay interest to a taxpayer who was found to be correct in his or her appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.  Is my reading of the section correct?  If so, does the Minister not think there might be an unfairness there in terms of taxpayers having to pay penalties and interest when in the wrong, but when the taxpayer is in the right, there does not seem to be any downside for the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

It is a simple proposal and I hope it is one to which the Minister can agree.  Obviously, the report does not have to be inserted into the Bill.  If the Minister is agreeable to considering this issue and coming back to it on Report Stage, that would make sense.</p><p>The situation is that landlords are entitled to avail of a tax deduction for management fees that have been incurred and invoiced.  That is appropriate.  We are not suggesting it is inappropriate.  We are saying that two things should be attached as conditionality for landlords to be able to avail of that tax deduction, namely, that the tenancy should be registered with the RTB - I do not think anybody would disagree with that - and that they must show that the management charges were paid.  I think that is appropriate because apartment owners have raised the issue consistently with Oireachtas Members, including the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson on housing, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, of the deduction being claimed in circumstance where an invoice may have issued but the management charges had not been paid.  The amendment is about making sure that those conditions are met.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I will outline the reasons I differ with the Deputy in respect of this policy.  I will send him a note between now and Report Stage in which I will outline why his rationale for advocating this amendment is not one I can support.</p> <p>  The core issue here is that Deputy Doherty appears to be suggesting that where management fees are not paid, none of the deductions under section 97 of the Taxes Consolidation Act should be allowed.  I do not agree.  Although I accept that there are difficulties with the non-payment of management fees in some developments - I am familiar with such issues - I do not agree that changing the rules of tax deductibility would solve the problem.  It would not address the non-payment of management fees by owner-occupiers and it does not seem fair to link the allowability of all expenses to the payment of one of them.  Property owners may be in dispute with management companies for a variety of reasons, such as the non-provision of services under a management agreement.  I am not convinced that the tax system is the best place for or is best suited to resolving these kinds of contractual disputes.</p><p>That is the core of the reason I would not support the policy change the Deputy is advocating.  I have a fair bit of material regarding the various matters he has raised, and I will send it on to him with a note before Report Stage to see whether it changes his view on the matter.</p></speech>

It refers, in particular, to &quot;options for including non-routine dental treatments such as dentures&quot;.  It seems to be a simple amendment.  We will see what the Minister has to say about it.</p><p>Everybody will agree it is important that those with missing teeth should have them replaced as soon as possible with a device such as a bridge, implant or, as in many cases, dentures.  This is not just important aesthetically in the sense that it gives people self-confidence, but it is also important so people can have a proper diet, which is crucial if they are to have a healthy lifestyle.  People who have loose or ill-fitting dentures often try to avoid certain foods, which is unhealthy for them.  We are aware that a scheme has been established by the Revenue Commissioners to claim tax reliefs on dental expenses.  It is called the Med 2 scheme and it is very much used by many people throughout the State.</p><p>Under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, tax relief can be claimed on non-routine dental procedures, such as those for crowns and bridges, but it cannot be claimed on routine dental procedures such as procedures to obtain new dentures, denture repairs, filling and cleaning.  Those who have worked in the industry for many years can understand how denture repairs, fillings and cleaning could be classed as routine dentistry and therefore would not be eligible for the relief, but they do not understand how providing new dentures could fall into this category.  They tell me that people change their dentures probably every seven to 15 years.  For some, it could be ten 20 years.  In some cases, people have been wearing dentures for up to 50 years.  Therefore, there is clearly no routine to this at all.  It is not a case that the dentures have to be disposed of after a certain period.  It can be from seven years to 50 years.</p><p>Contact has been made with the Chief Dental Officer, who has investigated the issue.  I understand the officer cannot find where the Revenue Commissioners came up with the classification of procedures to obtain new dentures as routine.  Also, the officer is not sure whether there was ever consultation with the Department of Health on the matter.</p><p>There is an issue of fairness.  There are those who may be able to afford an implant or bridge if they lose a tooth and who can obtain tax relief as a result, but there are some who cannot afford the treatments and therefore opt for dentures.  Consequently, they are not entitled to any tax relief.  While those with dentures do not fall into any particular socioeconomic class, there are indications that it is those from a lower socioeconomic background who are in the majority and therefore denied the type of tax relief in question.</p><p>We are asking for a report.  What we are really asking for is that the legislation be amended to include procedures for new dentures in the description of non-routine procedures or to omit them from the description of routine procedures, thereby allowing people replacing their dentures to make a Med 2 claim for tax relief in the same way that somebody obtaining an implant, bridge or crown can avail of the support.  It is an issue of fairness.  It might have been an oversight.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister has to say about it.</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty outlined the position very well.  It is an issue of compassion.  I would imagine it is an issue on which we can find common ground.  I am sure we all know people, including family members, with dentures.  I just cannot imagine the discomfort of ill-fitting dentures.  We can all agree that a little compassion could be shown and that we could find common ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2020111800002#V00600"><p>The rationale behind income tax relief for health expenses is broadly intended to provide assistance for significant or exceptional health expenses.  Expenses for treatment of a routine nature or minor nature are, therefore, typically excluded.  An example of this is that routine dental treatment does not attract the relief, though orthodontic treatment does.</p> <p>  Consistent with this rationale, tax relief in respect of qualifying health expenses is provided for in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Routine dental treatment is explicitly excluded under the legislation and is defined as "the extraction, scaling and filling of teeth and the provision and repairing of artificial teeth or dentures".  However, an individual can claim tax relief in respect of non-routine dental care provided by a registered practitioner.  A comprehensive and non-exhaustive list of relevant procedures is available on the Revenue Commissioners' website.  This list includes major interventions such as periodontal treatment for gum disease and orthodontic treatment to provide braces.</p> <p>  The exclusion of expenses incurred in respect of routine dental treatment has been in place since the relief's inception in 1967 and I am satisfied that the legislation, as drafted and implemented, provides sufficient flexibility for expenses that should qualify.  There are no plans to change these arrangements at this time.  In this regard, I note that tax relief for medical expenses is a commonly availed of relief.  The most recent data, from 2018, highlight that 522,800 taxpayer units utilised the relief at an Exchequer cost of &euro;156 million.</p> <p>  If routine dental expenses, such as those associated with dentures, were tax-relieved, it would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments similarly to qualify for relief, which could greatly increase the overall cost of the tax relief.  Given the many budgetary challenges we face, I question whether this cost increase would be worth justifying.  However, the Deputy will be aware that in recent years, there has been an increase in the level of dental benefits available through the social insurance system administered by the Department of Social Protection.  In this regard, it is noted that tax relief is of assistance only to individuals who have sufficient tax liability and therefore direct expenditure may be a more effective way of targeting assistance to those who may need a specific support.</p> <p>  For the reasons outlined, I do not believe a report of the nature described would be beneficial so I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

If he listened to the dental profession, dentists would tell him very clearly that dentures are not routine.  Dentists have given a description about how they can range from seven to 50 years.  There is an issue of fairness and equality here given that bridges and implants are deemed as non-routine but dentures are not.  The chief dental officer from the Department of Health should be engaged with us here.  This is something I feel strongly about.  I understand from those working in the profession that the tax relief is the difference for some, although not all, as to whether they will continue to wear loose fitting or inappropriate dentures, which as I outlined, have a negative impact on their health and is not appropriate.  This is a 20% tax relief for non-routine dental treatment.</p> <p>  Nobody is suggesting that fillings, scaling and cleaning are not routine.  Likewise, the cleaning of dentures is routine, but the provision of dentures is non-routine.  We should not decide on it ourselves.  I am not a dentist and neither is the Minister.  If he talks to dentists in the profession, they will tell him that it is not routine.  There is an issue of fairness here in how we treat different types of procedures, some that are more costly and out of reach of individuals and, therefore, cannot be availed of, but if they were to be availed of, they would be entitled to tax relief.  He can see the list in terms of what is available in the non-routine category such as crowns, veneers, Rembrandt-type etched fillings, gold posts and gold crowns, implants, chrome cobalt splints and other such treatments are entitled to tax relief but dentures are not.</p></speech>

While I respect the views of dentists, I have to be mindful of the fact that this is an issue that is broader than just dentistry.  I refer to how we define what kind of health expenses qualify for tax relief.  I could not agree to a change in regard to a dental expense and not expect that similar issues would be raised by other professions on behalf of those that they are looking after and to whom they are trying to give good healthcare.</p> <p>  This is not a matter of compassion.  I am as compassionate towards those who need support with dental care as the Deputy but through our social insurance system we have a way in which we try to increase the availability of dental benefits and doing so in recognition of the need that is there.  This is not just a dental matter; it relates to the principles by which we define what kind of health expense justifies a tax relief.  It is for that reason that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  I will check with my Department to see if there has been correspondence with the chief dental officer on the matter and if there is anything I am missing in the argument that has been made.  I will certainly follow up the matter with his office between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

I can understand his concern on the wider issue.  It is a big tax relief claimed by many people.  Unfortunately, many others do not claim this tax relief, despite the fact that they are entitled to it and that they can still claim it four years in arrears.  That is something we would encourage people to do for medical expenses.  This is an issue of equality because it should not be the case that the Minister can cherry-pick what is in or out.  What is in is non-routine dental treatment and what is out is routine dental treatment.  The question posed by those in the profession is how a bridge or implant can be non-routine yet dentures are routine.  It does not make sense.  I have heard what the Minister said.  I will withdraw the amendment and consider it again on Report Stage, but in the intervening period I ask him to not only review the correspondence that might have come into him, because it might have gone to the Department of Health as opposed to the Department of Finance, but that his officials reach out to the chief dental officer and to Department of Health on this issue.  We can discuss their views on Report Stage and perhaps have a more round assessment of the issue before we conclude the Bill.</p></speech>

I will see what correspondence has been received on the matter and use that then for the Report Stage debate.  This is a matter of equity, but it is also a matter of equity in terms of how we treat other healthcare expenses and that is the issue here.  I must ensure that there is consistency across how all healthcare expenses are treated from a tax relief point of view but, as I said, I will check up on relevant correspondence before we get to Report Stage.</p></speech>

This implements changes previously agreed by the Government on 19 October that the EWSS subsidy may be up to &euro;350 per week.</p><p>As a result of this change, the weekly rates of subsidy payable to the employer will be: &euro;203 of a subsidy per employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99; &euro;250 per employee paid between &euro;203 and &euro;299.99; &euro;300 per employee paid between &euro;300 and &euro;399.99; &euro;350 per employee paid between &euro;400 and &euro;1,462.  The subsidy payable will remain nil for employees paid less than &euro;151.50 and more than &euro;1,462 per week.</p><p>The second change is to bring forward the date of payment of the EWSS subsidy.  Similar to the payment schedule that applied under the TWSS, the subsidy payment will be made to the employer as soon as practicable after payroll, generally within two working days.</p><p>The purpose of this change is to minimise the delay between employees being paid and their employer receiving the subsidy to thereby reduce the cash flow burden of the wage bill on employers at this time.</p><p>This is consistent with the overall objective of the EWSS to support employment.</p><p> The third change relates to the turnover test to be met by qualifying employers which requires that they compare current operations with business operations pre-pandemic, in 2019.  For EWSS claims from 1 January 2021, the benchmark period for the turnover test will be rolled forward to quarters 1 and 2 of 2021 compared with the same period in 2019.  This will update the benchmark period for the new year for all recipient firms and ensure new firms may enter the scheme from January 2021, should the need arise.</p><p> Technical amendments will also be made, including the mechanics of clawing back subsidy overpayments from the employer by allowing that a future EWSS claim may be proportionally reduced, rather than require the overpayment be returned, and to update references to now outdated appeals provisions and bring the EWSS appeals process in line with current tax appeals provisions.  I recommend these amendments to the committee.</p></speech>

I welcome that the issue of the proprietary director, which I raised previously with the Minister, has been dealt with.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for a higher rate of EWSS and I welcome that the Minister has brought forward an amendment to increase the payment to &euro;350.  Will the Minister clarify how long that payment will last?  Is it dependent on the level of restrictions in place in the State at any given time?  In circumstances where there are varied restrictions in different regions, will that have any impact on the higher payment?</p></speech>

They will, therefore, remain at these higher levels up to that point.  I can only operate the employment wage subsidy scheme on a national basis.  I do not have the ability to operate this on a regional or county-specific basis.  That is where the CRSS is designed to operate.</p></speech>

Are there powers for the Minister to reintroduce the higher rate or would that require legislative change?  I note what the Minister said regarding the CRSS scheme.  This is, however, separate and complementary to it.  Does the Minister not see the benefit of or merit in being able to vary this scheme on a regional basis?</p></speech>

In the normal operation of the EWSS, flexibilities are open to me regarding how it operates but the higher rates are fixed in legislation until the end of January next year.  I will take stock of this issue as we approach that point and make further decisions about the EWSS.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about county-specific or regional-specific schemes, the reason we introduced the CRSS was to try to have a measure in place that will be specific to different geographical areas of the country.  I anticipate this will continue to play a role in supporting businesses that are subject to higher levels of public health guidance than business in other parts of the country.  The EWSS and TWSS are nationwide schemes and I do not have flexibility with regard to those schemes.  I am concerned about how it would be possible to operate such a scheme unless it is nationwide.</p></speech>

He does not have this power because he decided to introduce the scheme in a manner that does not give him such a power.  There is a way around that.  The fact is he introduced the higher rates which, as I said, are welcome.  He had set his face against doing that, however.  Sinn F&eacute;in argued for months that the rate paid under the scheme was too low.  Unfortunately, we had to have severe restrictions imposed for health purposes, which necessitated legislative change.  That shows that this has not been thought through.  There is an issue here.  The Minister should have allowed for change on a regional basis and the option to introduce the higher rate at a given point in time.</p> <p>  The CRSS is in operation, and we are legislating here for a higher rate of the EWSS.  The schemes will be complementary.  If there is a severe lockdown in the first quarter of next year, businesses will need to avail of both schemes again.  That will not be possible in the case of one of them without legislative change.  It demonstrates a lack of foresight, planning and preparation that it would require the Oireachtas to come together and pass what could possibly be deemed emergency legislation to allow this to happen in circumstances where none of us knows what restrictions could apply to the Houses of the Oireachtas at that point.  It is a mistake not to provide the scope to reintroduce this.</p> <p>  Naturally, I am not in favour of giving the Minister these kinds of powers and would normally take the contrary view that the matter should go before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are not, however, in normal times and we need the ability to be able to reintroduce and turn these supports on and off in line with other restrictions.  As I said, the fact is that the CRSS will run complementary to this during the period to December and January because it is needed at this point.  Both schemes are needed and may, unfortunately, be needed at some point in the future.  Without legislative change, however, the power will not be available to provide anything but the low rate of &euro;203 to these businesses.  That is a mistake.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I reject entirely the idea that this has not been thought through.  This is a very effective scheme which has saved hundreds of thousands of jobs.  As the economy opens up and public health guidance improves, it is absolutely necessary that we begin to reduce the level of subsidy available as otherwise we will end up with a scheme that is still running when the need for it has lessened.  That would create huge affordability issues for the Minister for Finance of the day.  We reduced the subsidy when the economy was opening and when, unfortunately, we had to close parts of the economy again, we increased the subsidy.  That is good policy.  Even in the current legal framework, I had the ability to increase the subsidy to this level before these amendments to the Finance Bill were tabled, let alone accepted, as I hope they will be.  In making those points, I also acknowledge, in the interests of fairness, the support the Deputy has afforded to this scheme.</p></speech>

I am fully conscious that these measures are under the management control of the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>The legislation has probably been pushed to its outer limits in allowing for payments that are in excess of the upper limits of what has actually been legislated for.  This is appropriate because there was political consensus, not only from the Government, in the form of a commitment to deal with this in future legislation, but also from the Opposition in supporting the measures and the direction of travel regarding what the Minister wanted to do.  I cannot understand why somebody would challenge it but if there were a legal challenge, we could be into difficulty.  This is the whole point.  This is the core area I was suggesting.</p><p> There is no provision in the Bill to turn on higher rates of the EWSS if we go to level 5 again in the future.  That is the problem.  It is a fact that the Minister does not have the ability to turn it on or turn it off.  We could all be at level 2 in a matter of weeks but the supports will continue to run to the end of January.  I am not against this, I support it but I believe the supports are too low even at less restrictive times.  The point is that we could be at level 5 again in March and the Minister has no ability to do this without introducing legislation.  Even allowing Revenue to pay these at higher rates requires legislative change at a given point.  This is my contention with regard to it not being thought out.  It is not that the scheme is not worthy.  The scheme is worthy and we have been arguing for additional support for the scheme.  What is not thought out is that we do not know where we are going to be and, therefore, we do not have the flexibility in the scheme to increase the payments again because the payments will reduce as we, hopefully, enter a period of fewer restrictions at the end of January.  We may need them again in February or March and this would be impossible without legislative change.  This is where I contend this has not been thought out.</p></speech>

I think we had agreed on 16 December.  That date is timely because it gives the new chairperson and the members of the task force time to examine all the issues.  I propose that Brian MacCraith, who is the chairperson of the task force, be invited in.  We should also have in Colm Henry, the HSE lead, and Professor Butler from the Royal College of Physicians Ireland.  She has been excellent.</p> <p>  The vaccine will be important and significant in the battle against Covid-19.  There are many exciting developments in this area.  This will pose a challenge in terms of distribution and it will be important to have the infrastructure in place.  Let us consider the flu vaccine this year.  We have 1.3 million doses.  However, for Covid-19 we will need 3.3 million doses at least.  There will be advance purchase agreements with several of these companies.  This is the biggest number of doses of vaccine that will ever be administered in the history of the State.  Given its scale, I imagine we will need pop-up centres for administration.  I am unsure whether general practitioners and pharmacists have the ability to roll this out as quickly as it needs to be done.  There may be a need to recruit staff and train up staff and so on.  This is why it is timely for us to be dealing with it at that meeting.</p> <p>  It is important that we get this right so that, come December, the bones of a plan are in place when the task force representatives come before the committee.  Can we give them a heads-up as quickly as we can about that session?  These are the types of conversations we want to have with them.</p></speech>

We got a submission from the Irish Association of Social Workers on adult safeguarding.  It is an important issue because it relates to the ability of the association to examine cases in nursing homes.  Several members of this committee who were members of the Covid-19 committee raised this issue previously.  I thought it was an excellent submission.  It is something we should look at in the new year because a Bill is already in existence.  It was progressed through the Seanad and is in the legislative programme.  The Government is looking at a different Bill or maybe it is the same Bill.  Anyway, the submission called for adult safeguarding to be put on a statutory footing and the possibility of an independent statutory agency to deal with this to be considered.</p> <p>  This is a major issue and one that the Minister for Health could work with us on.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, directly on this.  He is willing to work with the committee.  It would be good for this committee to advance that issue for patient safety reasons.</p></speech>

I hope everyone can all hear me.  My thanks to the committee for inviting us today via video link to provide an update on the construction progress of the children's hospital project.</p> <p>  I was appointed as chief officer in September 2019 and I am also the Accounting Officer for the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  My colleague, Phelim Devine, is here.  He was appointed project director in October 2019.</p> <p>  We already submitted an opening statement but in the interests of time I propose to simply share some of key points.  Mr. Devine will deal with several photographs to give members a more tangible view of the progress being made on the site.</p> <p>  The first point to which I wish to draw people's attention relates to the programme timeline and project delays.  The Tallaght outpatient and urgent care centre project is approximately seven months behind schedule.  The current estimate for substantial completion is September 2021.</p> <p>  Approximately one year ago, the last time we were before the Joint Committee on Health, we advised the committee that the main contractor on the national children's hospital project at the St. James's campus was behind schedule on the construction works.  In March this year, when the main contractor closed the site as a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, the delay on the national children's hospital project had increased to approximately six months.  The Government's Covid-19 restrictions on construction lasted for a period of seven weeks.  Construction work was permitted to recommence from 18 May.  However, despite our ongoing efforts and the fact that the vast majority of construction sites throughout the country opened when restrictions were lifted, the contractor did not reopen the new children's hospital construction site until 13 July, leading to a further seven weeks of delay.</p> <p>  I wish to add that the contractor has not provided a valid works programme for the NCH project that is in line with its contractual obligations.  The development board is dealing with this via the mechanisms allowed to us through the contract.  The primary mechanism is that we are withholding 15% of moneys certified for payment every month to the contractor.</p> <p>  I will comment on costs and cost projections.  While there has been a delay as regards execution, the contractor has been extremely assertive in terms of claims for additional payments.  Where the contractor is entitled to costs under the contract, the development board has been paying and will continue to pay the contractor.  However, where we believe there is no entitlement, we are using all mechanisms available in the contract to defend these claims and protect the public purse.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board executive is actively interrogating the programmes provided by the contractor and evaluating all current and potential cost pressures on the project.  This work has been our highest priority in recent months and continues to be.  The issues around the programme, timeline and claims have been highlighted on an ongoing basis to our stakeholders in the children's hospital project and the programme board, which oversees the project.</p><p>Once this current review is completed it will shared, first, with our board and then provided to the project oversight group.  This morning, we will endeavour to answer all questions.  However, members will understand some matters are before the court and some matters may be commercially sensitive, may prejudice our possibilities going forward or negatively impact our ability to defend the public purse in the future.</p><p> I will hand over to Mr. Phelim Devine who will talk the committee through a visual update on the project.</p></speech>

Although at a slower pace than projected, the construction works have progressed since we addressed this committee in November 2019.  This slide demonstrates that construction works are well advanced across the 12-acre site and illustrates the sheer scale of the development under way.  The structural frame currently at its highest level, level five to the south, will reach level four across the whole site early in the new year, with topping out at level seven expected early in quarter 2 of 2021.</p> <p>  The next five slides illustrate the progress that has been made in the past year.  This is the view from last year where we were at basement level for the Donnelly part to the north of the site.  This is where we are now, topping out at level 4.  To the centre of the site, last year we were at foundation level and now we are at level 3, with much of the steel work well progressed.  To the south, last year we were at levels 2 and 4 and now we are level 5 with the atrium being infilled-over with steelwork, which will form the new fourth level garden.</p> <p>  The next slide is of the main concourse at lower ground and ground floor level.  The concourse will be the heart of the building and will facilitate intuitive way-finding to all departments.  To the left is one of the three features stair and lift cores that are doing into the concourse.  To the centre is the prefabricated M&amp;E modules and partitions that are being installed as part of the fit-out works under way across the building.  To the right is the joinery and manufacture that are the staff bases to be used at levels four and six in the wards and also wardrobes and cupboards for use in critical care.  </p> <p>  The next slide shows many of the glazing types that are under way in the building.  We are using high efficient glass across the hospital.  This image illustrates that the insulation of the efficient, sustainable mechanical electrical plant is progressing well.  This will provide specialist ventilation, for example, to theatres and critical care and lighting, heating, cooling and medical gasses across the hospital.</p> <p>  The final slide shows the physical mock-ups that are nearing completion, which will demonstrate to the key stakeholders the quality of the design that is being delivered for the patients, their families and the staff of the hospital.  We extend an invite to this committee to see these physical mock-ups and the site next year when, hopefully, the impacts of Covid-19 abate.  That concludes our presentation.</p></speech>

I invite Ms Eilish Hardiman from Children's Health Ireland, who is very welcome to the committee, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleague Dr. Ciara Martin, clinical director and consultant paediatric emergency medicine in CHI.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to provide the committee with an update from the organisation's perspective on the new children&rsquo;s hospital project as requested in its invitation.  CHI is client to the NPHDB for this capital project and my update to the committee is in accordance with this remit.</p> <p>  To give some background, CHI was established as a statutory entity in January 2019 to govern and manage acute paediatric services for the greater Dublin area as well as all national paediatric services, some of which are on an all-island basis.  This resulted in the children's hospitals at Temple Street, Tallaght and Crumlin merging into CHI to deliver healthcare to Ireland's children in preparation for the move into new children&rsquo;s hospital.  In July 2019, we also opened the first of our two paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres at Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown. </p> <p>  Regarding our services in CHI, 334,500 children and adolescents were treated by our 3,614 staff in 2019.  Despite this volume of activity, more timely and greater access to paediatric services remains our single greatest challenge as a health service provider.  CHI has several infrastructure and workforce constraints contributing to our waiting list and access challenges, especially relating to theatres, radiology, critical care, laboratory and outpatients, and these are all addressed in the new children&rsquo;s hospital. </p> <p>  Covid-19 has hampered our ability to deliver the same or an increased level of activity in 2020.  CHI has returned its activity levels to, on average, 90% of the 2019 month-on-month activity after an initial Covid-19 period of reduced activity earlier this year.  This was achieved through putting up some prefabricated spaces and from repurposing spaces such as playrooms, family lounges and other communal spaces in our children&rsquo;s hospitals into clinical spaces to accommodate the beds displaced from our multiple occupancy rooms - those are rooms that have two to six beds - to meet infection prevention and control guidance of 2 m distancing between beds.  We have seen a decrease in our emergency department presentations but an increase in our mental health presentations. </p> <p>  This pandemic has demonstrated more than ever the need for the children&rsquo;s hospital.  CHI is currently assessing the impact on services for children and adolescents of any extension to the build programme.</p> <p>  The NPHDB have advised that they expect building of the second paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre based at Tallaght to be completed by September 2021.  CHI is planning an eight-week operational commissioning period before opening services in this new building by the end of 2021. </p> <p>  Regarding Connolly and Tallaght hospitals, our experience of opening services in a brand new spacious and child-friendly building in CHI at Connolly has given us a taste of what is to come at Tallaght and the new children's hospital.  It has also demonstrated how a new building can facilitate services compliant with Covid-19 guidance.  Our new facility at Connolly has allowed CHI to accelerate some of our plans to integrate and reform services during Covid-19 such as an integrated orthopaedic fracture clinic serving all patients in CHI.</p> <p>  The overwhelmingly positive feedback from children, adolescents and families that have availed of services in our new facility at Connolly is testament to the need for this investment and the benefits of implementing contemporary models in healthcare.  We are already reaping the positive benefits of more efficient provision of care and an effective patient experience with 97% of our patients attending urgent care there being seen within 15 minutes.  Since January 2020, we have treated 5,792 patients at our urgent care centre and have seen 9,217 patients at the outpatients department. </p> <p> As client for the project, the crisis and challenges in healthcare created by the Covid-19 pandemic has only magnified the difficulties our patients, their families and our staff experience daily in delivering acute paediatric services to Ireland&rsquo;s sickest children in outdated facilities in our existing hospitals with their poor digital infrastructure and old equipment.  I emphasise the criticality of these two new buildings, their digital infrastructure, modern equipment and enhanced workforce, which are at the very core of our plans to enhance clinical outcomes and develop services provided to Ireland sickest children and adolescents. </p> <p>  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will expand the physical capacity and type of facilities needed to increase activity and reduce waiting times in all paediatric services to help tackle current and future challenges in child health. </p> <p>  I wish to express my sincere appreciation to our staff for their continued dedication and support over the past number of months.  We look forward to walking through the doors of the new hospital and delivering care there.  In the meantime, we remain committed to reforming our services and prioritising investment to support improvements in the delivery of services and to addressing the challenges that exist within paediatric services.  My colleague, Dr. Ciara Martin, and I are happy to take any questions the members may have.</p></speech>

I thank them for the work that they have done in their various capacities and the work which they are about to do, as they say in all business.</p> <p>  Regarding the children's hospital, Mr. Gunning is probably best positioned to answer this question: how is the project progressing at the moment?  I note there is a dispute management process in place and that the issue has ended up in the High Court.  To what degree does he envisage the project being delayed by the failure to resolve disputes and the contractor being happy to go to court?</p><p> It is a year since we last met our guests.  Have the costs remained in line with what was indicated then or have they accelerated?  How many issues have been referred to the High Court and why were they referred?  I presume it was because there was a failure to reach agreement and resolve the problems under the dispute management process.  Can the witnesses also outline how the Blanchardstown special outreach department is operating?  This matter has already been referred to.  Is the unit operating as anticipated?  Have there been any snags?  Is the unit working efficiently and effectively and it is delivering services to the satisfaction of the witnesses?  How do the staff feel about the unit?  What is the difference from the point of view of job satisfaction?  How are the staff responding to the new situation?</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to respond.</p></speech>

Starting with the issue of progress, let me speak about Tallaght.  We expect the substantial completion of the Tallaght facility in September 2021, which is seven months behind the contractual completion date of February next.  Turning to the completion of the national children's hospital on the St. James's campus, the contract date for completion is August 2022.  It is fair to say that we have no expectation at this time that that date will be met.  In the absence of a compliant programme from the contractor, it is a challenge for the development board to state specifically when that facility will be completed.  We are working closely with the contractor to identify and progress that issue.  We have been working on this matter for more than a year, we have had significant engagement on it and we really need to move it forward.  That element of the project is certainly clearly in delay and that message has been clearly communicated.</p> <p>  Turning to the issue of costs, the cost budget for the completion of the project, that is, the approved budget, is &euro;1.433 billion.  We are currently operating within that budgetary scope.  However, it is fair to say that there are considerable pressures on that budget.  Referring back to my point in respect of delays, time on any project tends to impact on costs and this project will not be an exception.  In respect of other matters, we have a significant number of claims from the contractor for moneys additional to the agreed contract price.  We are defending these claims.  I reiterate that in circumstances where the contractor is entitled to additional payments, we are making and will continue to make such payments.</p> <p>  On the High Court, and in order to correct the perception, I must state that the development board has referred a particular issue to the High Court.  This was done when the dispute mechanisms within the contract were exhausted and the issue had not been satisfactorily resolved.  The matter in respect of which we have issued proceedings relates to the contractor's position that the instruction to commence the phase B works, namely, works above ground, was invalid.  We cannot say a great deal about this.  We obviously disagree with that position.  The contractor is completing the works and we are paying the contractor for the completion of the works, so we would say that it is somewhat odd to consider that the instruction is invalid.  However, that issue is before the High Court.  Regarding the Deputy's question about whether there are other issues before the High Court, that is the only issue before the High Court now.</p> <p>  That is a summary of the key issues Deputy Durkan asked about.  The unit in Blanchardstown has opened and I will hand over to Ms Hardiman to address how it is operating and the various questions from the Deputy in that regard, such as how the staff and others feel about it.</p></speech>

Last year, when we opened the paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre, we had set out to deliver the model of care, namely, to open an urgent care centre, to have a general paediatric clinic close to home, supported by psychology services, dieticians, multidisciplinary teams and also to have orthopaedic fracture clinics.  Those were the core services which we were going to run in Connolly.</p> <p>  This year, because the infrastructure of the building is new and spacious and there are so many single rooms, we were able to develop many services within the CHI at the Connolly campus.  We have been able to run additional clinics for which we had not planned but that have supported children's care across all of CHI in Dublin.  We are delivering some of the cardiac clinics, pain services and allergy clinics.  We have been able to use our radiology department to take some of the pressures off of GP referrals into radiology departments in Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght hospitals.  All those children were able to come over to Connolly during the time of Covid.  They come into our brand new building in a very safe way, have their X-rays and then leave.  We are up to a situation where approximately 300 children come in every week for radiology services in Connolly.  I think we have exceeded expectation there.</p> <p>  Our urgent care centre operates five days a week now, but our plan is to run it seven days a week.  In respect of running it as an urgent care centre, we were hoping to see approximately 70 to 90 children a day.  Last winter, before Covid happened, when we had busy accident and emergency departments across the city, within our opening hours of up to 8 p.m., we were already seeing 50 or 60 children a day.  We are very happy with that situation.  We have also been able to show that our model of care there is working.  When children and their families come in the door, they are seen by a clinician and triaged within 15 minutes.  Since the day we opened, more than 95% of our children have been seen within 15 minutes of arrival.  Their length of stay with us has come down from about three hours to approximately one and a half.</p></speech>

Before we finish, what was the main reason for the delay in getting on site and bringing the Tallaght project up to speed more quickly?  How has the guaranteed maximum price contract affected the cost of the project?</p></speech>

The guaranteed maximum price is an element that leads to the total of &euro;1.433 billion.  That is made up of several items.  As I said, we are currently operating within that budget.  The committee will be aware, probably from our discussion last year, that a significant number of exclusions are outside of that guaranteed maximum price.  We discussed at some length last year the issue of inflation, which remains outside of that guaranteed maximum price.

As I mentioned, we are operating within that currently.  However, as I also mentioned, there is significant upward pressure on the budget given the potential delays within the project.</p></speech>

He must have some estimate.  This is the Joint Committee on Health.  This is a big project, the source of many controversies through the years, so if it is not going to be August 2022, does Mr. Gunning expect it will be any time before the end of this year?</p></speech>

We have also established that there is at least one breach of the contract and that there is a penalty in place in terms of the 15% of moneys invoiced every month.  Mr. Gunning also says, "In response to the contractor's reported delays and lack of compliant works programme, that...the executive are interrogating the programmes provided by the contractor and evaluating all current and potential cost pressures on the project".  In terms of those costs, Mr. Gunning goes on to say, "Since the commencement of this project there have been hundreds of claims for hundreds of millions of euro."  He must be a bit more specific than that.  He cannot come before the committee and give us a range of hundreds of millions of euro.  There has to be some estimation.  Is it &euro;200 million?  Is it &euro;400 million?  Is it &euro;600 million?  Mr. Gunning must be much clearer with us in terms of the estimation of what those amounts are.</p></speech>

Mr. Gunning also says that the dispute resolution process has been activated across a range of levels to deal with issues such as employers' representative, project board, conciliation and adjudication.  They have all been used.  There is one case before the High Court.  Mr. Gunning gave some indication earlier as to what that was about, which is that the instruction to commence phase B works is in dispute because the contractor claims it is invalid.  Is that to do with design?</p></speech>

I think he could go an awful lot further and say that it is a mess.  It is bogged down in delays, controversy and escalating costs.  The board is not in a position today to give us a revised timeframe.  It is not in a position today to give us the total costs.  We were told before that it would be &euro;1.7 billion.  I would expect that it would be far north of that.  The project is now bogged down in a High Court case.  We are being told the case will commence in December.  We do not know how long it will take.  It is a very messy situation where it seems that relationships have completely broken down between the contractor and the board to the point where the board was even considering terminating the contract.</p><p>This is deeply unsatisfactory.  The people we need to be conscious of are the children.  This is about providing a hospital for children, yet we have no idea when it will be completed.  With the construction delay, it may even be 2024 before we see any patients treated in the hospital.  It is a complete and absolute mess from start to finish.  Everything I have heard today compounds that.  The witnesses are not able to give us basic information or any idea as to when the project will be built or an estimate of the costs.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is in the High Court and every single facet of the dispute-resolution process that could be used is being used.  It is unsatisfactory.  The witnesses will have to come back here in the new year with much more information for this committee. </p></speech>

I seek some details on when the project will be completed.  We are very excited about the development, which is in Dublin South-West.  I am particularly pleased to hear about it.  I commend those concerned on achieving 90% service capacity in Blanchardstown, which is some achievement in the context.  I ask the delegates to express our appreciation.</p> <p>  My questions are for the chief executive, who has been silent.  The other officials have been fielding the questions.  The opening statement really made no reference to the delay in the principal project, the national children's hospital.  It was silent on anything to do with that.  I accept it cannot be said when the hospital will be completed, given the conundrum the board is in.  Could I come at it from another angle, however?  How far behind is the contractor?</p></speech>

The Deputy will note from my statement that we are currently undertaking an assessment of the impact of any delay in the project on services.  That is not completed.  Regarding the question as to when the building will be completed, we appreciate and understand there is a desire to know the impact of any delay.

Our greatest capacity challenges currently lie with theatres, radiology and some of our outpatient services.  We have already secured funding, through the winter plan, to increase some of those services.  That is what Dr. Martin was referring to.  We are optimising the facilities and using them better.  We are sweating the new assets a little more.  We are fortunate because they are able to facilitate the Covid-19 guidance.</p></speech>

In other words, before Covid where did the board anticipate it would be by November 2020?</p></speech>

Before Covid, in March of this year, the project was approximately six months behind schedule.  Then there were further delays, including the seven weeks of the Covid period and a further seven weeks after the date for the reopening of construction sites, 18 May, when the contractor failed to return to work, adding further to the delay.  Those two periods, added to the accumulated delay in March, would give a clear indication as to where the project was and is currently in terms of the accumulated delay.</p></speech>

We need to go through a process here.  We have a detailed process under way and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on whether it would be at least a year and put out another date.  I indicated in earlier questions that I anticipate that we would have a new date available.  We would like to have that date available but I cannot and do not want to offer another date right here right now because my concern is that it does not have the appropriate rigour behind it, which it will have when announced.</p></speech>

Regarding the GMP programme, the contractual programme, to the end of October 2020 the GMP projected payments would have amounted to &euro;545 million.  The actual payment was &euro;308 million, which indicates a variance of &euro;237 million.  Therefore the actual payments to the contractor are 43% below the projected amount, which indicates in financial terms how far we are currently behind schedule.</p></speech>

I visited the site at various times during the Covid period.  I was taken aback by how few workmen were on site.  Mr. Gunning has my sympathies regarding BAM.  I wonder whether there is a role for the Construction Industry Federation but obviously we also have a duty to taxpayers.  I acknowledge that Mr. Gunning absolutely appreciates the frustration.  I am not gunning for him this morning &mdash; pardon the pun; I am just trying to get some answers.  How many BAM employees, contractors or subcontractors are working on site now by comparison with the number the board expected, in the last valid work plan, to be working on site at this time?</p></speech>

Therefore, there are 900 operatives on the site.  Going back to what Mr. Gunning said about the GMP, or the contract programme, if BAM were operating according to the contract programme, it would have from 1,600 to 1,900 staff at this juncture.  We expect that the figure of 1,000 staff will rise in the new year to a much higher level, up towards 1,200 or 1,400 and up to a peak of about 1,950 on site in the middle of next year.</p></speech>

During the seven-week closure period and the period that followed, when BAM remained off site, we received a number of what BAM regarded as offers or requests for additional payment to cover Covid costs and other costs.</p><p>We have not acceded to the payment of any of those additional costs.  However, this now finds its way through the dispute resolution process.  There are various claims in that in respect of Covid-19 and that process is very much active and under way but we have not acceded to any additional payments in respect of Covid.</p></speech>

This project is in trouble.  The board is tied up in complexities.  Everybody's ambition and objective is to complete it.

The position we are in is regrettable.  There are challenges but at times like this we all reconnect with the purpose.  Our job is to design, build, commission and hand over this building but our purpose is not to have a building.  Our purpose is to provide the highest standards of health care to the children of Ireland.  I am extremely proud of the staff we have working both directly for us on the NPHDB team and the people who work indirectly for us, including the design team, our specialist advisers and others, and the passion and the professionalism they show in the face of significant challenge in dealing with trying to progress this project.  One thing we would very much appreciate would be for the entire committee to come to our site and to see up close and personal what is happening, the challenges we are dealing with and the progress being made.  There is still progress being made but not the progress we would like to see.  That would be my single request to the Deputy and to his colleagues on the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. Gunning might think about other things the committee might be able to do.  I have a question.  Did the board suggest to BAM that it should apply for the Government Covid-19 support payment?  Was that ever discussed with the contractor?</p></speech>

Given the nature of the children's hospital project and the nature of the contract, this particular contract is outside of the scope for those particular arrangements.  Nonetheless, we have left the door open for the contractor to make submissions to us.  We have assured the contractor that if they were to make realistic and reasonable submissions we would certainly share those with the Government, assuming the development board was in a position to get behind or feel comfortable with those particular proposals.  We have not yet had any particular specific requests from the contractor at this time.</p></speech>

I was a little surprised when Mr. Gunning, in reply to an earlier question, said that the most helpful thing the committee could do would be to visit the site.  I am sure that would be an interesting visit but we are much more interested in getting up close and personal in respect to the fundamentals of this entire project.  We would like some rigour on that.  It is disappointing when we have the phrase in an opening statement that there have been hundreds of claims for hundreds of millions of euro.  That kind of sweeping, throwaway statement is not acceptable.  We should not have to dig down into these things to get proper answers.  Mr. Gunning talked about rigour.  We would welcome some rigour in respect of this project.  Can he tell us what is the working assumption now in respect of the estimated completion date and the estimated total cost?</p></speech>

The modification in question shall not exceed 50% of the value ... </blockquote> <p>My question relates to the contractor, additional legal fees or any service involved.  Is Mr. Gunning satisfied that the contract currently operating is in line with that statutory constraint?  If it is not, why is that the case?

I want to get one question in before my time is up.  As I just pointed out, healthcare systems require a large interaction with proprietary systems and commissioning, more so than most projects, both in building components and that evidence-based design piece where one needs medical professionals to come in and interact with things.  Significant delays will be quite likely to have an impact because one is dealing with proprietary aspects of building components which must be stored.  Are they being stored on site?  Significant delays in the project system, and the fact the contractor is not giving the board a compliant work programme, will have huge impacts down the line in terms of dealing with building components on site or securing them.  These are large building components that must be delivered at particular times.  What kind of an impact is that having on the work programme?  What is the contractor telling the witnesses in terms of those proprietary systems?  Is there a financial impact to those delays as they knock on to the next contractor?</p></speech>

Many of the key components of the building are part of the overall construction contract, that is, the big mechanical and electrical plant, specialist systems such as ventilation systems, boilers and all that sort of stuff which are part of the technical commissioning.  Perhaps, what the Deputy is indicating here is the specialist equipment that is put in as part of the construction contract.  The development board, working with the CHI, controls that and we are working closely with the contractor on the procurement of those elements so they dovetail in at the exact right time in terms of protecting the critical path and completion of the project.</p></speech>

We are fairly advanced in terms of our equipping programme and we are in a good position in terms of meeting all those dates.</p></speech>

Children's Health Ireland has released some of its key staff to be seconded to the development board to work on the equipping.  It is really important that element of it has close working because of the interdependencies between our staff, the equipment and our patients in the building.  We are, therefore, releasing staff to work and lead on some of that equipping programme and we will have a commissioning plan which will identify those significant interdependencies, which are quite a large element of the work that will take place just prior to substantial completion and, obviously, operational commissioning.</p></speech>

I know a thousand people turn up from BAM and all its subcontractors on the site every day and go in there with the purpose of doing a good job.  There is no doubt about that.  I know there are committed people in CHI and in our own area who are working hard to deliver this project.  I believe, however, it is fair to say the contractor has been under-performing as regards project execution and has clearly been assertive regarding claims.  That is what is regrettable, in my opinion.</p></speech>

During that period, BAM made several requests for additional payments.  It was really only on 10 July that the contractor indicated it would restart the construction works but was extremely reluctant to do so, and again, requested an additional payment.  It is a credit to the team and development board that they successfully withstood all this pressure for additional payments, which were clearly outside of what was allowed for within the contract.</p></speech>

Mr. Gunning can dress it up whatever way he likes but that appears to be the reality, which is a shocking state of affairs in terms of the board's relationship with the contractor.

In his opening statement, Mr. Gunning referred to hundreds of claims for hundreds of millions of euro and said he had to significantly beef up his own staff and support structure.  Did that significant beefing up include hiring outside consultants at extra cost to the taxpayer?</p></speech>

The design was complete for the purpose of agreeing the guaranteed maximum price in March and August 2018.  Once the phase B works commenced on site, what Mr. Gunning described as issued-for-construction information was completed quite recently.  That is the finalisation of the design in terms of its final dimensioning, which absolutely relies on the input of the contractor-supply chain.  Somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 issued-for-construction drawings have been issued.  I do not have the exact figure, but I can come back and clarify it.</p></speech>

We keep going around the end point and when the hospital will be opened.  As has been mentioned previously in the committee, this is taxpayers' money and the public has a vested interest in when the hospital will open.  I think the public may be coming to the end of its tether hearing about the extraordinary cost of this with no end point in sight.  Mr. Gunning has said that because he does not have the programme from the contractor, he is not exactly sure when the end point will be.  What actions will he take to rectify this situation?  I understand the complexity of building a project of this scale and that it is somewhat of a moveable feast.  What actions will he take with the contractor to get to this end point?  What will he do so that when he comes back here in January, we are not all grilling him again over when it will be done?  What actions will he take to try to get this project to completion?</p></speech>

We have a contract with the contractor.  The actions we can take are prescribed and set out in that.  It is critical that we get this compliant programme from the contractor.  We are deploying the mechanism within the contract to do that, which is the withholding of 15% of all payments.  In parallel with that we are engaged in dialogue with the contractor, bringing the contract issue towards a conclusion.  That is a crucial point.  Once we get that clarified, we will be in a position to make some significant progress in arriving at a much better picture of the projected cost outturn.  Obviously, cost and time are very closely tied on any project, but even more so on this project.</p> <p>  Defending the claims is really important.  As I mentioned, there is more than &euro;200 million in claims.  We have put a significant amount of effort into this area.  In the time I have been on the job, which is just over a year, we have really turned up and I think we are doing quite a good job in that area.  However, I cannot give any absolute guarantees that we will not face some challenges there because I am sure we will.  These are the primary issues we are progressing.  At the same time one of my jobs is to work closely with stakeholders to ensure that stakeholders, like Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman and the team at CHI, are fully up to speed on where we are with the project and ensuring we have high levels of co-operation on the areas that are interdependent, which are around commissioning and service activation and moving forward.  Those are the issues on my action list.</p></speech>

That information should frame what I want to say in the next few moments.</p> <p>  Mr. Gunning said in his contribution that the board last appeared before this committee last November and stated at the time that there was a four-month lag with the project.  After Covid and the coming months, what is the completion date for the hospital?  Will he give us an indicative timeframe for completion?  Will completion be on a phased basis or will the project open and be able to function as an entire hospital at a certain point?</p></speech>

As we said earlier in this discussion, we expect to clarify and give further guidance to the committee and other stakeholders on the projected substantial completion date, which is the day when building work is completed.  We hope to be in a position to provide that early in the new year, assuming that we get some input about the contractor's programme, which is currently missing.</p> <p>  The commissioning and other aspects of the hospital are the responsibility of Eilish Hardiman and the folks in Children's Health Ireland.  Perhaps she wants to deal with that particular question.</p></speech>

That goes for any building project, whether it is a home extension, a new build house or the biggest hospital in Ireland.  Surely that is part of weekly discourse.  I again ask: when will the project be completed?  I do not think it is a detail that Mr. Gunning would need to search too much for.  I am not digging deep into figures; I am asking for a simple completion date.</p></speech>

However, as I have explained earlier, we have absolute clarity on a number of the work streams.  What we do not have clarity on is the build programme, which is the responsibility of the contractor.  The reason we do not have clarity on that is because the contractor has failed to provide us with a compliant programme that sets out its responsibilities, activities, works and its substantial completion date.  That piece of information is absent.  I really do not want to put further dates into the public domain based on guesswork and speculation without having that information.  There is too much at stake in terms of this project for me to add to that and I certainly have no plans to do so.  Our intention is to be able to address that question early in 2021.</p></speech>

Will he give us a few examples of what kind of claims BAM comes to the board with?  What kind of dialogue is there?  Who is the direct contact person day on day on site, wearing the hard and engaging with BAM people?  How does it get to the point that BAM comes before the board with costs that run into the hundreds of millions of euro?  How have costs spiralled?  People really want to know that because the figure seems to change by the day.</p></speech>

It is not something we can control.  All we can control is how we respond to those and how we defend the public purse.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has mentioned, and I answered earlier, there are in excess of 600 individual claims with more than &euro;200 million.  I would characterise that there are some quite large claims of the tens of millions of euro and a large number of smaller ones for less trivial items.  We are focused on, and some of the larger items are going through, the conciliation process and I guess we are in the middle.  That is where things currently stand.</p></speech>

Once claims are submitted and substantiated, there is a process that must be gone through.  That is how the process works.  It works through the various steps from the determination by the employers' representative.  If a claim is not accepted by the contractor or by either party at that point, it goes to the project board, which is a formal meeting of representatives from both organisations under the chairmanship of the standing conciliator currently.  If it is not accepted there, it is referred to conciliation.  If it is not accepted in conciliation, the next stop is the High Court.  That is the process set out in the contract.  We have many conciliations, many claims currently going through that process.</p></speech>

Walking past or driving past on the Luas, an array of portakabins can be seen where there are offices with BAM staff and a number of our design teams located at the site.  On the site we have a quantity surveyor, QS, team, the architecture team, the structural engineering team, and the mechanical and electrical design team.  Each of the teams has its own resident architects or engineers who are supervising the works.  I will ask my colleague, Phelim Devine, to give some more detail as he is responsible for the day-to-day activities on the site and can answer that more completely.</p></speech>

The contract is administered through an employer's representative, so she holds meetings fortnightly with the development board, the contractor and the design team.  Site progress meetings happen fortnightly.  There are myriad weekly meetings for direct engagement across myriad work streams that happen on the site.  There is huge engagement on this project involving hundreds of people.</p> <p>  In terms of overseeing the works, we have our own internal team that oversees what our design team does on our behalf.  There is circa 15 quality inspector teams on the site looking at the quality of the project in association with our own people on our own team.</p></speech>

What I can say is that there are a number of large conciliations currently active and going to go through the process.  I am afraid that I cannot say an awful lot about them.</p><p>Smaller conciliations concern, for example, disagreements around costs for a piece of equipment, a structural issue, the specification of a wall finish or a piece of joinery.  The discussion in those cases tends to be around whether the costs should be borne by the contractor or the employer.  Our view is clear on that, depending on the situation.  The difference between the parties could be a few thousand euro or less.  Nonetheless, we are conscious that this is public money and our responsibility in these matters is to defend the public purse in every sense.</p><p> I hope this has given the committee a flavour without-----</p></speech>

As someone who has acted in arbitration cases in a legal capacity, I am familiar with the dispute resolution processes with which the board is dealing.</p> <p>  People might not like me saying this, but I have engaged with the developers of a children's hospital in Ontario that is costing $3.8 billion in Canadian currency, or &euro;2.6 billion.  The hospital is a similar-sized development.  It would be worth people's time to consider that development in light of the scale of our children's hospital.</p> <p>  The previous Oireachtas health committee was invited to visit the Dublin site.  If I am correct, the then Chairman, former Deputy Michael Harty, and I were the only two who did so.  I am open to correction on that, as there may have been other members present, but that is my recollection.  I would look forward to visiting again.</p> <p>  I wish to address the 600 or so claims, which the board says amount to &euro;200 million.  I am concerned about that figure.  My understanding is that there was to be a bill of quantities provided for the tendering process.  This was certainly to be the case for the contract's second phase.  Is it now the case that the bill of quantities was not adequate for the tendering process and the contract and, as a result, disputes are arising?</p> <p>  If the more than 600 claims amount to &euro;200 million, some claims must be for well in excess of &euro;50,000.  Perhaps Mr. Gunning will outline the types of claim in that regard.  How many of the 600 claims have been resolved?  How many can be resolved before the end of the year?  How many will remain unresolved and go to a more detailed litigation process?  If we are talking about &euro;200 million extra, these 600 claims are not &euro;1,000 each.  Some of them must be substantial sums.  Therefore, there must be a significant variation between what the builders are being asked to do and what they claim they were required to do under the plan and design stage and the bill of quantities.  Mr. Gunning might provide us some details.</p></speech>

There are a small number of large claims for tens of millions of euro going through the conciliation process.  Then there are a large number of claims in the thousands of euro.  We are making a renewed effort with the contractor to try to resolve the ones towards the smaller end and move on.</p></speech>

What substantial change occurred that now allows the builders to claim over &euro;50,000?  It must have been a substantial variation.</p></speech>

There have been a significant number of claims and we will not successfully defend all of them, but we argue that there has not been any significant change in the scope of the project and what we are expecting to build during the course of the project from pre-phase B to the building phase.  That is the position.</p></speech>

A significant issue that arose in the PwC report was the need to put in place a robust change management system.  We have put that in place in respect of signing off on, for example, design changes.  This does not just involve changes that are driving the prices up, though.  We are also focused on opportunities to reduce costs to try to take cost out of the equation, so to speak.  We have a robust sign-off process in place.</p></speech>

It could be something simple, for example, the equipment being installed has changed or been updated.  Have substantial changes needed to be made to the design in order to accommodate the change in what is available?</p></speech>

The answer is "No".  The design has been remarkably stable in terms of major issues and changes.  There have not been many changes.

Have the Covid restrictions forced the contractor to reduce the workforce or are there other reasons for the reduction?</p><p>The plan was to have 4,000 at peak but that is now not physically possible because of the risks with Covid.

The figure of 4,000 was never part of the plan.  The plan was to get to approximately 2,000.  The maximum number of people on site would be 1,900 or 1,950 from the contractor and all of the subcontractors.  At present, as Mr. Devine mentioned earlier, we are up to approximately 1,900 to 2,000 people on the site, so we are a little bit short.</p> <p>  It is fair to say, and I acknowledge, that BAM has done a very good job in terms of implementing its Covid protocols on entry onto the site.  It is constructing mess or hygiene facilities and other services to look after staff members.  I acknowledge the very good work it has done on this.  Now that these facilities are in place, the capacity of the site to take on more workers and allow more people into the site becomes realistic.</p> <p>  I would also like to say that from the board's perspective, the health and safety of all people on site, whether with regard to Covid or the safety of construction sites issues, are of critical importance and we would never want the contractor to take any risks that would in any way impair the health and safety of anyone, from Covid or otherwise.</p></speech>

As Mr. Gunning said, BAM is following all of the HSE protocols in dealing with these cases.  The site has not closed down as a result and BAM has handled the situation, including all of the welfare facilities, very well.  There have been two cases in Tallaght and I do not think any of them are active at present.</p></speech>

I was listening to them in my office and I heard most of the deliberations.  There has been a long history and saga with this project but it is heartening to see the photographic evidence the witnesses have presented on the progress where we can see the physical size of the project and the progress over the past year with the heights of the various parts of the project.  It is heartening to see this, notwithstanding the delays or the inability to give a concluding timescale for the project.  I understand the Covid delays, and every construction site was closed down and there were knock-on effects.  Are the witnesses concerned that BAM has been prioritising other projects and, therefore, not bringing work people onto this site?  They mentioned the figure of 900 work operatives on site and it was planned there would be 1,600.</p> <p>  This time last year, there was a four-month delay which was a six-month delay by the time the Covid lockdown started.  What was the reason for this?  Obviously there were no Covid delays at that stage.  Why exactly was there a delay at that stage?  Has that been ironed out?  It was a four-month delay and by the time the lockdown started it was a six-month delay.</p></speech>

I will start and work backwards.  The main contributor, in our opinion, to the delays that were accumulated were really down to resourcing and resource levels and not hitting the progress targets that were required.  At this time, as of right now, if we were complying with the guaranteed maximum price programme, the concrete and steel frame should be 100% complete, the facade should be approximately 75% complete and the fit-out with the internal partitioning should be almost half complete at this time.  We are not complete with any of these individual items.  The delay in our estimation is down to the challenge the contractors faced in terms of providing resources to the project.</p> <p>  The Senator's initial question was whether it favours other sites as opposed to this one.  I cannot get into speculation and formulate an opinion on this.  I am determined that in this project we stick to the facts.  I do not have information to give an answer one way or the other on this and I hope the Senator will appreciate the frankness of my response on this particular issue.</p></speech>

The reason I ask is I am conscious there are a lot of residents surrounding the site and one of the complaints that many residents associations in the area have is that the site is worked on early.  I presume it is the contractor trying to make up time.  Do the witnesses have any idea what is the official start time?</p></speech>

It is very important that we maintain good relations with all our neighbours in these matters and I will ask Mr. Devine to answer this more specifically.</p></speech>

It has started slightly earlier in some cases and worked beyond 7 p.m. on the strength of these derogations, but it has done this in a consultative manner.</p></speech>

This was my sense because I travelled in and out of St. James's Hospital for about 38 days and there did not seem to be a huge amount of activity on the site.  This is just anecdotal evidence.  There was a lot of concern in the media at that time.  Was that helpful?  There was a "Prime Time" programme on the slowness of the actual building on the site.  Quite a lot of cranes seemed to appear then and we could see floors going up.  Do the witnesses believe that media interest in the site, and perhaps the interest of politicians and taxpayers, has been helpful in moving the building onwards?</p></speech>

The programme for this is complex.  There is, of course, a lot of media interest and we want to reassure people we are fully committed to our purpose of designing, building, equipping and handing over the project to Children's Health Ireland, which will operate it for many years to come.  There is a lot of commentary, much of which is uninformed.  There is a lot of commentary that has some validity.  We want to reach out to make ourselves available to engage with people who want to come and visit, see the project and see exactly what is happening.  We are more than happy to do this.  We would welcome the visits of members of the committee and others who want to do this.  Informed commentary is always welcome.</p></speech>

Again, we are still at a loss - I certainly am and I do not know about other members - about what exactly is causing the delay.  There seemed to be a delay before Covid.  We understand delays during Covid.  Are there delays because of subcontractors not being paid by the main contractor?  Is this causing some difficulty or disruption on the site?</p><p>I know there are changes now post Covid-19.  There are many lorries going through the Davitt Road entrance.  Some lorry drivers maintain there is a delay because of that.  That may be down to health and safety - I do not know.  Anyway, we are not getting a sense of the reason or the main reasons for the delays.  Mr. Gunning said the board is not getting a compliant programme and this is missing from the contractors, but I do not believe we, as a committee, are not getting a sense today of what the problems are and what has caused these problems.</p></speech>

I answered this question earlier.  Our view is really around the resourcing of the project.  There was an earlier question about what it would be today if the contractor was complying with the guaranteed maximum price, GMP, programme.  We would expect the project to be building up soon to 1,900 people on the site.  We have approximately half of that.  I suggest that is a clear metric.  We have also said that we would have expected by now to have the frame, concrete, steel, facade and various other things moved on.  They are nowhere near the level of completion that we would expect.</p> <p>  One further point relates to the payments to the contractor.  We would expect under the GMP project, or contract, that at this stage we would have paid the contractor &euro;545 million.  Instead, we have actually paid &euro;308 million of the total of &euro;900 million.  Instead of being halfway through the project, we are one third of the way through the project.  These are the clear metrics indicating where the challenge lies.  The project will have to be resourced to make significant progress.  That is the challenge.</p></speech>

Cuireann Foras na Gaeilge maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il do Chonradh na Gaeilge chun an obair sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus t&aacute;im s&aacute;sta go bhfuil s&eacute; &aacute; d&eacute;anamh go maith, fi&uacute; amh&aacute;in m&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; ag cur br&uacute; orainn.<br/><br/>Is d&oacute;cha gur ch&oacute;ir a mh&iacute;ni&uacute;, nuair a bh&iacute;omar ag iarraidh an SPG &uacute;r, mar a thugaimid air, a shocr&uacute;, bh&iacute; s&eacute; bunaithe ar bhuis&eacute;ad 2019 a bh&iacute; f&oacute;gartha d&uacute;inn, a bh&iacute; bunaithe ar an mbuis&eacute;ad a bh&iacute; faighte againn in 2016, agus bh&iacute; &euro;4.6 milli&uacute;n n&iacute;os l&uacute; againn n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; againn in 2008.  Bh&iacute;omar ag pl&eacute; leis an mbuis&eacute;ad a bh&iacute; againn ag an am sin nuair a chuireamar &aacute;r gcuid molta&iacute; amach.<br/><br/>N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; i gceist riamh againn an deontas a ghearradh do dhuine ar bith.  Is sc&eacute;im ioma&iacute;ochta oscailte &iacute; agus cuirtear maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il do na hiarratais is fearr a thagann isteach.  N&iacute;l sc&eacute;al cinnte ar bith ann go bhfaighidh dream ar bith at&aacute; maoinithe anois maoini&uacute; faoin sc&eacute;im c&eacute; go mbeife&aacute; ag s&uacute;il go bhfaigheadh siad &eacute;.  Ar an &aacute;bhar gur thuigeamar go mbeadh airgead m&oacute;r ag dul amach chuig na ceantair &oacute;n St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras n&oacute; &oacute;n gc&aacute;in&iacute;oc&oacute;ir chuig bailte seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta agus na l&iacute;onra&iacute;, go mbeadh &euro;80,000 sa bhliain ag dul amach chuig na ceantair sin don phlean teanga, mheasamar d&aacute; bharr go bhf&eacute;adfaimis n&iacute;os l&uacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il faoi SPG do na ceantair sin.  T&aacute;imid ag aithint go bhfuil s&eacute; ag cruth&uacute; roinnt deacrachta&iacute; don l&iacute;on beag gr&uacute;pa&iacute; sin at&aacute; i gceist agus s&iacute;lim go gcaithfimid athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh air sin anois i gcomhth&eacute;acs an bhuis&eacute;id mh&eacute;adaithe a bheidh againn.  <br/><br/>Ba ch&oacute;ir dom a r&aacute; ag an bpointe seo nach bhfuil a fhios caid&eacute; an buis&eacute;ad a bheidh againn mar t&aacute; buis&eacute;ad Fhoras na Gaeilge bunaithe ar 75% d&aacute;r mbuis&eacute;ad don Fhoras Teanga - is &eacute; sin an comhlacht a bhfuil Foras na Gaeilge agus Gn&iacute;omhaireacht na hUltaise araon ann agus an Rialtas &oacute; Thuaidh - agus n&iacute; bheidh a fhios againn caid&eacute; an buis&eacute;ad a bheidh againn go dt&iacute; go mbeidh s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta.  Tuigimid go mbeidh m&eacute;ad&uacute; de sh&oacute;rt &eacute;igin sa bhuis&eacute;ad.  Beidh s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go n-aithn&iacute;mid go bhfuil, b'fh&eacute;idir, athbhreithni&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh air seo.  <br/><br/>Faoin am sin bh&iacute; bord ioml&aacute;n &uacute;r againn fosta, rud nach raibh againn &oacute; d'imigh an Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh-Theas, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin ar ais ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute;imid ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh bord ioml&aacute;n faoi dheireadh na m&iacute;osa seo, rud a ligfidh d&uacute;inn pl&eacute; leis an gceist seo mar is ceart sa bhliain &uacute;r.  <br/><br/>Maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; forbartha pobail, d&eacute;anann Foras na Gaeilge an-infheist&iacute;ocht idir &euro;7 milli&uacute;n agus &euro;8 milli&uacute;n sa bhliain as &aacute;r mbuis&eacute;ad i r&eacute;imse na forbartha pobail.  Cuir i gc&aacute;s an &euro;1 milli&uacute;n a th&eacute;ann amach chuig an SPG mar chuid de sin agus cuirimid os cionn &euro;1 milli&uacute;n ar f&aacute;il fosta do Ghl&oacute;r na nGael mar cheanneagra&iacute;ocht le bheith ag pl&eacute; le r&eacute;imse an phobail.  Is &eacute; sin an sainr&eacute;imse at&aacute; ag an eagra&iacute;ocht sin a bheith ag pl&eacute; le gr&uacute;pa&iacute; nach bhfuil ag leibh&eacute;al SPG go f&oacute;ill chun na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; sin a thabhairt a fhad leis an leibh&eacute;al sin.  Caithfimid cothroma&iacute;ocht a aimsi&uacute; sa d&oacute;igh a &uacute;s&aacute;idimid cib&eacute; airgead breise a gheobhaimid.  T&aacute; sc&eacute;imeanna eile a bh&iacute; luaite ag Conradh na Gaeilge sa ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is SEAS 20 at&aacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach fosta.  Is iad sin sc&eacute;imeanna &oacute;ige, imeachta&iacute; &oacute;ige, campa&iacute; samhraidh, agus sc&eacute;imeanna le haghaidh ionaid Ghaeilge.  Ba mhaith linn a bheith &aacute;balta riar a dh&eacute;anamh ar na sc&eacute;imeanna sin ar fad mar go bhfuil an-t&aacute;bhacht ag baint leo.<br/><br/>Maidir leis na ceisteanna a chuir an Teachta McHugh, go d&iacute;reach, beidh cead ag an mbaile seirbh&iacute;se Gaeltachta, l&iacute;onra Leitir Ceanainn an t-ainm at&aacute; air, iarratas a chur isteach ar SPG cinnte agus d'fh&aacute;ilteoimis roimhe sin.<br/><br/>Maidir le an bhfocl&oacute;ir agus m&eacute;id na h&uacute;s&aacute;ide at&aacute;thar &aacute; baint as sin, t&aacute; os cionn 2 mhilli&uacute;n &uacute;s&aacute;ideoir den aip agus den fhocl&oacute;ir ar l&iacute;ne <i>focloir.ie</i>gach bliain.  Maidir leis an bhfocl&oacute;ir cl&oacute;ite, is bestseller at&aacute; ann i l&aacute;thair na huaire i dtaca le leabhair Ghaeilge agus leabhair ar bith eile, go deimhin, a dh&iacute;oltar in &Eacute;irinn.  T&aacute; os cionn cothrom is 2,000 c&oacute;ip d&iacute;olta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; ag teacht rite linn coinne&aacute;il suas leis an &eacute;ileamh de thairbhe nach bhfuil ach duine amh&aacute;in ag obair sa tr&aacute;dst&oacute;ras de bharr srianta Covid-19.  T&aacute; an leabhar ag dul amach chuig siopa&iacute; leabhar ar fud na t&iacute;re agus an-&eacute;ileamh orthu.  F&eacute;adaim a r&aacute; go bhfuil an t-&eacute;ileamh i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; mar a sh&iacute;limid ach aithn&iacute;mid anois an sp&eacute;is at&aacute; &aacute; l&eacute;iri&uacute; ag an bpobal san fhocl&oacute;ir.  <br/><br/>Is fi&uacute; a mheabhr&uacute; nach bhfuil i gceist ansin ach trian den obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta.  Is &eacute; sin an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag daoine at&aacute; ag foghlaim na Gaeilge ach t&aacute; neamart m&oacute;r d&eacute;anta &oacute; buna&iacute;odh an St&aacute;t i leith phobal na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil focl&oacute;ir Gaeilge-Gaeilge againn.  N&iacute; raibh duine ar bith i bpobal na Gaeltachta riamh &aacute;balta focl&oacute;ir a oscailt agus sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; a fh&aacute;il ar fhocal ina dteanga f&eacute;in.  N&iacute; tharl&oacute;dh s&eacute; sin i dteanga ar bith eile m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag tabhairt c&uacute;ram ceart d&aacute;r gcuid teangacha.  Is &eacute; sin an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn anois aghaidh a thabhairt ar an gceist sin.  Is &iacute; an ch&eacute;ad ch&eacute;im eile go mbeidh focl&oacute;ir Gaeilge-Gaeilge ar l&iacute;ne ar f&aacute;il do phobal na Gaeltachta.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid cinnte, idir Fhreas&uacute;ra agus Rialtas anseo, go bhfuil muid ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il aird ar na point&iacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag Foras na Gaeilge.  In aon Bhille, caithfear a bheith f&iacute;orch&uacute;ramach maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; teanga.  T&aacute; difr&iacute;ocht idir th&eacute;arma&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la.  Mar a deir siad sa Bh&eacute;arla, t&aacute; na t&eacute;arma&iacute; &quot;may&quot; agus &quot;shall&quot; ann, mar shampla, agus t&aacute; difr&iacute;ocht idir an d&aacute; th&eacute;arma.  Cialla&iacute;onn ceann amh&aacute;in gur f&eacute;idir rud a dh&eacute;anamh agus cialla&iacute;onn an ceann eile go gcaithfear rud a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is d&oacute;cha go gcaithfidh muid a bheith an-ch&uacute;ramach agus gurb &iacute; sin an fhainic at&aacute; an Foras ag cur orainn inniu.</p><p>D'fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; m&iacute;thuiscint a bheith ar dhaoine faoi smachtbhanna&iacute;.  N&iacute; bheidh Foras na Gaeilge ag cur smachtbhanna&iacute; ar dhaoine ach ar eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it.  Cuireann s&eacute; iontas orm go bhfuil go leor eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it ann agus tugann siad d&uacute;shl&aacute;n don Oireachtais tr&iacute; neamhaird a dh&eacute;anamh ar an dl&iacute; ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile.  Nuair a sh&eacute;idtear chucu, b&iacute;onn cine&aacute;l iontas orthu go mbeadh &eacute;inne ag feidhmi&uacute; an dl&iacute;.</p><p>Is cuimhin liom sular tugadh isteach Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la go raibh treoirl&iacute;nte deonacha ag Foras na Gaeilge.  An cuimhin len&aacute;r n-a&iacute;onna iad?  Bh&iacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; ansin n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; san Acht nuair a th&aacute;inig s&eacute;.  Chuir m&eacute; ceist faoi sin agus is &eacute; an freagra a fuair m&eacute; n&aacute; go raibh na treoirl&iacute;nte thar cionn mar nach rabhthas i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re f&uacute;thu mar i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re n&iacute; chuireadh &eacute;inne i bhfeidhm iad.  Bh&iacute; siad uaillmhianach amach is amach ach bh&iacute; a fhios ag chuile dhuine nach raibh aon smacht leo.  Nuair a tugadh isteach an tAcht, pl&eacute;adh go m&oacute;r an cheist c&eacute;n chaoi a gcuirfear smacht ar na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it le go gcaithfid&iacute;s rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p> Is f&eacute;idir linn breathn&uacute; ar an Ombudsman agus mar sin de.  Is &eacute; an rud a bh&iacute; ann ag an am n&aacute; go raibh taith&iacute; againn d&aacute; nd&eacute;anfadh an gn&aacute;th-Ombudsman moladh faoi rud ar bith, gur glacadh leis.  Nuair a chaithfeadh an Ombudsman tuairisc a chuir go dt&iacute; an tOireachtas &aacute; r&aacute; nach raibh eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; ag clo&iacute; lena chomhairle, bheadh m&iacute;le murdar istigh sa Teach seo.  Buna&iacute;odh an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga air sin ach tharla dh&aacute; rud, le bheith f&iacute;rinneach faoi.  T&aacute; cuid den mhille&aacute;n orainn f&eacute;in - is &eacute; sin ar an Teach seo.  Ba chuma leis na heagrais St&aacute;it go scr&iacute;obhfa&iacute; tuarasc&aacute;lacha agus go gcuirf&iacute; faoi bhr&aacute;id an Oireachtais iad.  Idir Rialtais agus an tOireachtas f&eacute;in tr&iacute; ch&eacute;ile, ba chuma leis na baill go raibh na tuairisc&iacute; seo ag teacht isteach &aacute; r&aacute; go raibh neamhaird &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar an dl&iacute;, neamhchos&uacute;il leis an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; ag tarl&uacute; leis an Ombudsman.  N&iacute; chuimhin liom ach c&aacute;s amh&aacute;in - creidim go raibh an ceart ag an Rialtas sa ch&aacute;s &aacute;irithe sin - go ndeachthas in aghaidh chomhairle an Ombudsman.  Seasann s&eacute; amach i m'intinn mar go raibh an c&aacute;s chomh m&oacute;r sin.  Creidim f&eacute;in nach raibh aon rogha ag an Rialtas ag an am ach taispe&aacute;nann s&eacute; chomh neamhghn&aacute;ch is at&aacute; s&eacute; go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; neamhaird ar an Ombudsman.</p><p>  Ba mhaith liom rud a r&aacute; faoi smachtbhanna&iacute;.  T&aacute; a fhios ag na ha&iacute;onna an c&aacute;s maidir le bheith ag aistri&uacute; c&aacute;ip&eacute;is&iacute; go Gaeilge agus eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; gan &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh n&oacute; fonn a bheith acu &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Ba bhre&aacute; liom pointe amh&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh faoi sin.  T&aacute; dh&aacute; rogha againn: iad a aistri&uacute; go Gaeilge n&oacute; luach an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in a chur ar f&aacute;il do na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  T&aacute;im cinnte go n-aistreofa&iacute; chuile ch&aacute;ip&eacute;is go Gaeilge an t-am sin, is &eacute; sin go gcuirf&iacute; smachtbhanna ind&iacute;reach orthu.  Bheadh s&eacute; thar cionn &oacute; thaobh saol na Gaeilge de d&aacute; mbeadh smachtbhanna&iacute; ann ach go dtiocfadh an t-airgead sin &oacute; na smachtbhanna&iacute; mar is ar eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; St&aacute;it a bheimid &aacute; ngearradh.  N&iacute; i gcoinne pearsana a bheadh s&eacute; agus n&iacute;or mhaith d'aon duine a bheith ag olag&oacute;n, ag caoineadh agus ag d&eacute;anamh trua d&oacute; f&eacute;in.  M&aacute; t&aacute; l&iacute;ne ag deireadh cuntas eagra&iacute;ochta a deir "smachtbhanna&iacute; Gaeilge: &euro;100,000", m&iacute;neodh &eacute; sin c&eacute;n f&aacute;th n&aacute;r chl&oacute;igh siad leis an dl&iacute; le f&oacute;gra&iacute; a chur suas i nGaeilge agus mar sin de.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tagtha chuige sin mar mura mbeidh an dl&iacute; sin ann, pion&oacute;s airgid, is cuma c&eacute;ard a chuirfimid ina &aacute;it istigh sa Bhille mar nach mbeidh feidhm leis.  T&aacute;im maiteach gur theip ar an rud a ceapadh maidir leis an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga agus go gcaithfimid bogadh ar aghaidh agus a r&aacute; nach leor don Choimisin&eacute;ir Teanga tuarasc&aacute;il a l&eacute;amh.  Cuirfidh muintir na Gaeilge sp&eacute;is ann.  Is mionlach muid i dTithe an Oireachtais.  T&aacute;imid i bhfad n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute;omar ach is mionlach muid mar chuid den Oireachtas.

Is beala&iacute; iad na molta&iacute; a chuireamar ar aghaidh in&aacute;r n-aitheasc at&aacute; furasta go leor a chur i bhfeidhm, b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir, agus a l&aacute;idreoidh an Bille go m&oacute;r.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta nuair a luann s&eacute; an cheist faoi theanga agus "aird" versus "dualgas", is &eacute; sin "n&iacute; m&oacute;r" versus "f&eacute;adann" agus d&aacute; r&eacute;ir sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; feicthe againn leis an mBille craolach&aacute;in nach bhfuil cumhacht l&aacute;idir leis an t&eacute;arma "aird a bheith ag" i reachta&iacute;ocht agus is cos&uacute;il nach bhfuil saini&uacute; dl&iacute;thi&uacute;il ar caid&eacute; na dualgais a leagann aird a bheith ag Aire nuair at&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite sa reachta&iacute;ocht.  Is fi&uacute; athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh air sin.</p> <p>  T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta freisin maidir leis an gcoiste comhairleach, mar is molta&iacute; le haghaidh cinnt&iacute; a bheadh le d&eacute;anamh ag Aire n&oacute; a leith&eacute;id, is d&oacute;cha, at&aacute; i gceist againn.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur ch&oacute;ir &eacute; sin a shoil&eacute;iri&uacute; san aitheasc seachas cinnt&iacute;.</p> <p>  Maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; taighde SPG, tuigim an deacracht at&aacute; ag gr&uacute;pa&iacute; i l&aacute;thair na huaire maidir leis an &eacute;iginnteacht agus mar sin de.  N&iacute;l aon amhras orainne go bhfuil an SPG ar cheann de na sc&eacute;imeanna is tairbh&iacute; d&aacute; bhfuil againn agus go bhfuil s&eacute; mar thaca m&oacute;r ag gr&uacute;pa&iacute; at&aacute; ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ag leibh&eacute;al an phobail.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn &eacute; a fheice&aacute;il mar chuid de mh&oacute;rphac&aacute;iste de thaca&iacute; a chuirimid ar f&aacute;il ag leibh&eacute;al an phobail.  Cuir i gc&aacute;s go mbeadh airgead ar f&aacute;il ag gach gr&uacute;pa SPG feasta d&aacute; bhfuil againn faoi sc&eacute;imeanna na gcampa&iacute; samhraidh, na n-imeachta&iacute; &oacute;ige agus na bhf&eacute;ilte.  Cuirtear cuid mhaith den airgead sin ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh lena chois sin.  S&iacute;leann daoine, b'fh&eacute;idir, go rabhamar ag iarraidh ciorr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an SPG.  N&iacute; h&eacute; sin &eacute;.  N&iacute; raibh ciorr&uacute; i gceist leis na molta&iacute; a chuireamar faoi bhr&aacute;id an phobail le gairid in 2019.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; bunaithe ar an gceist ch&eacute;anna.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute;ad&uacute; beag de &euro;20,000 ann ar an milli&uacute;n a bh&iacute; ar f&aacute;il do sc&eacute;im reatha.  Is de bharr buis&eacute;id at&aacute; ruda&iacute; mar sin, mar a d&uacute;irt an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  M&aacute; t&aacute;imid chun airgead breise a chur isteach in SPG, caithfimid an t-airgead sin a bhaint &oacute; rud &eacute;igin eile.  N&iacute; maith linn gur mar sin at&aacute; s&eacute; ach t&aacute; c&iacute;ste againn agus caithfimid &eacute; a ghearradh ar bhealach &eacute;igin.  N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; riamh i gceist againn go mb&iacute;mid ag gearradh an ch&iacute;ste at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il don SPG ach go mbeadh l&iacute;on n&iacute;os m&oacute; gr&uacute;pa&iacute; ann mar chuid de agus go mbeadh maoini&uacute; ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh seachas an sc&eacute;im a ghearradh.</p> <p>  Maidir leis an athbhreithni&uacute;, t&aacute; s&iacute;neadh curtha ar f&aacute;il do na gr&uacute;pa&iacute; reatha go dt&iacute; deireadh mh&iacute; an Mheithimh agus bheimis ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh cinnt&iacute; d&eacute;anta ag an gcruinni&uacute; boird a bheidh againn i m&iacute; Feabhra.

Ar an drochuair, n&iacute;l neart againn air sin agus caithfimid teacht ar bhealach &eacute;igin agus is &eacute; sin an bealach a leagann an reachta&iacute;ocht s&iacute;os - go gcaithfear an maoini&uacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il do na dreamanna is fearr a bhaineann &uacute;s&aacute;id as.</p> <p>  T&eacute;im ar ais chuig an bpointe a luaigh m&eacute; n&iacute;os luaithe, is &eacute; sin go gcaitheann Foras na Gaeilge &euro;1 as gach &euro;2 ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; forbartha pobail, nuair a chuirimid san &aacute;ireamh an SPG, na sc&eacute;imeanna eile sin a luamar agus an t-airgead a chuireamar ar f&aacute;il do na s&eacute; cheanneagra&iacute;ocht.  Is obair r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach &iacute; na pobail sin &aacute; cumas&uacute; leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn agus le deiseanna &uacute;s&aacute;ide a chur ar f&aacute;il sna pobail a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann an Ghaeilge.  Is mar sin a ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; a bheith.  N&iacute; sh&iacute;limid go bhfuilimid ag caitheamh barra&iacute;ochta sa r&eacute;imse sin ar chor ar bith agus n&iacute;limid ag iarraidh gearradh siar air.</p><p>Chuir an Teachta &Oacute; C&uacute;iv ceist an &eacute; nach bhfuil airgead go leor againn maidir le maoini&uacute;, agus an ceart aige.

I welcome the Aire St&aacute;it, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and Ms Sheenagh Rooney, assistant secretary general of the Department of Community and Rural Development.  I thank the Minister and his officials for the briefing document they have provided for this meeting.  As the Minister of State is present, officials should not speak during the public session.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I advise the Minister of State that his opening statement and any other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website.  Before I call the Minister of State to make his opening contribution, at the previous discussion on the more extensive Estimate for the Department and on the issue of the LEADER programme, committee members felt strongly that a transitional arrangement needs to be put in place for that.  While the Minister for Community and Rural Development, Deputy Humphreys, has indicated that it is her intention to bring forward a transitional programme, it seems to be very much along the lines of an administrative funding to keep the administration of the LEADER companies going.  The reality, however, is that it will take at least two years before a new LEADER programme is in place, so not only do we need to look at the administrative aspect of this, we need to ensure these companies have a productive work programme over the next two to two and a half years to implement and that they have a fund to invest into those communities.  I indicated to the Minister of State in advance of this committee that I hope he can provide the committee with an update on the progress in implementing a realistic transitional fund for the LEADER programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.880" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2020111800002#A00200"><p>I may address the LEADER issue after my initial statement.</p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to present this request for a technical Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It will facilitate the allocation of additional funding of &euro;10 million for the Covid-19 stability fund, increasing the total value of that fund to &euro;45 million.  It will also finance a community resilience fund, which will assist community groups to continue to operate and provide services in a Covid-19 environment.  It will also encourage involvement in the Keep Well campaign which focuses on keeping active, staying connected, switching off and being creative, eating well, and minding one's mood.</p><p>As noted, this is a technical Supplementary Estimate with no net increase to the vote. The &euro;10 million is to be recouped from the Dormant Accounts Fund, with the community resilience fund financed through current savings identified in the Department&rsquo;s Vote.</p><p>With regard to the Covid stability fund, the planned additional funding of &euro;10 million will see the total fund increase from &euro;35 million to &euro;45 million.  The original &euro;35 million allocation was shared across three Departments, with &euro;22 million for my own Department, &euro;10 million for the Department of Health and &euro;3 million for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. This funding split was based on the sectors that grantees operated within.  However, for ease of administration at this stage of the year, the proposed additional &euro;10 million would be allocated to the Department of Rural and Community Development Vote, and would see the Department's provision increase from &euro;22 million to &euro;32 million.</p><p>The purpose of the Covid stability fund is to provide grants to charities, community and voluntary organisations, and social enterprises that provide critical services to the most vulnerable in society and which have seen their revenue drop significantly during the pandemic.  Pobal is administering the scheme on behalf of my Department, and to date four tranches of grants have been announced, allocating funding of &euro;30.1 million to 568 organisations.  Full information on the grants made to date is available on <i>gov.ie</i>.  However, I will mention a few organisations that have benefited.  There has been &euro;200,000 for Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation; &euro;85,000 for Killorglin Family Resource Centre; &euro;34,000 for Galway Autism Partnership; and &euro;19,000 for Corduff Community Resource Centre.  These examples demonstrate the broad range of organisations benefiting and the services that can be maintained due to this funding.</p><p>The pandemic is continuing to weigh heavily on the sector.  Challenges remain, such as the level 5 restrictions entered into in recent weeks. The logic for the additional &euro;10 million is to mitigate these impacts and others. The additional funding will further support organisations assisted under the first round so they can continue their important work in assisting the national response to the pandemic.  I am certain that the funding to date and this additional funding have been a vital support so that these and similar organisations can continue their work and help those in need during these challenging times.</p><p>I would finally note that this is a technical Supplementary Estimate, as the measure is being financed through the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The funding is recouped from the Dormant Account Fund, managed by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, rendering this expenditure Exchequer neutral.  I think the use of the Dormant Accounts Fund has been central to ensuring that these supports for the broad community and voluntary sector have been of such a significant scale.  I am delighted that, given the source of this money, it is being put to such a practical and important use.</p><p>On the community resilience fund, the second technical Supplementary Estimate is seeking movement of current savings from subhead B11, community enhancement programme, to enable a community resilience fund for small grant supports to community facilities and organisations at local level.  These proposed supports will assist two areas.  First, they will assist local community and voluntary groups to adapt their services and operations to fit the new Covid-19 reality.  This is consistent with an action assigned to our Department under the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19.  Examples of measures supported could be funding consumables necessary to support public health guidelines, including social distancing, offering online activities, providing social supports and friendly calls by phone etc.  Second, they will help to animate community groups to enable them to become more involved in the Government's Keep Well campaign.  It will seek to assist their participation in all five themes of the plan, particularly the staying connected theme.</p><p>Funding will be allocated to each local authority area, and the fund will be administered by the local authority development committees, LCDCs.  Sufficient flexibility under the fund will be granted to support community groups with day-to-day running costs if needed.  Savings identified initially for this proposal amount to &euro;770,000, with &euro;570,000 from subhead A4, rural supports, and &euro;200,000 from B5, LCDC supports.  This forms the basis for one element of the technical supplementary before the committee today.  The proposal is to open a current element under the B11 community enhancement programme subhead.  It is from this subhead that the proposed  community resilience fund will be disbursed to LCDCs for onward distribution to local community and voluntary groups as part of Government&rsquo;s pandemic response.</p><p>We continue to assess whether other small current savings can be identified across the Vote and would like to be in a position to supplement this fund further, possibly enabling a fund in the range of &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2 million in total.  If further current savings can be identified and the committee is in agreement with the Supplementary Estimate today, any further funding would be subject to sanction by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Overall, the community resilience fund will provide significant practical funding supports at local level with local flexibility and decision making, ensuring the impact on the ground is maximised.</p><p>As noted, this technical supplementary is required as the B11 community enhancement programme subhead contains only capital funding, so a Vote is required to enable current expenditure.  Again, this measure is net expenditure neutral given that savings elsewhere are funding the proposal.  However, it will ensure that our current funding is put to best use in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>I thank the committee for taking the time to consider the Supplementary Estimate and I am happy to answer any questions that arise.</p><p>I will say a little bit about LEADER.  I reassure the committee that active planning is ongoing and there will be an announcement very soon.  The current seven-year programme, which is co-funded by the European Commission, will come to an end at the end of this year.</p><p>I will just go through a few context points.  Proposals for a successor LEADER programme at EU level are intrinsically linked to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which co-funds the LEADER programme.  Proposals for the post-2020 CAP were launched in June 2018 by the European Commission.  However, given the lengthy nature of discussions on the CAP and the wider EU budget at EU level, there has been a delay in adopting these proposals.  This means that the next LEADER programme will not commence until January 2022 at the earliest.</p><p> The programme for Government includes a commitment to prioritise a State-led programme to bridge the gap between the current LEADER programme and the next EU programme, which will not commence until 2022 at the earliest.  The objective of this commitment is to allow rural development projects to continue to be delivered under a transitional programme using the LEADER model until the new EU programme commences.</p><p> An extra &euro;4 million has been provided for LEADER in budget 2021 to bring the total allocation for next year to &euro;44 million.  I can confirm that this allocation will be used to fund a combination of existing projects as they come to completion as well as for new projects to be approved under the transitional fund.</p><p> The funding will also support the administration costs of the local action groups, including their implementing partners who deliver the programme locally, in closing out the existing programme and delivering the transitional programme.</p><p> It is important to recognise that LEADER is a multi-annual programme and that payments in respect of projects which are approved in any given year are generally not drawn down until subsequent years as and when they are completed.  In this context, costs related to projects under the transitional programme are also likely to be met from the provision in my Departments Vote in 2022 and 2023.</p><p> The design, duration and composition of the transitional programme are currently being finalised and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, hopes to be in a position to shortly announce the full details of project and administration allocations under the programme.  To give reassurance, we are acutely aware in the Department of the importance of LEADER and the importance of keeping the moment going on it as well.  There will be an announcement coming soon.</p></speech>

The other area of savings was from rural supports which, frankly, I am not as familiar with.  There was; &euro;570,000 from subhead A4 - rural supports; and &euro;200,000 from the LCDC supports.  We are looking at other areas as well to hopefully bring us to savings of between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;2 million that we can put directly into communities at a practical and immediate level before the end of the year.</p></speech>

Obviously, it depends on Covid and the restrictions that we are required to adhere to.  At present, there are no plans but we will be actively monitoring it.</p> <p>  The position in the case of the community resilience fund is similar.  I suppose, with the community resilience fund, we are in a position coming to the end of the year where we can reallocate funding to areas that need it more at present, that is, I guess, the front line across communities.  That is why it is going in that direction.</p> <p>  It is going through the community enhancement programme.  That programme will continue every year anyway as well but there is a little reorientation at present to facilitate current expenditure under the community enhancement programme rather than the capital programme to allow people to get some practical aids to bridge gaps, especially where people are in isolated situations during the lockdown.</p></speech>

There is the reserve.  Putting that aside, there are funds that have been allocated but have not been spent for which one must make a contingency.  Then there are the unallocated funds.  Has the Minister of State any idea where those stand at at present?</p> <p>  On the Dormant Accounts Fund, how much of the money is now being spent directly by agencies such as the HSE and how much of it is going to community and voluntary groups around the country?  My understanding of the Dormant Accounts Acts is that the funding must be for social and economic disadvantage, educational disadvantage and disability.  I am curious as to whether there has been a little quiet mainstreaming in replacement of what should be Exchequer funding out of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  The fund was always meant to be for the community and voluntary sector and special issues, not for substituting State funding.  We saw the same happen with the lottery funds.  Those were all meant to be additional funding and then, slowly but surely, they replaced the Exchequer funding.  If I asked a number of Ministers how much of their funding was from the national lottery, they would not know from their Estimates unless they started digging into the DNA.  It is merely a matter of them having this amount of funding and they negotiate it with the Department of Finance as per usual.  The Dormant Accounts Fund was different because it used to come back to the Minister.  I do not know if that still happens.  Every project comes back to the Minister for approval around a committee.  It is where the Minister sits and looks at the ceiling and states that he or she agrees or otherwise with this or that.  It is all done in a process but it used be done by a committee.  The Minister of State might also confirm if that is still the situation.</p></speech>

Of this, &euro;101 million is in the reserve fund set aside for repayments to account holders.  The remaining &euro;211 million is in the investment and disbursement fund.</p></speech>

Once one allocates money to a project, one has to keep money, aside from the reserve, for that as well.  How much loose money is in it?  I presume there is not &euro;211 million.  Does the Minister of State understand what I am saying?  The Minister of State said there was &euro;312 million, with &euro;101 in the reserve.  That is a statutory reserve.  That is gone.  There is &euro;211 million left.  Of the &euro;211 million, presumably there are projects that have been approved for which the Minister of State must make contingent provision when they spend.  That should leave a net figure of what the Minister of State still could allocate and be covered.</p></speech>

The fund is risk averse.  All I can state, I suppose, is the amount that has been spent this year and last year under the action plans is in the region of &euro;40 million.  To flag it with the Deputy, I am looking into this as well as previous Ministers have.  It is certainly something that I am examining in terms of the capacity to use it.</p></speech>

In other words, it is still on the State's book.  When the Minister of State spends the money and goes to the Department of Finance looking for permission to spend more money, the Department will tell him that there is a still a contingent liability on the State for all of the money that was ever taken into the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p> <p> The fund came into operation in 2001 or 2002.  It definitely goes back that far.</p><p>There has not been a single year where the incomings have been more than the outgoings.  I understand that the average amount coming in from the Dormant Accounts Fund is &euro;20 million net per annum.  It used to be at any rate.  The Minister of State can check this out if I give him the figures.  If the outgoings are more than the incomings, we are saying that people who left money in banks 50, 60 or 70 years ago have suddenly been able to establish ownership of it.  They are probably long dead, so establishing a right to the money would be fairly ingenious.  Even if they could, there is &euro;110 million to meet their entitlement.  If all of that, plus the other money that has been allocated, is spent, then there is still this year's incomings.</p><p> I will give the Minister of State an example of my argument.  The State writes off bank loans every now and again, or it used to when we had a Central Bank of our own.  It would decide that there was X amount that would never come back.  There was a windfall for the Exchequer.  It is time that we put a stop to the fiction that everyone who ever put money into a dormant account will come looking for it.  We know following 20 years of this scheme that this is not happening.  In fact, the opposite is happening, with more and more money becoming available.  Has the Minister of State had discussions with the Department of Finance or would he consider doing so?  Otherwise, it will tell him every time he looks for money that this is a contingent liability on the State and, therefore, Exchequer funding.  It is not actually dormant account funding, all of which is counted as a liability on the State's balance sheet.  Have I explained myself badly?</p></speech>

He asked a bunch of questions and I am unsure whether I will be able to answer all of them, but I take his core point.  I have started internal discussions about this matter in the Department.  The Deputy's suggestion of speaking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which now holds the purse strings, is one that I will consider.</p> <p>  I do not have the information with me today, but I have examined the account's inflows and outflows for the past 20 years.  They are not as predictable as one would like.  There were some years where there were unexplained large withdrawals and others where the amount in the account decreased.  For example, there were a couple of years during the recession where there were net extractions, for want of a better phrase.  The Deputy's point is correct, though.  Over time, the account is increasing incrementally.  The difficulty is that its outgoings year by year are unpredictable.  However, there is a reasonable range outside which the account has not strayed.  Perhaps that is the range we should be considering.</p> <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question about how it-----</p></speech>

That is the cushion.  However, holding onto the entire amount from day one is wrong.  A new formula should be worked out, one in which the reserve is untouchable.  That is the rainy day fund.  To say that everyone who ever put money into a dormant account will one day walk into a bank is stretching credulity, though.</p></speech>

Regarding how the money is spent, that information has been published for public scrutiny in the action plans.  The 2021 plan was published last week.  People can examine how the money is being spent.  The majority of it is going to the community and voluntary sector.  I will keep an eye out for it being used to fill holes that should instead be financed through voted expenditure.  There is a risk of Departments straying that way, but this is generally managed well.</p> <p>  Perhaps I have not answered the Deputy's questions in the depth he would like, but that is as much information as I have.</p></speech>

I welcome that additional funding is being provided to the community sector, in particular services on the ground, given that is where it is desperately needed.  For a large number of small community facilities and organisations, &euro;1,000 is a lot of money and makes a significant difference.</p> <p>  From my experience in various groups, the funding that comes through local authorities gets to them quickly and easily.  There is little form filling and so on.  I question the use of Pobal, though.  From the feedback I have received, applying to Pobal for small grants is sometimes too much hassle.  Can we take the streamlined way funding is provided by the local authorities' local community development committees, LCDCs, and apply it to Pobal, particularly for small amounts?  I understand that some large grants are required and we need to be diligent in how they are made, but we have an opportunity to examine how smaller grants can be disbursed to communities quickly.</p> <p>  To clarify, is a set percentage supplied by the Dormant Accounts Fund every year?  If the fund is worth &euro;10 million, for example, is 20% of that disbursed, put into the reserve fund and so on?  I am not clear on this.  I am looking at the documentation, but I cannot see from it how the decision is made.</p></speech>

That is why we are doing this the way we are.</p> <p>  Pobal manages a range of funding programmes.  If there are particular programmes where accessing funding is a problem, we would like to know.  We could bring that information to Pobal.  It has a range of approximately 20 funding programmes of various kinds.  Pobal would be interested in knowing, as would I, if there are issues with getting small grants out efficiently.</p> <p>  Regarding the percentage of the Dormant Accounts Fund that is used, the quick answer is I do not know.  That is key information to find out.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, is clearly risk-averse, but it is worth delving into this and shedding more light on how the money is used.</p></speech>

It relates to remote working hubs, in particular the mol digiteach in Gaeltachta&iacute;.  With the current sea change in remote working, there exists an opportunity.  With the Bille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) 2019, which is before the D&aacute;il, we will enshrine in law the right and ability of people within Gaeltacht communities to access services through the Irish language.  Now would be the time to leverage the sea change and build a decentralised workforce within Gaeltachta&iacute; that would be able to act on behalf of all Departments.  Irish speakers would be in their own communities and providing State services.  This would not necessarily have to be done Department by Department.  Would welcome funding be made available for that type of remote working?  We have an opportunity now to consider this idea in earnest.  This is probably more of an observation than a question.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is especially interested in having a network of remote working hubs, particularly along the western side of the country.  She sees the value in that.  The Western Development Commission will play a role in developing that network.  We want to a situation whereby someone could check a phone app to see where he or she could go to work remotely.  There are dozens, if not hundreds, of options in rural Ireland to do that and make this approach viable.  It is high on the Department's agenda.  To my knowledge, the Secretary General chairs the cross-departmental group that is pushing this idea.  For a variety of good reasons - Covid, well-being, lifestyle and environmental - this is a no-brainer in terms of where to put political priority now.  The Vice Chairman's point is taken and we are working on it.</p> <p>  I will provide some figures.  Budget 2021 allocated an additional &euro;5 million to support the expansion of the hub network model into a national initiative.  The interdepartmental working group I mentioned has been convened to progress this work and significant funding is being provided through the town and village renewal scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  The town and village renewable scheme is providing &euro;200,000 for the development of the Cavan digital hub and &euro;150,000 to support the Ludgate hub in Skibbereen.</p><p>Rural regeneration and development funding of &euro;2.9 million has been provided to support the development of eight different hubs, right across the Gaeltacht in particular.  That is to directly address the Vice Chairman's point.</p></speech>

The reality is that I am not sure whether all those buildings are fully utilised.  I asked that question of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and received a reply.  He was able to tell me how many decentralised offices the State owns and rents throughout the country.  He could not tell me the utilisation level of any of those offices.  If one is in the public service, it is better to work from a public service office.  Someone might be in charge of that office so a person working there would have oversight, secure lines and the whole lot.</p> <p>  I know for a fact that an extension was built to the office in Na Forbacha.  A translation section was to go in there and provide translation to all the public service offices around the country, semi-State and Civil Service, that needed translation done centrally and to a quality, rather than using terrible Google Translate answers.  That was cancelled in 2012, for whatever reason.  I know that office space is there.  There is nothing to stop the Civil Service saying that 20, 30 or 40 civil servants who work in different Departments, the Department of Education or whatever, on condition they work through Irish, could be located in Na Forbacha on a co-location basis.  The senior official there would look after the ordinary, day-to-day things like administration and so on.  It seems to me that those kinds of locations are already available.  It is amazing that the Office of Public Works, OPW, does not know how many spaces are available for this kind of choice working.</p> <p>  I also think it would stop the silo effect which is a terrible problem in the Civil Service.  One would think that the 15 or 16 Departments were competing companies rather than a Civil Service serving one Government.  Everyone in the Government sits and works together but, when one starts working downwards, they fight each other as if they were all protecting their own little empires.  I just bounce that idea at the Minister of State because sometimes the simple and ready-made solutions are overlooked.  There are Civil Service offices in every county around the country.  That is one idea.</p> <p>  I will ask just one other question because I understand that time is short.  At the end of October, only 50% of the capital expenditure of the Department of Rural and Community Development had been spent.  That is crazy.  Every year, we get the same thing and it all happens in the final two months of the year.  That is bad practice.  Many schemes that were announced for 2021 have not had their allocations of funding approved yet.  I got a reply to a parliamentary question to that effect.  Will the Minister of State get up-to-date figures, subhead by subhead, of the capital allocation and expenditure to date, now that we are halfway through November?  The Department always seems reticent to show the figures but I have a suspicion that there will probably be an overspend on the LEADER programme but a significant underspend on some other programmes.  I would hate to see anything going back to the Exchequer.  It is hard enough to extract it, as the Minister of State will soon find out, without having to give it back at the end of the year, or to carry it forward, or to be making prepayments to local authorities, which I also disapprove of because sometimes they do not spend it for years.</p></speech>

Covid-19 has impacted that significantly but we have caught up and are on track.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about the State-owned buildings that could be used.  It is not an unreasonable suggestion.  I will impress that point upon the Minister.  While the broader remote working hubs allow access to the public and private sectors-----</p></speech>

I agree that it is a reasonable suggestion.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about expenditure.  As of now, gross departmental expenditure to date is &euro;262 million.  Capital expenditure has ramped up significantly over the past number of weeks and expenditure to date is &euro;99.5 million, with a remaining allocation of &euro;68.7 million.  Those are up-to-date figures.</p></speech>

I take it the Minister of State is responsible for Pobal.</p></speech>

There is a Pobal sub-office there that makes all the rural social scheme, RSS, and T&uacute;s payments and so on.  The amount of travel amounts to one or two people going to Dublin occasionally, or that was the case before Covid and that has now probably proven to be an unnecessary journey.  It is providing steady employment and wage packages to 30 or 40 people in Clifden.  It is worth a visit because it shows that people who said that everything has to be centralised were wrong.  One of the conditions under which Pobal got the pay-out of RSS and T&uacute;s was that it would be located in Clifden as part of the decentralisation programme.  That has been very successful and the Minister of State should visit the office to see for himself an operation that works totally under the radar and has never had a complaint about payments.  There have been many complaints about Pobal and its bureaucracy but there have been no complaints about payments under RSS and T&uacute;s.  It is a model of where we should be going on an absolutely relentless, step-by-step basis.  There is no need to be pushing people into overcrowded cities with overly costly rents when a lot of people would prefer to live in a rural community.</p></speech>

I am glad he could join us as I know he was busy in the convention centre this morning.</p> <p>  I request that members sit only in the permitted seats and in front of available microphones to ensure they are heard.  This is important as not doing so can cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff.  I remind members to please maintain social distance all times during and following the meeting.  Members are requested to use wipes and hand sanitisers provided to clean the seats and desks to supplement the regular sanitisation that is ongoing between meetings.  I remind members that the committee must vacate the room as quickly as possible at 4 o&rsquo;clock as there may be meetings afterwards.  If members wish to speak to our guests, they can do so outside in the lobby. </p> <p>  I welcome the representatives from Sport Ireland and thank them for their attendance today.  I acknowledge this has been an exceptionally difficult year for sporting organisations and that Sport Ireland has been to the forefront in addressing this crisis and the challenges facing governing bodies and many individual clubs.  The supports put in place are considerable.  A &euro;85 million funding package was announced earlier this month for the Irish sports sector.  It contains many positive elements, including funding for governing bodies and clubs to address Covid-related losses, additional funding for the GAA, and dedicated funding for disability and other adult sports.  All of this is welcome and timely in the context of the losses experienced during Covid-19.  However, we are entering into an important phase which requires careful consideration.</p> <p>  I am delighted to welcome our guests, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, chairman of the board of Sport Ireland, along with his colleague, chief executive of Sport Ireland, Mr. John Treacy.   The format of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make opening statements, which have been provided and circulated to members.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statements on the Oireachtas website following the meeting.  Mr. Mulvey will begin on the topic of his key priorities in his role as chairman of the board of Sport Ireland, followed by Mr. Treacy who will address matters relating to Covid-19 and the impact on the sector.</p> <p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House, or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I would like the witnesses to note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make in the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they might say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chairman to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to identifying a person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with such direction.</p> <p>  With the formalities over, I call on Mr. Mulvey to make his presentation to the committee.  This will be followed by Mr. Treacy's presentation.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy and I will outline the current state of play in regard to Sport Ireland and our plans over the next two years.  I will deal with issues relating to my priorities and some of the key issues which have been identified over the past number of years.  Mr. Treacy will deal with the issues regarding funding and Covid-19 and the measures Sport Ireland has taken.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland was established on 1 October 2015 under the Sport Ireland Act 2015 bringing together the Irish Sports Council, the National Sports Campus Development Authority, the Irish Institute of Sport, and Coaching Ireland, which is based in Limerick, into a new streamlined body to drive the future of Irish sport.  During the past five years, there have been a number of significant developments for Sport Ireland, particularly around the development of the campus, and funding of sport within Ireland.  I outlined them in the statement I have given to the committee and given the short space of time, I do not intend to go through them in detail.</p> <p>  The National Sport Ireland Campus, based in Abbotsown, is one of the hidden gems of sport in Ireland.  It has brought together high-level performance facilities for our national sporting bodies and for our national and international athletes.  This week alone, the Irish international soccer and rugby teams are training on new pitches provided by Sport Ireland and in indoor facilities.</p><p>These have been magnificent developments funded by the Government in phase 1 and phase 2 of the National Sports Campus.  We have added to that an international hockey pitch to Tokyo standards in recognition of the success of our men and women's international hockey teams.  We also have new equestrian facilities on the sports campus, which, again, is reflective of the fact that for the first time we have three equestrian teams qualified for the Tokyo Olympics, if they occur next summer.  In addition, the GAA has built additional facilities, including pitches, on the campus.  Cricket Ireland has new training facilities there as well.  The Institute of Sport, the National Aquatic Centre have offices there and negotiations are ongoing with other sporting bodies to bring their national offices onto the campus.  I will elaborate on that point later.<br/><br/>It is an exciting time for NGBs in terms of the physical capacity that is being provided apart from the sports capital programme throughout the country.  The former Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, will be familiar with the sports capital programme and the provision of facilities.  We are also upgrading our coaching capacity in Ireland, with many of our coaches now being recognised nationally and internationally, and around the recruitment of high-performance directors for the individual NGBs in which we assist.<br/><br/>In 2019, Irish high-performance athletes won 80 medals on the international stage in a variety of competitions.  We have 52 athletes qualified for the Tokyo Olympics, plus five in reserve.  With luck this year, and with further international competition opening up next year and, hopefully, the vaccines announced will be a major player in this regard, we could have up to 90 accredited athletes for the Tokyo Olympics, which is one of the highest ever number for Ireland in terms of international competition and the Olympic Games.  A similar picture is developing but with less success on the Paralympic side because of the change and the nature of the arrangements for Paralympic Games.<br/><br/>I am pleased that the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Martin, has appointed me for a further two-year term to continue the work of Sport Ireland in the context of the development of our facilities on the campus and in the funding of sports.  As we know, sport is crucial and central to the social, cultural and community life of Ireland.  Like all facets of society, sport in Ireland has been significantly impacted by the onset of Covid-19 and the resulting restrictions.  Live televised coverage of our international and national games is a boom to us at the moment in that we are still going through the Gaelic games senior hurling and senior football cycle.  Our soccer team is still playing at international level and will play tonight.  Our rugby team is continuing its international programme, with a game on Saturday.  This is important.  We are continuing our anti-doping programme under the terms of the Act.  We have an honourable record in this regard and already 850 tests have been completed this year despite the restrictions that have been on us.<br/><br/>The Government has responded very generously to our representations on behalf of the sporting community in regard to the significant emergency that occurred in funding in 2020 and the fact that our national governing bodies, including our major national field sports, were suffering considerable haemorrhage of income arising from the non-attendance and non-performance of events.  Other organisations were losing membership fees due to the non-availability of facilities, particularly organisations such as Basketball Ireland and Swim Ireland.  Mr. Treacy will address these matters in detail later.  It is important to acknowledge what the Government and the Oireachtas have done by voting and agreeing these measures.  It has significantly allowed us to maintain all our national governing bodies and to avoid them running into major deficit in regard to their activities.  It has given them security and they have welcomed that funding, which was announced recently and we are currently distributing to them.  We have received very positive feedback on that.  The Government and the Oireachtas have continued that funding in terms of the budget increase of almost of 50% for sport in 2021, a significant proportion of which we will be holding for contingency in regard to issues that will develop in respect of Covid as we go into next year.  This funding has given stability to the sector and allayed the concerns of sporting organisations.  It has enabled them to retain their head office staff and to maintain the organisation of the sport so that when the restrictions are lifted, they will be ready on a quick return to sport, which we are working on with all the NGBs and the line Department.  We are continuing our work with our Olympians, Paralympians, special Olympians and the Olympics.  We have a service level partnership agreement with the Olympics in terms of the Olympic events and in the case of Special Olympics.  We have continued to fund our accredited athletes into next year.  We have a further &euro;2.9 million devoted to expenditure for them and this has given them a source of comfort in terms of their performance and continuing their preparations for the Olympics to allow them to compete in further international competitions next year.  We have ring-fenced a further &euro;4 million for the Olympics to meet any contingencies arising from the rearrangement of accommodation programmes, travel, etc.  In that sense, much forward planning is happening to ensure that the return to sport in terms of playing and representation will come as no surprise and we will be prepared.<br/><br/>Strong governance across the sector<b></b>is an important issue.  I am giving priority to this in light of events.  We have put in place new protocols, new requirements for funding and new efforts to be made in terms of implementing new governance standards with all of the bodies that are funded by us and new terms and conditions for approval by the board of Sport Ireland for funding arrangements.  We are also following the governance code for community, voluntary and charitable organisations as a governance code for sport.  From 2021, it will become a condition of funding that all funding bodies must have adopted the governance code for sport, or, if there is a difficulty, to explain those difficulties in order to reach compliance.  <br/><br/>On 26 November, we will hold a major conference via technology, which will be attended by more than 280 participants who are chairpersons, members of boards and chief executives of our national governing bodies.  This will be co-partnered by the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, and the chief executive of the UK Sport organisation will speak and inform us about arrangements in the United Kingdom.  I will be giving particular attention to the issue of governance and conformity to the code of governance that has been agreed and circulated to all funding bodies.<br/><br/>Participation in sport is an important criteria.  It is one of the specific measures under the Sport Ireland Act.  Over the course of the next two years, Sport Ireland will put particular emphasis on participation in sport at local, national and international level.  Sport Ireland is a beneficiary of the Dormant Accounts Fund.  We will be putting in place further opportunities, particularly around hard to reach groups, the disabilities sector and those who do not have a great tradition of participation in sport.  We have been very successful through the local sports partnerships in funding these initiatives.  The funding provided to us under the Dormant Accounts Fund has been utilised effectively by us through the local sports partnerships in conjunction with disability groups and national governing bodies.  We are getting a very solid return in terms of the investment in that programme by way of greater participation of these groups in organised sport.  We have been allocated a further &euro;10 million in Dormant Accounts Funding for 2021 for this endeavour and sporting activity.  We will be funding these arrangements again in 2021.  This gives us great security around the programmes we have agreed and the staff we would have been funding in terms of these arrangements with national governing bodies.<br/><br/>The other area which is of vital importance is women in sport and the increase in participation of women in sport at all levels, both in terms of active participation and in governance.</p><p>Last year, we appointed our first women in sport officer, Nora Stapleton, who, with her team, is working very successfully through the women in sport committee with NGBs and making an impact in this area.  We also recognise that there are significant inroads to be made in this area and are providing a blueprint for future work on this.  We are working on major continuity with regard to the women in sport programme.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has emphasised to me that she wants significant progress in this area and will be joining us to talk to the committee later this month regarding what she sees as developing the national sports policy in this area.  It is not just about participation, where there is a significant fall-off in women in sport aged 16 and over.  It is also about ensuring that at all levels, our NGBs, schools and universities take particular note in this area and work in partnership with them.<br/><br/>Since 2005, &euro;22 million has been provided to Sport Ireland and NGBs for the women in sport programme and we hope to increase this exponentially over the next number of years and also through the local sports partnerships-specific programmes.  The aim of the programme is to have equal participation between males and females in sport.  The gender gradient in sports participation has closed from 15.7% to 3.4% since 2007 according to our most recent monitor in 2019.  We will follow it up with this year's return later this year.  That is in its final stage of preparation.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, the coverage of women in sport has only increased by 1.1% in our national media in the past five years.  The media need to cover the greater participation of women in sport and their successes at all levels, local and national.  It is not just a question for us.  It is also a question for the national media, some of which are better than others.  Across the board, in the past four to five years, there has only been a 1.1% increase in coverage in our national media so work needs to be done with it.  However, I must compliment the recent efforts by RT&Eacute; to cover Gaelic women's sports - camogie and Gaelic football - and the national sports awards run by <i>The Irish Times</i>every year recognising the achievements of women in sport.  There are particular areas but we need more media coverage of women in sport and more media reporting of their successes.  The board accepted at our meeting yesterday that we will give more attention to women in sport and to narrowing the gap where we can and where we can assist.  At board level, we recently conducted a survey on the representation of women.  The Minister has told me that she would like to see, as would we, greater participation of women at board level in sports.  We will aim to achieve at least 30% and, hopefully, 40% or 50% over the next number of years.  This is an uphill journey in respect of governing bodies and the participation of women in sport and at administrative level and the management of the game at national level in the respective sports.  <br/><br/>We have been very successful internationally in respect of the high-performance strategy for Irish sport.  The important issue is bringing stability and avoiding risk in this area over the next two to three years.  Our national high-performance sport strategy for the next 12 years will be published shortly.  This will bring us over the Tokyo cycle and into the Paris and Los Angeles cycle of the Olympic Games over the next number of years so it is important to plan for that.  We fund 117 international athletes and four teams at international level.  That will be an important element of our work, laying the groundwork on top of what we have achieved.  This means building the facilities as well as funding these elite athletes to allow them to continue their involvement in sport and ensuring that in doing so, they do not lose out educationally or in terms of employment.  We have various programmes to assist them in this regard.  We hope to have a successful Olympic Games in Tokyo and have a wide range of participation in a multiplicity of sports.  It will not be dominated, as it was in the past, by boxing or other sports.  We have a high range of international medalling and qualification in these areas.  As I said, our three international equestrian teams are accredited so we are looking forward to that if it goes ahead.  Preparation for Paris 2024 is proceeding but is now in a truncated period of three years.  We have started the initial programme.  We looking forward to publishing the high-level strategy for high-performance sport 2021 to 2032 as soon as the Ministers are available.  <br/><br/>The Sport Ireland campus in Abbotstown, north Dublin, is an incredible resource for us and a key priority.  We are preparing the new master plan, which is almost at final draft stage.  We hope to complete that at the board meeting in December.  We will then be in a position to come to Government with our proposals relating to the development of the national sports campus and future arrangements.  We are working very closely with Fingal County Council, which is our local authority.  It is very supportive of and committed to what we are trying to achieve there.  It will provide a blueprint and master plan for the campus and the facilities we intend to develop on the campus over the next ten to 15 years.  The important element of this is to bring more NGBs on to the campus and, hopefully, build a hotel on it that will also be an athlete hotel as part of a public-private partnership arrangement, which the previous Minister allowed me to proceed with.  This latter development will allow us to attract international competition to the campus and create a village-type atmosphere.<br/><br/>We are already planning for the development of a new velodrome centre, which will also incorporate the national badminton centre.  This is the next major building project we are discussing with government and initial funding has been given to us to do that.  We hope to have the postponed European cross-country championship on the course on the campus in 2021.  They are exciting prospects.  We still have Abbotstown House, which is the old landlord house in the Hamilton estate of Abbotstown.  That is maintained on a care and maintenance basis by us but we hope we can revisit that in the near future.  Hopefully, we will be able to restore it and allow it to be used for national and international events.  My own preference - this will take time to develop - is to create a museum of sport in Abbotstown House.  Sport Ireland's headquarters moved to the campus from Blanchardstown in 2018.  We have settled into the converted courtyard - the old stables in Abbotstown House.  That is working very well so we are leading by example in that regard.  <br/><br/>They are a number of the priorities.  Obviously, there are other day-to-day operations developed by Mr. Treacy and his team in Sport Ireland.  New issues come up at the board's regular monthly meeting with which the board must deal.  We had a four-hour meeting over Zoom about expenditure under Covid, previous expenditure, the budget for 2021, the new high-performance strategy that we must finalise and other reports we receive.  A significant amount of work is happening under the ambit of Sport Ireland in a multiplicity of areas with a multiplicity of governing bodies and local sports partnerships.  Irish sport is in a good place in terms of the funding arrangements that have been made.  They have been very resilient during the Covid period.<br/><br/>Hopefully, with our return to sport protocols, which we will have developed, we hope we will have vibrant sporting activity during 2021 - the vaccine is crucial in this regard - and the other issues regarding Tokyo will be resolved.  The footfall on campus was 1.7 million people last year.  This has fallen substantially by 63% due to the Covid restrictions so we hope to increase that footfall in the coming years.  </p></speech>

I do not wish to be rude but opening statements normally take about ten minutes to give the members an opportunity to ask questions.  I ask Mr. Treacy to keep his opening statement extremely brief and related to the impact of Covid-19, which is the theme for today.  If he does not have enough time to finish it I am sure it will be covered with the members anyway.  He might take three to four minutes and we will then move on to the members.</p></speech>

We were ably assisted by the Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, at the time in terms of all these initiatives.  An expert group was established by the Department and that was the mechanism whereby protocols developed by the national governing bodies, NGBs, could be approved.  That is chaired by the Department officials and it is doing very well and has proven to be very beneficial.  We instigated and increased our year in terms of the international carding scheme.  We extended it for a year into 2021, which is something the then Minister of State, Deputy Griffin, was keen we would do.  That was done very quickly to ease the minds of the athletes.</p> <p>  The big piece for us was getting the athletes back into training in the centres as quickly as possible.  That happened in June and it released a great valve in terms of the athletes getting back into training, which was critically important.  </p> <p>  The institute has continued to deliver services to our athletes.  We are conducting many Covid-19 tests for the athletes as they go to international competition.</p> <p>  There is much activity around the lockdown in terms of physical activity.  We ran numerous campaigns.  In terms of social media, we got the governing bodies to put pieces online.  Sport Ireland and the local sports partnerships, LSPs, were very active in that regard.  We ran a plethora of programmes around physical activity and the research that came back during the pandemic showed that the numbers increased.  Walking was up to 83% and the participation numbers got up as far as 50% so the impact in terms of social media was very important.  The LSPs and the NGBs worked hard with us to ensure those programmes were successful.  They were basically programmes to encourage people to exercise at home during the lockdown and they were provided with a good deal of advice to them.  That was very well received.</p> <p>  We ran Covid awareness courses.  More than 185,000 people touched on that.  We had compliance officers training for the governing bodies and the clubs so we reached down to the clubs in terms of all that training.</p> <p>  This month we are doing a piece, Your Personal Best Month, which is aimed at men over the age of 45 to encourage them to get out and keep active, with no more excuses.  That is the kind of message we want to filter into that age group.  Also, for the next three months we will be working with the Government and Healthy Ireland on the Keep Well campaign.  </p> <p>  It is important that we stress to members that yesterday we launched a campaign on our website on all the different programmes that are available.  We strongly advocate that people would look at it to see what they can do.  We run a community walking initiative, which will be centred around the sports and involving local authorities.  With Get Ireland Walking we developed a walking app where people can register and slot in a time for walking in these various facilities and monitor that.  </p> <p>  The local sports partnerships will roll out initiatives for people with a disability.  We will also link in closely with "Operation Transformation" over the next number of months.  We will operate a programme called FitLine, which is geared at older people who might not have access to social media.  We will make sure there is a telephone line through which they will be able to get advice and guidance on what to do from home.  People can talk them through it so that they can exercise.</p> <p>  The big piece around this is to try to encourage people to be active during the lockdown, which is critically important.  We all know how important physical activity is for mental well-being and always-----</p></speech>

He will have to blame his colleague because I am running out of time.  I did not think we would have the clock on but so be it.  I thank both gentlemen for their presentations.

I welcome both witnesses and I thank them for taking the time to come before the committee to discuss the work they do, which is critically important to many people across the country.  I am here as a member of the committee.  Previously, I have been here as chairman of the committee and also as a Minister of State.  Joni Mitchell had a song, "Both Sides Now" but I have seen this from three sides at this stage.  For the record, I want to say that working so closely with Mr. Treacy when I was in the Department gave me a great insight into the amount of work he does and the importance of it.  It has to be stated here just how important his work has been, specifically during the Covid-19 period.  That is not often acknowledged.  Like every public agency Sport Ireland will have its critics and people who will take pot-shots at it but I want to thank everyone on the Sport Ireland team for their massive response to Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic in March, which continues.</p> <p>  Mr. Treacy touched on some of the issues.  From very early on we convened a body comprising the main stakeholders in sport.  That was the genesis, ultimately, for the funding that came on board during the summer, the allocation of which was announced recently.  Sport Ireland's input into that process was invaluable.  Also, the return to sport protocols involved an enormous body of work which was carried out in a relatively short period of time under difficult circumstances, with most of it being done remotely.  It facilitated the return of sport in this country including the safe and early return of high performance sport, which people forget about.  That was critically important, especially when we see that some of our athletes performed very well internationally during the summer, for example, in cycling.  The work of Sport Ireland was crucial to that.</p> <p>  The messaging over the past eight months has been very important.  Sport Ireland's use of its platform to have a positive impact on the mental health as well as the physical health of the nation cannot be overstated.  In some ways it is a victim of its own success in that participation levels spiked during the first lockdown and into the early summer.  As a result of that, the programme for Government now has a very difficult target to reach over the coming years but I have no doubt that it is well up for the challenge.</p> <p>  I have a few brief questions the first of which is on the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.  How has Covid-19 affected preparations for the Games.  I know it is the same for every country worldwide but are there any additional challenges on that front?  Also, how will it have affected the cycle in respect of the Paris Olympic Games?  My understanding is that they will go ahead as scheduled in 2024, so Sport Ireland has only a three year window.  What impact will that have on European and world competition?  </p> <p>  On the European Cross Country Championships, we were looking forward to have those in a few weeks time.  The witnesses might give detail on how certain the plans are for those championships, which will be a major event for the sports campus and is very important.  </p> <p>  With regard to the unprecedented package of supports that have been announced and allocated, that is done based on an anticipation that we will get out of the Covid pandemic during 2021.  The great news today is Pfizer saying its vaccine has 95% efficacy.  Its competitors announced a few days ago that their vaccines had 94.5% efficacy.  Last week, the efficacy of Pfizer's vaccine was at 90% so competition is very healthy among pharmaceutical companies as well as sport.  Is Sport Ireland working off a deadline when normality will return?</p><p>Does Sport Ireland have a date where it feels sport will be in a normal place?  Is it working from such a timeline?</p><p> On the national sports policy, it is great that we are in a positive trajectory towards meeting our funding targets by 2027.  The policy contains many other targets apart from funding, but without the funding it would not be possible to achieve any of the other targets.  We have had nine months of Covid and can anticipate some more months.  How much of an impact do the witnesses feel that will have on the overall targets in the sports policy?  Will parts of the policy require review as this continues?  Are there elements which are now obsolete?  It was prepared at a totally different time and a different world and things have changed.  Does the plan now warrant revision?</p></speech>

We are working very closely with the Olympic Federation of Ireland and the Paralympics.  We have our plans and are looking at contingency.  We are just waiting for announcements from the IOC.  Next year, particularly in the first six months, there will be a big emphasis on all the international competitions that were put off this year.  We will need those for some of our athletes to qualify.  There might be a rush but the vaccine will help if all the predictions prove to be the case.  We will be giving priority in our campus in the Institute of Sport to ensure that all our international accredited athletes will get the vaccine as a priority for their travel abroad.  The new truncated period between the games in Tokyo and Paris will be only three years.  There will be a lot of emphasis and pressure on that.</p> <p>  We have had very little drop out from our international accredited athletes.  They are all still raring to go.  It has been an interruption but they have continued and we have given the exemption to allow them to train in our facilities at elite level.</p></speech>

If plans are put off, they readjust those plans.  They are also very good planners.  That is what training is all about - planning properly.  They dusted themselves down, started training and have a year to go now.  The hard part is the lack of competitions leading into these games and qualification.  The first half of the year will be vitally important because competition gets one ready for the next competition, which is the Olympic games.</p> <p>  On the European Cross Country Championships, I was on a phone call with Athletics Ireland and the European Federation.  We pitched for it in 2021.  It was supposed to go to Italy in 2021 but now we have it then and Italy has it in 2022.</p> <p>  Policy is hugely important.  We have developed a participation plan which links in with policy priorities and we are waiting for those to be published by the Department.  We are ready to go with its implementation.  The policy is an excellent document.  There is &euro;5.8 million around funding for the latter half of this year for some NGBs which might not have applied for funding in an earlier time because the big impact of financial costs were not with the governing bodies of sport.  Now, when membership dues are due, in December or January, is when it will really come into effect.  We have some money left aside for that purpose, so that the NGBs can get back into action as quickly as possible.  We hope that by spring or summer the athletes will be in full flow and sport will hopefully be back to normal, all going well. </p></speech>

That is the phrase Mr. Mulvey used.  We can understand how people would see the irony in this, given that Mr. Treacy has been in position for 22 years and Mr. Mulvey for 12 years, in breach, it appears, of Government guidelines on State bodies.  In particular, with regard to the absolute fiasco and scandal that went on in the FAI and that came to the fore in the past 12 months, Sport Ireland was the overseer.  How could anyone expect to have confidence in Sport Ireland?  The two witnesses are not in any rush to give up their positions on the board, which are well-paid.  They were in charge of oversight at the time of the scandal in the FAI, and it was not them who brought it to the fore but investigative journalism.  Considering the salaries and their length of time on the board, how can they genuinely expect any member of the public to have confidence?  Personally, having dealt with them on the committee, I will say on public record that I have no confidence in what they referred to as strong governance because they do not have a record of practising strong governance, standing over strong governance or adhering to it for that matter, particularly with regard to the FAI.</p></speech>

We have a number of programmes that we run with the IPA and we continue to develop the sports code for governing bodies of sport.  We hope to have compliance with everybody by the end of next year.  We place a large emphasis on this.  We do not have oversight.  The Deputy referred to the FAI.  We did not have oversight as during the period of time, we were not auditing the FAI's overall finances because we were only giving the association a small bit of money at the time.  It was only when the FAI agreed to let us audit that the KOSI auditors went in.  That is the background.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact the European cross-country championships will happen here.  There has been a focus on the support for elite athletes but one of the challenges for emerging athletes is the lack of competition.  There have not been any athletics events.  Part of the challenge will be how we get sport back on its feet.  Deputy Griffin spoke about the significant investment and this has been acknowledged.  We are looking at ways to support the NGBs through this.  It is also about getting sport back in communities on the ground and the role sporting organisations will play.  How do the witnesses envisage this will best happen?</p></speech>

They are still up and running.  They availed of the wage subsidy scheme also, which was a godsend for many of the sporting organisations and they were able to keep people employed, which was critical.  When the green light is given, I have no doubt they will be off and running.  Many of the competitions are not being held at present but governing bodies are doing things online and having virtual cycles and runs.  They are being creative in terms of what they are doing.  We need to thank the GAA, FAI and IRFU for taking high risks in trying to put on events during this lockdown period.  They have kept us all occupied during these months and they are to be commended for it.  It is hard at present.  Every sporting organisation and every athlete is biting at the bit to get back into competition.</p></speech>

The number of additional people out walking and running has been mentioned and it is very important that we build on this and that we are able to develop and grow it.</p> <p>  I welcome that Mr. Treacy spoke about a programme of activity aimed at men over the age of 45.  Perhaps it might also be a programme aimed at these Houses.  It could have a specific focus.  I make the serious point that there is probably a case for those of us who are in public life, where the hours are difficult and it is difficult to access sport, and it may be something that Sport Ireland may decide to target at elected representatives.</p></speech>

What was said about FitLine was very interesting.  I will reach out to some people in my community and talk to them about this brilliant initiative.  I have five questions so I will bounce them quickly.</p> <p>  Does Sport Ireland have any comment on the benefits of TV sport on the mental health of the nation during the pandemic?  I refer to the benefits outweighing the dangers that exist when sportspeople and their backroom teams meet up and train.  For many, it would seem that there is a benefit but I wonder if Sport Ireland is carrying out any research on the matter or if the witnesses have any comments to make.</p> <p>  Does Sport Ireland support the need for a light-up campaign in sports facilities in rural areas such as for GAA, soccer and rugby to enable activity within the 5 km boundary?  Should financial support be provided to clubs for such an initiative?  A lot of people have taken up walking in recent months and there are concerns about people keeping that up in the dark evenings.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p> <p>  We welcome the recent funding for local sports partnerships, LSPs, that was so badly needed for many sports clubs.  Unfortunately, many clubs missed out on this round of funding for a variety of reasons.  Does Sport Ireland and the Government plan to provide further funding for clubs, some of which are in trouble financially?  It is crucial to keep clubs going at this time.</p> <p>  There is an increase in the number of people working from home.  Are there any concerns in that regard?  My party proposed a right-to-switch-off Bill to enable people to separate work life and home life.  Are the witnesses worried about how the constant calls from employers might affect downtime and people's interaction with sports?  Has Sport Ireland considered how we might encourage the increased number of people working from home to take on further sports and activities?  How do we entice people to get out and about in the absence of work-based sports?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any comments on how the lockdown is affecting elite athletes?  There was a brief comment on it.  Has their funding been affected in any way and are they still able to train and work with their coaches in level 5?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1032" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#G00400"><p>I am conscious of the reprimand you gave me earlier, Chairman.  We support any initiative that will bring people out under the umbrella of any engagement in sport within the NPHET and Government guidelines.  The light-up campaign is one of those.  We believe the sports facilities, within the normal security arrangements, would allow for people to utilise them for socially-distanced walking.</p> <p>  During the period of austerity, there was an extraordinary increase in the number of people walking and cycling.  We noticed that again now everywhere cycle tracks have been built.  Further funding is also required for walking tracks.</p> <p>  Wearing my other hat, in terms of employment law and employment relations, remote working will totally change our whole approach to working and utilising the commute time that used to exist previously constructively.  We are beginning to see that already with families that are cycling and walking.  There has been a remarkable increase in sea swimming recently.  In a sense, we are beginning to utilise our natural assets.  It will be important to put more money into facilities for these pursuits.</p> <p>  To some degree, TV sport has given some relief to people's well-being, home life and activity.  That is important because sport is so central.  Perhaps Mr. Treacy wishes to add something.</p></speech>

That will be a big part of the walking campaign.  Funding will be set aside to help the LSPs get off the ground with local clubs as well.  That will be done.</p> <p>  Our message on people working from home is for them to make an appointment with themselves to get out for half an hour if they can at lunchtime if it will be dark when they are finished work.  That is a really important point.  We have a lot of programmes online that they can avail of.</p> <p>  Clubs did avail of the Government funding scheme.  The full allocation was made to clubs around the country.  The LSPs rolled out &euro;2 million to smaller local clubs around the country as well.  That was very well received.  Many of the small community clubs would have benefited as well, which would not perhaps be attached to a national governing body.  They got support.</p> <p>  In terms of the benefits of watching sport on television during the winter months, it is good for our well-being, but we must make sure we balance it with physical activity as well.  That is really important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1034" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Deputy Peter  Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#G00600"><p>I welcome Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Treacy.  I am one of the lucky ones in that I have seen the campus at Abbotstown.  It is absolutely fantastic.  The main point is that it is for all sports, as has been said, from equestrian to camogie.  It is great.</p> <p>  The most important word when it comes to sport is participation.  That means everyone can get involved, not just the elite.  The year 2020 has been a very frustrating one for everybody so far.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Sport is playing a big part in helping people combat the situation.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the GAA, soccer and rugby and all the other sports.  They put a fantastic effort into trying to help people.  All sports lost sponsorship, income from gate receipts and broadcasting.  Things are very tough.  In fairness, Sport Ireland played a big part in November with the announcement of the &euro;85 million in Covid-19 funding.  I liked the fact that the funding was distributed to everybody at national, international and local level.  That was very good.  The allocations were distributed through the national governing bodies and the local sports partnerships.</p> <p>  Today, I want to speak about the grassroots.  We can all see the US Masters golf tournament and the rugby on TV but an unbelievable amount of work is done locally.  Today's discussion is about the impact of Covid-19 on sport.  I know the work put in by local sporting organisations in communities in Gaelic games, rugby and soccer.  Everybody put their shoulders to the wheel.  People in communities helped those who needed to go to hospital or to the chemist's shop for medication.  The problem in recent months is that the small clubs in local communities are bleeding heavily.  They have nothing coming in.  Previously, they had draws or a pub in the local clubhouse but now they have nothing.  The money from Sport Ireland is being distributed but a lot of the small clubs are getting nothing.  Many clubs have good administrators.  They are very good at putting in applications and getting funding.  Mr. Treacy is a sportsperson.  He was a household name.  I get phone calls from clubs on a daily basis pleading with me for help with level 5 restrictions and everything else.  It is very hard on clubs.  Are the grassroots clubs getting the money they deserve?  I ask both Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Treacy to respond.  I am looking for value for money today.</p></speech>

The maximum grant was approximately &euro;1,500.  The NGBs ran programmes as well for clubs at local level, so they were able to avail of those schemes.  The funding was hugely appreciated by the clubs.  We have set &euro;5.8 million aside if there are other requirements from clubs in the coming months.  That funding is available.</p> <p>  The volunteers at local level are the catalysts for sport in the country.  Much of the resources are online in terms of supporting them through the pandemic.  It was hugely important that the Government decided that children could continue to train through level 5.  I advise small local clubs to make contact with the local sports partnership in their county.</p><p>It will give them as much help as it possibly can.</p></speech>

We have a resilience fund which we still have to distribute.  As we would say, for <i>ad misericordiam </i>cases that come in, we will have a ready ear for those.  That is before the end of 2020.  There is an opportunity to look at any particular cases the national governing bodies may bring to us or they can go through their local sports partnerships.  We had a tremendous presentation yesterday from Deputy MacSharry's territory, form the Sligo Sports Partnership, and heard of the work they were doing for the money in terms of maintaining activity during the Covid period.  Apart from our initial allocation, we are keeping back money next year to meet, in quarters 1 and 2, any contingency requirements we may need from any governing body or their clubs for contingency and emergency funding.  We have enough resources to meet this.  The Government has given us enough resources to meet it.  It is about ensuring funding gets to where it is needed most.</p></speech>

I have asked Mr. Treacy for years why swimmers from New Zealand and Australia did much better than ours.  We have big expectations.  I would like to see a few medals being brought back.  I wish the Irish team the best going forward.  We are a sporting nation and we love people representing the country.  There is enough knocking of sport.  Sport Ireland is doing a fantastic job.

They succeeded in creating confidence and a framework within which sporting participation continues to happen in a very safe manner.  That work has trickled all the way down to local clubs, be it the GAA, soccer or rugby.  Sport Ireland's guidelines and guidance has been crucial in supporting sporting organisation to navigate what has been an unprecedented challenge for all of us.</p> <p>  Also, heartful thanks to Sport Ireland for its work in encouraging increased participation by women in sport.  It is something I have been researching a little lately.  The figures are very encouraging in terms of what has been achieved in the past two decades or so.  They have far exceeded the participation rates I expected to see when I initially got into that research.  As the witnesses pointed out, the gap is closing all the time.  I thank them for the work they are doing.  There is great appetite among all sporting organisations, both national governing bodies and at local level, to assist Sport Ireland and work with it in a spirit of partnership to increase it further and perhaps to the point where, hopefully, women&rsquo;s participation in sport will overtake that of men. </p> <p>   Mr. Mulvey outlined there have been many challenges arising from Covid-19 but there have also been many positive aspects arising from the challenges which have been primarily beneficial for people and families in particular.  I am fortunate to live close to a forest trail developed by Coillte in conjunction with our local community.  It was literally overrun with people in the first phases of the lockdown on those lovely long summer evenings.  We saw families for the first time ever coming and exercising together.  That is something we need to encourage for the future.  Sport Irleand's work in the Keep Well campaign will aid and abet that and hopefully result in even greater levels of participation.</p> <p>  I want to make one comment about a sport I love, that of cycling.  Mr. Mulvey mentioned the significant increased participation in cycling.  We saw data from one of our national banks two days ago showing that the spend on bikes and cycling equipment has gone through the roof in recent months.  The European Cycling Federation has stated that the levels of participation in cycling, both leisure cycling and competitive cycling, have increased exponentially during the past 12 months or so.</p> <p>  Where are we at with the development of the new velodrome in Abbottstown?  I know it is an much an issue for Government as it for Sport Ireland.  We are fortunate to have some extraordinary athletes.  I think of Lydia Gurley, Lydia Boylan, Mark Downey, Felix English and many other young track cyclists developing now.  When they reach a certain level of competency and expertise and begin to win internationally they are shipped off to Majorca.  That is the only option they have.  If someone who excels in swimming was told that once they reach a certain level we cannot accommodate them anymore here and that they would have to leave the island and go elsewhere to reach the pinnacle of their talent, their judgment would be questioned.  It is as much an issue for Government as it is for Sport Ireland but I would love to get an update on that project.  If we had an indoor velodrome in Ireland we could bring over some of the best coaching expertise in the world, who happen to be Irish but now base themselves abroad.  I was in New Zealand a number of months ago and met two Irish coaches who are renowned in the field of cycling coaching but they have to base themselves in New Zealand because we simply do not have the facilities here.  We could create a wonderful eco-system of coaches and cyclists centred around a new velodrome that would see us having international success like countries such as New Zealand and Britain.  Where are we at with that project and how can we assist Sport Ireland in bringing that to finality?</p></speech>

It is the priority building for us having completed phase two of the indoor arena and the hockey pitch facilities.  We have already engaged and have had presentations on this from an international team of architects, based in the UK who came through the procurement system and have built velodromes in other parts of Europe.  We have already had board engagement on a presentation on that.  We have indicated to the Department what we are doing here.  We have got initial funding to carry out the scoping works that are necessary.  We have identified the site on the campus and have done the necessary scoping.  We have informed Fingal County Council about what our requirements would be with this and it is facilitating us with that.  It would incorporate a badminton centre in the centre of the building and also exhibition and spectator space.  We are recognising the achievement of our cyclists and the growth of the game.  That is the next big project and we expect, hopefully, some stage during this year to convince the powers that be in government to give us the necessary capital expenditure to achieve this.  We have managed our buildings very well and, thankfully, largely within budget.  We have a good track record there.  We are in negotiations with Cycling Ireland on bringing its national governing body building onto our campus as well.  We are converting a facility there to assist them on that and that is at a very advanced stage.</p></speech>

Our plans are advanced and hopefully it will be the next development that will occur.</p> <p>  On women in sport, we will be pushing to increase the number of women participating in sport.  The number is narrowing all the time but a big factor is losing women's participation when they reach the age of 15 or 16.  It is the same throughout every country and we then try to get them back participating.  As people get older, more women than men participate in sport.  That is why we encourage men over the age of 45 to participate.  We would like to see there being no gender gap.</p></speech>

I am due to be in the Chamber and I have to return shortly so I will ask one question.  I have read the opening statements and I thank the witnesses for their presence here.  On that issue of the participation of women in sport, we had Mary O'Connor from the Federation of Irish Sport before the committee last month.  She touched on that point during the meeting and during my chat to her after it.  A school from my home town in Navan, the Mercy convent carried out a piece of work at BT Young Scientist exhibition in January and Professor Niall Moyna from DCU carried out the analysis of that.</p><p>It took the underage female local rugby club in Navan to look at pressures such as body shaming and social influencers.  The peer pressure happening to young girls participating in sport is quite destructive.  The research in question is a huge body of work.  If we are serious about retaining young girls and women in sport, it must be tackled.  I am glad the school in question took up the mantle and delved into it.</p><p> It was stated the club resilience fund in scheme 3 was not paid out yet.  How much will that be?</p></speech>

There is a mechanism in place.  We asked for the chief executive to give a letter of reassurance that the money was spent for the purposes for which it was given.  These would be the two pieces around it.  We wanted to make sure there was no conflict of interest in the decisions.</p> <p>  These are the guidelines we gave to the national governing bodies regarding club schemes.</p></speech>

Obviously, in this period, they have taken a hit.  That is what was behind the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, addressing this under scheme 3.</p> <p>  In County Meath in the FAI's district league, a significant part of its revenue is based on pitch rentals which the fund does not cover.  This involves a large amount of money, nearly a six-figure sum.  That is the kind of gap that could put it out of business.  Has Sport Ireland liaised with the FAI to ensure the breakdown of funding request it is issuing to its clubs actually covers this kind of loss of income?  There is no point in the Minister establishing a scheme if it will not cover the losses of the clubs it is meant to support.</p></speech>

I thank them both for their professionalism and dedication to Irish sport, as well as meeting the objective set by the Government to increase participation rates and the distribution of Covid stability funding to our main sporting bodies.</p> <p>  The return to sport expert group is chaired by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  Sport Ireland has representatives on it, along with the different sporting sectors.  It is crucially important when we exit level 5 restrictions that mechanisms are in place to ensure people can go back to competitive sport, be it schoolboy soccer, underage GAA and rugby.  Ensuring there is consistency around competitive sport at underage level is important.  We need an action plan to ensure that it is well communicated after Christmas and into the new year.</p> <p>  Is the national sports campus available to all sporting bodies, be it soccer, rugby or GAA, from all different parts of the country?</p></speech>

Each sport developed protocols for the return to sport for the different phases laid down by the Government.  All these have been approved by the Department which has done an excellent job around all of this.  Those protocols are being followed closely by these sporting organisations which is to be applauded.  It has worked well.</p> <p>  One of the decisions we made early when the lockdown came was that we would keep the national sports campus open for the community of Blanchardstown.  We found we have hundreds of people walking around the place during the week and at weekends.  There are campus facilities available for elite sportspeople but also for recreational people as well.  Everyone is welcome to participate, to run around the cross-country course or walk around the campus.  We have weights machines around the place to allow people to do some strength and conditioning exercises.  It is a public parkway and people are welcome there.  The idea is also that we would stage events on the campus as it develops.  I would encourage anyone in Dublin to visit the campus because they would be blown away by it.</p></speech>

They have specific facilities there such as the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI.  County teams have availed of its facilities, such as outdoor and indoor pitches, to train.  Perhaps the Mayo team will take up the option soon.</p> <p>  The institute of sport facilities are also there for strength and conditioning.  The aquatic centre is available for swimming and exercise.  Up to recently, there was a good take-up.  We want the facilities to be used properly.  They are used under the control of the governing bodies and our facilities management.  We have had a high take-up from county teams, as well as UK Premier League teams which have used them.  The indoor facility has full-length GAA and FAI pitches.  The rugby indoor facility has a three-quarter length pitch with the normal facilities which would go with it such as hot baths, showers, strength and conditioning.</p> <p>  We want as many people to utilise it.  It is a revenue income for us.  It is also a way of showing what we have there.  It was built by the taxpayer for the people and organised team events.  Schools regularly use some of the facilities through the year.  There is a full length Croke Park pitch which might be useful.</p></speech>

That was quite frustrating for groups and clubs.  In level 3, however, I remember there was a great deal of unhappiness.  I refer to inconsistencies and the rationale for restrictions not being explained to people and clubs.  I do not think the communication was great.  Competitive tennis, for example, was not allowed, but the same people could play recreational tennis.  Basketball players could not throw a basketball to each other, but GAA players, whether footballers, hurlers or camogie players, could pass a ball to each other.  There were, therefore, many inconsistencies in that regard.</p><p> In Ringsend, for example, St. Patrick's CYFC, is a club that has men and women playing.  Some of the dual GAA and soccer players, in particular the women, could not play soccer on Saturday but they could play GAA on a Sunday for Clanna Gael Fontenoy.  That was great and it was good for them, but there was that inconsistency and it needs to be addressed.  Mention was also made that there were representatives from GAA and soccer on the return to sport expert group.  In order to inform that expert group a bit more, will Sport Ireland support and acknowledge the benefits and insights to be derived from having two other sports, perhaps non-contact sports, one indoor and one outdoor, represented on that body to help inform the decisions that will be made and then to communicate them better to a wider group of sporting participants?</p></speech>

Looking at the levels, the Government clearly wants people to stay at home in level 5.  As the restrictions are lifted, the Government will then want people to participate in sport, but not in competitions.  Things tend to be a bit more competitive in competitions than in sport which is for recreation only.  As the levels of restrictions are unlocked, competition will then be allowed again.  On passing balls, those involved in outdoor sports certainly have a much better chance of getting an opportunity to participate.  Indoor sport is going to be particularly problematic until we get down to the other levels because being indoors is problematic in respect of Covid-19.</p></speech>

Mr. Mulvey mentioned at the start that new governance measures had been put in place.

That is not just for the FAI but for all governing bodies under the code of practice, as I indicated earlier regarding charitable organisations.  This is a national challenge and not just one for the sport sector or individual sports.  We have, however, increased audit capacity within Sport Ireland, as well as our governance.  I mentioned earlier that we are providing seminars in respect of the code.  There has been a big take-up, with 280 people having locked-in for the conference on 26 November.  That will be done.  In the context of the FAI, we have a triple-lock system over that organisation's funding now through joint oversight of the implementation of the report on the reforms.  I refer to financial oversight.</p></speech>

There is, however, a constitutional responsibility in respect of governance and appropriate governance.  On the reappointment of the chairman, first of all, did Mr. Mulvey seek the reappointment?</p></speech>

I indicated to the Minister that I did not wish to serve for a further five-year term, which was a provision under the statute.  I did indicate to the Minister that, in the light of the circumstances, I was prepared to serve for another two-year period, if the Minister so deemed and it was appropriate.</p></speech>

There was obviously an issue in respect of the pandemic and we were allocating &euro;85 million in funding.  We needed a bit of continuity, therefore, and that was part of the business case.  The Olympic Games are next year and the European cross-country championships are also on the campus next year.  Those aspects were of critical importance and I wanted to see those events out.  It was my intention to leave at the end of this year and I would love to have been leaving this year but circumstances changed.</p></speech>

As committee members know, a change of Government was going on and negotiations were ongoing.

I was appointed chairman of Sport Ireland with the approval of the Oireachtas, the committee and the Government in 2015 under the Sport Ireland Act.  It was a new corporate body.  Under that Act, I serve for five years.  It is at the discretion of the Minister that board members, including myself, may be reappointed for a further five years but with a full limit.  New guidelines were brought in recently stating that there should be a term limit of eight years.  My reappointment is within those term limits.</p></speech>

I will allow it on this occasion because it will be short.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#L04900"><p>Yes, there is a vote in the Chamber.  That is why Senator Kyne has had to leave.  I will try to relay his question as best I can.  The question relates to super league basketball.  Obviously, it is an elite indoor sport.  I understand it was due to restart in October.  Some of the clubs have some American players who have come over here to play.  There is obviously a cost associated with that.  Senator Kyne's question relates to the plan.  When is the earliest we can have certainty for the clubs on return to play or what the future situation will be?</p> <p>  I am conscious of the complexities relating to protocols for any sport, but especially indoor sport.  Can the Sport Ireland representatives give us as much detail as possible in respect of what is happening on that front?  All of us are keen to see sport returning.  The Sport Ireland representatives touched on this earlier.  We are aware of the fact that some of the clubs and some sports were hit early in the year, taking the hit financially.  Some did not really suffer earlier in the year but now their activities are being displaced in the latter half of the year.  That is a challenge for them.  Can the Sport Ireland representatives touch on that?  I wish to get in one of my questions, if I may.  Anyway, those were the circumstances for the question.  A vote was called in the Chamber and the Senator was unable to ask the question himself.</p></speech>

When will indoor sports resume?  I do not know.  That is the answer.  They will resume when it is safe to do so.  We will obviously follow Government guidelines, as all sporting organisations do.  That was one of the conditions of the funding given out.</p> <p>  When will the restrictions be lifted?  Clearly, for indoor sports we are looking at the majority of restrictions being lifted so people can play indoor sports together.  That is a long way away, as I see it now.  It will be a long road, unfortunately.  That is the answer.  Outdoor sports are obviously safer.  That is why we are looking at outdoor sports.  I do not believe we will be seeing indoor sports any time soon, until we have a vaccine at least and obviously people have to be able to resume indoor sports safety.  That is really of paramount importance in all of this.  When people go back into sport, they need to be able to do it safely.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

We have given Basketball Ireland, if I recall correctly, between &euro;1.3 million and &euro;1.5 million as a special Covid-19 payment.  This will assist with the issue raised by Deputy Griffin.  We have maintained the funding for Basketball Ireland into 2021.</p> <p>  I wish to reassure all sporting organisations that we made our budget decisions yesterday at the board.  They will be getting 75% of their grant in January.  That will be a big support to them.  They will be able to plan for whatever they need to do.  We will retain 25% until later in the year before paying out, but they will get that money as well.</p></speech>

It is a time for everyone to step up and support local clubs by renewing membership.  Sport will resume.  We need to ensure we keep the infrastructure of sport in place and we need to keep the clubs going.  There is a part to play for members.  They can contribute to the clubs to ensure they are maintained and so that we can keep the infrastructure in place.  When it resumes, it will resume like that.  That is what we really want.  We want it to resume as quickly as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1581" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#L05300"><p>I am satisfied on the question from Senator Kyne.</p> <p>  The other question I wanted to ask relates specifically to sports partnerships.</p><p> We have not talked much about local sports partnerships, LSPs, but, obviously, they have been greatly impacted by Covid.  Will our guests give us an account of what the impact has been?  The work of the partnerships focuses on people who are under-represented in sport and who are trying to get involved in sport and physical activity.  One concern I have is that those efforts could be set back.  What has been the impact on them and how should we address that into the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1148" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#M00200"><p>The core funding LSPs has been maintained and that is the funding we give them.  It is approximately &euro;6 million, although we will increase the budget for next year, as well as some of the programmes.  Over the lockdown period, the LSPs have proven how much real value they provide to local communities and hubs.  They are there to answer the phone and to help them through issues.  The other aspect is that they have reached out to hard-to-reach groups to try to keep them involved in sport, and older people in particular.</p> <p>  As Mr. Mulvey noted, there was a presentation from our Sligo sports partnership at our board meeting yesterday.  It was very elaborate in terms of all the different groups being reached.  They have all done extensive work and it would be probably no harm for the committee at some point to hear at first hand about the work they are doing.  I think they would like to outline that because their work is invaluable.  I am sure all members, at local level, have seen what they do but it is important to state they have really tried to reach hard-to-reach groups.  They also reach out to people with disabilities.  All the LSPs in the country have disability officers who knock on people's doors and get them out and participating, and it is really important that that happens.  It is about ensuring that no one is excluded from sport and that everyone is included.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1557" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#M00300"><p>I might ask a few questions, although they will be observations more than questions.  I refer to an issue has not been discussed.  Representatives from Swim Ireland have appeared before the committee.  As our guests will be aware, swimming pools throughout the country have, no different from any other sporting facility, experienced severe impacts.  Most of them have been closed for months.  My local swimming pool was built as a community venture.  It was not built by the local authority or any sporting organisation but community people on the ground felt the need for a local swimming pool and built it.  It has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic and I am sure there are many like it throughout the country.  I would like to hear our guests' views on that and where Sport Ireland sees opportunities in that regard.  Swim Ireland recently sought applications for funding.  Swimming taps into all demographics within a community and it is so important to find ways for pools to reopen and keep open their doors sustainably.</p> <p>  LSPs, along with local authorities, are doing invaluable work to get people who might not ordinarily do sport involved in sporting activities, with initiatives such as Couch to 5K.  Events are happening throughout the country, in rural communities as much as urban communities.  The LSPs have some magic ingredient for getting people involved who might not ordinarily get involved, and have been crucial in keeping people of all ages outside, active and engaged in their communities, particularly in rural areas.</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke a little about women's participation in sport.  Recently, the Nancy Murray Cup for camogie was held, which Cavan won, I have to point out.  Social media campaigns such as See It to Believe It are very useful.  Mr. Mulvey noted that after the age of 16, there is a drop-off among women in sport.  Leanne Kiernan, of course, is a shining light as a role model for young women because of where she has taken her sporting career.  That is an area we all could do with working on and promoting.</p> <p>  I would like to hear their observations on the issues I raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2020111800002#M00400"><p>Swim Ireland is a successful NGB and is located on our campus, so we have constant access to it.  Under the first scheme for LSPs, we funded 1,600 clubs and, subsequently, under the NGB, there have been another 1,500.  It depends where the allocation came in, but those that may not have applied in the first round will certainly apply in the potential second round, and we will meet that.  We will not repeat the process but review new applicants.</p> <p>  Deputies Dillon, Fitzpatrick and others referred to consistency, and it is a big problem.  There needs to be consistency but the problems for indoor and outdoor sports are different.  As the committee will be aware, there are particular problems with gyms that have swimming activities.  My local gym is closed and we would all like to get back to that kind of activity.</p> <p>  The issue relating to women in sport sounds easy but it is difficult.  We hope that national trailblazers in women's sport will become champions of sport and encourage women to take up sports.  It is still a problematic area.  There are a number of reasons that women often drop out of sport at the age of 16.  One relates to a problem that sometimes arises in respect of team sport, namely, preparation for the leaving certificate, or whatever examinations, even though that applies to boys as well.  Another reason is the movement into individual sports, and there are some great personal achievements.  We are putting a great deal of hope and trust in the success of women's Gaelic football, which was the fastest growing sport a year ago, and that is true also in the case of camogie.  If a rugby sevens team is developing, that brings its own appeal, as does the women's international hockey team.  It is about creating champions of sport.  Obviously, the success of Katie Taylor and others such as Kellie Harrington in boxing has helped.  The same applies to athletics, where Catherina McKiernan was successful over the years.</p> <p>  As was mentioned earlier, it is about putting the current women in sport programme on the pedestal it needs to be on.  It needs to be upgraded.  The appointment of Nora Stapleton as manager of the programme will be a great success.  We have great advocates on the board, such as Lynne Cantwell and Olive Loughnane, who are champions in their own right.  The problem, sometimes, can relate to the fact that all-girls schools promote their sports, whether basketball, hockey, camogie, Gaelic football or rugby, but that may not happen in a mixed school environment, whether in community schools or comprehensive schools, where different arrangements are in place.  Perhaps in the latter case, more emphasis is put on boys' sports and championships than on female participation in competitive sports.</p> <p>  Multiple factors are involved.  We have compiled a number of papers on this and will certainly forward them to the committee for distribution.  We are making a big push in respect of participation and putting the emphasis on NGBs to apply for women in sport programmes under their own funding.  Over the past decade, we have set aside approximately &euro;22 million, which will definitely increase incrementally and has to because it is part not just of my priorities but also of those of the board and the executive.  On a multiplicity of fronts, it is about trying to promote the various aspects of the issue but also getting into the universities and schools, and telling them, at that level apart from the national governing bodies, that there is a physical education necessity to this.  Of course, we will recall the difficulty over the years of battling to get physical education teachers into schools and getting the Department to fund them at a particular quota.</p></speech>

It is being done by Active Ireland with set criteria.  That will be done sometime in December.  The Chair is right in saying there are huge costs involved when one is carrying a swimming pool.  We see it in the Sport Ireland Campus in terms of the 50 m pool.  It is very expensive heating a 50 m pool for elite swimmers while having no recreational swimmers coming in.  There are real costs and real needs at local level in terms of some of these indoor facilities.</p></speech>

The committee is particularly interested in discussing the role of the national broadband plan as well as regional and rural access to broadband.  With the increased numbers working, studying and socialising remotely, this issue is becoming more important than ever.  I welcome from National Broadband Ireland, NBI, Mr. Peter Hendrick, chief executive officer, Ms Tara Collins, chief marketing officer, and Mr. T.J. Malone, chief executive officer, NBI deployment.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with all such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Hendrick to make his opening statement on behalf of National Broadband Ireland.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive officer at National Broadband Ireland.  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak to it.  I am pleased to introduce my colleagues, Mr. T.J. Malone, who heads up the deployment of the NBI network, and Ms Tara Collins, our chief marketing officer overseeing all stakeholder and community relations.  Our chairman, Mr. David McCourt, has asked me to extend his apologies as he was not able to attend today.</p> <p>   On 19 November last year, NBI signed contracts with the Government to deliver the new fibre network under the national broadband plan, NBP, which is widely recognised as one of the most ambitious projects of its kind globally.  On 9 January this year, the contract came into effect and we commenced with boots on the ground.</p> <p>  The vision of the NBP is clear.  It is about making sure that every home, business and farm in Ireland has access to vital services.  It will ensure rural communities get the same access to opportunities offered by high-speed broadband as those in urban areas.  This includes offering the same connection cost and benchmarking the same quality and speed of service for rural communities as urban areas.</p> <p>  This is a project of tremendous size and scale.  It will serve over 1.1 million people in Ireland with world-leading, future-proofed, high-speed fibre broadband.  There will be approximately 544,000 premises available to connect to high-speed broadband, including homes, schools, businesses and farms.  At NBI, we are incredibly proud to be delivering the fibre network under the national broadband plan, which holds such significant national importance.  Our passion for delivering Ireland&rsquo;s new high-speed broadband network is what brings everyone at NBI together.  We believe that better broadband networks promote social progress, equality and sustainability.  With equal access to local, national and global opportunity, every person, community and organisation in Ireland will be empowered to achieve more.</p> <p>  Having commenced activities in January, NBI has made significant progress in mobilising our team and subcontractors in the deployment of the NBP network, all of which has taken place during the most difficult circumstances presented by Covid-19 restrictions over that period.  The Covid-19 pandemic has shown us the way we live, work and educate has changed forever, and access to reliable, scalable, high-speed connectivity is vital today and for generations to come.  Over the course of the last few months, we have seen unprecedented adoption of new technologies and applications which rely on access to reliable connectivity.  For so many of us, it will have been the first time we have ever worked from home.  Zoom, which was just a word nine months ago, is now synonymous with communication.  It does not end there, however.  The way our children have accessed schooling, the way vital healthcare services have been delivered and the way in which we purchase food and goods have all been fast-tracked to move online. </p> <p>  We strongly recognise that Covid-19 has accelerated demand for reliable, high-speed broadband.  We assure the committee that NBI takes this very seriously and I will discuss our efforts in this regard shortly.  Our commitment is to be part of Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.</p> <p>  The pandemic has created challenges for NBI in a number of areas.  Key contractors have restricted operations and in one case, a specialist UK contractor was forced to postpone its Irish operations.  Accommodation for contractors to work across the country has not been available.  Access to certain premises and locations, including the islands, has not been possible for long periods.  Equipment and material supply chains have been impacted from overseas suppliers.  The recruitment and integration of personnel as we and our subcontractors scale our operations has undoubtedly been more difficult.  However, I am pleased to be here today reporting that as a result of the mitigation measures that NBI has put in place to minimise the impact of Covid-19 delays, we have been able to progress our roll-out and hit significant milestones.</p><p>To put this into context, as of today over 800 people are now employed to work on the national broadband plan project.  We have boots on the ground in 26 counties.  We have 132,000 premises surveyed and detailed designs conducted for 92,000 premises.  We have commenced network build on the first 19,500 premises.  Our first fibre-to-the-home services will be delivered this year.  We have 200 broadband connection points across 26 counties that are now connected, including 36 schools.  We have signed up 33 retail service providers which will provide services to consumers and businesses on the NBI network, creating competition and choice from day one.  Last month, we were delighted to launch the first 50 of the 200 broadband connection points, BCPs, working with the former Department for Rural and Community Development and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  The BCPs represent a major milestone in the roll-out of the NBP and will provide free public access to high-speed connectivity at community facilities in every county.</p><p> NBI's priority is to keep operations on track.  Despite the challenging environment caused by Covid-19, the progress made to date and the recovery strategies we have put in place, where necessary, give us confidence to meet the future milestones and put the project in a strong position for acceleration.  I assure the committee that we are exploring every possible option to accelerate, and it remains the clear ambition for NBI to deliver the fibre network for the NBP in the shortest feasible time.  We spend a great deal of time engaging with local communities and we see at first hand how essential and urgent connectivity has become.  NBI has committed dedicated resources to independently evaluate the opportunities for acceleration and to formulate our plan.  We continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications in this regard.</p><p> I will put this project into the context of what is happening elsewhere in Europe and also give some context to our commitment to future-proof the NBP network, which has been a critical objective of the project since its inception.  Broadband connectivity is of significant importance for European growth and innovation for all sectors of the economy, as well as for social progress.  As a result, the European Commission strongly supports initiatives which align with its digital agenda.  As a result of its national broadband plan, Ireland stands to lead the way in Europe in the provision of high-speed broadband.  Ireland is currently ranked in the top five fastest growing markets in Europe for delivering high-speed broadband networks.  Over the next 24 months, the NBP network will reach in excess of 200,000 premises.  To put this into context, Ireland will have almost 90% of premises across the country with access to high-speed broadband.  In addition, the NBP network will launch with a minimum service of 500 Mbps, megabits per second, exceeding the digital agenda for Europe target, which has a goal set for 2025 to provide at least 100 Mbps to all European households.</p><p> Finally, meeting the needs of a digital economy has accelerated significantly over the last 12 months.  This network will place Ireland years ahead of other European countries in the provision of high-speed broadband and will empower a truly limitless Ireland.  I welcome the opportunity to take questions from the members.</p></speech>

I have a question specifically related to the implications of Covid-19.  I appreciate that it is almost the worst-case scenario.  Demand is now more geographically dispersed and intense, but NBI's ability to deliver on that is constrained by Covid-19.  Mr. Hendrick mentioned a number of milestones that have been achieved, which are welcome.  Are there milestones at this juncture that were intended to be hit but because of constraints or for other reasons have been missed?  Will Mr. Hendrick address the implications of Covid-19 for the cost of the project compared with that initially planned and for delivery timelines?  Is there contingency?  Mr. Hendrick referred to mitigation.  How will NBI contend with the challenges of cost and delivery dates and milestones missed?</p></speech>

Malone, who will give a more detailed update on the build programme.  In any project when one lays out one's plan for a programme, one builds in what risks there are and the implications of risks.  Every day we have to mitigate against some of those risks to ensure we deliver on our milestones.  I am happy to state that we will deliver on our milestones and we are confident we will continue to deliver on them with the objective of accelerating.</p> <p>  In terms of the overall cost of the programme, with what we are seeing with the programme as it stands, we are confident of coming under the original budget of the programme.  We do not see any significant increase in costs as the programme is developing today.  I will ask Mr. Malone give a more detailed update on the build programme.</p></speech>

There are four different stages before we get to finally connect a premises at the end.  We have a survey to start the first part of it.  That would lead in to the design of the network, which would then give us the information we need to build the network.  Once the network is built, we can connect the homes.</p> <p>  The survey is the first part.  That means we literally have to walk every metre and kilometre around the country to get an understanding of the condition of the existing network.  We are trying to utilise as much existing network as possible to get the delivery as quickly as possible to people.  The survey was the first part to do.  We did have problems or issues at the outbreak of Covid-19.  We had concerns about trying to get accommodation, as Mr. Hendrick mentioned.  There were no hotels available and there were no toilets or facilities available on the road.  At that stage we had intended to use one contractor to do the design of the full network, but we quickly mobilised two additional contractors.  We increased our workforce across the board, therefore, by getting three contractors.  As Mr. Hendrick mentioned, we now have 132,000 premises surveyed.  That equates to approximately 16,000 km of road and about 250,000 poles tested.  Although we were behind earlier in the programme, we have now caught up and surpassed on the surveying.  That is 25% of the total 544,000 premises - we are a quarter way through the entire intervention area - now surveyed and we are running at a run rate of about 17,500 premises per month.  We have caught up and are ahead.  That leads in-----</p></speech>

We did not intend to be at the run rate of 17,500; it would have been a lesser run rate.  We are now well ahead from the survey point of view.</p> <p>  That leads into the design.  Again, we were late getting there, but we have caught up.  The design is late starting.  We are now at 92,000 premises, which is well ahead of schedule as well.  When I say 92,000 designed, what happens is that our design partners take the information gathered from the surveys, analyse it and come back to us with detailed designs.  When that comes into NBI, we look at it along with our internal engineers and designers, and there is back and forth between the designers until we get what we believe is a quality plan with which we want to proceed.  There are 20,000 of them and 19,500 are currently under construction across five different employment areas.  We believe that by the end February, we will be at a run rate of between 7,000 and 10,000 homes being ready for connection, where we have built ready for connection.  By the end of 2021, we will be at between 105,000 and 115,000 premises.  We will have caught up on the build at that stage as well.</p> <p>  While we had initial problems, we have caught up on the first two parts of it and we are catching up on the build as well.</p></speech>

Has the ambition to come in ahead of schedule in the roll-out of the programme overall been affected by Covid-19 or to what extent is it a realistic proposition?</p></speech>

Covid-19 is an issue but the faster we can get the roll-out done, the better.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and departmental officials have approached us and asked us to consider looking at how we can accelerate the plan and bring those houses that may be in years six or seven into an earlier part of the programme.</p> <p>  To put some context on this, the seven-year programme was very ambitious and 144,000 km of fibre must be installed in that time.  In saying that fast it does not seem like much but putting it into perspective, it is like circumnavigating the globe three and half times.  There is a significant challenge and build ahead of us over the next seven years.</p> <p>  That said, we are very conscious about this and we are looking into it.  We have assembled a team that is specifically for looking at every single possibility of accelerating the programme and no stone will be left unturned in that way.  We are looking at everything.  Two of the critical lead time factors in any acceleration are survey and design.  If they are not done, the build cannot be accelerated.  We have taken the initiative to go ahead and accelerate the surveys and design, as I mentioned, so when it comes to a point in time when we may be able to accelerate the build, we will be able to catch up.</p> <p>  The survey and design is very much in our control and something we can gear up to but the build has a number of other stakeholders and factors involved.  There are infrastructure access providers, local authorities and licensing and permits that must also be dealt with.  All these areas and constraints have been looked at right across the board.  There are several bodies being worked on to ensure we can try to accelerate the process.  It is very much our desire to do it.</p></speech>

Is the figure of 544,000 premises correct?  The only figure I have seen as a target is 115,000 premises connected by the end of next year, which is 2021.  Will the witnesses give an indication of specific targets per year beyond that?  The programme is currently seven years so how quickly could it be fast-tracked?  Could it be brought back to five years?  The chairman of the group, Mr. McCourt, is on record with Reuters saying he is confident it could be pulled back.  I will put that to the test today.</p></speech>

As he described, with such projects we start with survey and design and looking to get them accelerated.  Once we start on the build programme, it is industrialised and it is about building efficiencies into it.</p> <p>  The first deployment of 19,500 homes is under active construction right now and there are 76,000 premises given to contractors to start the build programme.  We are making good progress into the 2021 and 2022 programme.  That will build up as contractors mobilise and we go from having 800 people today on the project up to 1,800 people over the next 15 months.  We will add 1,000 people to the programme in that time.  That extra resource will help us get to the steady state industrialised programme of build.  It is our desire, ambition and experience from other projects that once we get our systems and processes industrialised, we should be able to make some acceleration just in the normal course of a build programme.  In addition, we are looking at other opportunities and alternatives for acceleration.</p></speech>

The big issue is the blue connection.  These blue connections are to be serviced by Eir and other fibre broadband connectors but a large number of people have written to me who live perhaps 200 m from a blue connection.  They are wondering when they will be connected.</p> <p>  Will priority be given to people near existing or blue connections?  There may be a road where houses are connected to existing broadband providers such as Eir at one end but at the other end, the houses are not connected because of the existing roll-out.  When will there be a system on the National Broadband Ireland website where people can input an postcode and know when they will be connected?  As of today, how many premises are connected to the NBI network?</p> <p>  I agree with the comment that this is akin to the electrification of Ireland and in ways I almost regard it as more important.  Rural electrification brought light and allowed people to function better but, in many cases, people will not be able to work unless they have increased fibre capacity.  It is about balanced regional development.  NBI is playing a part in the second wave of a rural electrification programme.  It is an important feature.  When will NBI have a "traffic light" system on its website so people can see via their postcode when they will be connected?</p></speech>

We are starting in locations where there is sufficient space for the electrical equipment for power and there is existing fibre back to the main networks to the Internet.  We have started in locations where the infrastructure is available to quickly mobilise and develop from there.  Over the next 12 month,s we will be active in every county.  As we start to build out, we are servicing a significant number of homes close to the blue areas.</p></speech>

It is just the design criteria of the network.  We must start in locations that are typically urban or in towns that have fibre backhaul.  There is colocation space there where we can put the electronic equipment that creates connectivity to the home.  We start in those locations and build out.  It so happens that many of the commercial operators happen to be in those locations and there are premises in those areas that do not have high-speed broadband.  It is not that such cases are prioritised but because of the design criteria, we will start to pass those homes earlier in the programme as opposed to towards the end.  It is a critical part of our roll-out plan.</p><p>Regarding the communication of that, where we have produced designs and tasked subcontractors with building, we have announced on our website the townlands in which we are going to build in 2021.  They can be seen on our website today.</p></speech>

I will explain that.  Equally, if one enters one's postcode on our website, one can find out exactly the stage of the programme in which one is due to be connected.  First, one will be able to determine the areas being built in 2021 and, second, when a home will be ready for service connection.  Every month, as Mr. Malone's team completes the design activities, we will update the notification on our website announcing towns and townlands that are available for connectivity.  If one enters a postcode, one will see exactly where it is in the programme.  Over time, we expect this to broaden in terms of the number of townlands on the timeline.  Typically, our build programme looks ahead 18 months.  We have done our surveys and examined the designs and infrastructure required.  That might mean building new backhaul, co-location or putting in new passive infrastructure, poles and duct.  We start to map out when exactly we are going be available to build the network to connect the homes, and we have started to share that visibility.  We are providing information as soon as we can make it available.</p></speech>

Construction has started in Limerick.  When we say "Limerick", we do not just mean within the county; we mean a 30-km radius from what we call our point of handover, where our active equipment is.  Although we say Limerick, we do go into the other counties.  For next year, Limerick, Clare and Tipperary certainly will be part of the build-out programme from where we started today.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance as I must leave in a few moments to attend a meeting of the health committee next door.  We will be talking about the national children's hospital.  We all know what that means: overspending.  It is in this regard that I want to start today.  The NBI contract is massive and extremely important.  It is all the more important given the Covid pandemic and the fact that so many people are working from home.  Overall, the cost of delivery is estimated to be about &euro;3 billion over many years.  Since there is a multi-annual programme and since, by the delegates' own admission, there is still a lot of legwork to be done to determine what the network really requires on the highways and byways, what is the likelihood of overspending, perhaps not this year, which has already been covered, but next year or the year after that?  To what extent has the NBI factored in overspending and having to come back to the Government stating the programme will cost a lot more?</p></speech>

If the cost of building the network is approximately one third of the cost of the subsidy &ndash; the total subsidy number is the cost of the build &ndash; let us examine the position we are in today.  We have subcontracted the work on 76,000 homes to our subcontractors to date.  Based on the cost associated with that procurement activity &mdash; which concerns resources, equipment and materials &mdash; we are confident about the direction of travel for the remaining 400,000-odd homes in addition to the 76,000.  Over time, there will be changes affecting materials or labour rates but all of these are built into what we consider in terms of contingencies.  Today, we have confidence about the total construction cost, based on our experience with the first 76,000 homes.</p></speech>

Will a home having broadband installed in four or five years get the industry standard at that point or will it get what its neighbour a mile down the road got way back in 2020 or 2021?</p></speech>

What I would call the core network equipment that we have in the co-location facilities supports 10 Gbps per home but the customer premises equipment we are installing in every home will cover up to 2.5 Gbps.  The vision we had to build into the programme related to the infrastructure supporting the long-term demand.  In 2018 and 2019, we were considering launching with 150 Mbps in this regard.  Before we started construction, we had to move that to 500 Mbps because we are benchmarked against urban areas.  Today, we are supporting 500 Mbps to each of the homes connected to the network.  That was originally envisaged as being a year-ten requirement.  Therefore, the network will support 10 Gbps.  If the demand in urban areas increases beyond 10 Gbps &mdash; it seems like an outrageous number today &mdash; the passive infrastructure, which includes the cables and the infrastructure we built, will support it.  We have considered the vision for this beyond 25 years.  We can meet the vision with the passive infrastructure.  At times throughout the 25 or 35 years, we will have to upgrade the active equipment, but it is an easier upgrade.  When we are doing it at the co-location facilities, we can swap out cards and can send an engineer to site just to replace a box on the consumer's premises.</p></speech>

I realise it all revolves around Eircode postcodes.  At a previous meeting of this committee, I highlighted that in most cases postcodes are generated only on a quarterly basis.  Quite a number of people have come to my office stating they have missed the current quarter's capture.  Therefore, some will not get a postcode until February.  They cannot fully engage with the NBI's system and website because connecting a home to any network is very reliant on its having a postcode.  We believe there is a disadvantage in that regard.</p> <p>  As others have said, there may be a blue connection at one end of a road and another cable half a mile down another road.  There are many gaps.  People despair when they see NBI staff drive away from a crossroads at which they have been working and not come back because they are going to another community.  It is a matter of filling in the gaps.  This is what people really want to know about.  I would like to know about the Eircode postcodes specifically.</p> <p>  The delegates have has said NBI is doing quite a lot of work in Limerick.  I have seen NBI vans in Cratloe, County Clare, not too far from my own home.  We need to know a little more about where the infrastructure is going to be rolled out at county, townland and road levels.  In Clare, there are a number of cables in the ground that NBI is not allowed to tap into.  Perhaps the delegates could comment on this.  Ballygirreen in Newmarket-on-Fergus strikes me as an example.  The Irish Aviation Authority has its radio centre there to capture air traffic coming in from the Atlantic.  At its own cost, the authority laid state-of-the-art cabling through fields with cattle and rushes.  It is fabulous but it bypasses homes that desperately need it.  In many cases, NBI is encountering cables that have been laid by airports, schools and Garda stations but which it cannot tap into.  Perhaps the witnesses could cover some of those topics.</p></speech>

On our side, we will seek to connect homes based on addresses.  We will not delay for the four-month period; we will accept an update in terms of addresses on our system.</p> <p>  With regard to surveys in the blue area, we totally appreciate and understand the demand for broadband, particularly because of people working remotely owing to Covid.  Regarding awareness and communication, if a van is seen in an area it means we are at the stage of a survey, which means that within a number of weeks or a short number of months, we will move towards design.</p><p>Once the design is completed, that goes into a build programme and we can then share that information.  When one starts to see National Broadband Ireland vans in one's area, one can have confidence that at least one will get visibility soon in terms of when the network will be built and we can share that information.  Once one sees the vans, we are not just driving off.  That information is being taken back where we can do low-level designs and then inform a build programme.</p></speech>

At this time of the year, when ESB cables are down, it has a large team to get the networks back up again.  National Broadband Ireland has many overground cables in its network, some of which will come down over the winter due to storms.  With a workforce of 800, boots on the ground, has it an equal capacity to that of the ESB to enable it to patch up the network?</p></speech>

We have a team that is purely focused on the build of the network.  Then we have a team focused on preventive maintenance and maintenance of the network.  During the build phase, we are testing all of the existing passive infrastructure such as testing poles and clearing ducts.  As the programme is happening, one will see a number of poles replaced around the country.  Currently, over 2,000 poles have been replaced and that will continue.  That is purely build.</p> <p>  On the maintenance programme, if there are any outages on the network, we have key performance indicators that we have to meet.  If we do not meet one of these, we will get a penalty under the contract.  We have to resource our operations team to support the network in a steady state as soon as we pass and connect a home.</p></speech>

We bleed in across the boundaries.  South Clare is up and running with 1,300 premises under construction in Clare.  We feed back into Clare from Gort.  In May next year, we will start to roll out in Kilkishen.</p> <p>  We have 4,500 premises in Clare.  Overall, there is approximately 22,000 premises across Clare which fall into the intervention area.  Within the next six months or so, we will have 4,700 of those premises under construction.</p> <p>  It is important to note that we are trying to bring every county together at the one time.  We have a mandate to be in 26 counties over the course of the first two years.  No county can feel it is being discriminated against or left to the end.  We are bringing the entire country as a whole together.  We cannot go in and just finish one county at a time.  We will go in and do one area, come back out and keep rotating around the country.</p></speech>

We are building a brand new network.  That network is an inward-outward network.  We have to move out from where the backhaul network is there, and as we pass them, we absolutely will.  To use the analogy, it is like putting a light on top of a Christmas tree.  One cannot turn it on, unless one has power to plug it in.  There is no point in building them unless we have something to feed it back to turn it on and connect them.</p> <p>  We feel the pain of the people affected.  I have been around the country and met many of them at local authority meetings.  This issue keeps arising.  We will bring them on and serve them as quickly as possible.  We cannot, however, specifically take individual pockets and give them priority.</p></speech>

Broadband could not be more important to people.  I welcome the opportunity to have the company before the committee today to get this information out there to people.  There is an absolute information deficit in this regard.  National Broadband Ireland's website could be so much better.  I welcome the fact the company confirmed it will update it today.  We are living in a digital world but this website is from the Stone Age, however.  People do not know where and when they will get broadband.</p> <p>  Going back to the point raised by the Chairman on gaps, why is there not a unit in National Broadband Ireland to address them?  I can give several examples of areas in County Clare which experience these gaps.  With just a small bit of work, they could be connected and could engage in the world in which they now find themselves.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact the company has moved on in terms of the broadband connection points, BCPs, four of them in County Clare.  Three of them have been connected, namely, Cree Community Centre, Loop Head and the Michael Cusack Visitor Centre and one is planned for Stonefort, Caherconnell.  That information is on the website and people are encouraged to get access to that broadband.</p> <p>  Last week, I gave an example to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, of a broadband gap in Ogonnelloe.  All the houses in the area have broadband except for three in the middle that do not.  There should be a unit in National Broadband Ireland to identify such problem areas and fix them.  It can be easily fixed because one can build the network out to those three houses.  The same issue occurs in Mountshannon.  Again, on a whole section of road, broadband is not available but a short distance away, it is available.  This happens across County Clare and the rest of the country.  It is ridiculous and hard to stomach.</p> <p>  I welcome that the company explained the process of surveying, design, build and connect.  There needs to be more information about National Broadband Ireland as a wholesaler, engaging with 33 different providers.  The important message to get out to the public is that one can know when one will get broadband.  The witnesses have explained the challenges that have been presented by the Covid-19 pandemic but the information deficit needs to be breached and people need to be given hope.  This is a most positive project into which a lot of money is going, as broadband is now a necessity.</p> <p>  I wish National Broadband Ireland well in its work but it needs to improve on getting this information out to the public. </p></speech>

The BCPs are critical for delivery across the country.  We have a team which is dedicated to looking at acceleration of the programme and its opportunities.  Equally, the team is looking at BCPs, what works well and are there other locations or more schools we can add into the programme.  Similarly, it is looking at how we can deliver connectivity earlier to some of those locations that we believe will be further out in the programme based on this inward-outward process.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses explain, technically, why the existing blue connection points cannot be used as part of the build-out of the broadband network?  It is unacceptable and there appears to be a fundamental flaw whereby people could be waiting four to five years for a broadband connection when the neighbour they can see over a ditch has it.  I ask Mr Hendrick to deal with these points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-18a.1216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Hendrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020111800002#F00200"><p>I will.  Where I was going on the acceleration point is that we intend to update everybody on a local level but also on our website on the acceleration programme and the broadband connection points.  Over the next four to six weeks, people will start to see a lot more information on our website.  As of this week, we have started to see the build programme for the next 12 months where we are passing premises.  Equally, as we on board these 33 retail operators we will start putting that information on our website.  These will be the retail operators from whom people can buy services and the types of services and bundles that can be bought, including TV, broadband and voice.  We will make all of this information available now so people will have better access and visibility.</p> <p>  If I look at the blue premises, while we are not prioritising specific areas, it is a natural build programme and as we come out of the urban and town areas, we will pass many of these homes that have been stranded between the blue areas.  We are coming out from where there are commercial operators because that is where the infrastructure is and the backhaul, space and power.  I can say with confidence that over the next 12 to 24 months, we will start servicing a majority of those homes that are close to high-speed broadband and do not have it today.  Over the coming weeks, people will start to see the retail operators starting to sell to those homes because they are already providing services to their neighbours.  The fact we have all 33 operators on board, and we are accounting for 98% or 99% of the retail operators in the Irish market today, means they are actively going to be selling services on the national broadband plan network as they do on other commercial wholesale operators.</p></speech>

We will notify which operators have on boarded and gone through all of our systems tests.  When consumers go to that operator's website and inputs their address or Eircode they will be told a service is available, such as that 500 Mbps is available.  Depending on the retail operator, it may state it is National Broadband Ireland or another operator but the service will be available.  As we pass over the blue areas, any homes left behind will benefit from our roll-out programme because we are starting from the inside out because of the topology of the network.  People will be able to go to the websites of the retail operators and place an order and determine whether they are in or out.  Equally, if people input their address or Eircode on our website they will be able to determine whether they are in the intervention area or the commercial excluded area.</p></speech>

To date, we have five operators providing services in the broadband connection points.  They provide the actual Internet service and Wi-Fi connectivity in schools throughout the country under the broadband connection point programme.  As we roll out in each of the areas, and we speak about Cork, Galway and Cavan, we have different operators with a presence and customers today in these areas.  In many cases there are coming to us and stating they have 200 customers on a particular network and asking whether they can get connected.  We are engaging with the end users but they are also engaging with them and telling them the plan and how they want to migrate them from what would be a low-speed broadband service to a high-speed broadband service on our network.</p></speech>

They do not need me to tell them the importance of broadband to the rural areas of this country and the areas that are not covered.  This has been brought into even sharper focus by the pandemic.  People who might have liked to have had high-speed broadband now absolutely need it, and those who absolutely need it are in absolute distress because of the impact it is having on their lives.  The witnesses are well aware of this so there is no news there.</p> <p>  The only question anyone who wants broadband has to ask is when they are getting it.  It can be done by postcode, address or whatever flagging mechanism National Broadband Ireland wants but it is absolutely incumbent on NBI to produce a database of facts at the earliest opportunity.  The company should give its best guesstimate.  It is a year in operation, albeit with all of the constraints of Covid, and I accept this absolutely, but it has done 25% of the survey with 132,000 homes surveyed and 92,000 premises with design, and it is working on the network build for 19,500.  In terms of an initial sampling exercise, this should provide the company with the raw data it can use to extrapolate a master plan for installation.  Of course there will be issues and concerns but a resident in County Clare only wants to know when.  As others have said, there is nothing on the website that is in any way helpful in guiding this.</p> <p>  It is expected the programme will be fully delivered within seven years.  I could say to people on the phone that it will delivered in between five and seven years.  These people are planning their lives.  A lot happens in a year or even six months.  This will dictate whether people return to build, purchase or get a job in a particular area.  It is part of their life planning.  Some people will decide to move, quite frankly, because of the changes that have been brought about by Covid.</p> <p>  I accept there is always the hazard when projecting when something might be done that it will not be done in that timeline, and I have no doubt that if National Broadband Ireland sets a date, Mr. Malone, who I see is smiling, will respond that I would be the first to hold him to that target if he missed it.  It is better to set it out and give the best guesstimate.  National Broadband Ireland has the contract now and it does not have to big up any more.  It is now getting on with it and I, more than anyone else, wish it well in making that happen.  It has a job of work to do for citizens.  This will impact on its business because it has the contract and needs to get the plan rolled out whenever it can.  I know its targets with regard to key performance indicators but there is also a requirement that the people who will get the service know whether they will get it in year one, two, three, four, five, six or seven.  I have found in my role as a public representative over 18 years that when I get back to people, even if it is not with good news, that knowledge - in this case, a best guesstimate - allows them to plan.</p><p>If things get better, it is fair enough.  If they get worse, it is a question of the degree.  I appeal to NBI to put in whatever resources it can as early as possible in order to give people some certainty.</p><p> Other members referred to the gaps that exist.  People find it impossible to understand why NBI cannot build out to three, four or five houses or a little estate that falls outside.  Did I understand Mr. Hendrick to say that NBI is building the network out from the exchange, meaning that it will traverse the same ground that is already covered with existing fibre?  Am I right that in those blue areas it will not splice into the end of that but will go all the way back to the exchange and string fibre on poles and through ducts alongside existing fibre?</p></speech>

Looking at the capacity requirement over 25 years, we need to build in the scalability and the amount of cables that are required.  In each cable, there could be 144 separate cables.  We need to splice into that.  We need to account for the 544,000 homes and businesses that need to be connected.  We then need to account for growth, not just in terms of speed, but also new homes and businesses that will be added to the network over 25 years.  We have built all that design into our infrastructure.  While we will always seek to leverage the existing infrastructure that is available, it is difficult to build our capacity requirements into a network whose dimensions have been based on existing or historical demand.  We will always use infrastructure that is available and that can meet our demand expectations.</p></speech>

We will also use other networks that are available, whether passive or active, that fit into our demand requirements in terms of uptake and also new homes that come into the intervention area.  We built this to meet the scale of demand for 25 years and beyond.  That has been a critical part of our design criteria on the network.  There is plenty of infrastructure we could use, but we need to ensure that we can meet the benchmarking of urban areas in the intervention area for the future.  That has been a critical part of our assessment in designing the network.</p> <p>  On communications, we fully understand that people just want to know when.  The work that is now under way for the first 76,000 premises will give people confidence that the programme is under way.  We have 800 people out there building the network.  We will add another 1,000 people.  Every month we will add homes to that plan.  We will take on board the idea of breaking this down into phases giving people a better understanding if their premises will be done.  It is easy to say today who will be connected in 2021 and 2022.  We have discussed internally showing that people are in phase 2 or phase 3.  They might move and our ambition is to bring people forward.  How we communicate that is critical.  I would like Ms Collins to give a few minutes-----</p></speech>

Does NBI have a plan in place to extrapolate data it already has on the timing from initial survey through to construction and ultimate connection?  Is it doing that modelling and extrapolating it over a wider geographic base?  By the middle of next year, it should be possible for individuals to enter their Eircodes and get an indication that they are within six, nine or 12 months from being dealt or if it is going to be later that - even if it is 2023, 2024 or 2025 - it might get better.  That would be very helpful in addressing the needs of the people we try to represent.</p></speech>

We created what we call a protected ring that goes around.  We are coming from each of these active points and going out 30 km.  When we come out of the exchange, we are building multiple smaller exchanges, but we create a ring.  We create a ring so that we can provide the highest availability and reliable service.  When we start doing our first surveys and designs, we need to decide if we go left on the ring or right on the ring depending on the condition of infrastructure.</p></speech>

Perhaps because we engage with issues like this every day, we come to believe that the national broadband plan has been signed and is on the way.  In the past week, I spoke to two people who should know but they do not.  They were still asking when Eir would extend the four poles to get to their home.  It needs is a big campaign, with NBI, in consultation with the Government, reiterating what it is doing.  A big part of that is giving people certainty on the information.</p></speech>

We have been working incredibly hard to ensure we communicate with all our stakeholder groups.  In January we set up the website.  I take the Senator's point and we are looking at improving the information on the website, explaining the gaps which might not be gaps that NBI could fill, but information as to why a house in the middle of a road is not covered under our plan and is not being connected within a certain timeframe.  We are working on various animated explainer-type videos which are on our YouTube channel.  Along with the website, we launched all our social media channels in January and we launched the interactive maps shortly after.  The map had the end user in mind and is on an individual Eircode basis.  We recognise the need for the higher-level detail.  Members are getting questions every day from their constituents and we need to be able to field those.</p></speech>

As Mr. Hendrick said, we are committed to try to bring it to at least a two-year rolling update.  We have tried to bring it up to a higher level without the need to enter an Eircode.  The website <i>nbi.ie/rollout</i>gives a list of the first 21 deployment areas where we are active.  It will give estimated dates of when connection can be expected.  That information is there now.  We know we need to provide more granular detail, and we are working hard to do that.  The information beyond 18 months is not there yet.  Obviously, when Covid hit, we could not do any of the plans we had for this year, such as roadshows, town halls, pop-up shops and demonstration centres.</p><p>We have done door drops for the first five deployment areas.  Carrigaline, Galway, Limerick, Cavan and, next week, Ballinasloe are all getting door drops.  They will be told when they can expect to be connected.  Soon after that, we will go with a nationwide campaign.  We had planned a nationwide one a little bit further down the line but given Covid and the need for information, we will be door dropping to 544,000 homes over the next eight to ten weeks.</p></speech>

If I am out there and National Broadband Ireland has me in mind for year 7 or somewhere between five and seven years, and I receive one of those, it will encourage me to go back and establish it.  Even if it is to say that my location is in phase 4 and phase 4 is 2025-26, I will accept it.  I will have no choice.  But if I go in again and it just goes to a pit somewhere and I am none the wiser at the end of it, it is problematic.</p></speech>

We will do a national campaign so that people know where to get the information and they know where to sign up so that we can target them with specific information relevant to them.

It has been useful and informative.  In fact, many of the questions I was about to ask about information have been answered by Ms Collins.</p> <p>  This contract is without doubt the most important ever placed in the history of the State since rural electrification.  I am happy that I was one of the people who supported this contract.  Some of the people who are looking for action now were the very ones who were anxious to kick this to touch and go back to stage 1 again, which would have been detrimental to the people in rural areas.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Is the company satisfied that its contract is solid?  Is it satisfied that its contract is deliverable?  Is it satisfied that funding will be available to complete this project?  I ask that in the context of a number of people who are down the line in terms of connections who are concerned whether NBI will be still there, whether there will be funds and whether this process will be completed.</p> <p>  There were a number of issues I was to raise but I will not be repetitive.  I will stick to one issue to reinforce what other members have said and that is this problem that we have with gaps.  I am a public representative.  We deal with the public on a wide variety of issues but I have never received as many complaints or queries as I have in terms of the gaps with broadband.  There is a question to be asked here in terms of why, when this contract was made available, there was not some clause in it that would make it possible for a greater degree of co-operation between Eir and NBI.  All of us here have cases where there is broadband within 200 m, across the ditch, across the road and up the road, and then there is this big group of houses, including, farmers and business people, which have no access to broadband.  There was a time when broadband was optional.  It is now an absolute necessity.  I have a case of people 250 m from broadband.  They need it for their own business.  Their son is employed here in Dublin.  He has to work from home and he has been told, because of the broadband access, his job is in jeopardy.  That is the kind of situation that we are facing.</p> <p>  I also have a company that is literally next door to where the broadband is.  This company employs 40 in a place called Templederry in Tipperary.  The company does not have broadband access and it is hugely damaging to the company's ongoing business, particularly in marketing its business.  Taking the different places where the broadband is, the surveys, design and cabling are done.  Obviously, because there is a competitor, NBI does not have access to it.  What can we do as a committee in terms of communicating with the Minister and the Government, and obviously, the Department?  Is there anything that we can do to try and get these black spots prioritised and cabled?  I know it will need co-operation from Eir.  We have Eir in here next week and I think this will be our biggest bone of contention.  I will give NBI an example of that.  I have issues everywhere across Tipperary - my neighbours in Holy Cross, Boherlahan, Horse and Jockey, Clonoulty and Templederry.</p> <p>  One of the biggest examples I have is Terryglass.  Terryglass is a beautiful village.  It is on the lake.  It attracts a lot of tourists and visitors.  This is a good example of broadband issues in Tipperary.  In March 2018, Eir put fibre broadband into the village.  The broadband infrastructure was 90% complete.  Then, in 2019, when NBI was granted the contact, Eir walked away from the area and never completed the works in Terryglass.  One would have to ask the question-----</p></speech>

In Terryglass, for instance, the infrastructure is in place.  They left the site.  I looked recently to check where Terryglass was on NBI's website list in 2020 and it is at the bottom.  It makes no sense to have all the work completed and that this important facility is not available to that village and to the residents of that area.  There are several examples of this.  What can we do to help NBI bridge these gaps and give connectivity to the people who are effectively next door to where the service already is?  Is there anything that can be done?  What are the technical problems?</p></speech>

I will start by giving an update in terms of the contract.  I can tell the Deputy today that the contract is solid.  We have all of the funding committed and in place for the project.  We have established a contract liaison board with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We have proactive engagement on a daily basis with the Department in management and oversight of the contract.</p> <p>  We are meeting all of our contractual milestones, which have real meaning in terms of contract governance and contract oversight of the project.  At the end of the day, people care less about the contract and more about whether we are building, and connecting homes.  We would not be building the network if we had not met our first critical milestones in the contract.  With confidence, I can say the contract is solid.</p> <p>  Moving on to the gaps, when I look at this project it is about partnerships.  It is about collaboration.  It is not only about the 800 people we have on board.  It is about our infrastructure partners, and Eir is a critical infrastructure partner.  That programme is working quite well with Eir.  Eir has fully mobilised and we are working together in terms of access to and use of its infrastructure and making sure our teams and our subcontractors are aligned.</p> <p>  It does not stop with Eir.  It equally means our engagement with the local authorities.  Perhaps I will hand over to Mr. Malone.</p></speech>

When the Department started the procurement process, it undertook a mapping exercise.  It went to the commercial market and looked at what the retail and wholesale operators' programmes were for building networks over the seven-year deployment period.  Over a number of consultations, the last of which took place in September 2019, the Department received an update on where networks would stop.</p> <p>  When designing the network, we have to take into account not just today's need, but the need in three, ten or 15 years' time.  We consider the capacity requirement that is available and design our network and build our infrastructure on that basis.  Plugging into someone else's network might seem simple, but it is not from a technical or operational perspective.</p></speech>

Our network will cover 96% of the country's landmass.  Consider the connections between Europe and the US.  There are a number of transatlantic fibre cables because of the capacity growth that is required and that growth's specific needs.  The infrastructure providers that build the networks wholesale them to retail operators, but they are built to account not just for today's capacity, but capacity in five, ten or 20 years' time.

There is no need to conduct a survey because there will be no further expansion.  These are settled communities and we have planning laws that do not allow for expansion in their areas.  There is a missing piece in the middle.  What can be done to give connectivity to these people?  Homeowners, people who are working from home, farmers and business people are caught in this no man's land.  It is frustrating for them.  In fact, people are angry about it.  From what Mr. Hendrick has told me, nothing can be done about this until NBI goes through the same process that Eir went through, that being, to survey, design and then table a plan.  Why can that not be prioritised?  Why can the existing network not be used and an agreement reached with the provider to supply the connections?  Can that be done?</p></speech>

Equally, we must commit to supporting that service for 25 years with speeds and service availability.  In doing so, it is not easy to leverage anyone else's network.  We have to provide a future-proofed service.  Do not get me wrong - I appreciate and understand the frustration felt by those caught in the gaps.  Under the way we will roll out our design and build programme, they will be some of the first people to have access to the national broadband network.</p></speech>

The main queries we get about broadband are from people in gap areas.  Mr. Hendrick has still not answered the question.  Under the contract that NBI signed with the Government, could it prioritise the surveying of the gap areas and then do a deal with Eir, which is the main provider of commercial fibre cable, to link to its fibre broadband so that the people in question could have broadband connections within a year?  Mr. Hendrick is talking about the road, but can NBI do this under the contract?</p></speech>

People in gap areas approach their public representatives.  We go to Eir, which is the provider with fibre in the ground very close to the people seeking access.  Eir gives us a simple answer.  It tells us clearly that it is no longer the provider because it has completed the work in the area and it is not going back, and that the matter is for the new operator, NBI.  The Chairman and I are asking Mr. Hendrick something.  He actually gave me some encouragement, as I had not realised that there was a level of co-operation between NBI and Eir.  In light of that co-operation, could NBI not sit down with Eir and come to a commercial agreement to expand the existing service to allow black spots to be connected, thereby closing the gap?  Surely that is possible.  Please, do not complicate this by telling me that NBI has to future proof.  These areas are finished and have settled communities.  There will be no further development or expansion in these black spots.  Will Mr. Hendrick go away and think about this or talk to Eir?</p></speech>

In the previous exchange with my colleague, Mr. Hendrick, committee members asked what they could do to help accelerate the process and so on.  There are constraints on us.  We must build a network under the existing local authority guidelines.  We are engaging all over the country.  To be fair, local authorities have, to a person, been fantastic in that engagement.

Do not get me wrong; the local authorities have been fantastic so far.  They have been extremely engaged because they know their own constituents are crying out for this.  They are working very well with us but one area we are looking at is trying to get national agreements across the board so that we are not going into every local authority looking for permits.

The Department probably needs to examine that and determine whether there are technological short term fixes.  I do not know if that falls within the remit of the witnesses but if so, I would be grateful for an answer on it.</p> <p>  The broadband connection points are a matter for them.  On 30 October, I was told that 187 sites had been installed by NBI.  I understand that 59 of these publicly accessible points are live.  I seek exact details on this, including why they are not all live yet, although I accept that some of the issues involved may not necessarily be the responsibility of the organisation.  The witnesses also mentioned school broadband connection points.  On the same date I received a response to a parliamentary question to the effect that approximately 74 schools will be provided with high-speed broadband but to date only six have been connected.  There is obviously an issue there.  Are the witnesses aware of the details and what can be done to expedite the process?  </p></speech>

Following that connection, the retail operator provides the Internet and Wi-Fi infrastructure in the community centres.  It comes along after us and test its infrastructure.  We provide the connectivity from the premises all the way back to a data centre, where we hand over the service.  The operator connects into us in the data centre and it has to put its infrastructure in the location where it will be launched.

Certainty is very important and if this committee can help to progress the national broadband plan, it is important that it does so.  Many of us have issues with the blue and amber areas.  I genuinely want to applaud NBI for its honesty today, for the work it is doing and for its engagement with committee members, outside of formal meetings, when we make queries or representations.</p> <p>  With regard to the map, I am interested in place such Heatherfield and Earls Well in Waterfall and Matthew Hill where there are significant issues with connectivity.  The map says that premises in these areas are not in the intervention area because other service providers operate there and therein lies our difficulty.  Our difficulty is with Eir.  I know that the Chairman said that we should not mention that company because there is no one here representing it but there is a fundamental difficulty-----</p></speech>

If we learn nothing else from today, it is that there needs to be a synergy between NBI and other providers.  Members of this committee are being parochial in referring to particular areas and I can list Matthew Hill, Douglas, Ballinora, Ballyphehane, Glasheen, which are predominantly urban areas in the middle of Cork city.  They are not out in the middle of the Wild Atlantic Way, bordering the Atlantic Ocean.  They are in the middle of Cork city with no real access to broadband. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications mentioned Carrigaline and one of the witnesses also referenced Carrigaline in his remarks.  I hope they can give us certainty regarding the situation in Cork.</p> <p>  The Chairman is correct in his analysis.  The issue is the blue connection areas and being able to piggyback from the exchange.  Premises that are 100 yards away from their neighbours have no connection.  Reference was made to the future and this is about providing certainty and connectivity.  More and more people are working from home.  A survey published by Pure Telecom this morning indicates that 37% of workers in Munster have issues with poor broadband.  I appreciate where the witnesses are coming from and thank them for being here.  We are all citizens of a republic and we want connectivity and good customer service.  We want to be able to get answers and timely interventions</p></speech>

Mr. Hendrick has confirmed that under the contract, the company has scope to look at filling in the gaps with a provider, possibly Eir.  It may be able to come to some commercial agreement.  NBI was set up to deal with the intervention areas.  As part of that, it has to build out the network and in five or six years, it will have a nationwide network that will be able to compete with other service providers, not just in the intervention areas but in other areas as well.  That is what I understand from today's meeting.  National Broadband Ireland was set up primarily to deal with the intervention areas but there are critical areas that must be addressed.  There are people who can look over the ditch at their neighbours with high-speed broadband but they will have to wait for four or five years for a broadband connection.</p><p>That is wholly unacceptable.  We will write to NBI and our guests have given us a commitment.  Am I correct in saying that nothing in the terms of the contract prevents NBI from engaging in discussions with Eir to come to a commercial arrangement to deal specifically with the blue gap areas?  That is a "Yes" or "No" question.</p></speech>

We as a committee will write to NBI in that regard.  We want to work with NBI and to get broadband rolled out in Ireland as quickly as possible.  Nevertheless, we would like an assurance from NBI that, within that remit, it will prioritise the surveying of all blue areas now as part of that undertaking.  We will write to NBI in that regard and it will tell us if it needs us to assist it in any way, which we will do.  We wish NBI well and want to work with it.  That is our role as a committee.</p> <p>  In summary, will NBI examine the issue, respond to us and engage with Eir to link in to its broadband connections next door to these blue areas?  As part of that, rather than examining it on a geographical area-by-area basis, will NBI carry out a survey of all the blue areas as part of that priority?</p></speech>

What I can say, and we will take this away as an action, is we will look at the blue areas that are caught up in amber areas, that is, where their neighbours have high-speed broadband.  We will examine them and see when they will be delivered under the programme.  I believe that the majority of them will be passed in the early phases of the programme.  A big frustration, which we are aware of, is that people who are not in the intervention area, because the benchmark is 30 Mbps, feel they are getting less.</p> <p>  We are mindful of that but we are also open access and equal opportunity for the retail operators.  All the retail operators will sell on our network at 500 Mbps.  The objective of the national broadband plan under the programme for Government was to benchmark against urban areas and to consider the commercial operators and their commercial deployment.  The expectation is that those networks will have to increase to the same scale as the very urban premises and the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

We cannot have unintended consequences from a national roll-out such that there is a nationwide network but one of the last locations to get a broadband connection is someone living beside an existing blue area.

I do not know whether it is a common theme that has arisen but it is certainly a theme in Wicklow.  There is a great deal of anticipation and excitement about getting broadband, but when people look at the map and see their area is missing from it, there is considerable disappointment.  Will that be addressed?</p> <p>  Our guests spoke earlier about building out the ring of the main fibre backbone.  Presumably, that will be all underground-ducted to various nodes.  For that last bit, where a number of houses may have to be served, is it proposed to underground-duct that service, or is it proposed to use the existing poles network that may exist, whether ESB networks or the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs poles?  When fibre is put on a pole across open countryside, does that leave it more susceptible to storm damage than if it were underground-ducted?  Following storms, large parts of rural Ireland are commonly left without power.  My view is that the cause of much of that is that an overhead wire fell out and, obviously, overhead wires are more susceptible to storm damage.  When there are power outages, people will become more dependent on their fibre, provided they have power to use the device.</p> <p>  In Bray, the most urban part of Wicklow, when fibre was being rolled out by fibre providers to a terrace or string of houses, the owner of one house might not give access to allow the fibre to go across the face of that house to the next house.  In some cases, fibre was rolled out to two or three houses but the last two houses could not have it because a third party had said it could not go across their property.  Has that issue been addressed or can our guests see a way around it if it arises?</p></speech>

In line with our programme, part of the reason the build is taking so long is we are making the existing infrastructure fit for purpose.  We are replacing a significant number of poles throughout the country.  We are bringing into account what the network needs to be for the next 25 or 35 years and beyond.  Poles, typically, will stand for anything from 40 to 50 or 60 years.  We are testing those poles and have tested more than 250,000 to date.  We are replacing poles in each deployment area as we go and we are thinking about high availability because there will be penalties if we do not deliver a service that is comparable with that of an urban area.</p> <p>  While today, in parts of the country, storm damage tends to take down telecommunications networks, there are two parts to that.  There are the poles that have been there for a significant number of years and there are copper networks.  In the latter case, an electrical signal is sent down a copper cable, whereas with fibre it is not.  Fibre is much more reliable in terms of technology and the connection boxes.  There are no electrical signals in the connection boxes.  We use connection boxes that are expected to last for 30 years and beyond.  Because of that network refresh, we have calculated the availability of the overall network to be far greater.  As we have built those rings to protect what we call an east-west network to each of the connection exchanges, there is a much higher availability than people would traditionally have got with the service they have today, no matter what broadband or voice servers they have.</p> <p>  I will pass to Mr. Malone, who will give a more detailed view of the build and rights of way.</p></speech>

We use existing infrastructure.  If there is underground duct, we use it, while if it goes overhead on poles, we use that.  We are building new infrastructure only where there is a lack of existing infrastructure.  I am very familiar with examples such as the one the Deputy gave, where one house owner would not allow a cable to transition across his or her property.  That will not be the case with us because we are building on roadsides.  As a result, we are not running across houses or feeding from one house to the next.  We will be on the footpaths or the roadways.  In the event that we will need right of access to get across a property, we will look to go around it.  We will not, like some operators in the past, transition across houses.  That is the technique they use but we are adopting a different technique.</p></speech>

I thank NBI for the update.  I want to speak about this matter because I come from east Galway.  I am particularly interested in the area comprising Roscommon and east Galway.  In 2019, two of the schools that had the worst download speeds were in east Galway - that is how shocking it is.  The witnesses are fully aware of the disadvantages involved and how difficult it is to attract investment to areas which just do not have the same access to broadband and broadband speed.</p> <p>  NBI has &euro;3 billion, so there are huge funds.  The witnesses referred to 140,000 km of fibre cable, 1.5 million poles and 15,000 km of underground duct networks, so it is a huge project.  In Galway alone, we are talking about 38,000 premises.  I am one of the people who lives in one of those properties.  In Ballinasloe, right beside that area, I had just 7 Mbps and because it took 4 Mbps for me to download my virtual private network, I could not get onto my Oireachtas email.  I am renting a house and sharing with two others, and I was one of those who could not physically work from home.  This is crucial right now.  This is the speed available, and it is why I am talking about acceleration.  NBI has the funds.  We know the time limits have to be shortened.  It was five years and now it is four.  What measures can NBI take to ensure we deliver this as soon as possible to the areas affected?  Many amber areas are affected and people cannot work from home.</p> <p>  What measures can NBI take in terms of project management and increasing resources for contractors?  When will the fibre to the home network start?  The recent announcement suggested it will start soon but when will the first homes be on this network?  On the BCP connections to school and community areas, do the witnesses have a figure they can give me to suggest they are up and running?  What work can be done with regard to improving broadband for the marts?</p></speech>

There are 634 schools in the intervention area where we are looking at possibly accelerating those premises as part of our acceleration programme.  We have talked in depth today about the premises that are close to the blue areas.  As Mr. Malone said, we have a dedicated team looking at acceleration and nothing is off the cards, whether it is utilising other infrastructure or other technologies.  We are also looking to see how we can develop efficiencies into the programme, whether it is to do with engaging with local authorities, how we are building the programme or how we add more subcontractors into the programme.  We have accelerated in terms of the surveys and the designs by adding more resources.  We are absolutely focused on ensuring that we accelerate equally around some of the critical connection points, such as schools, but also all of the homes in the intervention areas.  We do not want to leave anyone behind in terms of that acceleration review.</p></speech>

It is crucial and I cannot emphasise that enough.</p></speech>

We will be offering them a service before Christmas, and we will be talking about which homes and how we bring on board the retail operators.  We have to manage those 33 retail operators that are on board.  We have all had varying degrees of customer experience in regard to utility services.  Customer experience is at the forefront of what we want to deliver.  There is no point in building a network without it.  The customer experience during the connection and in life is critical.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Hendrick say who are the four retail operators that have been signed up to date and when will the full 33 be in place?  Mr. Malone might comment first on the situation in Limerick and north Tipperary, particularly at Newport, Ballinahinch, Birdhill, east Limerick and Limerick.</p></speech>

We split the country into 227 different deployment areas in order to speed up the roll-out.  The first five are active and up and running, and Limerick is one of those, I am glad to say, as is Ballinasloe.  That is part of the first 19,500 premises in Limerick and, as I said, it will feed into all of the other counties as well.</p></speech>

There are parts of Limerick that bleed into it.  In County Tipperary, Clonmel and Roscrea have both been surveyed and are both being designed at the moment as well, and they are actively being got ready for construction as we speak.</p></speech>

I want to ask Mr. Hendrick an open-ended question.  The committee has spoken with one voice today and despite the fact we might have been starting from different positions, we all want to end up in the same place.  NBI has a responsibility for the intervention areas and it can see there are significant problems in the non-intervention areas.  How does Mr. Hendrick believe that should be resolved?  Do the Department, the Government, NBI, Eir or the other providers have a role?  How does Mr. Hendrick believe it should be resolved?</p></speech>

The digital agenda for Europe is that every single home in Europe should have access to 100 Mbps by 2025.  That is where the test really has to happen.  It has to come from Europe and that it is being driven from Europe.</p></speech>

We are not going to get there by starting in 2024.  That objective has to start now across the entire country, moving towards a gigabit future where everybody has access to 1,000 Mbps.</p></speech>

Dunboyne and Clonee are the first areas in Meath in respect of which we have already undertaken a survey.  They are packaged and ready.  They are one of the first 20 packages that have been agreed and where the contract has been awarded.  We are looking at the build starting there in either late December or early January, with a view to connections coming online somewhere in the third quarter, around September.  The number of premises is roughly 4,100 or 4,200 in those areas.</p></speech>
