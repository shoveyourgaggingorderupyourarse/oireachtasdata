    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#A00400"><p>No apologies have been received.  I understand that Deputy Devlin may be late joining us due to prior commitments.</p> <p>  I will begin by welcoming all to this online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  We are joined in person by Deputy Sherlock as he cannot attend remotely due to technical issues.  You are all very welcome.  The remaining members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to the constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.  Today we engage with officials from the Department of Transport to examine the 2019 Appropriation Accounts, specifically Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport, and expenditure related to the following matters: BusConnects, the driver licence and testing process, the western rail corridor and the search and rescue contract.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Transport: Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary general, aviation sector; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer, sustainable mobility investment division; Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal officer, regional and local roads division; Mr. Eugene Clonan, principal officer and acting director, the Irish Coast Guard; and Mr. Ray O'Leary, assistant secretary general, land transport.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer in the transport, tourism and sport Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside the precincts of the Parliament, and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name when first contributing.  The fact that we are doing this virtually means proceedings will not always run as smoothly as at a meeting at which we are physically present, so I ask members and witnesses for their co-operation in that regard.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#A00500"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport records gross expenditure of &euro;2.3 billion in 2019.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes of widely varying value.</p> <p>  The bulk of the expenditure in 2019 was under programme B, for land transport.  Expenditure on that programme amounted to &euro;1.9 billion and accounted for 83% of gross voted expenditure.  This comprised mainly investment in roads and road safety and regulation and current and capital spending on public transport.  I note that spending allocated to the land transport programme has increased substantially since 2019.  As recorded in the Revised Estimates Volume, the allocation for the programme for 2021 totals &euro;3.3 billion.  It may accordingly be time for the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider splitting the programme.  This would allow the Department to provide more useful detail about the various spending lines, in both the Estimates and future appropriation accounts.</p> <p>  The largest of the other expenditure programmes for Vote 31 in 2019 related to programme E, tourism services, and programme D, sport and recreation services.  Expenditure on these programmes in 2019 amounted to &euro;158 million and &euro;106 million, respectively.  Both these programmes were allocated to the new Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media following the formation of the Government in mid-2020.</p> <p>  Programme C relates to maritime transport and safety.  Expenditure on this programme amounted to &euro;96 million in 2019.  This mainly comprised expenditure on the Irish Coast Guard service, which operationally is part of the Department.  It includes recurrent expenditure on the long-term contract with a private sector supplier for provision of a helicopter search and rescue service.  Expenditure under the contract in 2019 is not itemised in the appropriation account, but members may wish to note that the estimated residual financial commitment under the contract is shown in note 2.8.  This amounted to &euro;155 million at end 2019.</p> <p>  Programme A relates to civil aviation services.  Expenditure under the programme totalled &euro;34.8 million in 2019, including financial support for regional airports amounting to &euro;21.8 million.</p> <p>  Receipts into Vote 31 as appropriations-in-aid are relatively small.</p> <p>  The surplus on the Vote for 2019 was &euro;69.8 million.  With agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;48.6 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2020.  The remainder of the surplus, &euro;21.2 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the year end.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.</p> <p>  The Department has an oversight role in respect of a substantial number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include bodies substantially funded from Vote 31 such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety; bodies that are funded mainly through charges and levies such as the Road Safety Authority, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Commission for Railway Regulation; and transport-related commercial State bodies such as the CI&Eacute; Group, Dublin Airport Authority, the Irish Aviation Authority and a number of port companies.</p><p>A list of bodies under the aegis of the Department can be seen in the appendix to the appropriation account.</p><p> Members may wish to note that, in the statement on internal financial control, the Accounting Officer discloses that shortcomings were identified in the process for procurement of vehicles for the Irish Coast Guard motor fleet.  Having reviewed the circumstances of the procurement as part of the audit of the 2019 appropriation account, I decided to examine the matter further from a value for money perspective.  We are in the process of finalising a special report about this procurement, which will be presented in due course.</p></speech>

While you have your opening statement prepared, in fairness to you, I would ask that you keep within the five-minute limit, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00300"><p>In 2019, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was one of the largest capital spending Departments.  Its net allocation in the Revised Estimates for 2019 was &euro;2.327 billion, comprising &euro;1.85 billion capital and &euro;742 million current expenditure.  The allocation of capital was in line with the Department&rsquo;s core remit in investing in transport infrastructure and assets.  Some 92% of the capital allocation was allocated to the land transport programme.  Our allocation and expenditure in 2019 was closely aligned with our statement of strategy for 2016 to 2019.</p> <p>  The high-level goal for aviation in 2019 was to maximise air transport connectivity with a safe, sustainable and competitive transport network and services.  We invested &euro;26.188 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.579 million in capital in the aviation sector.  This financed public service obligations for the regional airports as well as capital investment.  The Exchequer is not responsible for financing major projects at State airports.  However, two of the biggest projects ongoing in the State during 2019 were financed by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, namely the north runway and the visual control centre, both at Dublin Airport.</p> <p>  For land investment, our goal was to service the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.  In this regard, we are responsible for the corporate governance of the two lead planning and investment agencies, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  It is worth noting that over 75% of all inland passenger kilometres travelled in Ireland in 2019 were by private car.  Public service obligation, PSO, funded public transport providers carried more than 295 million passengers.  Of public transport passenger journeys, bus journeys accounted for more than two-thirds.  Until the time Covid-19 struck, there was a steady upward trend in growth in all public transport services, with near-term forecasts suggesting limitations in public transport capacity were being reached, particularly at peak times.</p> <p>  The Department has clearly defined investment programmes in all the main modes of transport - active travel, heavy rail, light rail, bus, and road - geared towards supporting the ambitions of the national planning framework, the programme for Government, and the climate action plan.  The Government has also signalled its ambition to provide competitive fares and socially beneficial services for consumers through a system of public service obligations.  In 2019, PSO payments accounted for 38.3% of the Department&rsquo;s gross current expenditure allocation.  Protection of these vital services during the Covid-19 pandemic required an additional emergency allocation of &euro;460 million for PSO services in 2020, on top of the annual core allocation of approximately &euro;300 million.  A further emergency allocation of &euro;370 million is required this year.</p> <p>  Under the maritime programme, our goal was to facilitate safe and sustainable maritime transport and the delivery of emergency management services.  Of the &euro;103.068 million allocated to the maritime sector, &euro;77.235 million supported Coast Guard services, &euro;62.515 million of which was invested in the Coast Guard search and rescue service delivered by CHC Ireland DAC.  A budget allocation of &euro;5.659 million was also invested by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who are responsible for maintaining marine navigation systems in Irish waters.</p> <p>  Turning to sport, our goal in 2019 was to contribute to a healthy and more active society by promoting sports participation, supporting high performance and the provision of sport facilities.  A total of &euro;126.162 million in Exchequer funding was provided to sport that year.  The bulk of the funds were allocated to the sports grants scheme and to Sport Ireland.</p> <p>  On tourism, we focused on supporting the industry to grow in a sustainable way.  The vast bulk of Exchequer funds were disbursed directly to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and to Tourism Ireland, which has responsibility for promoting tourism on an all-island basis.  Some &euro;175.655 million was allocated for tourism investment.  Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the marketing and product development funds managed by the two agencies accounted for over 91% of the budget allocation.</p> <p>  Projects under our remit will be key to improving citizens&rsquo; quality of life.  We all want less congestion, cleaner air and pleasant journeys.  We also want to play our climate part and improve our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity.  As we progress towards the tendering and construction phases of major infrastructure projects, we must be mindful of the reasons major projects overrun on cost, but also, if the right projects are successfully planned and delivered, of the significant benefits that will accrue.  I am confident that, as a Department, we are taking an effective governance approach which emphasises responsible and prudent management of public funds and that we will see the benefits of careful planning and investment starting to emerge over the coming years.</p> <p>  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s remarks regarding it potentially being time for the Department to consider splitting the programme.  That is something we will take up with our colleagues at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Deputy Dillon has 15 minutes.  The second speaker is Deputy Sherlock, who has ten minutes.  All other speakers have five minutes.  As time is limited, I will keep members to that time and will try to allow for a second round of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00500"><p>I welcome our witnesses here today.  I acknowledge their work done during the pandemic to keep their Department functional.  As time is limited, I will jump straight in.  My first question is for Mr. Spratt regarding the national development plan, which is being revamped and is due for publication in July.  I would like to get Mr. Spratt's thoughts on whether priority should be given to balanced regional development in the building of infrastructure, be it rail, road, regional airports, ports, or whatever.  Given that the west and north west was downgraded by the European Union from a developed region to a region in transition last year, and in this case there is urgent need for positive discrimination into the future, what is Mr. Spratt's assessment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00600"><p>We are engaging with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the national development plan.  We have our own sectoral strategy which is called the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI.  That sets out a number of priorities for us, and balanced regional development is one of them.  We also have other priorities and none of them are ranked, so they are equal priorities.  They are decarbonisation, protection and renewal, urban mobility of people and goods, movement of people and goods in the regions, and regional connectivity.</p> <p>  We also have a number of hierarchies which guide us on how we should invest.  Those hierarchies are modal and investment.  From a modal perspective, we try to prioritise active travel before we move to public transport, and before we move to private car.  From an investment perspective, we try first to maintain, then optimise, then improve, and only following this only will we get into new investment.  Having said that, balanced regional development is very important.  It is one of the priorities and one of the things we have uppermost in our minds as we engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the review of the national development plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00700"><p>I thank Mr. Spratt for that.  Coming from a rural constituency and representing people in Mayo, it is concerning that a report commissioned by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, Region in Transition - the Way Forward, found that there is a startling level of inequality in investment across key areas, one being infrastructure and transport.  Certainly, a failure to address these critical investment shortfalls means there will be a two-speed economy developed in Ireland, with one being on the east coast and the other being left behind on the west coast.</p> <p>  Looking at the appropriation accounts, making provisions for the regional airport programme is crucially important for my constituency and for Knock Airport.</p><p>I want to get an understanding of the expenditure in 2019.  It was increased to &euro;21.8 million to maintain and improve air access to the regions.  How was the amount calculated and determined per airport?  Can we be provided with a breakdown of the expenditure in subheading A3? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#C00200"><p>If I point to the total capital provision over the five years, 2015 to 2019, Knock had &euro;14,751,520 in capital funding.  On top of that, there was current funding of &euro;8.441 million over 2015 to 2020.  It is a fairly significant amount over five years.</p> <p>  The national aviation policy recognises the role of smaller airports in supporting regional development and commits to supporting them to make a sustainable contribution to their respective local economies and communities through the regional airports programme.  The 2019 outturn for Knock was &euro;9.48 million.  I will refer to some of the investments we made.  The grant aid total at Knock of &euro;27 million was provided under the regional airports programme to support essential safety and security-related projects and activities at the three regional airports, Donegal, Knock and Kerry, over 2018 to 2020.  The larger of the capital projects recently funded through the regional airports programme include the following at Knock Airport: &euro;207,000 provided for a medical fitness facility for fire crew project in 2018 and around &euro;526,000 for a whole baggage screening upgrade project in 2018, and &euro;850,000 in 2019.  Exchequer funding of around &euro;1.173 million was given to a runway overlay project; &euro;6.6 million and &euro;550,000 were paid during 2018, 2019 and 2020.  For 2019 the figure for the overlay project was &euro;6.6 million.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

Given the impact of Covid-19 has been enormous, what supports has the Department offered during the pandemic?  Has it assessed the impact on each of the regional airports?  It is hugely important that they continue to be supported.  As what level has the Department engaged with Knock on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#C00400"><p>There are a number of things that we can do for airports, as well as ferry ports and airlines around Covid.  The first thing the Government did was provide horizontal supports which help employees in the airports and ferry ports.  There were three things we were very focused on during the pandemic.  We needed to keep the airports open, we also needed to engage with our colleagues across Government on the restrictions to ensure the impact on airports and ferry ports was fully understood.  We did that with our colleagues in the Department of Health and through the Department of the Taoiseach as well.  The third thing will be incentives in due course, once the restrictions are eased, and what levels of incentives we need to ensure the airlines come into those airports.</p></speech>

The construction cost of some 500 m of this tunnel is estimated at &euro;650 million, three times what the western rail corridor will cost for 52 km.  What are Mr. Spratt's thoughts?</p></speech>

We do have instructions to deliver as set out in the programme for Government.  We know we have to improve public transport provision, not only in Dublin city but all cities and all regional and rural areas.  It is hugely important that we give the consideration required to all the projects at the outset.  While it might look like a huge amount on a relatively small piece of connectivity we believe once we go through the public spending code and cost benefit analyses, we will get to a point where we can decide whether it is good value for money.  Those figures are being spoken about by third parties but we have not got to the point where those costs and benefits have been assessed.  We do not have that level of detail.  There is a public spending code which we have to go through which we will do.</p></speech>

When we see projects that cost billions of euro compared to what we are looking for in the west, it leads us to question the Department's priorities.  It is difficult for us to accept some consultants' reports discussing the economic feasibility of a project against what is determined by officials in the Department.  There is frustration out there.</p> <p>  I will briefly touch on the Coast Guard.  I come from a constituency where it has units in Westport, Achill, Killala and Ballyglass.  They are a hugely important part of coastal areas, with volunteers providing an important service.  There was an underspend in Coast Guard purchases and upgrades in 2019.  Why was that and what was the reason for the delay?  What, if any, impact was there on services by not having this equipment?  </p></speech>

The Coast Guard has Westport, Achill and Ballyglass and another 44 stations around the coast.  We started from a very low base.  We inherited the Coast Guard stations going back to 1993, which are mostly the old rocket houses, which were basically garages fit for a horse and cart and some equipment.  Since then we invested an awful lot of money and brought them up to scratch.  We have a building programme with the OPW.  The priority in the building programme is Greystones, followed by Westport -----</p></speech>

We have a budget available, we are going through the planning process with Greystones, Westport and Killmore Quay and to a lesser extent in Cleggan.  The OPW getting planning permissions and going to tender has been delayed because of Covid.  The delays account for some of the underspend.</p> <p>  We hope to turn the sod at Greystones later this year and we hope to award the contract for the tender at the end of this year for Westport.

More priority needs to be given to the upgrading of facilities in many of these areas which are crying out for better training centres and facilities to provide their services.  We have seen a tremendous effort in Blacksod following the Rescue R116 incident.  It is imperative that we respond to all of these people in a way that ensures that their value is fully recognised.  That is the response from the constituents that I talk to in these areas.  Westport and Ballyglass need a certain focus and this could be expedited as we move forward with the capital programme.</p></speech>

We have a building programme.  There are 11 buildings on the list and we have 44.  We normally get a new building across the line every two to three years.  It started approximately ten years ago.  We have a methodology and are going through the scope.  Where we do not have adequate resources, which are some of the rocket houses, including the house in Cleggan, we have put in temporary facilities.  If we cannot get the temporary facilities in due to the leasing of land or whatever, we have to make arrangements with local hotels for such facilities, where they can do their training.  That is what we are trying to do and I assure the Deputy that we are very much on top of the building programme and in touch with our volunteers on the coast.  After all, these are the people who risk their lives and we support them with training.</p></speech>

I welcome the officials.  I will focus on programme B, land transport, which is 80% of the overall gross expenditure for 2019.  I also acknowledge that the 2021 total is &euro;3.3 billion.  Arising from land transport, there is the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The Secretary General will be aware that there is a serious backlog in driver theory testing and driver testing.  Approximately 100,000 people are waiting for driver theory testing and the number is similar for the other test.</p> <p>  Today's issue is the relationship between the Department of Transport and the RSA in working through the backlog of lists.  I wish to explore further that relationship in how resources are deployed by the Department to the RSA.  The reason I am asking specifically about the RSA is that notwithstanding the positive engagement that I have had with the agency on driver theory testing and driver test backlogs, the announcement in the past number of days of an interim solution to be provided by moving driver theory testing online did not get off to a great start because the number of people who will be tested under that online system will be 4,000.  </p> <p>  There are also further inherent issues then as to how the technology is deployed.  Why, for instance, are only 4,000 people being tested online with this new interim solution?  How is the Department resourcing that?  What is the nature of the relationship of the RSA with the Department to ensure that we move from 4,000 being tested up to the full cohort and backlog being tested, which is the full 100,000 plus of people who are waiting for tests?  </p> <p>  What are the technological issues arising from this interim solution where we are being told that to apply for the online driving test someone has to have a Windows 8 personal computer, PC, or above and that those using a phone, tablet or Mac computer will be excluded, as will those using android or iOS?  Applicants must also be able to use Google Chrome and the minimum speed has to be 5 Mbps.  </p> <p>  I want to explore with the Department its relationship with the RSA on the basis that it is a key Department in getting Ireland moving again in a post Covid-19 society.  If we are to get people off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other Department of Social Protection payments to enable them to move, we need driver theory and driver testing to be fit for purpose.  What is Mr. Spratt's current appraisal on when the Department expects that full cohort of people to be tested and what resources are being deployed by his Department to ensure that the RSA is fully resourced so that people can get back on the road?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#D00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  There are a number of questions and I will do my best to answer as many as I can.  I may in due course call on my colleague, Mr O&rsquo;Leary, who heads up our roads and related matters division.</p> <p>  First, there is a significant backlog in the number of tests as a result of Covid-19.  That is something that we want to tackle as quickly as we possibly can.  Our colleagues at the RSA were looking at an additional 80 contract testers to be hired.  It is also looking at permission to retain or rehire 36 testers which the authority previously had or may have on its books at the moment, but wants to ensure that it has the full 36.</p> <p>  Initially, we gave approval for those 36 to be retained or rehired and for an additional 40.  However, given that the pandemic has lasted longer than we had anticipated when we first decided on this, the management board just on this past Tuesday took a decision to provide the additional 40.  Now, instead of there being an additional 40, there will now be an additional 80 testers.  The first tranche of 40 are in training at the moment and will be testing through their training in June and July.  The second tranche of 40, once we have settled everything and have crossed the t's and dotted the i's with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will be taken from the panel we have in place as we do not have to go through a recruitment process, and provided that we get that sanction, we will be able to put those in place reasonably quickly.  That will give us additional testing capacity.      </p> <p>  The RSA is also working on the setting up of additional centres.  We are hoping that we will be able to move through the backlog reasonably quickly.  That should make a good and decent dent in the testing backlog.</p> <p>  As to the theory testing, I agree with the Deputy that in this day and age people want to access public services on all platforms and want user-friendly services to be provided very quickly.  I was disappointed when I read reports on the online theory test being confined to certain technologies and operating systems.  That is something that I am just hearing about in the past number of days and is something that I want to engage on with the RSA.  If it is the case that this needs additional help from us, that is certainly something that we will be willing to consider.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, I have a very good personal relationship with the RSA as I believe has the Department.  I meet with the chief executive of all of the agencies at least twice a year with nothing on the agenda.  I also meet with them from time to time when needs arise.  We have a good relationship but are very conscious of the need, to use the Deputy&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo; to get Ireland moving again&rdquo; to ensure that people can get back to work, education  and can go about their business as usual.  In rural Ireland, in particular, that means that people must be able to drive their cars.  We are very conscious of the need to get going on all of this.</p><p>We will leave no stone unturned to make sure we get the backlog cleared as quickly as possible.  I commit to taking up the matters the Deputy raised with the chief executive before the close of business tomorrow.</p></speech>

The 100,000 people waiting for the driver theory test and the 100,000 who are waiting for the full test may take some comfort from those words.  For the cohort who are waiting on the driver theory test, the technology needs to be user-friendly and fit for purpose and there should be protocols put in place in terms of the use of the technology, in that when camera technology is being used, assurances are given to the person who is being tested that any data collected is collected in a safe and appropriate way.  That is important for people who have decided to put trust in the system.</p> <p>  If the RSA can reach a target of 50,000 per month, the lists will be got through within a short space of time.  I welcome the statement by the Secretary General on providing us with an update and commitments in respect of close of business tomorrow.  It is important we ensure we can get people moving again.  So many people are reliant on this.  It is an important service for everybody in this country.</p></speech>

On B6 in the Vote, the smarter travel carbon reduction, particularly as it relates to small public service vehicles, SPSVs, there was an &euro;8.9 million budgeted amount and a &euro;5.6 million outturn.  Will Mr. Spratt talk through the reasons for that shortfall?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#E00400"><p>I mention the electrification of small public service vehicles, such as the fleets and taxis.  We have a national electric SPSV grant scheme.  It was established in 2018 by the then Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to support the electrification of taxi, hackney and limousine fleets.  The scheme initially provided grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles, BEVs, and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, PHEVs.  To encourage greater take-up, the grant levels were increased in 2020 to &euro;10,000 and &euro;5,000 for BEVs and PHEVs, respectively.  Between 2018 and 2020, this initiative supported the registration of 101 electric SPSVs through grants of &euro;627,000.</p> <p>  In addition, &euro;1.5 million was allocated in 2020, to support a small public service vehicle recharging network scheme, which will see the installation of SPSV dedicated electric vehicle, EV, fast charging infrastructure at transport hubs around the country.  Chargers were installed at Dublin and Cork airports as well as Heuston Station, Cork Kent Station and Limerick Colbert Station.</p> <p>  While we in the Department have just taken responsibility for EVs, we have been supporting the EV tolling incentive scheme since 2018, as I am sure the Deputy knows.  The EV tolling incentive scheme provides discounts of approximately 50% on tolls for electric cars and vans.  To date, registered vehicles have made more than 1.3 million discounted journeys and can claim up to &euro;1,000 back every year.</p></speech>

We all want to see a decarbonisation of the fleet, but there are clearly issues other than the grants which are being made available, especially to taxi drivers.  As Mr. Spratt knows, taxi drivers will gather in Merrion Square today and many will say, in terms the end-of-life vehicle changes, they are not in a position to be able to garner credit, even with the electric vehicle grants, especially given the past year but also generally.  Clearly, there is an inability to spend it as a result of structural problems, and we need to look at those structural problems.  Are the Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, looking at why that shortfall was not spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#E00600"><p>We are.  There was a lower than anticipated uptake of the grants.  We accept that.  It might be owing to a trend of drivers delaying vehicle purchases pending the anticipated launch of longer range models.  That might be something to do with it.  To encourage a greater take-up of EVs in the sector, which plays an important leadership and normalisation role, the grant levels of the scheme have been increased from seven to ten.</p> <p>  However, we need to do more.  We are required to reduce our carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050.  A big part of what we do between now and 2030 will be around biofuels and electric vehicles.  We are working through the options on that, but we need to figure out how we can get the behavioural changes we need.  We are conscious of the exemplars that taxi drivers are when it comes to EVs, so we are working through that.  We expect, with the revision to the climate action plan, we will be able to set out our stall and we might need to do more on that front.  That is something we are considering, but we are glad to take the Deputy's feedback on it.</p></speech>

The NTA regulates taxi licences, but we do not have anybody looking at the taxi industry.  What has been spent in terms of research on the taxi industry, the impact Covid-19 has had on it and how we can assist thousands of operators within a sector to ensure they are a key and important part of the public transport network?  I do not believe the NTA is approaching it from the perspective of researching best practice and working with the industry.  It seems to be approaching it purely from a regulatory perspective.</p></speech>

The old Great Southern and Western Railway terminated at Heuston Station.  It needs to be connected.  It went to railway order in approximately 2015.  It is only a comment.  It is the game changer and the missing piece, which is not to say the western rail corridor is not important, but this requires to be done.  Will Mr. Spratt give us a note on how much of the previous work in bringing it to railway order level can be reused if there is an evaluation?</p> <p>  On the rollover and the extension of the search and rescue, it is due.  It is 2012 to 2022 and there is an option of another three years.  A lead-in piece has to be done.  In terms of the capital cost, did the Department or the State fund any of the capital costs for the purchase or financing of helicopters?  If so, is there an ownership?  I know there is a depreciation of approximately 25 years on these.</p><p>Does the State own any assets?  If a new company comes in or if it is split between State-run and a combination of State-run and private sector, there will be a training component.  Is this component built into the cost?  I find it quite difficult to see how this rolls over without there being sizeable work.  Are there any assets?</p></speech>

The Chairman could extend the Deputy's time if that is okay.  There has been much interest in our search and rescue responsibilities and I would be grateful to set out important facts.  The existing contract with CHCI was to run for ten years from July 2012 with an option for three one-year extensions.  The contract has been extended to July 2023.  The annual cost is approximately &euro;60 million.  The current service was procured on the basis of a thorough scoping exercise at the time involving all stakeholders, including the Department of Defence and the Air Corps.  Based on that analysis, the recommendation for the new service was to significantly enhance the search and rescue capability, which involved modernising and upgrading the helicopter fleet to cater for the wide range of scenarios for maritime search and rescue, including a mass rescue.  Thankfully, we have not had to do that but we have the capability to do so should we need to.</p> <p>  It was tendered by open competition.  A compliant process was followed and independently audited.  This resulted in a Government decision to award the contract to CHCI at the time.  The construction of the tender bids was a matter for each tenderer based on the specification required.  It was not for the Department or the Coast Guard to dictate whether it should buy or lease but to assess the relative costs between the two final bidders.  The tenders were evaluated on the basis of the stated award criteria and CHCI was determined to be the preferred bid.  This is not a fixed-cost contract.  There are agreed monthly standing charges and variable elements on top of that.  There are costs associated with modifications, which are agreed with the Coast Guard.  There can be other additional costs, all of which are provided for in the contract terms.  The contract costs on average &euro;60 million per year, which is broadly in line with expectations at the outset.  CHCI has provided an excellent service and the contract has delivered on all key performance metrics.  The Air Corps was not in a position to deliver the service at the time and this was acknowledged by the Department of Defence.  The question of the State purchasing helicopters, which was raised by the Deputy, was considered at the time.  This would require significant upfront costs and would have involved significant associated risk to the State.  In buying a service, the risk of helicopter loss or depreciating values of the asset, which is important, is carried by the service provider.  To sum that up, it was something that was considered at the start but it was decided on the basis of what we required to procure that it was better not to be the owner of those assets.  I might ask Mr. Clonan to address the training component.</p></speech>

It approached the Department at the end of 2017.  At that point, unless emergency funding was provided, the airport would have been at risk of entering liquidation.  That would have had immediate implications for the continuance of the search and rescue base at the airport.  Arising from that, emergency funding was provided to the airport and this has continued on the basis of plans for works that would enable the return of scheduled services put forward by the airport and accepted by the Government.  However, arising from changed circumstances, the Minister has confirmed to Waterford Airport that the continuation of funding on that basis would not be possible.</p></speech>

We are not doing it for Sligo Airport, which does have needs, does have a rescue service and does house the CHC choppers in Strandhill, where I live, but it is one rule for Waterford and no rule for Sligo.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

In his second response to me, he changed that to say that the work was really to do with assisting the return of scheduled services whereas the truth is that the former Minister, Deputy Ross, just decided that we were going to give &euro;5 million to Waterford.  What I am trying to establish is whether if he was so disposed, the current Minister could make funding available to Sligo Airport, which, as Mr. Towey probably knows, has had to realign its runway from a safety perspective to keep CHC at the base.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

If the Minister of the day is so disposed, can we get money for Sligo Airport so that we can maintain the high standard of air and sea rescue currently carried out by CHC Ireland on behalf of the State at the bargain price of &euro;60 million a year?  We need a safe airport and a small amount of capital support.  I am not talking about capital expenditure or operational expenditure.  The airport is not run for profit but is owned by the people of Sligo.  Can Mr. Towey confirm that, if the Minister is so disposed, money can be made available to Sligo Airport for this purpose?</p></speech>

Why did it take the Road Safety Authority so long to make the driver theory test available online when the test for bus drivers was already available online?  What were the challenges the RSA was unable to overcome until now?</p></speech>

A new service was being introduced.  An element of systems analysis and design had to be gone through.  The RSA had to test that online system.  This is something that is new to the authority.  It is, therefore, introducing it incrementally.  It was initially introduced for a particular type of vehicle.  The RSA hopes to roll it out for other drivers but, as I mentioned earlier, there have been some teething problems and challenges.  That is something I will be taking up with the chief executive of the RSA with a view to determining what can be done to roll it out more quickly.</p></speech>

What sort of engagement has his Department had with the RSA in light of the fact that the number of people on waiting lists was spiralling out of control and had reached almost 100,000 people?  The Department was aware that the RSA had requested 80 additional testers, although the Department initially granted it only half of that number.  Mr. Spratt has said the process of securing the others is now in train.  Given the seriousness of the issue and given that waiting lists are spiralling out of control, it does not appear that the Department had very much engagement with the RSA over the past 12 months or so, especially as Mr. Spratt only became aware of the access problems in recent days.</p></speech>

I personally engage with the chief executive a couple of times a year with nothing on the agenda.  I also engage with him several times a year between those meetings with regard to any issues that have arisen.  Mr. O'Leary is the assistant secretary with responsibility for road safety and related matters.  He might be able to update the Deputy on the more detailed engagement that happens between the Department at divisional level and the RSA.  My sense of the matter is that we are very close.  We are as engaged as we need to be.  The RSA comes to us and we come to it whenever issues arise.  We are working with the RSA to address these backlogs as quickly as possible.  I accept that, as the Deputy has said, we initially only gave the RSA 40 of the 80 testers it had requested but, given that the backlog is growing, we moved this week to provide it with all of the testers it needs.  Is there anything Mr. O'Leary wants to add?</p></speech>

The authority has described it as a temporary position, which is not really satisfactory.  I want to highlight the fact that, as he has said, Mr. Spratt only recently became aware of this despite the constant engagement with the RSA he has mentioned.  I just wanted to flag that.  The effort the Department seems to have put into enabling the RSA to tackle those figures is quite shocking given the numbers on waiting lists.</p> <p>  I wanted to touch on another matter, if I have time.  It was reported last month that the Pensions Authority had warned the trustees of the CI&Eacute; pension scheme that they could face prosecution if they do not come up with a plan to address a deficit in that scheme.  Can Mr. Spratt confirm that the current total deficit does not exceed &euro;975 million?</p></speech>

It proposed that the retirement age be increased to 65 and this proposal was approved in June 2020.  CI&Eacute; has submitted a draft statutory instrument in that regard, which is being worked through.  The second scheme, which I believe is the scheme to which the Deputy is referring, is known as the 1951 scheme.  Proposals in respect of this scheme were initially voted down by 80% of the members who voted in a ballot last September.  However, the trade union group recently balloted members on Labour Court proposals which emerged in November 2020 and, on 5 May this year, the Department was notified that there had been an overall acceptance of those proposals.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that things will become clearer over the coming months.  The Minister will then introduce a draft statutory instrument for consultation.

I had thought the Chairman said that my time was up.  Mr. Spratt said earlier that the Department wants to improve transport provision.  Last week, it was reported that Bus &Eacute;ireann is to cut some of its intercity Expressway services.  I believe nine regional routes are affected.</p><p>It seems an odd time to suspend services when the country is on the brink of reopening.  What is the Department's view on that?  Should we be seeking to increase public transport capacity?  </p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann is obviously one of our agencies.  There is a commercial operation, which is that particular part of the company's operations.  It needs to take decisions based on the market.

Over &euro;1 billion has been spent on road improvement and road maintenance programmes.  The big complaint I constantly hear is about where major road improvement is carried out and shortly afterwards another utility company comes along and excavates it again to put down ducting, cables or whatever.  What kind of co-ordination involving local authorities takes place before work starts to avoid duplication and excessive expenditure?  I was a member of Cork City Council during 2003 and 2004 when there was major refurbishment in Cork city.  We notified all the utility companies that we would not allow any excavation to take place for ten years once it was completed, meaning that they had to put in all their required ducting.  Is it the Department policy to co-ordinate work with all the utility companies that operate in the State?</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite right.  There is an issue which in the past required to be addressed regarding road openings.  Quite recently the Department updated what is called the purple book, which provides the guidelines on road openings.  It also has put in place centralised portal systems in order that all applications come through the one system and are then diverted to the relevant local authority.  It is a single portal which speeds up the whole process.  What the Deputy says is right.  There is provision for local authorities to have embargoes on reopening a road.  If for some reason a road has to be reopened by a utility within a short period before the period of five years, or in some cases ten years, is up, there is a surcharge to be paid by the person who does so.</p></speech>

That is my question.</p></speech>

The road programmes are made available to them because three-year plans are prepared on a rolling basis.  They are made available to utilities so that they can see where the works are taking place and they can plan their work in order that they get in before it.</p></speech>

Can we get details of the number of companies where surcharges were imposed?  Do particular utility companies incur a higher number of surcharges because of their not planning ahead and not being there before the major road infrastructure work takes place?</p></speech>

I would not like to say I could have it to the Deputy immediately because we will have to go back to the local authorities to collate the information and go to the road management office, RMO, which operates the central system.  We can certainly follow up and check how it is being applied across the country.</p></speech>

This is about planning into the future, whether it is ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  Is that option being made available?</p></speech>

It is not the norm.  Longitudinal ducts are put in place along roads in order to cater for future things like variable message signs.  TII has put in extra ducting along dual carriageways where there are gaps in the network.</p></speech>

I have come across cases where the local authority has carried out major resurfacing or major drainage work and six months later, I have seen the same roadway being excavated again.</p></speech>

I also thank them for the detailed information they provided in advance of today's meeting which is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Clonan.  I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire and obviously I have great affinity and respect for the work that the Irish Coast Guard does, in particular the volunteers in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard unit.  My information is that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard is quite busy and I expect it to be far busier this summer given the requirements for an outdoor summer.  That will place considerable pressure and strain on the volunteers.  My information is that 20 volunteers are attached to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard.  How is the recruitment of new volunteers nationally going?  Obviously, I am sure that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard could do with more.  Is there a cap on the number of volunteers attached to each Coast Guard station?  I also seek information about the replacement of and investment in equipment for Coast Guard stations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Clonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#J00100"><p>There is quite a lot in those questions but I will do my best to go at them.  Regarding the Coast Guard maritime search and rescue function, we have the three rescue co-ordination centres and search and rescue units on the coast to respond.  There is our search and rescue helicopters, the RNLI and, finally, our Coast Guard units, of which there are 44.  There are three functions.  Every team has a search function.  They have vehicles, they break into teams, they have PPE and they search the coast.  The next function a Coast Guard team could have is a boat.  The Howth team, over on the other side of the harbour, has a boat.  They are trained in that, equipped and so on.  Another function a Coast Guard team has is a cliff team.  Greystones has a cliff team, a boat and a search team.  They are trained on that.</p> <p>  I will concentrate now on D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a small search team, an RNLI unit in the harbour and the helicopter behind it in Dublin Airport.  Based on the risk assessment, that is the search unit for that area and it is very busy.  With Covid, and looking at last year and this year so far, in the first quarter of this year we responded to about 435 incidents nationwide.  During the month of August last year we responded to 430 incidents in just one month.  We are expecting a huge ramping up of incidents this year.  It is not the fishermen or the merchant ships; it is the people of Ireland availing of recreational facilities, particularly around D&uacute;n Laoghaire: the Forty Foot, Seapoint and the surrounding areas.</p> <p>  As for the number in each station, generally a search team has about 15 people.  If you add boats and cliff teams, the number goes up to 25.  As to how we recruit, every team has 15 members.  It has a volunteer person in charge, a volunteer deputy, an education officer and a training officer.  They are the main functions and they recruit locally.</p></speech>

Staying with that issue, Mr. Clonan mentioned vehicles.  Is it true that volunteers cannot use their vehicles?  I understand that in some stations they can.  Obviously, however, it limits their ability to respond if they cannot.  I understand that the Coast Guard vehicles are one of the four blue light vehicles but they are limited in where they can use those vehicles.  Maybe that is more a question to the Department than Mr. Clonan, but that hampers the ability of volunteers, depending on their location, to respond to incidents.  I am just thinking ahead to this summer, as I said.  I am nervous because they do fantastic work, the volunteers are on call 24-7 and we need to ensure they can respond but my information is that some stations can use the vehicles and bring them home so they can respond more quickly to incidents while other stations cannot.  What are the criteria there?  Who can use the vehicles and when?</p></speech>

We need vehicles for towing boats and vehicles for moving the equipment.  They have to be extremely mobile.  Most units have two four-by-fours and, depending on their functions, may have a cargo van, a quad or whatever, but it is based on that.  There is no restriction on using vehicles.  If they are on exercise, they use the vehicles.  If they are on a call-out, they use the vehicles.  The officer in charge, OIC, has charge of his or her vehicles.  If they are on exercise or are called out to an incident, they use the vehicles.  There is no restriction on using vehicles.  In the event of distress or someone being in immediate danger of loss of life, they can put on the blue lights and respond.  We are working with the Road Safety Authority.  It has emergency driving courses for the emergency services.  Deputy Devlin is correct that we are one of the blue light services along with the fire service, the ambulance service and the Garda.  For a small organisation there is a huge burden, if you want to call it that, or a requirement to train people to be able to drive safely.  All our volunteers have been trained in driving with blue lights.  We are a little different from the other three services in that they are allowed to break the rules of the road, basically, where it is safe to do so, whereas our guys must stay within the rules of the road when there is an emergency.  We are in discussions with the Department on legislation to amend that.  With the other emergency services there are specific blue light driving courses on which you drive at speed and that type of thing.  That is in the pipeline.</p></speech>

I am up early enough for it to be the afternoon.  I welcome everybody to the committee meeting.  As we have only five minutes each, I want to make a couple of observations that have been brought to my attention.  One is the theory test going online.  It appears it is not the only problem, in that you have to have a certain type of software on your computer to use it but if you apply for a test you do not get one until 2023.  Maybe that can be brought back to the RSA.  It could be that nobody knows the answer to this but could somebody supply to the committee a figure for the cost of putting the theory test online and how much was spent on it?  Ultimately, it is a bit of a disaster at the minute.</p><p>Regarding the appropriation accounts - and this is probably a question for Mr. Spratt - paragraph 2.10 relates to the &euro;1.2 million that was paid out in respect of the Smith <i>v</i>. Meade case.  That case arose because, effectively, the wrong transposing of a directive on car insurance occurred.  Who within the Department has been held accountable for that failure?  If the Exchequer is down just short of &euro;1.2 million due to that mistake, have lessons been learned?  If so, what lessons have been learned?</p></speech>

I have a very long note in front of me which, if I were to read through it, would probably take up all her time and probably even go over it, so what I might do about the lessons learned is come back to her with a context note but also set it out in a note for-----</p></speech>

However, it has been brought to my attention that significantly, &euro;7.5 million was paid out perhaps over ten years ago in respect of night vision goggles in addition to CHC helicopters.  As the training has yet to be completed, it would appear that those goggles are not being used in the service at all.  I need to understand how we spent &euro;7.5 million on something that has not yet been used.  Would Mr. Spratt be able to compile something on that for me?</p></speech>

Obviously, we need to recruit board members.  We have processes in place to recruit those board members.  We need to make sure we have the knowledge, skills, expertise, capacity, competence and capability for all our board members, so filling the board member vacancies does take time.  Yes, we have some vacancies on a number of our boards but we are trying to fill them as quickly as we possibly can.</p><p>In that context, did the Deputy mention the board of CIE?</p></speech>

I have a number of questions for Mr. Spratt.  If he can keep his answers short, that would be helpful.  A couple of hundred thousand people are waiting for both the theory and the full driver test.  Why was the theory test suspended?  The theory test can be run in a cubicle with a screen, similar to what is in every bank, post office and public building.  Members of the public have asked me this question and I do not have an answer for them but I told them I would raise it with the Department today.  I am at a loss as to why the theory test was suspended.</p></speech>

As was the case with many of the decisions that were taken, the Chief Medical Officer had his view and made his input, and when it came to marginal decisions, public health guidelines overruled and took precedence.  While we fought as hard as we possibly could to keep the theory test going and we contributed to the final decision, public health guidance was also submitted and it was a decision that went against us.</p></speech>

I also welcome the fact Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s Department pushed this matter.</p> <p>  I also ask about the instructors, and Mr. Spratt clarified earlier there will be 80 and not 40 extra employed.  I very much welcome this good news.  On clearing the waiting lists backlog, how many does Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s Department hope to clear in each of the months, July, August and September?</p></speech>

It is starting incrementally with the longest waiting non-essential drivers, which has already started.  The authority is finding there is quite a heavy dropout rate because these are very often the people who are taking longest to pass their tests.  It will be ramped up over time, and as the additional testers are deployed, the numbers will increase during July and August.

Again, a constituent who needs a motorcycle to get to work contacted me about this last week.  I failed to provide an answer to that person as to how you would catch Covid-19 on a motorbike.  I have observed the test because my office is on a circuit used for the motorcycle driving test and I regularly see the candidates passing.  There is a motorcyclist and a tester some distance behind him.  I fail for the life of me to see how that kind of testing could not have continued.  It is just to highlight that.  It is to be hoped we will not be into another lockdown or semi-lockdown.  If we are, I appeal to the Department that we please keep the theory and the motorcycle tests going.</p> <p>  On the NCT centres, my understanding is these centres are not accepting cash.  I have had complaints, especially from pensioners who may not have a card, online banking, plastic card, or whatever.  They arrive in to pay by cash and discover they cannot to do so.  Is that the case and can the Department do anything about this?  While it may be a minority now who may wish to pay by cash, can this matter be looked into and followed up because it is an important issue?</p> <p>  Reverting to Mr Spratt, on the search and rescue business, to date and over a ten-year period, there are commitments of &euro;638 million.  Mr. Spratt clarified we will not own any choppers at the end of this period, but yet there is a capital element of &euro;35 million that has been spent, according to my understanding of this.

We have rules around how we procure contractors and consultants.  Whether or not there is a specific check on a balance sheet, I am not entirely sure, but what I can say is that this process serves us very well and ensures we get reputable contractors and consultants to supply us with the services we need in a way that is good value for money.</p></speech>

Would that be checked out thoroughly by the Department?</p></speech>

This process has served us well.  We check referees and the quality of work done previously.  The process has served us very well in terms of the skills and expertise we have procured from consultants and contractors.  I would be surprised if there were a suggestion that we were not getting good value for money or purchasing knowledge, skill, expertise, competence, capability that did not exist.  To my mind, based on my experience of the last 20 years in similar situations, all the contractors and consultants, while their service is variable, tend to be very good value for money.</p></speech>

If there is not sufficient traffic, the State must pay the toll road operators compensation.  Was there anything built into the contract that would have envisaged something like the unimaginable Covid scenario?  Was there any safeguard built into the contract for anything like that?  Separately, on road maintenance, can we expect to see an underspend in 2020 because of Covid?  If so, will that underspend go back to the Exchequer?</p></speech>

We have two concession PPP contracts.  One is for the M3 from Clonee to Kells and the other is for the N18 Limerick tunnel.  They provide for variable operational payments to the operator when traffic volumes fall below specified levels.  Variable operational payments continue to be payable on both of these contracts and estimates of future liabilities are based on observed traffic data, forecasts of traffic growth and inflation.  Inflation indices are derived from the forecast consumer price index on the assumption that toll charges will rise in line with that index.  Where return traffic growth and-or inflation differ from the forecast, this impacts on the variable operational payment amounts provided for.  Such payments were included in PPP contracts for these important groups, which are less trafficked than those on which such payments are not provided for, to ensure an appropriate balance of risk between the commercial operators and the Exchequer.  They were subject to scrutiny before contracts were signed to ensure they deliver value for money and the economic and social benefits they bring.  That is a long way of saying there is a risk to be balanced and there are compensation payments provided for in those contracts.</p></speech>

Was there anything built into the contract in relation to unforeseen circumstances like the loss of traffic last year because of Covid?  Is there a get-out-of-jail clause for 2020 or does the State carry all the risk?</p></speech>

If so, they can drop me a line afterwards.  I note that the Department is responsible for the Coast Guard and search and rescue services.  My question is about an agreement in Castlefreke, west Cork, that Coillte would transfer land for a new base to be established there.  Contracts were furnished to the Chief State Solicitor's office over 18 months ago and there is still no progress.  Perhaps the witnesses will get back to me with an explanation as to why that has occurred.  I know the OPW is dealing with the matter but ultimately it falls within the Department's remit.

Staying with programme C, in terms of the volunteer use of vehicles, if I am a volunteer, the vehicle has to be stored at the base, but is not practical for me to get from my home to the base.  Can Mr. Clonan drop a note to clarify the use of those vehicles?  It is important we get more vehicles for our stations, but also that they are able to be used.</p> <p>  Is there a strategic plan for the Irish Coast Guard?  If there is, can Mr. Clonan furnish me with a copy?  The national oil spill contingency planning is under the remit of Department of Transport.  When was the last time that was undertaken or practised?  I ask the witnesses to come back to me in writing.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Spratt for the information.  What subheading does the marine casualty investigation board come under?  I could not find it in the accounts.</p> <p>  In March, I put a question on the transfer of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, among five harbours included.  I am sure Mr. Spratt and his Department are delighted to have all that handed over to a different Department.  I am inquiring about the funding.  I have asked about the funding which was given to local authorities on the transfer of that.  It seems funding was given to certain local authorities and not to others.  My main concern was D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown not getting a penny.  Can Mr. Spratt do a review of that and furnish the committee or me with that?</p></speech>

Maybe they will come back in writing and I can forward that to the clerk.  I would like to know how the Department assessed the efficiencies and effectiveness of the agencies under its remit.  What programme of assessment does it carry out to ensure they are operating?  I have huge difficulty with some constituents contacting me, who have been waiting for a walk around check for nine months.  Without that they cannot move on to take their artic licence.  It is a significant issue.  I cannot understand it.  It is not similar to the theory test.  It is carried on outside.  I will submit some more to Mr. Spratt, but how does he measure the effectiveness of the agencies under him?</p> <p>  I want to come back to the roads.  It is a significant issue.  County Wexford has a deficit of &euro;68 million, accrued in a shortfall over the past ten years, in road maintenance moneys.  We have approximately 5,600 km of roads in the county  One councillor recently said due to the state of the roads in County Wexford, it is similar to trying to keep the tide out with a fork, in terms of performing maintenance at the level of funding which is given.  It is difficult to see a 500% increase in commercial traffic on roads which are underfunded.  I want to make the point on the &euro;68 million deficit accrued over a ten-year period.  We are firefighting all the time.  It just maintenance, maintenance, maintenance.  There is no resurfacing.</p> <p>  On the national oversight and audit committee, in terms of roads, we have the worst roads in the country, second only to County Donegal.  I would be looking at how roads funding is allocated.  I do not believe for one minute it is of benefit to the Exchequer to be funding through the kilometre system, on the basis some of our counties have good roads.  As Deputy Murphy alluded to, if maintenance does not need to be carried out, that money should be disbursed into other counties where the roads are significantly worse.  That is according to National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, not my opinion.</p> <p>  I thank the members of the Department for coming in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#M00900"><p>I have a couple of things to mention to Mr. Spratt before we close up.  I do not want Mr. Spratt to give me an answer now, in terms of the roads in County Offaly.  There is a special case for north County Offaly, because the roads are over peat.  Mr. O'Leary is nodding in agreement.  There is a serious issue there, in terms of road safety.  Can someone please have a look at the R400?  The engineers and councillors need the money for it.  The local population needs it.  There are road safety issues with the R400 in the area where the old Derrygreenagh works were.  There is a serious situation in north Offaly, because it is going over peat.</p> <p>  The other thing I wanted to briefly mention was the 1951 CI&Eacute; pension scheme.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  There are people there for 40 years who have paid into a pension scheme and are left in a precarious situation.  The trustees have made a High Court application.  There should be no further discussion of the 1951 scheme, until that happens.  Another member of the committee has already raised this.  The Department needs to keep an eye on it, because there are people who have paid into that scheme throughout their term of employment with CI&Eacute;.</p> <p>  The last thing I want to raise with the witnesses is the issue of bus shelters.  I have had to write, as a member of a local authority and as a Deputy, to the chair of the National Transport Authority, about bus stops for Mountrath, Castletown, Borris-in-Ossary, Doonane, Crettyard and Ballylynan.  It is crazy stuff.  There is provision under the local authority Act brought in by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, whereby that power is given to local authorities.  I did not agree with him on many things, but one of the things he did was the provision in that Act.</p> <p>  There is huge frustration at local authority level, because they feel there is significant micromanagement by the Department of Transport.  Local authorities have excellent engineers.  There are good local authority members.  There are good management systems in place.  I know it is a matter for the Minister of Transport more than the witnesses, but I do not want to let the opportunity pass.  We need to allow the local authorities to breathe.  We need to breathe a bit of life and democracy back into local authorities.</p> <p>  Can the issue of bus shelters be delegated back to local authorities?  If one goes over the Border, into the Six Counties, there are bus shelters all over the place.  There are bus shelters at every half-mile point on the road, including for school buses.  We cannot seem to get them in counties Laois or Offaly and every other Deputy here will concur with me on this, in terms of their counties.  It is too bureaucratic.  It is the local authority.  Give it the money.  Let it do it.  It will do it cheaper as well.  I ask Mr. Spratt to come back to me with a note on that.  I am saying that in a constructive way.</p> <p>  It is good news about the driving tests.  I welcome that staff numbers are being increased.  We look forward to that being expedited.</p> <p>  We are out of time.  I thank all the witnesses for joining us and the Department for the information it provided on a wide range of issues.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending and assisting the committee.  It is agreed for the clerk to seek any follow up in the information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed.  Is it also agreed we publish any opening statements and briefings provided for us today?</p><p> I remind members of the committee that directly after the meeting there will be a photo shoot outside, on the Plinth, so they should have their best suits on.  I remind members also that we will launch a report on our engagement with the Office of Public Works at 12 o'clock and that the launch will be published on the Oireachtas website.  I thank everyone.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.  The committee is adjourned.  On 9.30 a.m. next Tuesday, 1 June, the committee will meet in private session.</p></speech>

All other members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on Microsoft Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to mute their microphone when not making a contribution, to use the raise hand function to indicate and to note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Members of the committee will be prioritised for speaking slots.</p> <p>  The agenda for today is the ongoing issues in the forestry sector with officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I welcome Mr. Colm Hayes, assistant secretary; Mr. Seamus Dunne, senior inspector, and Mr. Eamon O'Doherty, project manager.  They have all joined remotely.  We have received the opening statement and briefing material, which have already been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions and so the committee has agreed to take the opening statement as read.  I am going to give the officials, when I finish talking, five minutes to give an overview of how the Department will address the licensing issues.</p> <p>    Before we begin, I must read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants joining the committee meeting from a location outside of parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  As Chairman, I will make an opening statement to the witnesses to outline what has got us to where we are today.  I am disappointed that the committee had to request the attendance of the officials here today.  As a committee, we issued a report in March after extensive consultation with all stakeholders, including the Department.  The recommendations in our report addressed the slow output of licences and other forestry issues, including ash dieback, which affect the forestry industry.  We had hoped that the situation would improve but, unfortunately, it has not.  Farmers considering planting trees have walked away in despair and with a complete lack of confidence in the industry.</p> <p>  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions that relate to licences, planting, clear-felling for roads and thinning.  The standard answer given is "contact us in nine months for an update", which is completely unacceptable.  Some of these licences are in the system for two and three years.</p> <p>  Climate change and the challenges we face are a huge issues for the whole agrifood sector.  Our failure to meet targets cannot continue.  Over the last few years we have been 15,000 ha shy of our planting targets.  This figure is based on 70% coniferous trees and 30% broadleaf trees, and takes into account the loss of carbon during felling and replanting.   In the lifetime of those plantations, in terms of the targets that we have failed to meet, 5.8 million tonnes of carbon would be sequestered.  It is criminal that these targets are being missed, which has a compounding effect on the rest of the agrifood industry and rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Today, we are not here to discuss Project Woodland, which definitely has a place in the future.  We hope that many of its objectives can be implemented.  Today, we are focusing on the low output of licences by the Department.  On average, 87 licences were issued in the four-week period prior to the Oireachtas committee meeting in January.  In the four weeks up to 18 May, on average, 43 licences were issued.  Like other committee members, I have been inundated with calls from stakeholders, including representatives of mills that have had to import timber, forestry contractors who are going bankrupt or farmers who have been unable to get licences.</p> <p>  The forestry sector is hugely important to the economy and must be efficient.  Today, we demand an output of 100 licences a week.  A greater output would be ideal but 100 licences is the bottom line.  At this meeting I would like the officials to tell us how they plan to achieve this target.  When the output of licences drops below 100 in any given week, we respectfully request a report that outlines why this has happened and how output will be rectified for the following week.  This is a frank statement but time is not on our side.  This has long been an issue and I have dealt with it since I was appointed Chair of this committee last summer.  The crisis is ongoing for four or five years and is a huge concern to this committee and to the Oireachtas, in general.  I want to walk out of this meeting today with this issue resolved but if not then we intend, as a committee, to reconvene in the near future.</p> <p>  I give the officials five minutes to address the licensing issues and then I will open up the debate to questions from members.  It is with a heavy heart that we have the officials back in here today but, unfortunately, the concerns of the forestry sector at the moment are paramount to us.</p></speech>

The Chairman has asked me to specifically focus on licensing, which I will do because we have submitted a longer and more detailed statement that will go on the record, and will be available for everyone to read.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the committee in producing its report on the issues that impact the sector in Ireland, which of course we have carefully studied.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, has responded to the committee thanking it for its detailed and careful consideration of these issues.  She has responded to the observations and recommendations to outline where they are being incorporated into Project Woodland.</p> <p>  The Chairman has asked me to address the licensing issues but I want to update the committee briefly on some important developments that have taken place since my previous appearance.  First, the Minister launched Project Woodland on 25 February.  It is a major project that aims to resolve the issues facing the sector and is also looking at the wider strategic outlook for forestry in Ireland.  The setting up of a high-level project board to oversee Project Woodland is now in place.  The board is chaired by Mr. Brendan Gleeson, the Secretary General of the Department.  It has three independent members who bring extensive experience and knowledge of project implementation and governance.  Below that, there are four working groups seeking to deliver the identified tasks under Project Woodland.  Each working group has an independent external chair and its membership comprises stakeholders from the forestry policy group and a departmental representative.  The statement goes into more detail on those individual aspects.</p> <p>  There has also been the appointment of an external project manager, Mr. Eamon O&rsquo;Doherty, as per the recommendations of the Jo O'Hara report.  Mr. O'Doherty attends this meeting today as part of the Department's delegation.  He is available to speak and answer questions.</p> <p>  The final piece is the commission of a study to be conducted by Irish Rural Link that will engage with communities to determine attitudes towards forestry in Ireland.  The recommendations from the study will feed into the work of Project Woodland on forestry strategy.</p> <p>  In terms of licensing, we fully acknowledge the difficulties that delays have caused for applicants.  It has been a difficult time for applicants who have had to wait longer than they should have to receive their licences.</p><p>We are sparing absolutely no effort to resolve this.</p><p> We are not yet where we want to be on licensing but we are seeing some improvements in output, with 1,236 licences issued to date this year.  This is a 15% increase on the same period last year and although I know significant further gains are needed, we are moving in the right direction.  Of course, licence output is only one measure of performance and the more realistic metric is the volume of material licensed as this is what matters to the sector.  In this regard I can indicate that as of last Friday, felling licence volumes are 32% higher than the same period last year and the area licensed for afforestation is 26% higher.  Road lengths licensed are 117% higher.  Of course, this is not to say licensing issues are resolved - they are not.  I am not claiming that to be the case.  We are, however, making progress with substantially more work yet to do, and I fully expect this progress to improve further as the year progresses.</p><p> As many of the questions raised by the Chairman pertain directly to licensing, I will now address it in more detail.  As members know, we have set ourselves an ambitious target of 4,500 licences this year, as outlined in January, which is a major ambition amounting to a 75% increase on the same period last year.  By the end of this week, I expect we will have reached just under 30% of this target.  We are absolutely committed to achieving this target and I remain confident that we will deliver the number of licences promised.  It is a huge task to do this but we are ambitious both for our output and the Irish forestry sector.</p><p> As has been stated, to achieve this goal we will likely have to issue over 100 licences per week for the rest of the year.  Last week we issued 101 new licences, along with a number of remitted licences, or appeal decisions back from the forestry appeals committee.  I expect this week's number to be high and well above the weekly average so far this year.  This improvement is largely thanks to some process changes we are making internally, as well as an increase in resources.  The number for April was lower than expected but in May we expect to have recovered some significant ground and June will achieve the highest numbers so far this year.</p><p> The number of licences now on hand is 6,119.  This figure is inflated by the submission by Coillte in March of 1,842 new felling licences to cover production for the next two years.  It is important to understand that particular nuance.  As we all know, a significant factor in the licensing backlog has been the need for more stringent appropriate assessment procedures, and particularly the number of licences requiring ecology input.  As noted, we have invested heavily in ecology resources, training and, more recently, a streamlining of procedures in order to address the backlog.  There are currently 1,860 private applications on the ecologist work list for afforestation, road and felling files.  On average, the weekly output for licences with ecology input since June 2020 is 38 licences.  Over 1,050 files have come off the private ecology work list, of which 900 have already issued as licences.  When combined with the ecologists working on Coillte files, this means 1,745 licences with ecology input have issued.</p><p> We continue to focus all efforts on improving the licensing position.  The difficulties created for those involved in the sector are clearly understood by us and our foremost objective is to resolve this matter.  As already mentioned, two working groups of Project Woodland are fully engaged with the backlog and improving the process.</p><p> The question has been raised as to how many licences the Department must issue annually in order to satisfy the needs of the private forestry sector and specifically the quantities to keep the mills running.  The targets for output are determined not by the number of licences but by metrics relating to targets set for afforestation and forest roads and, in the case of felling, the forecasted harvest.  It is worth looking at our progress to date measured against these three specific targets.  The Department has issued 116 km of forest road licences this year, or 92% of the annual target of 125 km set out in the climate action plan.  I expect, therefore, that road licences issued this year will well exceed this target.  Based on targets, we expect to issue new licences for over 5,000 ha of afforestation this year, with licences for 2,236 ha issued to date.  Additionally, 4,300 ha has already been licensed and is shovel-ready or available for use carried into this year.  It is, of course, up to landowners to decide whether to plant once they have received approval to do so.  It is a matter for all stakeholders to utilise the licences available and I encourage them to do so.  Of course, improved turnaround times for licences will play a significant role in this - we acknowledge that - and converting what is licensed into planted area must be everybody's priority.  We remain concerned by the continued low conversion rate from approval to planting and I have written to sectoral representatives in the past week to invite them to discuss this in more detail and see how we can be of more assistance.</p><p> With felling, we have issued licenses for just over 2.2 million cu. m for the year to date, which is 54% of the COFORD Roundwood forecast.  The breakdown so far this year is that Coillte has received 58% of the licensed volume and the private sector has received 42%.  We are very confident that last year's output of 5 million cu. m will be exceeded.</p><p> I will also update the committee on the question of appeals for forestry licences because it is relevant to output.  The position with appeals is progressing extremely well, with only 48 cases remaining to be scheduled.  In total, the forestry appeals committee has 130 cases on hand from approximately 1,100 received overall.  We are advised that come September the turnaround time for new appeal cases will be in the region of two months.  This is a very welcome development and testament to the hard work of the forestry appeals committee, the new committees and departmental staff.</p><p> Looking to the future, I will briefly outline our priorities for the rest of 2021 on forestry so they can be well understood by all.  In summary, these include the issuing of 4,500 new licences for afforestation, roads and felling; the implementation of Project Woodland and all of its many recommendations; the significant advancement of a new long-term forestry strategy for Ireland; and the development of a strong Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan and an ambitious successor to the forestry programme, both of which will deliver for farmers, rural communities and society as a whole.  The focus absolutely must be on better integration between both of these policies, as set out in the programme for Government.  These are enormous challenges that will require intense focus if they are to be achieved.  It will require the co-operation of all stakeholders and we are committed to working together with them in the achievement of these targets.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention and we are very happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#B00200"><p>We have broken from tradition in the time allowed for the statement.  Having listened to the opening statement, any comparison with 2020 should be avoided, as it was an absolutely disastrous year for the forestry sector.  Giving us an improvement percentage using 2020 as a baseline is not acceptable.  I would rather get the raw figures for output comparisons.  Using 2020 as a parameter will not work because it was such a year of underperformance in the sector.  Deputy Flaherty must go to the convention centre so I will allow him to speak first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for indulging me and I apologise to other members for any inconvenience.  I thank Mr. Hayes for the opening statement, which probably went some way to bamboozling us with updated statistics.  The reality is we have been well briefed in advance by farmers and farm organisations and there is still significant, if not growing, disquiet in the sector about the failure to move licences along.  Departmental officials indicated to the committee on 29 January that we would see north of 4,000 licences issued this year.  The current number is 30% of that target with seven months of the year left.  We could probably discount two of those months, one around Christmas and one in the summer.  Realistically and hand on heart, we could probably say we will not hit that target of 4,000 licences this year unless some really meaningful action is taken.  To be honest, emergency action probably needs to be taken at this stage.</p> <p>  I am sure the delegation has seen the input of the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, on this matter.  The market, including producers and companies dependent on the forestry sector, and the workers in these organisations are exasperated.  I am a relatively new Deputy, having spent just over a year here, but it is inconceivable to think how this problem has been rumbling on.  As the Chairman rightly said, we should discount 2020 for comparison.  We have given this process time.</p><p>We had a degree of faith that something would happen and there would be some change.  I appeal to Mr. Hayes to reflect on the urgency of the situation.  What the IFA is asking for is not unreasonable, namely, a commitment that no farmer will have to wait longer than four months for a decision on a forestry licence application.  At this stage, that is the only acceptable element we can consider.</p><p> Mr. Hayes referred to road licences.  Forestry road construction and thinning operations need to be removed from the licensing system and approved under a forest management plan.  We need to consider a cost-based planning support grant for the sector.  Many of my committee colleagues will go into the IFA's submission in more detail.</p><p> I accept Mr. Hayes's opening statement at face value, but from what we are hearing on the ground from farmers, companies and employees, there has been no meaningful improvement.  For us just to take what Mr. Hayes is saying at face value and not counter it would be to do our constituents and people involved in Irish farming and Irish forestry a great disservice.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.</p></speech>

We have turned so many corners as regards forestry that we are back where we started.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives from the Department for participating in this meeting.  As we heard from the Minister's contribution in the D&aacute;il last week and from today's opening statement, felling licences have increased by 32% on the same time last year and the area licensed for afforestation has increased by 26%.  Is it not true, however, that these figures reflect an admittedly good January and an improved February but a disastrous March, April and May?  In March, the area licensed for felling decreased from 1,462 ha to 1,059 ha.  In April, it fell from 1,437 ha to 950 ha.  In May, it fell from 1,332 ha to 1,080 ha according to the most recent dashboard figures.  Why are the figures for the full months of March and April so bad?  Where does the fault lie?</p> <p>  The issue of the appropriate screening area was mentioned.  My understanding is that the threshold has increased from 3 km to 15 km.  It would be useful if the Department explained the rationale for that and why the appropriate resources and preparations were not put in place before it happened.</p> <p>  The afforestation licence numbers are worrying.  The Government has indicated its ambition to deliver 8,000 ha per year.  Last year, licences were awarded in respect of 4,342 ha, but the actual area planted only came to 2,488 ha, which is pathetic in light of the ambition-----</p></speech>

That only 2,488 ha were planted last year must ring alarm bells.  This year, licences were awarded in respect of 2,226 ha, but only 948 ha have been planted so far.  Of those, could we be given the breakdown between Coillte and private operators?  How much of that area relates to new entrants to afforestation?  If the figure is not available now, could it be found?  It will set out whether there is any prospect of achieving the ambition of planting 8,000 ha per year over the Government's lifetime or the rest of this decade.</p> <p>  May I ask a question that can be responded to later?

The timber sector is at crisis point.  That we are seeing the importation of wood is scandalous.  There is no other term for it.  Afforestation levels are more worrying.  Although there is an immediate crisis that needs to be addressed, we are far behind when it comes to licensing afforestation, which is supposed to be crucial for climate action, diversification and so on.  We do not want to hear that the Department is doing its best.  We need to hear what concrete measures are in place.  Working groups are fine, but what is being done on the ground to deliver more forestry and felling licences in the immediate term?</p></speech>

The 948 ha planted to date this year are all private, as are all of the afforestation approvals that have been issued.  Coillte does not apply to us for new afforestation licences.  As such, all of those hectares have been planted by private landowners.  The Deputy also asked how many were new applicants.  I understand the Deputy's question to be about whether these were new hectares as opposed to hectares that were being replanted after clear felling.</p></speech>

Obviously, they are all new hectares, not hectares that have been replanted after clear felling.  In some cases, they are owned by people who planted once upon a time and have come back in with more land.  As to whether the hectares are brand new, I will have to check and respond directly to the Deputy, but I assure him that they are all private lands and not Coillte lands.</p> <p>  Regarding April, our headline target remains 4,500 new licences for the year.  As we told the committee in January, there will be fluctuations between weeks and months, but we are not resiling from the overall headline target for 4,500 new licences.  The amount will not be uniform each week.  The Deputy asked why April was a low month.  That was for a number of reasons.  Primarily, we did not have Coillte licences to issue because Coillte had received all of its 2021 felling licences by the end of January or thereabouts.  It is fully licensed for 2021.  Our team that works on Coillte licences was doing a great deal of background work on the 1,800 new Coillte licences.  The dashboard measures output in terms of licences, but there is also a large piece of work that goes on in the background.  We were also making some background IT changes as well as process improvements that will increase output.  Those improvements are starting to come through now.  They came through last week with 101 new licences.  There will be a very high amount this week as well.  It will be higher than the average, although I will not know the figure for sure until Friday evening.  I expect the situation to be the same next week and the week after into June.  We have in some respects retrieved May, but April was a disappointingly low month.  We have outlined some of the reasons for that.</p> <p>  I assure Deputy Flaherty that we are not discounting any month of the year.  Licences will issue every week this year, as they did last year, including Christmas week.  There should be no downturn at any point.  We will continue to put our shoulders to the wheel.</p><p>The target of 4,500 licences requires an output of approximately 100 per week, as the Chairman outlined at the start.  We are well aware of the metric and we believe that can be delivered.</p><p> Deputy Carthy mentioned, and I agree with him fully, that any applicant who applies for a forestry licence should have some degree of certainty as to how long it will take for that licence to be received.  We have fallen down in providing that certainty.  There are people who applied for afforestation licences and received them a month later but there will be those who will have to wait significantly longer.  Regarding the targets of approximately three months for afforestation licences and four months for felling, we have fallen behind on those.  The average length of time for the issuing of those licences is not at those figures, and it absolutely should be.  We expect detailed recommendations from the working groups and Project Woodland.  This has been highlighted, in particular, by Jo O&rsquo;Hara in her report.  She called on those groups, as did the Minister, to deliver those metrics.  We expect recommendations on how those groups believe they should be achieved.  We are not at the stage where we can guarantee a turnaround time for those.</p><p> We have reached a point in our licensing system where are issuing more licences to date this year than applications received.  This is a good place to be but it does not deal with the licences that are on hand and the backlog.  The priority must be to drive down those figures.  Reaching a point where we are issuing more licences than applications received is a good indicator of the future.  Right now, the output of 100 licences is required to drive down the backlog.  Those who have waited longer than they should have, need to hear that and understand that this is where our effort is going.</p><p> There was a question from Deputy Carthy on the 15 km zone of influence in terms of appropriate assessment.  I will pass that question, with the Chairman&rsquo;s agreement, to Mr. Seamus Dunne, chief forestry inspector, to provide more information on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#D00200"><p>In relation to the 3 km and 15 km zones, this comes up quite often.  The legislation states that an appropriate assessment is undertaken where screening identifies a likelihood of the project having a significant effect on a European site.  This is true throughout the EU and is true regardless of the separation distance between the project and the European site.  The legislation does not lay down the distance but it refers to any project that may interfere with any European site.  The advice we received nearly two years ago was that it was not defendable to have a distance of 3 km and not consider European sites outside of 3 km.  This is the industry norm in ecology companies throughout Ireland.  It is the industry norm with regulators as well.  There is a logic to that.  The logic is that one can have hydrological connections between a project and a special area of conservation, SAC, that has qualifying interests, such as salmon, lamprey, crayfish, and other, that are greater than 3 km.  One can have foraging distances outside of special protection areas, SPAs, that are greater than 3 km.  They normally range from between 6 km to 15 km.  The 3 km was deemed to be not defendable.  We took the advice to go to 15 km.</p> <p>  There has been much attention on the 15 km but not on the other changes that led to the sites being screened in for appropriate assessment.  It is not because of the 15 km.  The licensing crisis has occurred because of the change in the number of files screened in for appropriate assessment in Ireland, we all know that.  The most important change which led to a much higher number of files being screened in was compliance with the European Court of Justice and national case law that determined it is not appropriate, at appropriate assessment screening stage, to take account of the measures intended to avoid or reduce the harmful effects of the project on a European site.  In other words, in deciding whether we can screen in or screen out a site, and whether it would have an effect, we can not take account of a buffer zone between the planting and an aquatic zone.  In the past, we could have taken that into account and screened it out.  That is the most important area where a change in policy arose two years ago, not the 15 km, which led to more sites being screened in than screened out.</p></speech>

I will summarise the four major responsibilities given to me.  It flows from that to be able to understand the different roles that Mr. Hayes plays and the role I play.  I was brought in as a full-time adviser to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on Project Woodland.  Two of the work groups are extremely significant from my perspective.  One is the clearance of the backlog and the other is the renewal of departmental processes.  Starting yesterday, we recruited a business systems analyst, who reports to me, whose role is to map out all the processes around licensing and the sub-processes around ecology, archaeology etc.  Her plan is in development and I should receive that next week.

I do not want any more, once I know who it is.  That is all I want to know.</p> <p>  The metrics that are based on the increases on last year were coming from a very low base.  Would Mr. Hayes agree that if we went back to years before, they would have been minimal?  Is it acceptable to be working from bases like that, considering the type of figures we are looking at?</p></speech>

I emphasised clearly in my opening remarks that we do not claim to be where we want to be.  Absolutely not.  It was by way of an indication as to whether there is an improvement in output.  I think it is perfectly valid to give an indication with what happened last year.  One can make that comparison without saying that all is perfect.  I would like to think that this was understood clearly from my opening remarks.  We are not claiming that but at the same time, if one takes this as a two-year project, we are showing signs of improvement all the time.  Every metric in 2021, when it comes to licensing, will be up on 2020.  It absolutely must be.</p></speech>

My next question is on the number of licences in the system.  Mr. Hayes has stated in his submission that the figure is 6,119, of which Coillte have put in 1,842, and I know it has put in some lately, which leaves 4,277.  Mr. Hayes will recall we spoke about this last November.  He said that there were 1,900 licences backlogged, that there were 2,500 which had no problem, and that I did not word my comments correctly.  When that was added up, it came to 4,300 or 4,400.  We have made no headway in the backlog of licences whatsoever, when one adds that.</p></speech>

As regards the previous meeting of the committee, I gave Mr. Hayes the information on the first day and when we brought him in again and I questioned him about it, he said that 1,900 would basically have to go into ecology or whatever as there were difficulties but there were 2,500 with which there was no problem.  So far this year, approximately 1,200 licences have been issued.  Where are the rest of the 2,500 in respect of which there was no problem?  Why were they not issued if there were no problems?</p></speech>

The committee will not take that hook, line and sinker.  For several weeks, 40 licences were being issued each week and it ended up that the whole industry is in chaos.  I know guys, as does the Chairman, who have been in business for 30 years but the repossession guys are taking their machines.  Does Mr. Hayes feel good about the likes of that?</p> <p>  On climate change, we have missed our targets by nearly 50% for three or four years.  How many tonnes of carbon sequestration have we missed out on?</p></speech>

Obviously, what we plant now will make very little difference in the context of our 2030 climate targets as a result of the time needed to sequester and the fact that under the accounting rules they really kick in afterwards, but I agree with the Deputy's overall thesis.  The failure to hit the planting targets obviously has an impact on climate policy overall.  It is not good.  It is in everybody's interest that every hectare that is licensed is planted and we all need to work together in that regard.  Obviously, the Department has a key role to play in issuing more licences.  Thankfully, the area for afforestation is 26% up on last year.  We hope that it will be much higher by the end of the year.  This is all part of the project and the output is to get all that back up onto a stable level and to make sure that targets such as 8,000 ha are realisable.</p> <p>  Overall, we are in a very interesting phase because we are at a key stage in the design of the next CAP and, in parallel, we are designing the next forestry programme.  It is clear to all that significant tree planting measures should absolutely be considered as part of the next CAP and the agri-environment schemes, that is, the eco-schemes or the agri-environment climate measures, AECM, schemes.  There will be several ways to come at future afforestation targets that should absolutely be considered by all and that could really be to the benefit of farmers as well.

In his opening statement, Mr. Hayes stated that 2.2 million cu. m of timber is basically licensed this year.  We know that thinnings and clear-fell are included in that.  Has the Department brought out a system since November to know the difference between those?  If there is 2.2 million cu. m available at the moment, why are mills still running out of timber?  Why are they going to Scotland and further afield to try to buy timber?</p></speech>

This will require a full environmental impact assessment and we are expecting an application in that regard soon.  We are working with both parties on it.  This will have a level of environmental assessment that goes far beyond any private afforestation application.  For the information of the Deputy, it will be funded only on the basis of costs incurred.  It will not enjoy the premiums that other afforestation schemes enjoy.  That is an important point to note.  It is an exciting project that can contribute to our national afforestation targets.  It can offer alternatives for land that was previously used for other purposes.  It can be a major boost to biodiversity and climate if it is done correctly.  However, there is a long way to go and, obviously, a detailed environmental assessment is the next step.</p></speech>

I will call it very straight: I lay the full blame at the hands of the Department.  I cannot understand how it has not considered something along the lines of the case involving Bord na M&oacute;na and An Taisce, in which the High Court ruled there is an exemption up to 30 ha.  I cannot understand how the Department has not gone down a road such as that.  Have people in the Department considered their positions?  Has there been consideration of a reshuffle if things are not working out?  I will be blunt about it.</p> <p>  In fairness to the committee, it has watched the developing situation on forestry weekly.   I will be in touch with Mr. Hayes regarding the dashboard.  If there is a differentiation between the commercial stuff and the thinnings it would be very helpful to all members of the committee.  I do not do things lightly.  We are going to monitor this for three months.  I do not often get time to deal with this issue but when there is nothing changing or moving, we have to make decisions.  Unfortunately, for the likes of me, the only way we can try to resolve this or move it on is to bring a motion of no confidence in the Minister at the top.  That is the last thing anybody wants to do.  I actually pity the Minister because it is aspects within the Department that have not functioned.  I urge Mr. Hayes to address this issue in the next month or two, because we are going to be watching it.  It is not acceptable for 100 licences to be issued today and then 40 each week for three or four months.  We are watching the situation weekly and daily.  We hear the stories from the industry.  I am asking Mr. Hayes and his colleagues to address the issue.</p><p>I know Jo O'Hara, Jerry Grant and a few more people have been brought in.  Project Woodland is for the future.  In the here and now, the timber industry is in trouble.  The contractors are going bust, including people who have done 30 years of the finest of service.  We will not take this lightly and I will be very blunt about it.  The only option for the likes of me is to take it out on a Minister, which is not right but it is the only option, to put it bluntly.  Are personnel in the Department being changed around to try to resolve this issue?  Unfortunately, Mr. Hayes was before the committee in November and the job has not changed.  He can dilly-dally with figures, and technically he is correct with regard to 10% or 15% but 15% of nothing is still nothing and 15% of a bad result is a bad result.</p><p> Where does Mr. Hayes sees himself in the next two to three months?  Does he see himself getting out 100 licences every week?  He speaks about some of the licences on his dashboard with regard to what is planted as against what is issued.  The reason is very simple.  I am a farmer.  If I was waiting for two years, a year and a half or three years for a licence I would not have a notion of waiting for it.  I would have moved on to other things so I would not be planting.  What is the response of Mr. Hayes to this?</p></speech>

Deputy Fitzmaurice has raised questions about how output will be increased and I ask Mr. Hayes to frame his answer around this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#F00300"><p>It is exactly as I said at the outset.  Over the next three months, which is when Deputy Fitzmaurice is speaking about, we see ourselves delivering the type of licences we spoke about earlier in the year, which in volume terms will deliver 4,500 for this year.  This means approximately 100 licences a week.  There will be weeks when it is up and a little bit down but if we can average at around this, we will be well on the way to delivering the overall 4,500 target for this year.  This is our target and we are absolutely committed to it.  I assure the Deputy there is no shortage of effort.</p> <p>  The purpose of the dashboard is to measure output.  We are fully transparent on output on a weekly basis.  We circulate it to the committee each week.  It is there to monitor and measure.  We are committed to doing this.  We did it last week and we expect to do something broadly similar this week.  We are starting to see things come through that indicate to us that June will be the best month of the year.  All of this combined will lead us to where we want to be.  The Deputy will have the dashboard every week to monitor this and we look forward to engaging with him as it progresses.</p></speech>

In fairness to the committee it is grand to say the Department hit 100 last week but the previous four weeks averaged 43.  Our patience is exhausted, as is the industry.  The industry is at exasperation point.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice has said, Mr. Hayes has committed to an output and we will be watching extremely closely because the output has to increase consistently and not just for a week or two.</p></speech>

A famous American baseball catcher, Yogi Berra, is accredited with the quotation &quot;<i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>all over again&quot; and this morning I can see where he was coming from and I am experiencing it.  I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice.  Politically, I would have to oppose his actions if he were to go down that road but I certainly see why he would be driven to where he said he may have to go.</p><p>We are legislators and administrators and we are answerable to the public and the people who have skin in the game in the timber and building sectors.  They are the people knocking on our doors, ringing our phones and hounding us for meetings.  To be quite honest, Mr. Hayes is detached from the real world as far as I can see and totally insulated.  The problem we have today sits firmly on his doorstep.  He managed us into the crisis we are in today.  He managed the applications stockpile.  While I acknowledge European law changed and ecology requirements changed, we need a Department that is efficient enough to change with the change and stay ahead of the posse.  Mr. Hayes acknowledged an applicant would be entitled to a turnaround of three to four months.  It is in the farmers' charter that an applicant will get a licence within four months.  It is in the 2014 Act.  Mr. Hayes acknowledged we are not meeting it.  What is the point of the farmers' charter?  We are not abiding by the 2014 Act.</p><p>Deputy Fitzmaurice and the Chair mentioned the men who, unfortunately, are going into receivership and out of business and are having their machines repossessed because they do not have timber to harvest.  This has gone much further. A 6 ft tree is, on average, &euro;6 more expensive today than it was four months ago because of the actions at the auctions in Scotland.  The Scots have cottoned on to the amount of timber leaving Scotland and coming in here and now the prices are being hiked.  This drip-feeds down to somebody building a family home.  It now affects the entire building sector.  Jobs are at stake.  People will be paying up to 40% more than they should be paying on mortgages for the next 25 or 30 years.  The problem can be traced right back to the forestry section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>Mr. Hayes did not answer Deputy Fitzmaurice's question on whether there will be changes and managerial changes in the Department.  The buck stops with Mr. Hayes.  The Deputy can have his vote of no confidence in the Minister.  Ministers come and go but the forestry section of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has not changed.  It has overseen this problem.  It has brought us to where we are.  I welcome the figures we have been given today but I reserve judgment on them until I see some consistency.</p><p>Mr. Hayes admitted in his statement that we have 30% of what we need for the year.  If we are speaking about percentages, Monday is 31 May and that is 41.66% of the year gone.  We will not speak months or weeks but percentages.  The Department is behind on its figures for catching up.  I will quote two lines from the submission document that was read out earlier.  Mr. Hayes said converting licences into planting area must be everyone's priority and that the Department remains concerned about the continuing low conversion rate.  He stated he had written to sectoral representatives to invite them to discuss this in more detail.  What Mr. Hayes is saying is that even the licences being granted for afforestation are not being taken up and we are behind the curve.  Is this because of what has happened in recent years, and that even people who get licences have lost confidence in the sector and may well not plant those trees?  If this is the case, it is because of the management of the Department.  It means we will not reach our targets of 8,000 ha.  This 8,000 ha target is built into our overall climate approach for achieving carbon neutrality.  If we do not reach this target, what will have to change on the other side to balance it?  People speak about herd reduction.  I am not in favour of this but if we do not reach the sequestration figure we will have to start legislating for areas such as this.  Will Mr. Hayes accept responsibility for these consequences and the decisions that legislators and administrators will have to make on the back of his bad management that got us to where we are today?</p></speech>

On the question as to whether farmers are not planting now even though they have received a licence, it is clearly the case.  The purpose of writing to sectoral representatives is to understand this. I absolutely accept, as I said in the statement, the delay in receiving a licence must be a factor in this.  Of course it is.  We also see evidence in our figures of people who receive licences within a month or two of applying and still do not proceed to planting.  We need to understand this better.  We need to see how we can work with farm advisers and Teagasc and make farmers understand the value of what they have received in terms of a licence and the options they have.  This would be a good step.</p> <p>  There are a number of factors.  We know we received licence applications for land speculation reasons.  We know that of course farmers can change their minds when the forestry machinery shows up.  A range of factors can lead to this.  We need to understand it and see whether we can help in more detail.  The Senator is correct that the best help we can deliver is a timely licensing system.  This is what all of this and Project Woodland are about.</p><p>That is the purpose of that particular discussion.  It does not happen in felling or roads but if we are to go to all this trouble to process licences, and if companies are to go to all the trouble of submitting them, we need to make sure every licence is valuable and utilised to the maximum possible extent.</p><p> On the question of climate policy, I am wary of any direct link between agriculture livestock policy and forestry because it does a disservice, in many respects, to both sectors.  The forestry sector and the planting of land is not there to help livestock sectors achieve their output targets.  We have to be very careful that all sectors play their part in achieving climate policy goals.  I am very wary of drawing a link between one sector underachieving, or overachieving for that matter, relative to the other because forestry is a big sector in its own right.  The people who plant lands do so for very valid reasons and should be encouraged to do so.  We should treat them on that basis and not necessarily draw links between the underachievement of one leading to knock-on effects in the other.</p><p> I will touch briefly on prices because the Senator mentioned them.  Of course, timber prices are well up at the moment.  There is a commodity boom globally.  I read the other day that timber prices in the US are up 350% compared to the same time last year.  We see that at the moment from the builders association, for example, in the effects on concrete and timber.  These are market issues.  I am not clear on the extent undersupply plays in that but it has to be acknowledged, in the overall context, that there is a boom right now in timber prices internationally.  As a large exporting nation Ireland will inevitably feel an element of that, as it will with steel, concrete and all these other factors, which as the Senator correctly pointed out are leading to increases in construction costs.  I saw something from the Irish Home Builders Association the other day referencing this in addition to the impact of Brexit, Covid and various other factors which contribute to the increased costs at the moment.  It is important to acknowledge that as well.</p><p> I think I have answered all the Senator's questions.  I ask him to tell me if I have left anything out.</p></speech>

I beg to differ with what he said about the journey of agriculture, as a sector, to carbon neutrality.  Forestry is a major influencer on that.  It is written into carbon neutrality as a major part of it.  If we are not achieving what has been put in there regarding forestry, from a sequestration point of view, there will have to be some cuts in output on the other side.  It is a basic balance.  Carbon neutrality is a balance and I beg to differ with Mr. Hayes on forestry.  From the agriculture sector side, forestry has been written in as 8,000 ha per annum for a reason.  This is a number that will reach neutrality.</p></speech>

Mr. Hayes has made his points about the management structure.  It would not be fair to expect him to identify or criticise his own management at a meeting.  The point has been made by the Senator and others on the absolute necessity of delivering targets.  They have not been delivered up to now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.281" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#G00400"><p>I thank the representatives from the agricultural side of the house.  I would like to acknowledge, and seek clarity on, a very significant statement that was made at the start of the meeting.  Comparisons were made to 2020 regarding licences.  We stated that 1,130 licences were granted in 2021.  By comparison, my figures for 2019 indicate we were at something like 3,600, which means we have reached approximately 30% of where we were in 2019.  It was a little unfortunate that the 2020 figures were used.  The 2019 figures show we are really only hitting a 30% target, from what I dug up in the last 20 minutes anyway.  We need clarity on the licences and the projections.  If we are at 30% of 2019, the figures presented to us this morning were somewhat misleading.  I ask for clarity regarding that.</p> <p>  The question of whether the 4,500 licences being proposed will realistically meet the needs of the industry is a major issue.  I do not think they will.  That figure is the bare minimum and we are still on a trajectory where we will be under pressure to reach those targets.  That is clear from everyone we talk to.  We saw in the auctions today that a 16 ft length of 6 in. x 2 in. timber has gone up by another &euro;2 today alone.  That will have a massive impact on our society.  The two issues we really talk about in Irish life are health and housing.  Housing prices will go through the roof for the lack of a sustainable commodity like timber, which we are growing in significant amounts but cannot harvest.  That will be a real issue for us as a community and society.  We need clarity on where these licences are going. </p> <p>  In the last few days and weeks, comparisons were made between our licensing approach and that of European countries.  I ask for clarity on whether we are in line with what is happening in Europe.  We all read in certain publications in the last seven or eight days that our licensing regime for private licences is totally out of sync with what is happening in the European model.  Countries like Belgium, Hungary and France have a totally different regime and a totally different interpretation of the 15 km rule.  That is a really significant issue.  Taking into consideration that we are all part of the European project, how can there be a scenario in which there are totally different rules when it comes to afforestation and planting projects, the way woodlands are managed, woodland management plans and what is required in a 15-year management plan so felling licences are not needed for roadways or thinnings?</p> <p>  There is a lack of joined-up thinking regarding what Ireland Inc. and other European countries are doing.  Can I get clarity on why we seem to be a total outlier on this issue?  It is possible major publications in this industry have published different material but that is what we have read in them.  Real clarity is required here because if we are that out of sync do we really need to start afresh with completely new policy and legislation?  That is realistically where this information seems to be pushing us.  We seem to be making trouble for ourselves all the way through.</p> <p>  Regarding our ecology service, I ask for clarity on how many people are actually employed by the Department and what their roles are.  When I ask that, I mean their roles and functions because the letters I have received, even this week, seem to be asking for work that can be done by the Department.  They are indicating that if certain reports are provided, one will come above the line.  Given that we have over 20 people working for us, why is the Department still looking for these reports to be provided, for private licences in particular?  Affordability is a real issue with some of these reports, which can cost &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,500 a pop.  This is a significant issue if just a small number of hectares is involved.  We need clarity on how many people are there, why they are there and what they are doing.  Why are we still asking for these reports to be produced by some private landowners?</p> <p>  On the afforestation programme targets, and correct me if I am wrong, we reached 2,500 or 30% in 2020.  I have four children at home.  Future generations will not thank us for reaching those kinds of targets.  We are under exceptional pressure.  We all realise there a huge problem here.  Figures like that really call into question the big, grand announcement that 8,000 ha will be planted annually.  We are at 2,500.  We are a lifetime away from that target.  There is a responsibility on everyone to ensure we raise the bar and reach those targets.  We will not be judged by the electorate in five years' time.  We are not worried about that.  It is society in 30 years' time that will judge us, when people are looking to cut down trees and do not have the ability to do it.  We have a real issue.  I am looking for clarity regarding those targets, where they are and how and when we will reach them.  I do not see anything at the moment that gives me confidence we will reach them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#H00100"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I agree with him.  The afforestation target is crucial.  A discussion is ongoing regarding the design of the future climate action plan and the climate Bill.  Afforestation must be a key part of the solution, which might require a lot of landowners to engage in a way they have not engaged up until now.  One of the lessons from the current forestry programme is that farmers have disengaged from afforestation to a certain extent.  We need to understand that better.  We are in a crucial phase because we are starting to design the next forestry programme.  We are working on the next forestry strategy as part of Project Woodland.  The farming bodies are on that, as are all of the other stakeholders.  We need to clearly understand the reasons farmers disengaged.  I understand and acknowledge that licensing would have been one of the factors - possibly one of the major ones - but we all need to understand better why that is the case.</p> <p>  When it comes to tree planting, there must be scope and there is a commitment in the programme for Government for better integration between the next CAP and the forestry programme.  All these discussions are ongoing and are all crucial because they will all play their part in how we achieve the 8,000 ha target or whatever the figure is in the future.  If the licences are in place, we expect north of 5,000 ha this year.  If there were 4,000 ha coming into the year available to plant, in theory, those are the 8,000 hectares but we know that does not get carried through into planting.  We are having that discussion as well.</p> <p>  In respect of the Senator's original point, I did not quite catch the 30% figure he referenced for 2021 compared to 2019.  If it is in respect of felling, there were very high figures for hectares licensed in the early months of 2019, which he will have noticed were completely out of sync with the other months before and since.  This is because they were on Coillte thinning licences that issued in large batches around then.  We prefer the volume to be the ultimate metric because hectares do not always translate into volume.  The thinning volume can be very different to the felling volume.</p></speech>

There were 3,619 licences in 2019 compared to 1,130 in 2021, which means we are at roughly 31% of where we were in 2019.  This is based on licence figures, which are the crux of the argument.</p></speech>

In those early months in 2019, there were very large numbers of thinning licences for Coillte, which inflated everything from the number of licences to the number of hectares.  I would also point out that the early period of 2019 predates the legal judgments that have knocked us back on these particular issues.  We are in a new phase because of the impact of those legal judgments.  They forced us to change our processes and procedures and do things very differently.  Comparisons going back beyond those judgements involve a different time.  What we are about is getting the whole thing back on track to reach the levels we and the sector want to reach.  This is what every effort is going into.  I might pass the question about the role of the ecologists to Mr. Dunne.</p></speech>

Our ecologists review everything that comes in so if there is an ecology report by the applicant, it must be reviewed on our side by an ecologist.  In the case of felling, we issue licences that do not have land information searches where we carry out the appropriate assessment report and appropriate assessment determination.  When the private ecologist produces a land information search, our ecologists would review it and produce an appropriate assessment determination so in all cases where there is ecological input on the private side, it would be reviewed in the Department by our ecologists.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the number of ecologists in the Department.  I think the figure is around 21.  There are nine permanent staff consisting of a head of ecology with eight staff.  We have a contract with Fehily Timoney, which has seven ecologists plus one environmental scientist working on licensing.  We have a lot of freelance ecologists who mostly work part time but bring it up to about 21 full-time equivalents.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about what other member states are doing.  It is fair to say that many member states do things differently from us.  Not all of them have lighter regulation regimes around forestry.  The Netherlands has a complete ban on all felling from April to September during nesting season whereas we would have a similar ban in special protection areas.  Not all regimes around Europe are similar.  The major difficulty we have had in the past two years is compliance with the appropriate assessment procedures and the habitats directive.  This has led to delays.  We would have to do a really detailed analysis of how other countries comply with the habitats directive, which basically refers to any project that may affect any site regardless of the separation distance involved.  As I said earlier, the 15 km are not laid down in law but are used as an industry norm in this country.  If many of a country's protected areas are in one part of the country, that would explain how the appropriate assessment would not feature in the other parts of the country.  Ireland has designated many of its river systems as SACs, which means that virtually every catchment in the country is hydrologically connected to an SAC.  This may not be the way in other countries.  We would need a detailed look at other countries.  </p> <p>  The Senator mentioned management plans.  Certainly management plans are received instead of a licence application.  Regarding the management plan detail, we have guidance around management plans and it is really useful for owners to have management plans.  It is normally a bit more detailed than we would expect in a licence application.  If we look at a licence application, and we have templates on our website, we can see that we receive management plan-type information.  Does that explain some of-----</p></speech>

Will a body of work be done to find out what the European norm is?  Mr. Dunne mentioned an investigation or study.  I have looked at France and Belgium and I think we have all read the actual publications.  There seems to be a different forestry regime in those countries.  The 15 km rule is not taken to that degree and management plans seem to be the key.  Can I take it that the Department is going to do a body of work to review what other European countries are doing so we could be in line?  If there is a more appropriate way of dealing with it, could that be the way forward?</p></speech>

We have all been contacted by various stakeholders about the norm in other European countries.  When we look at some western European countries, it is very clear that farmer-sized forestry can get felling licences without any regulation attached.  In Germany, we see that they can still get permission to clear and fell their plantations without a licence in a nature conservation or water protection area.  We are all supposed to be under the same level of regulation.  How can this happen in other European countries whereas here no matter where someone's forestry is, he or she must go through the whole complicated regulations regarding getting a licence?</p></speech>

We all act under the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.</p><p>Initial afforestation is an annexe to development under the EIA directive and building private roads is an annexe to development under that directive.  We consider them to be projects under the habitats directive.  We would be open to looking at other member states.  I am on working group 4 of Project Woodland, and part of that is an end-to-end review of processes.  We are absolutely open to considering this.  We would need a very detailed analysis of how other countries comply with the EIA directive and the habitats directive.  We certainly do not want to follow another country that is in difficulty with the European Union, and we know a number of countries are in difficulty with the European Union at the moment.</p></speech>

We have a submission from a farming organisation.  Germany and France are two countries we are very close to in regard to regulation and everything else.  Will the Department give a commitment to do a study on how they are issuing their licences for different sizes of plantation and how they are complying with EU legislation?  This is going to become a significant issue going forward.  There is clearly a different interpretation in the way they are implementing the legislation and the way it is being implemented here in Ireland.</p></speech>

Will the Department commit to doing a review of what is happening in other European countries to see how they are interpreting the legislation and how those countries are issuing permits, as they call them, for clear-felling and for afforestation?

The Department is on it but there are a lot of stakeholders on it as well.  For the avoidance of duplication, we will let that work develop.  Mr. Dunne mentioned the end-to-end process review that is being done and that will inevitably give an immediate comparison with other member states.  We are seeing stakeholders already making submissions to us on that, highlighting the differences they believe there are between what we do and what other member states do.

This issue is exasperating, to say the least, and we are under severe pressure to resolve it, as politicians on the ground.  It does not look like it is being resolved and it is costing the industry and costing many people jobs.  The pressure is unbelievable.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I hope I do not read them too quickly but I would appreciate answers because it is the people on the ground who are speaking.  The system must guarantee that a farmer has to wait no longer than four months for a decision on a forestry licence, as set out in the Forestry Act 2014 at section 18(1).  When is this going to happen?</p> <p>  Second, forest road construction and thinning operations should be removed from the licensing system and approved under a forest management plan.  Why can this not happen?</p> <p>  Why is Ireland such an outlier when it comes to licensing of forestry?  There is no other country in Europe which is experiencing a similar disaster to the one which the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has inflicted upon the forestry and timber industries in Ireland.  Have the Ministers and their officials looked overseas to see what can be learned from forestry regimes elsewhere?</p> <p>  Members of the forestry and timber industries are rightly in despair when they see what has happened to their sector and how the Department has handled the crisis so far.  They have major concerns over the prospect of Project Woodland succeeding unless there is a significant move towards regulatory reform.  Is regulatory reform a feature of the work being carried out under Project Woodland?  If not, will it be included?</p> <p>  The Department has set a target of 4,500 forestry licences for 2021, a target which the industry has argued is totally insufficient in the first instance.  We were recently told by the Minister, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, that only 1,080 licences have issued so far this year yet the Department maintains it will reach the 4,500 target.  With reference to specific detail, how is the Department going to increase its input in the coming months to reach that target?  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, said he expects the output for April and May to be significantly up and for this to continue in subsequent months.  What specific detail is that statement based on and what is going to change to allow for an increase in licensing output?</p> <p>  What communication, if any, has the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in regard to the impact the forestry licensing crisis is having on the housing crisis?  Has the Department, for example, raised concerns in regard to the country being left short of the timber needed for house building?</p> <p>  What communication, if any, has the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications had with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the forestry licensing collapse?  Has it, for example, raised the collapse of afforestation in the context of Ireland not reaching its climate targets?</p> <p>  I hope I did not read the questions too quickly.  If I did, I can go back over them again.</p></speech>

I touched earlier on the first question around the four months and the key performance indicators.  This is one area on which we are expecting detailed recommendations from the working groups under Project Woodland.  We are aware we are not meeting the deadlines set for ourselves in many cases, although we are in some cases.  That range between when applicants receive their licences is too broad at the moment and, obviously, our aim is to drive that down to the lowest possible number and to help to meet these targets.</p> <p>  The stakeholders are doing some very good work on this as part of Project Woodland and we will wait to see their suggestions in terms of deadlines.  Obviously, they have to be realistic about the processes and procedures that an application has to go through in terms of third-party referrals and all that sort of business.  I will wait to see what they come up with.  There is a strong recommendation within the Mackinnon report around the development of a customer charter for applicants, and that is something we will certainly do.  However, we first need to have that discussion around the indicators.</p> <p>  On the question of Ireland being an outlier when it comes to regulation under the EU regulations, I think it has been answered and I do not think we need to repeat what was said before.  I am very happy to engage with the Deputy bilaterally or I can repeat what was said earlier.  Again, we are expecting an end-to-end process under Project Woodland which will see a comparative analysis with other EU member states and for that to be a key feature of the work.</p> <p>  In a way, that answers the Deputy&rsquo;s third question, which is what role regulatory reform plays in this whole process and in Project Woodland.  It plays a key part.  We have always been very clear that if anyone comes along with any feasible suggestion on how the regulations can be done in a different way, or how we can meet our environmental goals under the EU directives and, at the same time, issue more licences in some sort of alternative way, we are absolutely open to that, no question.  We have engaged with every stakeholder and repeated that message at every opportunity.  I am very hopeful that Project Woodland will be the vehicle to do this.  There is serious work going on under four excellent working group chairs, aided by the arrival in the Department of a new business analyst, who started this week, and by Eamon O&rsquo;Doherty, who is managing the whole project.  I expect we will see some significant recommendations in that space.  To put the Deputy&rsquo;s mind at ease, regulatory reform absolutely has to be part of the discussion and absolutely is part of the discussion.</p> <p>  On engagement with other Departments, we engage with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications on the implementation of the climate action plans.  We have done presentations on this at various forums.  Our output is well known and is not a secret because we produce a weekly dashboard, which is effectively a public document at this stage.  I am on record from earlier in the meeting about sharing the concerns of members in terms of the afforestation targets not being reached and how important it is to reach those, particularly in the attainment of the climate action plan goals.  It is full shoulder to the wheel on that.</p> <p>  We have not had direct engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as regards any potential impact on the housing sector.  I would reiterate earlier points that everything, including evidence from the construction sector itself, is pointing towards a significant boom at present in commodity prices across timber, steel and concrete, and all of this has to be better understood.  We obviously do not buy or sell an ounce of timber, so it is the sectoral representatives who will be better able to fill in the Deputy on that.</p><p>Looking at what is coming from some sectoral representatives, we are dealing with global commodity price increases.  To what extent the supply situation here exacerbates that domestically is something the committee would need to hear directly from sectoral representatives.  Much of our material is exported as well.  At a guess, this is somewhere between a market and a supply issue but I am not qualified and do not have the commercial information from individual companies to answer in detail.  It goes back to everything we have been doing so far.  The solution here is more licences and that is our aim for 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#K00200"><p>I have a good few questions and I will do them in lots of three.  I welcome the guests.</p> <p>  I am disappointed, as others have said, that we are still discussing how to reach the target the Department has set.  We seem to be standing still or going backwards and the buck has to stop with the Department and the Minister.  It is wrong that we are seeing businesses close, as the Chair and Deputy Fitzmaurice said, because of incompetence, it seems, from the Department.</p> <p>  In a recent parliamentary question I asked if, prior to March 2021, Coillte had been able to provide generic non-site specific harvest plans with felling applications and if this had been accepted practice between Coillte and the Department.  In the response, the Minister said that applicants are encouraged to include them with their licence application and that Coillte have done this with their recent applications accepted in March.  He added that Coillte had undertaken to provide further site-specific information in support of their recent applications.  Yet, in response to another parliamentary question, the Minister told me that 1,864 licence applications were received from Coillte on 15 March 2021 and pre-licensing work had begun immediately with applications.  Given that Coillte&rsquo;s licence applications did not contain the required site-specific information, how come pre-licensing work began immediately on them?  If a private licence application is not up to the required standard, the Department returns it immediately and it is not processed.  Is Coillte receiving preferential treatment from the Department?  Is it a coincidence the applications were being processed and not being returned to Coillte until around the time the issue started to be questioned?  Why is the Department prioritising Coillte licence applications when there are applications going back to 2016 still in the system?</p> <p>  There is a feeling out there that there has been an industrial system in forestry, which was to some extent rectified in 2009, when the case was made that forest farmers should be entitled to the single farm payment.  Yet some elements of this industrial consideration continue to exist in terms of the 15 km Natura impact assessment rule.  Other countries make a distinction between industrial and agricultural and use a 5 km rule for the latter.  Why are we different?</p> <p>  Is there concern in the Department that trees ready to be felled would have an impact on our carbon sequestration targets because of a failure of the licensing process?   A vast proportion of trees were planted around 1990 and it is coming up to harvest times for those.  I have been told there are concerns in the Department that if the trees are felled which are due to be felled then, because of the Department's poor management of the forestry sector over the years, by 2025 we could be sequestering less carbon than we are now.  In other words, there are suspicions that the delays are happening by design to hold up harvesting.</p> <p>  If I can get answers to those first, I have another couple on ash dieback and Project Woodland.</p></speech>

The breakdown last year in private licensing volume was 52% Coillte and 48% private.  This year to date it is 58% Coillte and 42% private.  On the basis that, as I understand, Coillte supplies 75% of processing timber for the mills, I do not think that could be described as favouritism towards it.  It is short-sighted to engage in comparison between two sectors.  Coillte is not an international conglomerate; it is an Irish company that supports Irish jobs and harvests Irish timber for processing in Irish mills.  Every licence is valuable and in our role as regulator, we will drive out every licence we can, assuming it is correct and in the condition it should be.  Every licence has value to the rural economy and it is important that is done.</p> <p>  On the climate question, in simple terms, Ireland's forestry estate is and will remain a net sink for carbon dioxide up to 2050.  We outlined this recently in our national forest accounting plan.  Beyond 2050, we have some detailed modelling projections and work to do.  There may be some older forests that will be a small net source of emissions up to about 2025, after harvested wood products are stripped out.  That is in our forestry accounting plan.  Projections indicate the forestry estate remains a net sink.  It has no bearing on our licensing regime.  It is important the national forestry estate is well managed but we would never bring to bear on any licence application any consideration of the national forest accounting plan.  I draw clear blue water between those two issues.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked a detailed question on the Coillte applications and I think Mr. Dunne can shed some light on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#K00800"><p>The Deputy mentioned the harvest plans.  A harvest plan is not a legal requirement at application stage.  We do not generally get harvest plans from Coillte at that stage.  We encourage all applications from private sources and Coillte to supply harvest plans.  It is good practice to discuss the harvest plan with the contractors who are doing the work.</p> <p>  For sites that are screened out for appropriate assessment, we assess whether there is a need for a harvest plan.  That is for Coillte and private sites; there is no difference.  For sites that are screened in, we always look for more detail, up to and including a harvest plan.  This is important and Coillte has always provided sufficient information when we sought it.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the information is generic.  Is the word &ldquo;generic&rdquo; similar for everyone?  As Coillte harvests perhaps 1,000 sites annually, there will be a high degree of consistency and standardisation with all of its harvest plans.  For each application, it gives us a map of the harvest area and details of what will happen on that site.  We are receiving harvest plans for screen-in sites.  It is essential.  We have clarified this with the sector.  We sent circulars to the trade, including the private sector and Coillte, and clarified that harvest plans are essential for screen-in sites.  That is for Coillte and the private sector; there is no preferential treatment.  Coillte has invested heavily in ecology resources.  It has approximately 20 ecologists preparing Natura impact statements, NISs.  It produces them to a high standard.</p><p>It probably produces more NISs than any other organisation in the country.  We get the NISs with harvest plans from Coillte for us to process.  It is not fair to say there was preferential treatment with Coillte.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Dunne saying that if Coillte does not have the site plans, it cannot continue on, as is the case with a private contractor?  If the private contractor does not have the plan, his application is returned.  It is not processed any further until he has the site plans.  Is Mr. Dunne saying that happens with Coillte as well or is it allowed to continue without the specific site plan?</p></speech>

We encourage them because they give us a lot of good information.  For screen-in sites, it is essential that we have a detailed description of every harvest site.  That is the same for both the private sector and Coillte.</p></speech>

There are three matters.  In terms of the ecology, I will stick to the points in the statement from our guests.  I welcome them and thank them for their work, particularly their presentation.  My questions will be on that, rather than broad-stroke questions.  Mr. Hayes referred to investing heavily in ecology resources, training and, more recently, streamlining the procedures in order to address the backlog in ecology.  That is the subject of one question.  If Mr. Hayes cannot do so today in detail, he might supply the committee with a summary of what is meant by that.  How has the Department increased streamlining the procedures?  Clearly, there are problems and they have to be streamlined.</p> <p>  Second, I am interested in the individual working groups.  The presentation refers to working group 1, pre-application discussion and a planning grant system.  That is very positive and important.  I am familiar with pre-planning in other planning structures and perhaps there is room for developing a pre-planning system, or screening or assistance.  We do not want a situation where people go so far and then some of the stuff is sent back.  It prolongs things.  Pre-planning discussion and a format for that are very positive.</p> <p>  I share the concerns of others that the goals in terms of climate action are disappointing.  The goals for replanting are disappointing.  Other speakers have asked why small farmers are disengaging.  It is because of the bureaucracy.  I can speak about people who have bought land or have an option to purchase land for forestry, but the process goes on for too long so they walk away from it.  They just give up.  They do not feel the system is with them and is supporting them.  They are not inclined to hang around, so they decide it is not for them and they move on.  Clearly, that is not in anybody's interest.</p> <p>  Finally, the presentation refers to the planting of native woodland in Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.  That is an exciting project.  I would like to know more about it, as I am sure the committee would.  Rather than take time now, I ask the witness to send the committee more details about that.  Hopefully, when the Covid-19 pandemic passes, the committee might take the opportunity to visit some of these projects.  That would be important.  I thank the witnesses for submitting the paper and for answering the questions so far.</p></speech>

I am happy to do that.  We have significantly bulked up our ecology resources from one 12 to 18 months ago to 21 working on this now.  It is a massive investment on our part in environmental compliance.  Streamlining the process is back-office stuff, to be honest, but I have no problem with outlining some of the detail because it is impactful in terms of output.  There is nothing particularly exciting about it.  There is no game changer, but it is all part of the process of continuous improvement when it comes to licensing.</p> <p>  On Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, I addressed this in the opening statement and I would be happy to supply more information.  I suggest direct engagements with Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte as well, if that is of interest.  We can certainly give as much information as possible on the pilot scheme we have launched on this, which both agencies intend to use.  A site visit would be excellent and could easily be facilitated when the Covid restrictions lift.</p> <p>  Have I dealt with everything?</p></speech>

The pre-planning discussion appears to have worked well, particularly in Scotland in terms of lifting its numbers.  It works in the local authority context as well.  Obviously, resources are finite and we have set ourselves the very ambitious target of 4,500 licences this year.  It is something that has to be factored into the business planning for the rest of the year.  We are open on it.  We can see the benefits.  It has to be something that delivers a net gain, both for ourselves in terms of the efficiency of outputs and for the sector.  First and foremost is the expertise of the foresters who are submitting the applications, which we rely on as well in terms of the quality of the applications.  There are a number of ways in which one can approach this which would improve the quality of the applications.  Better quality applications mean faster turnaround times.  Like the Senator, I am quite excited about this.  I am expecting recommendations and detail from that working group under Project Woodland on how they might work, for us to consider in more detail.  We have an open mind on this and I look forward to seeing those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1500" speakername="Michael Ring" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#L00900"><p>I have two or three brief questions for the officials.  When the recent legislation was before the D&aacute;il we were told that it would help to speed up licensing and felling.  What has gone wrong?  If the officials wanted one thing today to speed this up, what would they seek?</p> <p>  Second, we have a crisis now.  It is one of the biggest crises in forestry since the foundation of the State.  This will get worse.  Twenty years hence, people will look back and ask what this Parliament and Government did about forestry, particularly with all the talk about carbon, the environment and saving the environment.  Is the Minister of State taking an active role in this?  Is she bringing anything forward to encourage more people to plant and get more people to stop objecting?  Can any campaign be done by the Department to advise people on how important this is for the economy, the country and the environment?</p> <p>  There is real frustration at present.  People do not want to go into forestry.  Like everything in this country, it is over-regulated.  We are over-regulated in planning and in every Department.  Over the last 20 years everything has been over-regulated and people are now fed up.  They are not even bothering to do anything.  It is the same with housing.  Everybody was giving out about the builders and about building houses.  Now, there is a crisis and people want houses to be built.  It is the same with timber.  There is a crisis and people have to go to Scotland to buy timber.  It is an awful situation in this country.  There is some marginal land on which people should be growing forests.  Instead, there is a crisis and people are competing in Scotland to buy forestry to keep jobs in this country.  It is a very sad situation.</p> <p>  Those are my few questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Colm Hayes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#L01000"><p>I will refer to the recent legislation first.</p><p>The legislation presented last year was quite simple and was designed to align the planning and appeals system with what happens in other local authority planning systems.  That had a number of effects, including the introduction of a fee for an appeal and for a submission.  It amended the legislation underpinning the Forestry Appeals Committee that allowed it to be more flexible in terms of how it does its business and subdivides into committees.  It has been effective in many ways, particularly the subdivision of the Forestry Appeals Committee into four different committees.  As I said in my opening statement, in its short lifespan the Forestry Appeals Committee has received more than 1,100 appeals on forestry licences.  There are 48 cases left to be scheduled and 130 on hand.  The difference between that 48 and 130 are the cases scheduled for hearing in May, June and July.  Relative to where we were last year in terms of all of this, forestry appeals and the delays for all stakeholders in how the appeals system is run, it is fair to say that this is a welcome development and great credit and testament to the work of the people involved.</p><p> The Deputy also asked what is the one change we would like to see.  There is no one change and that is the point.  There is no silver bullet here.  We are looking around and implementing various types of solutions.  We have gone to Scotland to see what people there have done.  It is sometimes gets forgotten that Scotland went two years without planting a single tree but eventually got its planting rate up to 10,000 ha per year.  These are big ships to turn around.  It is a big planning system, a &euro;2 billion a year sector, involving thousands of landowners.  This is big environmental legislation.  For that reason, I think Project Woodland is the vehicle to deliver all of that because it is bringing all those elements under one roof to deliver on each of those aspects.  </p><p> The current situation on licensing cannot be divorced from the long-term perspective on forestry and the development of a new forestry strategy and programme.  The Chairman asked me at the start to address only licensing today but it is important that we take a longer, rather than an immediate, perspective on all of these things.  We obviously have an immediate focus on resolving the licensing issues but we also need to keep a longer perspective and see where are we going.  What is the next CAP going to do for tree planting?  What is the next forestry programme going to do?  How is it going to re-engage farmers?  These are all perfectly valid questions that the committee has raised with us previously and we are considering them.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1487" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021052700002#M00200"><p>I appreciate the opportunity to make my views known on behalf of the people I represent.  I have been trained from a young age to treat everybody with nothing but respect and courtesy, and the Chairman knows I will act that way today.  However, today is testing me very much and I will tell you why.  I am personal friends with farmers whose lives have been held up, disrupted and upset and whose financial situations have been detrimentally affected.  I am friends and personally close with contractors who own forwarders, harvesting equipment and lorries that are on the road.  They slaved to get those lorries going.  These are fellows who started out at a very young age.  I am proud to be friends with one man who celebrated a special birthday recently and who recently celebrated his 50th wedding anniversary.  That man has been on the road and hauling timber as long as I can remember.  He is a highly respectable man with a great family coming up after him who are involved in the harvesting business and taking trees out of the wood, drawing them away and all that type of work.</p> <p>  I am personal friends with millers, people who own a mill.  Their operation might look like a big one from the road or the sky and one would say money is not a worry for those people.  It is a worry for them because they are up to their eyes in debt.  All they want to do is get timber in.  The people who need the timber at the other side, including the users, the building contractors, the people who want to build homes and the construction industry want to use their own timber and do not want to be drawing it in from the rest of the world.</p> <p>  The reason I am cross and exercised about this issue is that I know every one of the people involved in the sector, that is, those involved in growing, harvesting and milling timber.  I know them all.  I think of what they have been put through.  They see us today, including myself, dressed in suits, shirts and ties, and with clean hands.  They have worked so hard in their industry and they are looking at the officials and asking what in the name of God they are doing.  I assure the Chairman that I am going to control what I am going to say but if I were in the officials' shoes, I would be ashamed.  They gave us assurances most recently on 29 January and I would be ashamed to think that nothing has improved since then.  If anything, it is backwards we are going.  That is a fact.  Deputy Fitzmaurice indicated earlier that we are taking one step back and half a step forward.  I think of what the officials are doing to the people.  The confidence in the timber-growing industry in Ireland is completely gone.  No farmer or young person would dream of planting a bit of ground because all they are hearing is negativity.  </p> <p>  The Department is not capable of issuing a felling licence or a thinning licence.  It is incapable of issuing a licence or permit for a person to construct a road.  If it does issue a licence, it then tells people to do impossible things.  We are dealing with the issuing of permits.  Fellows are being told to import all the material and not to backfill a road, the way we have always dug a road.  One digs out the clay, buries the bog, brings up the clay and makes a road as one goes along.  We have people telling others to take off the bog and draw every bit of material from a quarry nearby.  No one in his or her right mind could even undertake such a process because it would cost a mental fortune of money that no farmer or person developing a road could even imagine.  We are not a local authority.  We are not being funded from Europe.  My goodness, we are talking about farmers who only want access to the timber they want to cut and sell.  They want to manage their forests properly and cannot do so because of the Department's incompetence.  I would be ashamed to be an official coming before the committee today.  How in the name of God can the officials go to bed at night thinking they have brought a fine industry to its knees?</p> <p>  We are one of the best countries in the western world for growing timber.  If you threw a sapling on the ground, it would be up to your knees in no time.  God gave us this country.  He gave us growth conditions.  My goodness, I think of the highly respectable people who I adore, foresters who did so much in our area to encourage people to plant trees, and the shambles the Department has made of the whole thing.  The officials are incapable of processing a few God-damn permits.</p></speech>

I ask, on two bended knees, our guests to do the necessary work.  It is not impossible.  We are not asking the officials to climb Mount Everest.  All we are asking is that they start to go through the backlog in a workmanlike way.  I call on them to roll up their sleeves and tear at the job of work that needs doing.  Do not mind talking about ships.  If the Department were a ship, it would have sunk further than the <i>Titanic</i>.  The politicians, farmers and representative organisations have all lost confidence in the Department.  I am disgusted to say that because I was brought up to respect officials.  I was brought up to respect people whether they are in a local authority or a Department.  What the officials have done to themselves is to lose the respect of the public and of the people of Ireland.  By God, they are going to have to roll up their sleeves if they are going to gain back that respect.</p><p>I am sorry for being cross but I am cross on behalf of an awful lot of people who are cross today because of the inaction of Department officials and people in the Department who are not capable of doing the job that they are being highly paid to do.</p></speech>

The forestry sector itself came along only in the past two weeks to request a place on the consultative committee, which is up and running.  What has been happening in Brussels for the past two days is the setting of the ground rules for what the scheme will be.  A great deal of work has yet to be done on the design of all these schemes, and the forestry sector has now asked whether it could be a part of the committee that has input into that.  There is still a decision to be made on that and, obviously, many different groups would like to have input.  We met representatives of the forestry sector last week to discuss what the input to the CAP schemes might look like.  Whether the forestry sector is inside or outside that formal structure of the CAP consultative committee, it is absolutely no barrier to ongoing discussion.  We are open to any sensible suggestions in regard to the next round of schemes.</p></speech>

The Chairman can correct me if I am wrong, but we did not receive any feedback on the ideas.  In fairness, every member spent a long time on it.

I thank the witnesses for their engagement.  As can be seen clearly, there is great frustration on our side over the issues facing the sector.  I hope we will not have to return to the matter in the near future, but the licensing issue has to be sorted out.  The sector cannot survive with the licensing output that has obtained in recent years.  It just cannot function.  There have to be licences for afforestation, thinning, felling and roads.  We are not talking about something in the future; this has to happen now.  We will closely monitor the issue of licences over the coming weeks.  I hope we will not have to address it again as a committee but, if so, we will not be afraid to do so.</p> <p>  Members, including Senator Boyhan and Deputies Carthy and Martin Browne, wanted to raise other issues that affect the forestry sector, so we will need to have a further meeting in the near future to discuss them.  Today's meeting was intended specifically to address the issue of licences and the disaster in the forestry sector.  I thank members for their engagement.

The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p> <p>  Members are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, either Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in these public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I call on Mr. Barnes for his opening statement. </p></speech>

Joining me remotely are council members Ms Dawn Holland, Professor Michael McMahon, Dr. Adele Bergin and Mr. Alessandro Giustiniani, as well as our chief economist and head of secretariat, Dr. Eddie Casey.  We value our engagements with the Oireachtas and as we see these opportunities as an important part of our work, we are happy to be here.</p> <p>  The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012.  Its mandate is to endorse and assess the official macroeconomic forecasts, assess the budgetary projections, assess compliance with the fiscal rules and assess the fiscal stance.  Its focus is on the overall fiscal position, rather than on individual tax measures or spending items. </p> <p>  The council&rsquo;s fiscal assessment report, published yesterday, assesses the Government&rsquo;s stability programme update, SPU, for 2021, which was published in April.  It assesses the official projections to 2025 and the Government&rsquo;s wider strategy. </p> <p>  The economy is set to bounce back as Covid-19 restrictions ease and as vaccines are rolled out.  The economy has proven more resilient to repeated waves of Covid-19 restrictions than we had thought.  While the Government&rsquo;s official projections assume permanent losses, or scarring, of about 5% due to the pandemic, these forecasts seem to us to be relatively cautious.  The council sees more upside to potential growth.  The unwinding of savings could boost consumer spending and much of the rebound could be largely domestic in nature, such as supporting the services sector.  However, there are still risks.  Virus mutations could lead to further lockdowns or restrictions in the future, international tax reforms could reduce foreign direct investment, FDI, into Ireland, and Brexit&lsquo;s impacts could be worse than assumed.</p> <p>  Turning to the fiscal side, both Covid-19 spending and sharp increases in core spending mean a large deficit is likely again this year.</p><p>The Government expects a deficit of &euro;18 billion or 8.4% of GNI*.  The &euro;5.4 billion of buffers set aside for 2021 look like they will be mostly used up for the extension of the support schemes, both spending we have seen so far this year and spending that would be required if those schemes were extended beyond June.  However, the deficit should narrow as temporary measures end and as the economy recovers.  The stability programme update projects the deficit to be about &euro;12 billion in 2022 and to narrow to less than 0.3% of GNI* by 2025.</p><p> While it is welcome that the Government has provided new medium-term forecasts, the medium-term budget projections are poorly founded.  The spending projections for later years assume current spending grows by 3.5% every year.  The council&rsquo;s estimates of stand-still costs imply current spending being about &euro;1.2 billion higher than that by 2025.  These stand-still costs assume our estimates of the cost of maintaining existing policies while fully allowing for price and demographic pressures.  Capital spending projections in the SPU are also well above the numbers in the capital plan.  Moreover, the SPU has income tax receipts forecast to grow unrealistically fast given Government plans to index tax credits and bands.</p><p> Adjusting the SPU forecasts, the council estimates the deficit would be around &euro;2 billion higher in 2025 at around 1.2% of GNI*, also taking into account a bigger loss in corporation tax receipts.  The deficit, however, could still close if growth is better than expected.  The SPU projections are on a technical basis and do not reflect the cost of implementing policy changes set out in the programme for Government.  There is little or no detail on the cost of major initiatives, including the substantial Sl&aacute;intecare reforms to healthcare.</p><p> The Government has become ever more reliant on corporation tax receipts.  Corporation tax receipts account for one in five euro of tax collected last year.  Some 56% of corporation tax receipts last year were accounted for by just ten corporate groups.  Major changes to the global tax environment threaten the sustainability of this tax base.  The Government assumes global reforms will reduce corporation tax receipts gradually by &euro;2 billion, but the impact could be far greater.  A scenario considered in this report shows how just five firms exiting Ireland could see &euro;3 billion of yearly corporation tax receipts lost.</p><p> The council assesses that large temporary supports to the economy have been appropriate.  Unlike in the past, Ireland was able to boost spending and other supports during the downturn.  This approach may have halved the contraction in the domestic economy in 2020.  These measures are likely to be extended after June and may need to be extended on a more targeted basis into 2022.</p><p> The pandemic will leave Ireland with a high debt ratio, expected to still be above 100% of GNI* in 2025.  The State has large resources on hand and interest rates are low, but higher debt levels mean a riskier debt path.  The council estimates there is a 15% to 20% risk that Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio could be on an unsustainable path by 2025.  This is not alarming, but it underlines the importance of returning to safer debt levels.  Doing so would help to ensure future governments can respond to future crises in the same way the Government has done for Covid-19.</p><p> Closing the deficit by 2025 would help put debt on a downward path to safer levels.  If the economy recovers as expected, this would mean modest or perhaps even no adjustment would be needed from 2023.  However, this leaves no room for any new policy measures unless taxes are raised or spending falls elsewhere.  If the Government does not raise taxes or reduce spending to fund new policies in the coming years, the projections suggest the deficit will not be closed and debt would remain uncomfortably higher.  Budget 2021 included permanent increases in spending of at least &euro;5.4 billion without setting out the long-term funding.  This means much of the fiscal space that growth in the economy would have provided by 2025 has already been used up and committed. </p><p> Ireland faces significant medium-term fiscal challenges.  These include reducing reliance on corporation tax, potentially costly adjustments to meet Ireland&rsquo;s climate change targets and a rapidly ageing population.  In addition, implementing the policies outlined in the programme for Government would lead to higher spending.  This means a credible strategy is needed.  The Government has failed to publish a credible medium-term strategy as it had promised with the SPU.  The need to set out such a strategy is both essential and long overdue.  The absence of realistic plans and any fiscal targets leaves the public finances without an anchor.  It means overspending in the coming years is more likely to lead to larger than planned deficits or further use of corporation tax receipts to mask the overspending.  The council has long called for reforms to how Ireland&rsquo;s budgets are set.  Three initiatives would help better anchor future budgets - credible debt targets, saving unexpected corporation tax receipts in a rainy day fund, and setting spending limits based on realistic forecasts.  We look forward to answering the committee's questions.</p></speech>

That is about the end of my jumping for joy because the council's report is sobering.  I am concerned about two issues.  We are aware of the potential diminution of receipts from corporate profits tax.  It is difficult to identify in the midst, heat and wake of Covid that we can at same time take the corrective measures Mr. Barnes has hinted at.  To what extent has the council evaluated the impact on the economy in general and on taxpayers throughout the country of taking at an early date the corrective measures Mr. Barnes has hinted at?  What will that do to us as a people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#B00400"><p>The first thing to say is there is still much uncertainty about what will happen with corporation tax.  There is both uncertainty on the policy side in terms of what will happen in the US Congress and about what the EU may do.  There are ongoing discussions at the G20-OECD process and we do not know what will happen.  It may be some details are very important, particularly because so much of the tax comes from a very small number of companies.  Very specific things about their tax strategies may have a very big impact on the Irish economy.  It is clear the risks that corporation tax will fall substantially are there and they need to be addressed.  Dr. Eddie Casey might give the Deputy more detail on the analysis in the report on possible impacts.  It is uncertain but it is a very likely risk and something that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  On the policy side, first, we expect the economy to bounce back fairly quickly.  All being well with the effectiveness of vaccination, we should be in a position where the economy is much stronger quite soon.  That means we can look ahead a little bit.  The public finances have become over-reliant on corporation tax.  It is important to do that adjustment in a smooth way and that is what we are arguing for.  The Department of Finance has put in a smooth adjustment of &euro;500 million a year.  We are saying that if corporation tax turns out to be higher than that path, particularly in the initial years - it may take a few years for these reforms to come in - that money should be saved.  That partly means we will have savings on hand but it also means we will be gradually reducing the extent to which corporation tax is built into the base of the public finances.  We will be reducing the extent to which we are relying on that to finance health, education and those kinds of things.  We think that it is very important.</p> <p>  Although the Department of Finance has put in a smooth adjustment, the adjustment is probably more likely to happen in a relatively sudden way.  For a few years, while discussions are ongoing, nothing may happen, and then, over the course of a year or two, we could have a big step down, which would be very disruptive.  It is about gradually moving away from this.  If we had the choice and could keep this money, we would, but we do not have that and we do not know at what time it will go.  Therefore, we need to manage that smoothly.  Dr. Casey might add a comment on the economic analysis.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Barnes believe a sudden retraction might have the effect of snuffing out the recovery and the acceleration the economy needs and is likely to take at this time?  We might not have a recovery or it might be a very deflated recovery over a period of years if we take too draconian a measure to slow down taxation from the corporation tax side and a number of other issues.  In the context of the Covid pandemic during the past 14 months, does Mr. Barnes accept it has been virtually impossible to plan anything because it has been impossible to identify precisely the full extent of the ravages of Covid?</p></speech>

On the question of the impact, a big and sudden adjustment would obviously be very disruptive.  That is a relatively unlikely scenario to happen in that way, but this is one of the major pressures in the context of the public finances.  It is, however, more of an issue that can be handled gradually, if it is well managed.  That is why it is important that this issue should be managed in a gradual way and that is why we are advocating for a gradual unwinding of the reliance on corporation tax.  I ask Dr. Casey to fill in some details on the economic side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eddie Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#C00200"><p>We looked at the potential economic impact based on how many people tend to be employed in the top ten corporate groups which account for most of the corporation tax paid.  The economic impacts would not be that big.  We are looking at a scenario where the impact of the hit to growth would be approximately 1%.  That reflects the fact that while genuine and real activities are being undertaken by these companies on the ground, they tend to not have a massive employment outlay.  Even when we try to take account of supporting sectors that benefit from the multinationals being present in Ireland, we still do not see a major impact in respect of employment.  Most of the impact comes purely from the hit to corporate tax.  In that context, we would be looking at five of the large companies leaving Ireland, meaning that we could lose corporation tax receipts of &euro;3 billion annually.</p> <p>  On the policy front, we are not saying that we must adjust things immediately in this regard.  We are stating that the plans are poorly founded.  This was something we saw prior to Covid-19.  It is not just the pandemic which is leading to bad planning over the medium term.  We are stating that we must think about what the plan is for corporate tax in the long run.  If we get more corporate tax in the future, beyond what is predicted by the Department of Finance, then we should have a plan for how to set those funds aside rather than allowing the over-reliance on such receipts to build even further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#C00300"><p>Returning to the planning question regarding Covid-19, we accept that it has obviously been a complicated year and the Government had many things on its plate that were challenging and had to be dealt with urgently.  On the other hand, many of the Covid-19 measures have been fairly temporary and there has been strong evidence in the public finances that the economy will bounce back.  This is sort of a temporary situation.  The economy will come back and then we will be in a situation that will not be that different from the one we would have been in before Covid-19 struck.  While there is much uncertainty in that regard, there are many things we do know about, such as, for example, that the population is aging and climate change needs to be addressed anyway.</p> <p>  Equally regarding long-term planning, one of our concerns is that despite the impact of Covid-19 the Government has been moving ahead on different things.  In the budget, it committed at least &euro;4.5 billion in permanent spending that was not related to Covid-19.  That is a huge increase.  We have also seen a great deal of activity regarding the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 and progress is being made in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Therefore, the Government is undertaking many initiatives and it is good that life goes on while Covid-19 is with us.  Those initiatives are advancing.  Our great concern is that the one piece missing from those pictures is how these initiatives are going to be paid for and how much they are going to cost.  It would be possible to state that things have been too complicated this year and the Government has not been able to plan anything and has just been focused on Covid-19.  However, that has not been the case.  Progress has been made on different things by the Government, but it has just not been able to address how those initiatives are going to be funded.</p></speech>

I refer to prolonging the time required for the recovery of the economy by stunting its growth now.  I venture that it is most essential for the economy to recover quickly, get up to full speed and into the business of delivery.  If we stunt the growth of the economy at this stage, it might not deliver and we might create an artificial downturn for many reasons that Mr. Barnes will know far better than I do.  I put that suggestion forward.  My other point for Mr. Barnes to consider is that I contend the Government has managed to deliver in respect of the economy in the best way possible, given the convoluted and exceptionally negative circumstances it found itself in during the past 14 months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.350" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#C00500"><p>I certainly agree that economic recovery is key, a good thing and welcome.  The Government has played its part in that, partially through the massive support measures put in place in respect of dealing with Covid-19 in the form of payments and supports to businesses.  Equally, the Government has also contributed by increasing other forms of spending, and particularly capital spending.  Therefore, the Government is contributing a great deal to recovery and we welcome that.  Looking at the medium term, though, as we set out in our report, the resources from the growth we expect in that period have largely been committed to existing spending programmes or will be needed to meet requirements stemming from things such as population aging.  Growth in itself is not going to generate a huge amount of resources to finance new things.  We basically think it is not going to provide any space for that at all because that space has already been committed.  Over the medium term, therefore, from 2023, we do not see a major need for fiscal adjustment.  There need to be a little bit, but nothing on the scale of what has been-----</p></speech>

Everybody agrees that those supports are desirable, good and effective for the time being.  They would not compare in any way, though, with the economic performance that past experience has shown that we can achieve.</p></speech>

In that sense, we are agreeing with the Deputy that there is a great deal of scope for recovery.  Once we have built that aspect into the scenario, though, the concern remains that the lack of medium-term planning and the lack of clarity on how policy will fund some of these pre-committed measures can themselves be damaging.  Policy uncertainty is being created.  Businesses and households expect that there could be tax rises, but without having clarity about where and how those rises will come.  In preparing for those potential tax rises, therefore, businesses and households may take actions which in themselves will stunt the recovery.</p> <p>  We absolutely support the Deputy's statement that growth is a fantastic way to bring debt down and ensure that fiscal policy is in a sustainable place.  As I said, we are more optimistic in many regards concerning the medium-term prospects for recovery from the disruption caused by Covid-19, and we are not looking back at what happened in the past year.  We are looking forward, and in that regard the key point is that we are concerned that it is exactly the lack of credible medium-term planning that will act as a bit of an anchor on the recovery.  We have been warning about this aspect for several years and it is exactly this policy uncertainty that we would like to see eradicated.</p> <p>  Nobody knows precisely what will happen in the future.  If the experience of Covid-19 has taught us anything, however, it is that entering a period of unexpected crisis in a healthy and credible fiscal position enables the Government to provide supports such as those it has wonderfully been able to provide in the last year.  We must, therefore, separate the Covid-19 concerns - and, yes, it is and has been an uncertain time - from the very important aspect of policy certainty and credible fiscal frameworks.  We worry more about those aspects being the cause of stunted economic growth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1455" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#C01000"><p>I thank the witnesses for the report and the overview.  I would like to tease out a couple of matters.  As we put Covid-19 behind us and look forward to greater activity and a bounceback, I highlight the fact that we witnessed a rapid rally in some areas when restrictions were eased late last year.  Is it expected that there will now be a similar rate of bounceback and economic growth?  I ask that because many sectors will have found it very difficult in the last year.  While they might have been able to come back fast the last time restrictions were eased, businesses in those areas will have now eaten into their reserves and they will be expecting to struggle this time.  What kind of bounceback is expected this time?  Are the witnesses able to put some kind of figure on it?</p><p> Continuing supports are needed in other areas, especially hospitality and entertainment.  These sectors have taken a pounding and may struggle much more to get back up on their feet.  When the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council refers to maintaining these supports, does it mean providing the same kind of support on the same scale?  What reduction does it envisage and what would be the focus of that?  Mr. Barnes said he expects supports to extend into 2022.  Would supports be at the same level?</p><p> Not every sector took a hammering during Covid.  Some did well and personal savings are growing.  This raises different questions.  There is greater inequality between people who have been under pressure and those who have not.  Where will those savings go?  Has IFAC assessed such issues?  Is it expecting savings to be spent in Ireland or will they flow out of the country when people get a chance to travel and take holidays?  Has IFAC assessed how this might develop?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#D00200"><p>Those are excellent questions and we deal with them in the report.  Broadly speaking, we expect a strong bounceback as restrictions ease.  This is partly because it is what we have seen in the past.  The vaccine is a game changer.  During the previous reopening when many people could have gone out, they might have felt an element of fear and decided to be a bit more cautious.  In this case, even with the vaccine, people should obviously still have a degree of caution but they may feel more confident than they did before.  We expect a strong bounceback.  We can see it in the spending on credit cards, for example, which has been very strong in recent weeks.</p> <p>  Another reason for that strength is the savings.  Household income, surprisingly, barely fell last year, partly as a result of the support schemes and partly because some sectors of the economy did quite well and wages increased by quite a bit in the year.  We know that almost one quarter of that was saved, which is a record amount of saving.  One of the big reasons was that people simply could not go out and spend.  We expect that to be a driver of the bounceback and it may be one of the reasons the recovery is stronger than the Department of Finance predicts.  There is a box on this in the report.</p> <p>  While there are different estimates, it appears that there are between &euro;12 billion and &euro;15 billion of excess savings, that is, savings over and above what can be explained.  The Department of Finance assumes that only &euro;2.5 billion of that, or an amount of that order, will be spent, which is a very small part of it.  We believe it is quite likely that while people will not spend the whole amount - they will use some of it for debt reductions or keep it in their savings - it is likely that they will spend more than that the Department estimates.  This will lead to a very strong amount of demand.  We have looked at this closely in the box analysis, which suggests that many of the items on which people will spend, in particular services, have a very high Irish content and that people will not particularly buy and spend it on imports.  This will increase the economic impact and benefits.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, one question is whether people will go abroad this summer and spend their money there.  In a world where people can go abroad this probably means that other people can come to Ireland.  Hopefully, there will be some sort of offset in that regard.</p> <p>  These are uncertainties.  It is very hard to predict because we have never been in this position before.  We believe, however, that there are strong reasons to believe that consumption will come back pretty strongly for the reasons the Deputy outlined.</p> <p>  As the Deputy also noted, the picture is generally positive.  There are risks.  Something could go wrong and some businesses may continue to suffer.  For example, if people do not go back to the office in a big way, businesses that cater to office workers may face a permanent challenge.  As the Deputy said, balance sheets have taken a hit over the past year.  Hopefully, good profitability in the next few months, combined with Government support, will mean the damage is fairly limited.  However, we do not really know where businesses stand.</p></speech>

When we looked at this in our projections we assumed it would be stronger again because the savings are unwinding, there is less uncertainty and there is the sense that we are out of the crisis.  When things start to reopen they will open up on a more sustained basis.  Those kinds of factors lead us to believe the very strong recovery and consumption we saw in previous reopenings of the economy will potentially be even stronger again.  In some ways, we are at that point already.  Credit card data, ATM withdrawals and retail sales data from the CSO all indicate that there is already a recovery in consumer spending, even with the lockdown still in effect to a large degree.  This gives us some confidence that there will be a strong recovery.</p> <p>  To put one estimate on it, which Mr. Barnes alluded to, if the recovery is highly domestic and we spend a large part of the money that has accumulated over the past year on domestic services, it could potentially lead to much higher growth.  One estimate we made in the report looks at the Department's projections, which assume a very high rate of imports for everything being spent.  If we change that forecast so that it is more in line with historical imports for everything we spend, growth will be potentially 6% higher.  These are drastic differences potentially.  While there is major uncertainty, this adds to our more optimistic picture of where the recovery will lead.</p></speech>

The hospitality and entertainment areas, for example, are in a totally different landscape from where they were before.  A scaling off of the supports for those sectors is mentioned, with some supports continuing to 2022.  Should a similar level of support continue or should support taper and, if so, by how much?  How does IFAC see supports changing for sectors that are under pressure?</p></speech>

The money is available to provide the supports that could be needed to make sure there is not lasting damage to the economy.  Exactly how one designs those supports is a difficult question.  It is one on which the Government, with its much closer contact to the business community, is in a much better place to take a view than IFAC is.</p> <p>  The current supports end in June and many people still receive them.  It is obvious that some form of extension will be needed.  With the economy recovering significantly according to our 2022 projections, it is less obvious to us that large-scale support for everyone in a fairly open way would be justified.  It would probably need to be much more targeted.  Perhaps a little more care is needed to ensure companies' business models really have been disrupted and they are not just being kept alive with public support and also that there are proper business transition plans in place.  It is not the fiscal council's expertise to know how to design these schemes.  The Government probably does not need to make a commitment now on what it will do in 2022.  It must wait and see how this unwinds.</p></speech>

The report includes a reference to projections being "poorly founded", and uses language such as "piecemeal", "not realistic", "not credible" and "not ... useful".  In fairness to the Minister, he did not pull his punches either, rebuking the assessment and defending the Government's approach.  What is the next step for IFAC?  The Minister, in his commentary yesterday, did not appear to take the criticisms on board.</p></speech>

In the comments that we have seen in the past 24 hours there is nothing that would cause us to review anything that we wrote in our report.  We stand by our report.  Our assessment is correct and well founded.</p> <p>  Some of these issues are long-standing, both in terms of the way the forecasts are done and whether they provide a realistic and useful benchmark or guidance for parliamentarians.  The long-standing political questions of the overall fiscal strategy for the medium-term is a very urgent and important one for the country.  That is why we say it needs to be answered.  It is very important for many reasons, including fiscal sustainability.  We absolutely stand by what we said.</p> <p>  It is very important because the lack of a clear plan and projections really does leave the public finances in a somewhat vulnerable position.  Making big commitments without adequate funding is a classic risk for the public finances and really does need to be addressed.  This is an issue that we will keep looking at and assessing.</p> <p>  This is also a question for other people, including parliamentarians.  If they accept our analysis and feel they are not getting the guidance they need from the official projections, parliamentarians, including the Deputy, should make those points to the Government as well.</p></speech>

This is not the first time IFAC has called out this issue.  It called it out last year and the year before but nothing has changed.  Many members of this committee and the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach have called also out the unrealistic projections.  The SPU is a wee bit meaningless, to be honest.  It is just ticking a box and does not provide a proper assessment.</p><p>On the Government's medium-term forecasts, the IFAC report states: </p> <blockquote> 	They show income tax receipts growing unrealistically fast relative to incomes.  This is not consistent with the <i>Programme for Government </i>plans to index the tax system, which would reduce growth in income tax receipts. </blockquote> <p>I ask Mr. Barnes to expand on the cost of indexation per year as committed to in the programme for Government.  How does it deviate from the SPU projections?  How did IFAC make the strong assessment that income tax forecasts are not credible?</p></speech>

Instead, what we see is a very fast growth in income tax receipts relative to pay.  That is basically where our concern comes from.  One way to reconcile that would be if the Government chose not to index the tax system.  That means as income grows, extra money is brought in if average taxes increase.  That is what was done in the past couple of years.  The programme for Government stated the Government would not do that if wages were growing in the years ahead.  Therefore, the Department of Finance is implicitly assuming that is what will happen.  We have tried to clarify that with the Department but it is not very clear what it has done.  At face value, assuming the Department's forecasts for income and also assuming the programme for Government indexation goes ahead, these forecasts are incoherent.  Mr. Casey will provide the exact numbers showing how much difference indexation makes each year.</p></speech>

The year-to-year figure varies.  Generally, the estimate that we use, which comes from Revenue, is that for every 1% wage increase for which non-indexation is provided, the impact amounts to approximately &euro;150 million.</p> <p>  There are big questions about how far they go with indexation as well.  Is it just income tax or is it universal social charge, USC, or other things?  We do not know so we took a conservative estimate.  The potential impact could, therefore, be higher.  It  goes back to the view that wages will grow to some degree in the later years and, given that growth, we expect that the impact could be quite high.</p></speech>

Some 56% of all corporation tax receipts come from just ten corporate groups.  The SPU predicts that there will be a reduction of &euro;2 billion in corporation tax receipts due to the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, in particular Pillar I.  Mr. Barnes will note that there is real momentum now behind the process, with the Biden Administration rowing in behind it and calling for a minimum tax rate on corporations of not less than 15%.  This has been welcomed by France and Germany.  As recently as this week, the Minister for Finance doggedly asserted that our corporate tax rate of 12.5% would remain unchanged as a result of this process.  Does Mr. Barnes think that is likely?  What impact does he foresee if our corporate tax rate were to increase to 15% as a result of this process?</p></speech>

We base our views on what the stated Government policy is.  There are complex questions as well as to how Ireland would respond.  Again, as we said earlier, it also depends on what actually comes out of the international processes as well.  For these reasons, we do not have a very clear view on that.  What we are clear about is that there is a big risk that, in future, Ireland will not be able to raise as much corporation tax as it does under current policy.</p></speech>

Obviously, there are risks around that but it is a starting point.  For us, the main concern is the fact that overall revenue, whatever the rate would be, would fall and that is a major problem because it is a big share of the tax take.</p></speech>

IFAC has commented elsewhere in its assessment that the programme for Government made spending commitments in core areas such as health and housing, which are required.  At the same time, the programme for Government has ruled out tax increases across a majority of tax heads, apart from some smaller areas such as the plastic bag levy, sugar tax and carbon tax.  Is the programme for Government compatible with the stability programme update?  Is the fact that they are not compatible the reason the SPU lacks credibility, as the IFAC report states?</p></speech>

One is in terms of compatibility with the rules.  At the moment, the rules are in a slightly strange position because the exceptional circumstances clause has been enacted.  That clause will be lifted.  There is also a lot of discussion around reform at the EU level.  What we have done in this report is we have assessed, if the rules do come back in, whether what we see in the SPU would be broadly compliant.  In terms of the numbers it is compliant.  The question is really about the policies that go behind them.</p> <p>  Looking more broadly at the question around the fiscal position and getting back to budget by 2025, as the Deputy said, this is really where the medium-term strategy is required.  Getting back to budget balance seems like a reasonable objective over that period, with the economy growing and also because of the need to get debt down.  If we accept that, carrying on with the current policies would perhaps lead to a small deficit or an all-round balance.  Maybe a little bit of fiscal adjustment would be needed but it would not be massive.</p><p>As the Deputy said, the big issue is how other things are funded.  That has been complicated.  Our estimate is the Government committed not to apply increases to around one third of the tax base.  That includes income tax, for example.  The areas mentioned for revenue increases are quite small, with the exception of PRSI, which is a bigger tax head.  However, as the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, showed very nicely last week, a 1% increase in PRSI rates still just raises approximately &euro;600 million.  It is not huge when compared with the estimated cost of implementing Sl&aacute;intecare, which is of the order of &euro;3 billion.  These are the pressures.</p><p> On the spending side, the Government has also committed not to cut spending on around half of the overall spend.  These big pressures are why the Government will have to decide how it will reconcile those things.  Will it increase taxes, try to cut spending in other areas or not go ahead with some of the priorities it has talked about?  The Government really needs prioritisation.  It is difficult because health, housing and climate are all areas where there is much agreement that things need to improve.  How that is delivered will be very difficult given the way the Government has set things up.</p></speech>

Does he accept the old model of measuring what the State can or cannot afford to do has changed and this will change the approach of IFAC in future?</p></speech>

Interest rates have never been this low and are still essentially negative for Ireland.  Ireland should experience quite high growth so the debt dynamics are essentially very favourable.  The Deputy is correct that we are in an environment very different from the ones we have seen in the past.  Of course, there are all the challenges we have talked about as well, which are not to be set aside.</p> <p>  The way we look at it, one can have favourite measures for the public finances but they essentially all come back to the same sorts of things.  We have looked at the public finances in terms of debt sustainability.  While the debt dynamics are very favourable, we have also looked at the risks around that.  It is quite possible that interest rates or growth will not stay this favourable forever.  That is a big concern for anyone who looks at these things.  We have done a careful analysis of this, which Dr. Casey will tell the Deputy a little more about.  The bottom line is that, yes, debt dynamics mean this level of debt does not create problems but we need to bring it down to a more sustainable level.  Dr. Casey will explain the exercise we did to look at that question explicitly.</p></speech>

Over the past couple of years, we have advanced our work in this area to develop joint modelling work with staff at the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, on how to do these things in a frontier way.  We now use stochastic debt sustainability analysis, where we build in a very detailed interest modelling platform.  We have insight into all of Ireland's debt securities, what the interest rates are on them and how long they will be fixed.  We can then tell when some of the debt will run off, when we have to replace it and how expensive that will be, potentially.  We look at a probability path for debt under different types of scenarios.  From that, we can say there is a 15% to 20% probability that the debt ratio will remain as it is, at very high levels, or will start to rise in an unsustainable way.  This takes on board the factors of having a very low interest rate and a very low debt serving burden right now.  Much of that is fixed for a very long time.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding all those positives, there are still risks when debt is at very high levels.  While there are risks that it could become unsustainable, those risks, and the uncertainties around them, are magnified when debt is at high levels.  We know even less about what will happen in future because we are at a high level.  Those are the risks we point to.</p></speech>

It is an eye-opener for some of us.  I am certainly taken aback by some of the facts.  They show we have an awful political operation ahead in the recovery to try to get ourselves to a place of financial stability in the future, while trying to do our best for the people who elect us and trying to ensure fairness for everybody in the recovery that is required.  At the same time, we are trying to protect and safeguard overseas investment, which we do not want to jeopardise with regard to tax rates and corporation tax rates.  We have to be so careful about how we proceed.  I am very grateful to Deputy Doherty for some of his probing questions because they answered some of the questions I wanted to raise.

Unfortunately, I have to leave at 10.30 a.m. to attend another meeting so I will be brief.  I have two observations and two related questions.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that the witnesses gave the Department of Finance some kicking on the stability programme update and did not pull any punches.  Is the SPU credible at all and is it of any use this year?  Is there a likelihood of the European Commission correcting Ireland's homework and sending it back to the Department for another assessment or, at least, review?</p> <p>  My second point is on our over-reliance on corporation tax from a very limited number of companies and the vulnerability that presents to our Exchequer and spending plans.  It seems to me we are going back to the 2000s.  This could end up being a similar situation to what we experienced in the 2000s in terms of an over-reliance on residential stamp duty related to people selling ever more expensive houses to one another.  There is a clear vulnerability there.  </p> <p>  The point was made, in the context of the programme for Government, that the Government has essentially tied its own hands when it made a political commitment not to increase income taxes over its lifetime.  In that context, it restricts any revenue-raising measures the Government might be considering to measures confined to taxes that could be raised on about 14% of the existing tax base.  That is a very risky situation to be in given the commitments made in the programme for Government and the deficits the pandemic exposed in our public services and other aspects of public policy.  One way of addressing that gap and generating additional revenue is to look very seriously at the prospect of the introduction, for example, of a well-designed net wealth tax.  Is there any merit in that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#F00900"><p>The Deputy asked three questions about credibility, the impact of corporation tax and a wealth tax.  I will leave the second question to Dr. King and we will come to it last.  On credibility and the SPU forecast, it is welcome the Department has returned to doing medium-term forecasts that are four years ahead.  Although, ideally, they should be five years ahead, it is the first time in more than a year the Department has done that and it is very helpful.  It is helpful to everyone, including us, to be able to understand what it is doing.</p> <p>  However, as the Deputy said, we have concerns the forecasts are poorly founded.  On the economic side, we endorse these forecasts.  Our view is a little more optimistic but these are reasonable macroeconomic forecasts and we have endorsed them.  It is not a problem on that level.  The issue is much more on the public finance side.  There are two problems.  One is that even conditional on the existing policies on which the forecasts have been done they are not well-founded, as we have discussed.  There are a number of issues.</p><p>Among those, we have a concern about incoherences between the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and a lack of costings, particularly on the spending side, which is more in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's remit than that of the Department of Finance.  The political questions also need to be resolved, but those are matters for the Government, not officials.</p><p> Overall, the budgetary forecast is not credible.  We have produced an adjusted version because the adjusted numbers are probably the ones that people can use.  They are useful on two bases.  First, they are more realistic and seem to be more correct.  Second, they provide better guidance because they are built up in the right way, allowing someone to understand what the various moving parts are and to come up with a different set of numbers if he or she takes a different view.  It is difficult to do that with the Department of Finance's numbers in the stability programme update because many aspects of those are unsatisfactory.</p><p> It is for the European Commission to decide, but there is not really a process through which it can revert with criticisms.  Importantly, we have an endorsement role on the macroeconomic side, in that we endorse macroeconomic forecasts before they are sent to the EU.  The EU requires them to be endorsed.  If we do not, the EU would have no forecasts from Ireland to examine.  The situation on the budget side is different, in that there is no endorsement function.  Although we are providing an assessment, it is not in any way binding and does not affect the way the European Commission will consider the matter.  It is important to understand this difference on the institutional side.</p><p> The council's mandate is not to examine specific tax or policy measures.  As such, we do not have a view on a wealth tax.  As we have discussed at previous hearings, there are many forms of wealth tax and they may have different implications.  More generally, we welcome the creation of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare.  Taking a rigorous look at these issues is a good idea and could contribute to developing a good strategy.  It is important that, when bodies like that or the Pensions Commission report, it leads to change and is not just an exercise in kicking matters into the long grass.</p><p> I will ask Dr. Bergin to contribute on the impacts of corporation tax.</p></speech>

How can we replace that and could the design and imposition of a net wealth tax help to address the imbalance and fill the gap?</p></speech>

I understand him now.  A detailed analysis in the report goes through the over-reliance on corporation tax and how it poses a risk to funding our spending, given that it is volatile and highly concentrated.  There is a risk of a sudden reversal.  We have argued that, if there are excess corporation tax receipts, they should be kept aside and not used to fund current spending, thereby reducing the reliance over time.  The Deputy is right in the sense that a sudden reversal in corporation tax receipts means that other taxes will have to increase or spending may have to decrease.</p> <p>  Mr. Barnes answered the Deputy's question on a wealth tax.  We make an assessment of what would have to be done overall without prescribing taxes.</p></speech>

I welcome IFAC.  Having served on the previous Committee on Budgetary Oversight, placed a great deal of stock in IFAC's reports and made the point continuously that this kind of advice was absent at the time of the crash, it is worth repeating that, broadly speaking, the only advice against a soft landing that was coming to the Government at the time was from a fairly obscure economist from UCD.  Now, there is a plethora of advices.  For the past five years, IFAC has been warning about corporation tax.  It is warning about the over-reliance on that tax again.  The previous Government only moved on that advice in its final year in the form of the rainy day fund in the budget.  Despite the fact that such a fund was included in the 2016 confidence and supply agreement, it was really only introduced and activated in 2019.  It has now been exhausted as a result of Covid.</p> <p>  For me, a reasonable summary from a lay man's point of view is this: Covid has cost an inordinate amount of money, but in spending that money, the Government has fulfilled the unwritten but expected social contract between the State and its citizens by bolstering them and providing a safety net when they needed it.  We expect a big bounce, although there is a question mark over how big it will be.  IFAC continues to warn about the sustainability of the corporation tax figures and, for the umpteenth year, has warned about the over-reliance on a number of companies.  Our debt is significant and will have to be serviced.  The Government's plan is to have no income tax increases.  Proceeds from the bounce, be it large or modest, will be exhausted by Sl&aacute;intecare and housing, meaning that there will not be a great deal of room for manoeuvre unless spending is reined in or there is some creativity in terms of the tax system.  Is that a fair summary of the situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.389" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#G00600"><p>That is a pretty good summary, although there is an important nuance to highlight.  As we set out in the report, even with some reduction in corporation tax receipts, we would still get close to or at balance by 2025 if current policies are maintained, which would not be an unreasonable objective.  Any adjustment to current policies in this scenario would be modest.  The real challenge is in deciding how to pay for elements on top of all that.  The Deputy said that there would not be much room for manoeuvre, but I would say there would be no space for these additional elements to be accommodated without there being some offset.  If one is planning to improve the quality of public services and spend more money on them, it is not unnatural that taxes would have to rise to balance that.  It would not particularly depress the economy, given that money would be being moved from one place to another.  It is not an overall consolidation.  Rather, it is about ensuring that both sides of the equation are balanced.</p></speech>

Has he anything further to say on the matter?</p></speech>

It will instead be about targeting specific sectors.  If businesses struggle even after the economy has returned to its normal level, it raises a deeper question about their position.  It may be that some sectors will take more time to return, and that is fine, but it raises a question about whether such businesses will be able to survive.  It is much too early to tell at this stage, but once the recovery is in full swing, the general need to support should be less.  That is as much as I can say.</p></speech>

That is what IFAC was set up to do.  Mr. Seamus Coffey often repeated his predecessor's words that IFAC was instituted in part to institutionalise in the system the memory of the crash so that the same mistakes would not be repeated.</p><p>I say that in a non-partisan way and as a non-political statement.  It is how we work out from that.  This is advice from the council and I do not think it should be ignored or that we should look for ways out.  I go back to the infamous words that revenue buoyancy will rescue us from all of these things, even though the argument is circular in nature.  The warning is coming early enough.</p><p> A lot of questions were answered and I found this session very useful.  The reading material was also very useful.  If Ireland had to adopt a 15% corporation tax rate as a minimum, can the witnesses give us some kind of narrative around what they think the impact of that might be?  What revenue would it raise?  What impact might it have on companies that seek to locate here?</p><p> Corporation tax is not the only contribution of such companies to Ireland.  When I was on South Dublin County Council about eight or nine companies were responsible for 75% to 80% of the county's commercial rates base and they all happened to be companies that paid corporation tax.  If any of those companies decided to leave for any reason, it would not just hit the corporation tax base but also a whole load of other revenues often seen by the public.  What would be the implications of a 15% corporation tax rate?</p></speech>

Deputy Lahart mentioned Mr. Seamus Coffey.  I am sure he would give him a far more detailed account than I would.  The points the Deputy has made are good.  In a world where Ireland ended up with a tax rate that is more similar to other countries it would lose some of its advantages.  It would not lose all of them.  There are many other reasons companies choose to locate in Ireland.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Barnes believe that is a concrete analysis?</p></speech>

We do not know the strength of the different forces between the tax rate and the rest because we have only ever observed them together.  Being an English-speaking country, the kind of economy Ireland has, the skills of its workforce and being a member of the European Union are all major advantages.  As the Deputy said, the tax advantage exists and we do not really know how to separate it from the other things.</p> <p>  There are essentially two effects that would result from any scenario around tax reform, not just the one the Deputy mentioned.  One is that some of the tax revenue may shift.  Companies may pay tax in the United States or elsewhere, rather than in Ireland.  The other is that some activities may shift.  That is a different impact.  Activity shifting has the kind of impact the Deputy has spoken about, in terms of people's employment, the taxes they pay and the money they spend in shops.  There are those two effects.  </p> <p>  It is much easier for companies to move money rather than assets and the actual underlying activities.  Large companies do move those things.  The Deputy is right that there are two channels.  As I said, the strength very much depends on the detail of the companies and what is agreed.  It is important to keep track of those two channels.</p> <p>  A third channel which is important is that the tax that is paid into Ireland is spent by the Government in various areas.  That flows back into the economy as well.  There is a net inflow of money into Ireland.  Most tax is taken from one person in Ireland and used to finance something else in Ireland.  This tax is a net flow from the outside.  It is quite significant in that case.</p> <p>  I want to come back to a previous point the Deputy made about the lessons of the crisis.  Looking back, one thing which has not changed since the crisis is that the budget cycle in Ireland remains very focused on an annual cycle.  For example, it is striking that the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan has all kinds of details about what is planned but the budget numbers only cover 2021.  One would assume additional allocations will have to be made for it next year.  There is no discussion or costing of that.  The most up-to-date information we have for costing Sl&aacute;intecare comes from 2017, which is a long way away.  </p> <p>  The focus on the annual cycle leaves Ireland adrift and at risk of not having a medium-term plan, letting things drift and spending revenue as it comes in.  As we saw in recent years, corporation tax could be at a different level in the future.  Breaking the annual cycle and moving to a more medium term cycle, as the best countries have done, would be helpful.  That is one of the reasons we care so much about medium-term forecasting. </p> <p>  A credible medium-term spending forecast could align all of the Departments' spending plans a few years ahead.  There would not be much by way of decisions to be made in the budget because we would have a clear medium-term strategy that would help us to avoid having a cyclical movement of public spending because it would be set on cruise control.  We cannot have that at the moment because the medium-term spending forecasts are not well founded and built up to allow us to do that.  Spending numbers would have to be revised again whenever we next get the opportunity to do so because they are not well founded.</p> <p>  To come back to the Deputy's point on the lessons from the crisis, it is very important for the committee to move away from the annual cycle.  Things will always have to be changed a little bit from year to year because lots of things happen, but moving away from the cycle is important and that is why it is important to have a medium-term strategy.  We need the forecast that would allow us to do that.</p></speech>

Could we sell to the public the idea that we have Sl&aacute;intecare or something else with a medium-term tax need that will be reviewed after a period of time?  It is often the case that when a tax is introduced we feel it is permanent.  For example, it is hard to move away from a tax such as the USC.  Aside from creating certainty, what would be the advantages, to use a clich&eacute;, of having an envelope for each Department, etc.?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.398" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#H00600"><p>The main advantage is that it would avoid the procyclicality that we have seen in the past.  If there is a temporary boom where the economy bounces back very strongly, it would be a mistake to spend or build spending plans around that money.  That is the main advantage.  There are lots of other advantages to good planning.  It also means that Departments, rather than chasing after more money, may, in some areas, think harder about how they can make more of the existing money or will at least know how much they have and can plan around that.  There are many advantages to a more medium-term approach.</p> <p>  In terms of temporary tax measures, it is very hard in general for governments to be credible around these kind of temporary measures.  There is a much better chance of being able to do that if there is a generally credible framework around public finances.  For example, one issue we had is that investment is running at very fast levels.  We do not have a very clear sense of the long-term gain.  Is it a catch-up period of investment?  It will probably go to a higher permanent level of investment, but what will that be?  Some of these dynamics could be built into a medium-term plan.  We do not really see that at the moment because it is not well articulated.</p></speech>

Ar nd&oacute;igh, t&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orshuimi&uacute;il, mar is gn&aacute;ch.  </p> <p>  I note Mr. Barnes stated that if just five firms were to exit the market, the State could see &euro;3 billion in yearly corporation tax receipts being lost.  As I said, I have raised these concerns with the two relevant Ministers.  I have also mentioned the need to begin planning for an alternative industrial strategy, given the coming expiration of the current one.  IFAC has also raised concerns about spending and the need to reduce the deficit and try to reach a balanced budget.</p><p> I agree with the witnesses on the risks to our low corporate tax model.  Surely transitioning from our corporate tax-based model to one based on creating a high value-added sector would require greater public investment and State involvement in the economy.  The same goes for reaching our climate targets.  We need to be prepared for the eventuality of an impact on our corporate tax receipts.  If we accept, based on that analysis, that FDI growth might decline as a result of international tax regime changes, then we need to be prepared.  The State would need to grow its own.  Focusing solely on balancing the budget at a time when corporate tax receipts could be falling might lead to the worst of all worlds.  Is there not an argument to be made that we need to invest now and ensure we place our tax base on a more secure, long-term footing?  Would it not be a more prudent course of action to invest and ensure we have an alternative strategy, in case we need it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#J00200"><p>I agree that sustainable growth is probably the main factor in ensuring the sustainability of the public finances.  Were the economic model to change in a significant way, it is right that the Government would prepare for that, which may require public investment in all sorts of areas.  These are definitely legitimate matters for the Government to think about.  From our perspective, the point we are making is that the sustainability of the public finances is important as well, particularly in view of the fact that we have a very high debt rate or level of debt.  One of the big risks is that there could be a shortfall in growth and one of the things that could drive that is a big contraction in FDI activities or if FDI activity were to stop all together.  That is definitely a concern.</p> <p>  Our point on the spending side is that the issue is prioritisation.  There is an amount of spending that is consistent with fiscal sustainability.  That amount can be increased if taxation is increased in a way that matches but it is important to maintain the sustainability of the public finances.  That may require prioritisation, either between tax cuts and spending or how much one increases taxes and adjusts spending.  It may require prioritisation within spending, that is, orientating spending more towards things that will help to support growth, for example.  The key message is that fiscal sustainability is very important and if money does need to be spent, whether on measures to help support growth, address climate change or tackle inequality, for example, that needs to be funded in a sustainable way.  That is the key point and it requires prioritisation between the different policy objectives.</p></speech>

The council notes in its opening statement that capital spending projections are well above those contained in the capital plan.  This ties into what Mr. Barnes has just said in relation to funding in order to ensure that we build and grow.  The IMF has said in recent times that Ireland has infrastructural deficits.  Those deficits actually put us on the back foot when Covid-19 struck, particularly in the context of our hospitals and schools and we had exceptionally long lockdowns as a result.  The capital spending projections are well above the capital plan but there have been reports in the media that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is concerned that Departments may not meet their capital spending targets.</p> <p>  In terms of balanced regional development as we emerge from this crisis, we have huge concerns about unemployment levels and businesses no longer being viable.  New sectors will have to be built up and infrastructural deficits addressed.  In that context, capital spending will be an important core element and such spending must be done on a regionally balanced basis.  Is IFAC aware of any mechanisms used by other member states to ensure that Departments meet their spending targets?  That is going to be very important.  It is one thing not having funds available to stimulate the economy but it is another thing entirely having such funds available but being unable to spend them, unable to get funds into the hands of contractors to commence capital projects and, most importantly, unable to have that money circulating in the economy.</p></speech>

Capital spending, which had been very weak following the crisis, is now ramping up and is set to ramp up even further at quite a fast pace to a level that is historically fairly high for Ireland and well above the EU average.  There is a lot of capital spending due, much of which is outside the Exchequer area, in areas like housing and the local authorities.  There is a lot of investment going on and that is important.  It provides a favourable background for the recovery and hopefully will deliver future benefits.  Our specific concern is that the Government's projections for capital spending should be in line with its capital plan.  For some reason, which we do not fully understand, the Government has projected a much higher number and that number takes investment to a very high level by historical and European standards.  We are a little unclear as to what is happening there.</p> <p>  Obviously, capital spending is important for growth and many other things.  It is important, therefore, that it is delivered.  In past years, there has been a tendency for the capital budget to be underspent.  It is important that the targets are met in a sensible way, not just because costs are going up but because volume is being delivered.  Obviously, delivering capital projects is a complex business.  On the quality of those projects, there are many issues arising which are beyond my expertise.  Professor McMahon may have something to add on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about other member states but there are many examples to look to, including Singapore which is a world leader in this area.  There, public investment is planned on a multi-year basis with clear co-ordination across Departments.  For example, roads are built to places where houses will also be built and so on.  It is about having a credible plan.<br/><br/>To go back to some of the answers we gave earlier, it is not that investment is good and current spending is bad.  It is really about what we spend on.  Good spending is good and in that sense, that is where the planning aspect of this is important.  As the Deputy alluded to, there could be plans that would increase debt in the near term but which could be seen as very sustainable because they would bring benefits of growth further down the road.  That is a really important part of the debt sustainability equation.  That would be my main response to the Deputy's question.  It is not just about one plan or another but about a joined-up plan and a multi-year plan.  It is not tying the hands of the Government but it is giving a focus to all of the Departments, not setting each of them individual targets but getting them all to sing from the same hymn sheet.</p></speech>

I have one more question.  IFAC states that if the Government does not raise taxes or reduce spending to fund new policies in the coming years, projections suggest that the deficit will not be closed and debt will remain high.  Leaving aside the question of what types of taxes need to be raised, we need to prioritise tackling tax avoidance within existing tax measures.  Some weeks ago, the Committee of Public Accounts heard evidence relating to bogus self-employment and the resultant loss of PRSI contributions, up to a potential value of &euro;1 billion per year.  Mr. Barnes made reference to increases in PRSI bringing in an additional &euro;600 million.  While we could have a conversation about that, I am more interested in the issue of tax avoidance.  Even if the Government increased PRSI rates, tackling avoidance would still be important.  Would we not be better served by tackling the avoidance under existing tax heads before we start talking about changing bands, introducing new taxes and so forth?  I am interested in the council's views on that.</p></speech>

I do not know how much money is available but it makes sense to look at that.  It is important for the sustainability of the tax system that it is seen as fair and efficient, so those are definitely areas to consider.</p><p> I sound a note of caution in that Governments often look at reducing waste or improving enforcement as ways of filling gaps in their budgets.  Those are areas an organisation such as ours looks at very seriously now.  In the past, the way in which estimates of how much additional revenue such an approach would bring in have been accurate.  People who look at public finances generally examine these carefully because they can seem like an easy way out for the Government.  The Deputy is right, however, that they may well be totally appropriate in the circumstances.</p></speech>

As I said, as a council we do not look at the merits of specific issues and, therefore, we do not really have a view on that.  Clearly, though, housing is an important issue in Ireland for many reasons.  Housing costs are very important, including for Ireland's competitiveness, so it is a matter we look at.  I do not have a view on it.</p></speech>

What is IFAC's view concerning what should be done to prioritise Sl&aacute;intecare and the vital reforms required in this area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.411" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#K00600"><p>Sl&aacute;intecare is a major reform.  We know health spending increased very sharply in recent years.  I think it increased by approximately 30% in the three or four years before the crisis and the onset of the pandemic.  Aspects of Sl&aacute;intecare could help to reduce pressure on healthcare costs.  It is an ambitious reform programme.  We are not experts in health, so it is hard for us to make a detailed analysis.  However, we are concerned that this major reform is being undertaken without any up-to-date estimate of the costs.  The most recent assessment of the costs was done in 2017 by the health committee.  Many things have changed since then and we do not have an up-to-date estimate, or at least none that we have seen, of how much the Government now expects Sl&aacute;intecare to cost.  We have seen the numbers for this year and the expected cost is &euro;1.2 billion.  Apparently, those numbers were in the budget but it was only made clear this month that that had happened.  There is, therefore, a big issue of transparency there.  We see this occur in many areas.  There seems to be a deficiency in joining up different things across different Government documents and initiatives.  Like the Deputy, we would very much like to know how much the Government thinks Sl&aacute;intecare is going to cost and how fast it is planned to implement it.  That is essential as the first stage.</p> <p>  The second stage would then be to consider the projected cost in respect of sustainability and risks.  Internationally, when countries have undertaken healthcare reforms, they have often cost much more than expected and added to financial pressures.  I am not saying that is going to happen in Ireland but given that we do not even have a baseline for how much Sl&aacute;intecare is supposed to cost, it is very hard to think about those risks.  It is urgent that the Government produces an up-to-date costing.</p></speech>

It will have a major impact on the country and on healthcare provision, but also on the public finances.  If the Government were to tell us that the cost is the same as it was before, that is fine with me too.  The key point is that we need to see an estimate of the cost and to understand how that has been arrived at so we can consider whether there might be risks or weaknesses.  With a major change to a big area of spending, such as Sl&aacute;intecare, thought must be given to potential risks and overruns.  That partly depends on how well the costings have been done and we cannot assess that because we do not have up-to-date numbers.</p></speech>

It is hard to know how people are going to behave.  Hopefully, increased consumer spending will help business to recover.  One possible risk is that there may be some inflation in the short run as everyone rushes out to have a meal they have not cooked themselves, and so on.  There will be quite a lot of uncertainty in that regard in the short run.  There is probably less uncertainty regarding where we will come up afterwards, but it could have an impact.  It could impact on all sorts of things, including, for example, on construction costs.  We are already seeing a major increase globally in the cost of raw materials and various aspects of the construction process.  It is, therefore, going to be a somewhat unusual time.</p></speech>

In the meantime, I will ask some questions of my own.</p> <p>  On corporation tax data and the impact of regulatory changes we may see in the next few years, we saw an effective doubling in corporation tax receipts between 2015 and 2020, when they increased from &euro;6 billion to &euro;12.5 million.  There was economic growth during that time but we also introduced changes to the constraints concerning intellectual property, IP, and capital allowances for expenditure on intangible assets.  The almost doubling in the growth of corporation tax receipts did not correspond with a similar increase in jobs in Ireland in the FDI sector.  Does IFAC consider that there is a considerable level of phantom FDI-led activity in the State?  I refer to the use of mechanisms such as corporate inversion and the terms of the IP regulations to simply on-shore profits in Ireland to reduce the tax paid by such companies globally.  Do we have enough data on that aspect?  </p></speech>

The Chairman is correct that there is a mismatch between the revenue coming in and the level of activity.  Much of this activity is occurring in fairly unusual sectors anyway, from a productivity perspective.  Regarding what this might tell us about the future, as we discussed earlier, one possibility is that the revenue will move while the jobs stay here.  Alternatively, there might be more pressure on the jobs at the same time.</p> <p>  On the data, it is hard to tell.  There are confidentiality restrictions in this area for good reasons.  A small number of big companies are involved in this activity and, quite rightly, the way these things are handled means that information is not necessarily publicly available.  It is a major area of uncertainty.  These are big, complex and dynamic companies as well, so it is very hard to know what decisions they would take.  It will probably depend a great deal on some of the details.  Perhaps Dr. Casey has something to add.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Eddie Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#K01400"><p>Dr. Aidan Regan and Professor Sam Brazys have done some work on the phantom nature of some of this FDI-led activity.  They tried to assess the phenomenon on the basis of the volatility of some of the receipts.  That is a good way to look at this issue, but is it hard to say which activities are genuine and which may be phantom.  Examining volatility is a good way to approach this issue, but it does not give us the full story of whether there is anything behind this type of activity.  Profits in the major multinationals which move to this country and locate their activities here can be really volatile anyway.  There can be huge transfers in a good year.</p> <p>  I do not know how to determine levels of phantom activity.  It is an exceptionally difficult question to answer.  We have tried to get around this issue by asking where corporation tax receipts would be now if, after 2014 or 2015 when they accounted for their normal share of tax receipts, they had grown in line with the domestic economy.  That is a useful way to think about things on a fundamental basis.  What level might we return to in a more normal situation is a useful question.  That is where we come up with these estimates, such as the &euro;3.5 billion mentioned by Mr. Barnes earlier, of how much corporation tax receipts could fall in future.  These are the ways in which we think of this but it is an exceptionally difficult area in which to gain a true insight because of major uncertainty and the high level of confidentiality around individual companies and activities.</p></speech>

As Mr. Barnes said, it may be that even if revenue goes, the jobs will stay, but does that impact on our ability to navigate those regulatory changes because we simply do not understand what is phantom FDI and what is not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.421" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#L00200"><p>That is part of it but much of the uncertainty is what will happen to policy.  Much of the uncertainty reflects the reliance on a few big companies doing very complicated things in businesses where intellectual property is a big feature.  As Dr. Casey said, there is a lot of volatility as well.  We have to take that as a given.  Based on that, we then have to take a cautious approach to what we do about it.</p> <p>  The Department of Finance has taken a step in that direction by adjusting corporation tax receipts downwards by &euro;2 billion.  That actually means the level of corporation tax in 2025 will still be higher than it was in 2019.  It is not a fall in absolute terms; there are just no gains.  The Department started making that assumption last autumn.  Since then, the risks have increased and that is one of the reasons we think a more realistic starting point would be a downward adjustment of &euro;3.5 billion.  That is also why we argue that the Department should wind down over-reliance on corporation tax in line with that sort of profile, rather than continuing to spend until we, potentially, hit a wall and have to adjust very quickly.  It is one of those unknowns we have to live with and will manage best by running a relatively prudent policy around it.</p></speech>

Mr. Barnes mentioned that we do not have up-to-date figures on the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  There is certainly huge frustration that people cannot have sight of the capacity review for the health service because that will obviously have major budget implications.</p> <p>  Regarding medium-term budget planning, we have heard from IFAC and other groups that we do not always do it very well in this country.  Is it fair to say that as we move towards more performance-based budgeting, the medium-term outlook is more about setting targets and then deciding how they will be serviced?  This would allow the tax base to be adjusted accordingly, looking at what we have to spend and where we will spend it, rather than what we tend to do in this country, which is annual budget development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sebastian Barnes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2021052700002#L00400"><p>The Chairperson has picked up on two issues regarding the case for this more medium-term approach.  There is a complementarity between these stronger performance budgeting-type frameworks and medium-term planning.  By setting clear spending envelopes several years ahead, Departments can then plan to deliver around that.  There is a big complementarity with that, which might help to increase performance and efficiency.  Of course, this makes it easier, because it is not necessary to spend as much money to get to the same outcomes, or better outcomes can be achieved with the same money.</p> <p>  The other complementarity is a process like that might reveal more information and encourage the Government to build more data.  It could then build bottom-up forecasts of these things more effectively.  The Chairperson will remember over the past couple of years this has been a big problem in the area of health.  Basically, a top-level, top-down target was set for the health service, which did not correspond to anything it planned to spend or any of the pressures it was under.  The health service was spending on a bottom-up basis and the average overrun was in the hundreds of millions every year.  This is a really big problem.  Improving the budgeting framework in general, with a more microeconomic focus, would help to solve these macroeconomic problems.  The two very much go hand in hand.</p></speech>

What would the IFAC consider a targeted stimulus?</p></speech>

It was not clear there was going to be a vaccine at that point and we thought that consumers and investment would be pretty depressed by now.  As it turns out, things have worked out much better than that.  We have seen the economy is more resilient and people are much more willing to spend if they get the opportunity and if there is a vaccine.  Our previous advice, that it was possible we would need some sort of big stimulus programme, is not really needed at this point.  The fact that investment is ramping up means the Government is already putting a lot of money into the economy.  That large-scale, untargeted programme of pumping money into the economy programme does not seem to be required.</p> <p>  There may be some sectors of the economy, firms or activities where the recovery will take longer or balance sheets have taken more of a hit.  The Government may need to design some programmes or measures to help those.  We are basically saying the money is there should the Government feel those measures are necessary, but we should not expect to pump lots of money into the economy just to get spending going because the economy will be doing okay by that point.</p></speech>

I should mention that in quite a number of debates between 2011 and 2014, I had to apologise to all economists for what I was about to say about them regarding their predictions in previous years.  I am not going to do that just now since we have had that experience, but I will ask a couple of related questions.  Does IFAC accept that housing prices, housing costs and the availability of affordable housing are part of our taxation system?  I believe they were and are because they create a situation whereby members of the workforce can plan ahead in the clear knowledge that they can afford to house themselves as time goes by.  Does IFAC take house price inflation into account, for instance?  To what extent does that impact on its projections?  I have two or three other lovely questions and the witnesses will enjoy all of them.</p></speech>

The tax system clearly does interact with that.  Again, as a council, that is the sort of tax issue we do not look at in the context of taxation design.  Housing is a very complicated issue and there are other people who know more about it than we do as a council.  It is definitely important to look at this issue.  We know the damage housing bubbles have caused in the past.  We also know that housing is very important to the competitiveness of Ireland.  As the Deputy said, it is important to the way people consume, save, plan and where they work.  There are many issues.  It is something we are constantly keeping an eye on and it is important for tax revenue as well.</p></speech>

There has not been much construction although there has been some.  These things contribute to the tax system.  Given there is a big shortage of supply in the economy, basically the speed at which supply is able to pick up will be important for growth and the growth of revenue.  That is probably the main way we look at it.</p> <p>  We also look at evidence of a housing bubble funded by credit.  We all have the not-so-distant memory of the damage that caused the economy in the past.  The housing market is functioning very differently from the way it did in the housing boom years, but we continue to monitor it very carefully.</p></speech>

We focus a lot on that.</p> <p>  We would welcome moves by the Central Statistics Office to improve the data that are available on GNI*.  We also highlight very good work done by the Department of Finance in moving more towards these domestic measures in its projections.  The fiscal advisory council has been actively looking at these.  Once we start to correct for the external sector everywhere it shows up in the economy, we end up with quite a different picture of how the economy looks.  For example, we get a picture of the economy that is much less open and has much fewer exports and imports on a star basis than it does if we look just at raw numbers.  That is very important for understanding the economy.  I give credit to our secretariat for playing a leading role in the development of those measures but also to the Department of Finance for including GNI* in its forecasts.  </p> <p>  Maybe Dr. Casey can give us a sense of how GDP developments, which are much more influenced by the international sector, compare with what we have seen on GNI*.</p></speech>

All our focus has shifted to GNI*.  We have tried to promote that re-emphasis in our reports by scaling everything we look at relative to GNI* and looking at growth rates in GNI* terms.  It is how we think about the economy now.  If we look at tax revenues that the Government takes in, it is a much better way of explaining what is happening with those tax revenues.  There is a much tighter relationship historically with tax developments if we look at tax relative to GNI*, rather than if we look at things like GDP.</p> <p>  Where we are now, if we take GNI* relative to GNP, the former is at about three quarters the level of the latter and actually closer to half of what GDP is.  We can see that the scale of the gap between the two measures has ballooned in recent years.  We remember the 2015 surge in GDP and the claims of &ldquo;leprechaun economics&rdquo; that were being made internationally.  GNI* and GDP diverged quite a bit that year, and that divergence has continued ever since.  This highlights the degree of pollution in the data that is caused by large-scale activities by foreign-owned multinationals. </p></speech>

I do not envisage that but I am a modest observer and I do not know.  However, it seems improbable that the impact on individual companies would be such that it would damage the companies to a totally unnecessary extent.  The yield might not necessarily compensate for that.  What is IFAC's view?</p></speech>

In the earlier phases of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, many people expected the outcome to be very unfavourable to Ireland.  In the end, because of the precise way that BEPS happened - and maybe because of other factors that arose at the same time - we had a big surge in corporation tax receipts.  This shows that over a period of a couple of years, companies can move these tax revenues in very big amounts relative to the scale of the Irish economy.  We know that.  Whether they will be moved to do that again depends on what happens on the policy side and other factors.</p> <p>  These things can move.  It is not a one-way street.  That is why we need a prudent approach on the corporation tax side.  We need to reduce the structural reliance on that spending in the years ahead.  We need to do that as far as we can under our own control, which means saving it and being prudent rather than waiting for a measure to be imposed on us.</p></speech>

It highlights two really interesting points.  First, one of the only areas on which Revenue does not provide an estimate is how much any change in the corporation tax rate would raise.  That we do not know what kind of impact a change in the corporation tax rate would have has highlighted the level of uncertainty in this regard.</p> <p>  The second area highlighted in some very good and complex work done by Professor Ronald Davies and others in University College Dublin, UCD, is the probability of future FDI flows coming into Ireland if we were to change the rate.  Professor Davies suggested that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate would reduce the probability of Ireland being chosen as a location for new FDI from outside the European Union by 4.5%.  This gives us a sense of what could happen.  However, because things are so concentrated in a handful of very large companies, it is hard to say that this is exactly what would happen or this is the behaviour we could see in future.</p></speech>

Various people around the globe have spoken as if they had intimate knowledge of the damage Irish corporation tax was doing to the international economy in the last century.  It was found at the peak of the economic crash that a number of other countries had incentives in place in their economies that were even more favourable than those provided here, but nothing was said about it at that stage.  I know changes have been made since.  However, is there a grave danger that we could create a problem through our continuous preoccupation with what is seen to be the necessity to increase corporation tax, which incidentally is a tax on employment?  It will affect the workforces in various countries.  Incidentally, a number of Irish investors have invested overseas.  How are they likely to be affected in the event of there being major changes here?</p></speech>

Ireland does not have a great deal of influence on what will be decided in the United States.  It might have some, but the US will mostly decide on the basis of what it believes to be in its interests.  That is why the main thing that we can do in Ireland is to plan, so that if the likelihood materialises that we lose a big chunk of corporation tax, that will not make a big hole in the public finances because we will have prepared for it properly.  That is the best we can do because it is essentially out of our control.</p></speech>

Would we damage the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for foreign direct investment, even though we need FDI on an ongoing basis?</p></speech>

As one of the Deputy&rsquo;s colleagues correctly pointed out earlier, there is both a public finance aspect to the planning and a question of keeping Ireland attractive for FDI.  There are many reasons unrelated to tax that companies choose Ireland as a location.  There may be things that public policy can do better to support that in a cost-effective way.  That is, again, one of the levers that people should be thinking about in years to come because, clearly, the risks are much higher than they were a year ago.</p></speech>

Keeping in mind that a repatriation of all US-based companies may benefit the US, it also might not do so because the rate may have to be changed again, unless we get into a global tax war, which would not be beneficial to anybody.</p></speech>

The way corporation tax works is complicated.  It is complicated from an economic point of view because it interacts with other taxes and because most corporate tax codes are also complex.  I would say that many countries are in a situation where they have high rates, but their base is being eroded significantly, not just by international things, but by domestic choices.  There is a lot to be said about international corporation tax.  It is very complicated and I am not an expert in that subject, in the context of Ireland or any specific country, so I cannot say much more about it.  It is an issue, however, and these things need to be looked at.  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare will also be thinking of some of these questions in an Irish context.</p></speech>

Today's meeting is to discuss the implementation of the United Nations Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the ratification of the optional protocol.  I extend a warm welcome on behalf of the committee to Mr. Markus Schefer, a member of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Ms Catherine Naughton, director of the European Disability Forum, and Mr. Pat Clarke, vice president of the European Disability Forum.  We are also delighted to welcome members of the Spanish Senate Comisi&oacute;n para las Pol&iacute;ticas Integrales de la Discapacidad.  It is an honour to have this meeting and everyone is extremely welcome.  We look forward to the discussion.</p> <p>  I remind members they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located within the precincts of the Leinster House complex or in the convention centre, if the D&aacute;il and Seanad are sitting there.  This meeting is online, so I ask people to bear with us if there are technical issues.</p> <p>  Before we start the proceedings proper, I must begin with some formalities.  Regarding matters of privilege, witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings should be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protection afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given as to whether or to what extent the evidence given online is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from other jurisdictions should be mindful of their domestic statutory regimes.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they should respect that direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice, as stated previously, not to comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now call Mr. Schefer to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I will begin with some of the insights the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has gained from conducting state party reporting procedures.</p> <p>  The UNCRPD covers nearly all aspects of life and requires substantial changes in law, society and individuals&rsquo; attitudes toward persons with disabilities.  In addition, it extends to all types of impairments.  Correspondingly, implementing it is a task with which every member state struggles.  It is of paramount importance to develop a comprehensive strategy that sets out goals, timeframes and the measures to be taken and that clarifies the priorities and spells out the reasoning behind them.  Poorly co-ordinated, piecemeal approaches are ill equipped to succeed.  The measures included in legislation must be accompanied by the funding required to realise them.  The committee is frequently faced with promising legislation only to be sobered by an absence of enforcement due to a lack of funding.  Representative organisations of persons with disabilities need to be actively involved throughout the process.</p> <p>  From my personal experience in implementation processes in five Swiss cantons, such participation is indispensable in developing those measures that in fact address existing problems in society and address them appropriately.  These experiences have also underlined the importance of including local government in all implementation efforts that touch its spheres of responsibility.  Our committee observes that the provision of services for persons with disabilities is often the responsibility of local government and that it is here where the implementation frequently fails, whether the state is unitary, as it is in Ireland, or federal, as it is in Switzerland.</p> <p>  Article 33 of the UNCRPD requires the establishment of an independent monitoring mechanism.  Parliamentary oversight cannot substitute for it, but it can complement it by transforming its findings and those of the independent monitoring mechanism into political action.  In addition, parliamentary oversight equips the legislature with direct know-how of those areas where existing legislation is adequate and those areas where it needs to be amended.  However, a clear separation of the parliamentary oversight and monitoring bodies must be precisely delineated and it must be ensured that the independence of the monitoring mechanism is not compromised.</p> <p>  The convention does not contain an exhaustive definition of disability, but it does clarify that a disability is the result of the interaction between an impairment and society at a given time and place.  Domestic law ought to specify further the disabilities covered by law, but it must not attempt to codify an exhaustive list.  As society changes, together with its perception of discrimination and suffering, any definition must remain open to be adapted accordingly.</p> <p>  Allow me one last remark.  Implementing the optional protocol in a dualist state effectively requires its incorporation in domestic law.  We may expound on this in the discussion.</p> <p>  I again thank the committee for its generous invitation, and I look forward to discussing this subject and addressing questions from the committee members.</p></speech>

Parliamentary work for the fulfilment and development of the agreements of the UNCRPD and for the rights of people with disabilities has been very intensive and fruitful.  We started this legislature with the mandate to represent the interests of people with disabilities, who were able to vote for the first time thanks to a change in the legislation.  I refer to 100,000 people whom we feel we can represent because they have used a constitutional right which had been taken away from them.</p><p>Also, from the Cortes Generales, along with a great agreement, we have changed laws on forced sterilisation or neutering of people with disabilities.  This is a milestone both for society and for Spanish democracy.</p><p> An essential part of the new educational law is educational inclusion.  There is some debate but also lots of support.  It means that over the next ten years there will be an increase in the resources used by the autonomous regions for the inclusion of students with disabilities in ordinary classes, and in respecting the opinions of parents and all the educational community.  Social inclusion in society starts in schools.  The ability law supports the rights of people with disabilities, supporting them to use their legal rights in all legal areas of life.  It tries to change the parliament to promote abilities and to focus on the right to autonomous decision-making for people with disabilities.  It promotes liberty, equity and basic rights, as full members of society.  We have other challenges facing us.  Throughout this process, the participation of the entities representing people with disabilities, social organisations and families, have been and are essential in reaching agreements and in moving forward in the fulfilment of our commitments to the rights of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

The EDF is an umbrella body organisation, which represents more than 100 million EU citizens with disabilities in the EU.  It does that in conjunction with members at a national level and at a European level, all across Europe.  Our work advocates for the rights of persons with disabilities.  The EDF is part of the independent monitoring framework established by the EU to monitor the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, at the EU level.  It does this together with the EU&rsquo;s Fundamental Rights Agency, FRA, the European Ombudsman and the European Parliament.  EDF publishes information for its members on their rights within the EU.  It has a regular human rights report series, which assesses the extent to which the CRPD is being implemented in Europe.  Last year's report focused on Covid-19 and on persons with disabilities.  It highlighted the neglect and discrimination faced last year by Europe&rsquo;s 100 million persons with disabilities as the pandemic ravaged Europe.  I will now pass the floor to Ms Naughton.</p></speech>

While it was disappointing that Ireland was the last EU member state to ratify the convention, it is inspiring to see the leadership now being shown in Ireland through the establishment of this joint committee.  The committee demonstrates the vital scrutiny role that national parliaments can play.<br/><br/>As Mr. Markus Schefer has already pointed out, parliamentary oversight complements the independent monitoring function established in the convention.  Of course, this committee does not stand alone.  Every other committee in D&aacute;il which follows a Department also should be playing this scrutiny role.  For example, if the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is working on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, this is also where the inclusion of and accessibility for persons with disabilities can be handled. This Committee on Disability Matters can hold ministers and civil servants to account related to implementation of the convention and the allocation of resources to its implementation.  It also has the opportunity to discuss these matters with visiting EU officials, giving the committee a potential role in the scrutiny of the implementation of European Disability Rights Strategy, which was adopted recently in March 2021.<br/><br/>In terms of the ratification of the optional protocol, which allows individuals, groups of individuals or third parties to submit a complaint to the committee, complaints can only be made against a state party that has ratified the optional protocol.  It is, therefore, important that Ireland moves ahead with this.  Twenty-two EU member states as well as all EU candidate countries and the United Kingdom have ratified the optional protocol.  The CRPD committee has consistently called on state parties to do so in its concluding observations.  We see it as an important measure of a state party&rsquo;s willingness to be held to account and to enable its citizens to seek redress.<br/><br/>The sustainable development agenda was mentioned on the agenda of this meeting.  At the core of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is its promise to &ldquo;leave no one behind&rdquo; but also &ldquo;to reach the furthest behind first&rdquo;.  Unlike the previous millennium development goals, MDGs, disability issues and persons with disabilities are included<b></b>with 11 specific references throughout the 2030 agenda.  Persons with disabilities are mentioned 19 times in the SDGs.  A key message presented in the introduction of the indicator framework is that all indicators should be disaggregated, where relevant, by disability and other characteristics.  If you want to know how well Ireland is progressing in its goals to tackle poverty, you also need to know how people with disabilities are being reached. <br/><br/>On Covid-19, people with disabilities around the world have been hit very hard by the pandemic, by the measures taken to control the pandemic and by the pandemic itself, looking at the loss of life of people living in institutional facilities across Europe, and of course by the middle and long-term economic consequences.  On the EU's recovery and resilience facility, Ireland is expected to receive &euro;853 million in 2021 and 2022.  It is important to see this as an opportunity to invest in and to promote the rights of people with disabilities.  Following the guidelines given by the European Commission, there should have been extensive consultation with civic society on how and where those funds could be used.  Persons with disabilities should be at the heart of reforms funded by Ireland&rsquo;s recovery and resilience plan.  The area of greatest concern is, of course, the tragic number of deaths and infections in residential care.  EU funding is an opportunity for Ireland to invest in personalised and community-based support and services to ensure those who require support and services are not cut off from their communities in times of crisis.  It is also an opportunity to assist persons with disabilities in finding their place in the open labour market, especially after the job losses we have seen during Covid-19.<br/><br/>Last, as we hope we see the end of the Covid-19 crisis, EDF has been campaigning for access for persons with disabilities to vaccination.  In low- and middle-income countries around the world, it is expected the European Union and countries such as Ireland will contribute to the COVAX programme to ensure vaccination and recovery funding and investment will these countries without discrimination.  This is something Ireland can support.</p></speech>

I extend a welcome to our witnesses today and thank them for their time and for the information that they have provided in their submissions.  We are talking about the UNCRPD.  The European Disability Federation referred to it as a convention of many firsts.  First, it is the first human rights treaty to be adopted in the 21st century.  Second, it is the first international human rights convention that the European Union has ratified as an entity itself.  That means that as a collective, as a network of states, the EU itself is committed to bringing into fruition the humanitarian aspirations outlined in terms of access to rights.  Third, it is the first convention that has been negotiated directly with its beneficiaries through sustained consultative procedures.  Fourth, it is the first convention that makes explicit provisions for a series of multi-level mechanisms of monitoring its actual implementation.</p><p>In my view, it is the most inclusive disability legislation to date in that it incorporates, on an equal basis, different levels of lived experience of people with different impairments.  Taken together, these unique aspects of the convention should cumulatively give it height and weight, gravity and meaning in terms of genuinely improving the lives of people with disabilities.  All of that is good, but because Ireland has chosen not to ratify the optional protocol, it has wangled itself out of any accountability for the disabled people of this country who know the rights enshrined in the legislation are not being vindicated in their direct lived experience.</p><p> As a country, Ireland has more equality legislation than many other jurisdictions but some of the least equal metrics in terms of employment, independent living and access to personal assistance services for disabled people.  As a State, we did not embrace the UNCRPD and delayed its ratification for 11 years because Government knew how shaky our legislative and service provision foundation was, with a significant number of Acts yet to be fully commenced.  There is concern about the optional protocol and its ratification.  In responses from the Minister, it has been pushed backed a number of times and different excuses have been given.  The most recent excuse was that Government is awaiting a response from the UN on its report.  I am concerned about that and about the protracted publication of several vital reports, such as the Indecon report on the cost of disability and the disability capacity review.  Coupled with this, the disability portfolio has been transferred from the Department of Health to the new Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  As a committee, how do we ensure appropriate accountability and funding in the budget process for this area?</p><p> I have a number of questions.  As the committee is aware, key to an effective implementation of the UNCRPD is co-ordination between social services and health services and between central government and local government.  Will Mr. Schefer outline how we can ensure effective implementation of the UNCRPD at local government level and a co-ordination approach in that regard?  Will he also comment on the additional mandate provided to the UN committee by the optional protocol and the impact of a state party not ratifying that protocol?</p><p> Based on his knowledge, does Mr. Schefer feel the shift of the narrative from disabled people being service users to rights bearers and the move from a medical or charity model to a human rights model will be key drivers to the effective de-institutionalisation and Article 19 of the convention?  I would welcome his thoughts in that regard.  A deep attitudinal change is needed.  What are the practical policy changes that accelerate cultural change?</p><p> My next question is to the Spanish Senate members.  Based on the experience in Spain, what have been the most effective measures taken to increase employment in the disabled people's community, in respect of which Ireland has the lowest level in the EU, at 32.3%.  We have a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024, but the extent to which it has been effective is inconclusive.</p><p> My final question is to the European Disability Forum representatives.  They have noted that disabled people are disproportionately impacted by the risk of poverty, a situation compounded by economic recession.  In the forum's analysis of various member states of the EU, what countries were identified as having best aligned their social policy with the social model of disability?  In what national context is there the best statutory footing and consistent choice-led access to services?</p></speech>

On the co-ordination issue, it is an issue on a horizontal level.  It does not just pertain to social and health services, but to all aspects of Governments.  For example, the security services need to be included.  Policing and construction need to be included.  Every department of government needs to be co-ordinated.  That is the purpose and focal point of Article 33.1.  The convention leaves open to member states whether they create one or more focal points.  However, it is important to have one focal point that has the ability and power to link together all Government entities and to co-ordinate across all administrative borders, which in my experience is a quite a task.  Administrations are usually structured vertically and they do not have much interaction.  A member state needs to have one entity.  It is important that entity is hierarchically suitably located and not on a low level because low level focal points in this area usually do not have the capacity to bring on board government entities that might be resistant to a common policy footing, including local government.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, very often services are being provided by local government.  This is where good intentions very often come to an end and are not transformed into action.  A member state needs to have focal points on local government as well because it, too, is structured vertically.  There must be close interaction with central government or otherwise it will not work.  It is a task to create an entity that can effectively work across established borders within administrations and such entity needs to be located at a hierarchically relatively high level.<br/><br/>On the impact of non-ratification of the optional protocol, the optional protocol in effect puts some pressure on the Judiciary to abide by the UNCRPD in that it opens up an avenue against the decision of the highest court.  Once a domestic remedy has been exhausted a complaint can be filed with the committee.  Where this is a possibility, it transforms into some pressure on the Judiciary to take the UNCRPD seriously and not simply to ignore it.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, to ratify the optional protocol a member state needs to have a legal means in place for people in judicial proceedings to invoke the rights in the convention.  To do that in a dualist country requires incorporation.  In the UK, the lack of incorporation of the UNCRPD hampers the effectiveness in judicial proceedings despite the UK having ratified the optional protocol.<br/><br/>On the shift from the perception of disabled persons as service-users to rights-based bearers, this week we had European hearings on de-institutionalisation.  It has become clear that de-institutionalisation will not work as long as persons with disabilities are viewed as objects of Government benevolence and users of services that cost a lot.  This mental shift needs to be take place to enable de-institutionalisation and <i>vice versa</i>.  By starting de-institutionalisation we contribute to a change in societal views.  We cannot wait for one part to happen in order that the other can start.  It is a shift that will require some time.  It is not a development that can be completed by tomorrow morning.  It will require time and this is more of a reason to start now and start intensively.<br/><br/>Deputy Wynne mentioned attitudinal change.</p><p>In the end, the effectiveness of the convention relies on attitudinal changes.  That is partly why the convention contains a provision for measures to create some sensitivity in society.  Article 8 is a provision that not all of the UN human rights treaties contain.  We are here not just as a legal matter but to change society, with the timeframe that entails. </p></speech>

It is a complicated picture in terms of which country is doing best.  I will share with the committee that our last human rights report, issued in 2019, was on poverty and social exclusion.  What we saw across Europe was a mixed picture.  However, really disappointingly for Ireland, the employment rate of persons with disabilities was the lowest in Europe, which has been mentioned.  In this human rights report, we compare many different elements of progress in some countries.  For example, on disability assessment, Estonia was very good.  In terms of government spending, Denmark was the highest.  Ireland was close to the lowest there as well, unfortunately.  In these obstacles to employment and social inclusion, there is a range of policy areas affected, be they transport, housing, education or personalised support.  This requires, therefore, a whole-of-government approach.  I am not sure how this has been done in Ireland but it could be something like a disability lead in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office or some kind of central co-ordination mechanism that can look horizontally at the elements that will contribute to social inclusion, to tackling poverty and to promoting employment.  It is not simply a one-Department issue.  I will share the forum's European Human Rights Report 2020 with members in order that they can look at the different elements in more detail.  Then, if there are any particular microdata that they want from countries as well, that is something we can also provide to give more nuanced detail.</p></speech>

The powers mainly reside in the autonomous communities.  However, at legislative level, it is the state that decides on the guidelines for its development.  In my opinion, being part of the convention, as well as being able to ratify the agreements of the convention and the protocol, benefits persons with disabilities, in the sense that the national reports help us to take legislative measures.  Then, via the transfer to the autonomous communities, competencies can be implemented afterwards.  Also, the organisations representing people with disabilities provide a very important service, both to people with disabilities and to their families.  They provide support, via the creation of residencies and social services support.  They also help in decision-making.  Every time a rule or regulation is created, it is binding in its application in the full territory of Spain.  It is, therefore, important to conduct continued assessment on our decisions, so that we can make better decisions at every step.  This is essential to give people with disabilities the possibility to enjoy the same and equal rights to the rest of the citizens.  In this regard, today, in Spain, we are working very actively.  Actually, we are going to modify the Spanish constitution to change the wording we use to refer to disabled people.  We will include the term &ldquo;persons with disabilities&rdquo;, instead of &ldquo;disabled people&rdquo;.  This is an important step.  In Spain, we have a rule of law where people with disabilities should be able to enjoy full legal, judicial, and social capacities and to live autonomous lives.  Every year, national reports will always include recommendations to improve the quality of life and equal rights for this community.  The Government of Spain takes this very seriously.</p></speech>

I have a few questions.  On this committee, I feel frustrated that we have a segregation or compartmentalisation of Government functions.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth seems to have to have to pull extra weight.  I do not see other Departments rowing in as efficiently and as properly as they should be.  I would ask the members of the Senate, from their experience, how did they get the segregation, the roles of national government, central government and local government, to all to take their responsibilities in relation to people with disabilities as a default base level in how they go about all their policy duties?  Second, when they ratified the optional protocol together with the convention, was that a basis to help that along?  When they had the optional protocol in tandem, did that help make progress in respect of the segregation of responsibility?</p> <p>  I have a general question on the cost of disability.  There is definitely an argument for a payment for the cost of disability.  We all agree that having a disability costs extra to survive because we, as a society, put up so many barriers to people taking part.  It does cost extra.  I would like to hear people's opinions on how we re-balance that with a payment to help on the cost of disabilities.</p></speech>

Spain has a central power.  In the Spanish Parliament, there is a Lower Chamber and the Senate.  Legislation is created from there.  Legislation passed there goes to autonomous communities.  Autonomous communities have their own legislative powers but they develop their powers from national legislation.  On another level, there is the local level, which every important.  I know that as I have been the mayor of my home town.</p><p>I have a colleague here, Josep Ruf&agrave; Gr&agrave;cia, who has also been a mayor of his home town.  Lots of us today come from the level of the municipal governments, which play a fundamental role.  For instance, in the case of my village, my home city council had a number of agreements with the autonomous communities.  Via those agreements, the economic resources were provided so that we could devote them to fighting gender violence and promoting the quality of life of people with disabilities.  This is essential if we want to develop social policies and provide all those who need it with the economic and social resources that they need.</p><p> I was a mayor of a small village with 6,000 inhabitants but we had social housing spaces for people with disabilities and they lived in the local area.  They were also very active in local activities.  It is also very important that there was a really beautiful atmosphere in the village.  People with disabilities were really catered for by the rest of the neighbours.  They were helping them all the time.  They were playing with them at playgrounds.  They were helping them when they went to the sports centre.  I think this is the tendency, as it should be.  We should create effective legislation that does not overlap or interfere with old mentalities that have been there throughout the past such as has been said, identifying them with higher costs for society.  No, this is wrong.  We in society should be doing exactly the opposite: it is our duty and obligation to help them.  When we talk about costs, we have to think, believe and make sure that it is an effective cost and that we spend our money effectively.</p><p> My dream is that disabled people are fully integrated in society, that they are really happy and that we overcome the negative image.  They have been rejected by society.  We are living in a modern society and modern societies should be inclusive.  For that, we need the economic, legislative effort from all of us in order that we can overcome barriers and that we can count on the understanding of everyone in society.  That is why taking part in this committee is a great satisfaction for me, because I know I am working, I am making an effort so that my child will feel part of society and he will not feel like he is excluded because he has a disability.  I am sorry if I get emotional when I think about my son.  This is what we are dealing with here.</p><p> This is a must for states.  I believe that in Ireland and in Spain we must pass laws in a comprehensive way and listen to people in this community because they know at first hand the reality.  All these laws must be accompanied by funding and can be translated to the next level, which is the autonomous regions and through partnerships with local communities.  A part has to be given by the local government, the regional government, the central government and another by the users.  All this money is then used to fund the cost, which is considerable.  If we listen to the stakeholders and the families we will be able to be successful in Spain so that the users can welcome the work that has been done.  There is a lot still to do but the law must be a driver for getting funding for what we are doing.  I have tried to explain how we do it here in Spain.  In each region there are different aspects because they have the ability to pass laws according to their own criteria, and also at local level, so there are some actions taken which are the result of these negotiations.</p><p> I am quite proud.  I will tell the committee an anecdote.  Fifteen years ago, I visited the United Kingdom.  There were several representatives from municipalities, and we met a parents' association - parents of children with disabilities - but this association was merely about helping one another.  When someone needed some help, he or she would ask the other members of the association for help, which means that the Government was not helping them.  It was not providing professional or specialised care for disabled people.  When I came back to my home town, I told people in the parents' association there about it.  What they do is mediate between the users and the local government or the regional government in order to get more effective services for people with disabilities.</p><p> It all depends on the political drive.  We think that with this Government, there is enough sensitivity about it.  We have a specific Ministry for the disabled.  That means we are getting the resources that we need, and we get attention as there is an open channel for communication.  I say this to help the committee to understand how we do things.  There are many things we should do better and some more things that we should do but it is good to let the committee know how we do things here in Spain and to encourage members to keep up the effort and the good work to raise awareness and to be heard by all the powers and administrations that are in Ireland to make them understand that we have an obligation towards these people.  We have to work for that and it is worth it.</p></speech>

This is something that is really influencing poverty and social exclusion among persons with disabilities right across Europe.  For example, in our human rights report on poverty and social exclusion we saw in some countries the annual additional costs come up to something like &euro;23,000 a year in higher-income countries in Europe.  Research in Ireland shows also that it can be up to 23% of a family's budget.  The extra costs include transport, housing, assistance, things which should be covered by social protection and other measures which families are taking on themselves.  The idea of totally separating disability-related support and income or employment-related support is really important to ensure that when somebody can go into work, they still receive the support they need for the extra disability-related costs, which are substantial.</p><p>They are covered well in our human rights report to the extent that we could and I can give the committee more details on that later from the countries where we had the research.</p></speech>

I have four, if there is time to get to them.</p> <p>  First, how can we truly ensure participation for people with disabilities?  With the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, what is the best way to ensure that happens effectively?  Second, how can people with disabilities be put at the centre of our response to Covid-19 and, going forward, the climate emergency?  Third, and perhaps this is for the Spanish Senate, I am wondering if members could discuss their experience of ratifying the optional protocol at the same time as the implementation of the convention.  I am wondering how this benefited people with disabilities and the progress on the convention.</p> <p>  Finally, I am wondering what the impact of Ireland not ratifying the optional protocol is.  Some of the statements and submissions referenced the increase in poverty and disproportionately higher rates of poverty for people with disabilities.  I am wondering how that will have an impact.</p></speech>

I am happy to be here with you.  I have been twice to the Irish Parliament - the last time in 2019 - and also the Congress so I have some knowledge about the green island that is so close to Spain.  In my party, as you know, in the Spanish state, we have different levels.  We have the Spanish state and the Spanish law.  Then we have the autonomous regions and we also contribute some laws.  This is very important because in each region, we might have different political parties and the combination of these parties has an effect on the social policies and also the investment changes.</p> <p>  We do not see this as spending.  We call it investment.  It is not spending; it is investing.  Of course, it is a cost, but it is a cost of an investment for these people to access a normal life.</p> <p>  In our group, we have sponsored that the political programmes should be prepared in easy reading.  We are training people with disabilities to be part of the political election lists for the Congress and for the Parliament, and also for the Congress of Catalonia.  As you know, my party is now ruling in Catalonia.  We have the presidency and we want to keep the investment.  First, I call it "expenses".  I am going to call it "investment".</p> <p>  It is good to revise the convention.  This is done by external assessment of the Spanish state and how it works.  This helps the regions, the central state but also the political groups in the different chambers.  My party is in the Senate.  We are in the Spanish Congress, also in the European Parliament in the European Free Alliance and also in the Government of Catalonia.  This work will never be ended because we do not know if we will get to a certain level of disability in the future, maybe due to a disease or an accident.</p> <p>  As for the last point, I think the president will answer the Deputy.  I thank her for her questions and thanks for being here.</p></speech>

In relation to some of the earlier questions that were listed, one of the ways in which we can get meaningful engagement of people with disabilities is for a level of funding to be made available, and if it needs to be, specifically directed around the CRPD.  That is about the only way that people will be in a position to engage.</p> <p>  One of the areas that might work in this regard is the recovery and resilience funding.  As far as I am aware - I was not in a position to find it - Ireland has not yet published its plan for how that money will be spent and this could well form part of that overall plan.</p> <p>  There are a few other points mentioned earlier.  Senator McGreehan mentioned the extra cost of disability.  I am quite well aware of this.  My son has Down's syndrome and the extra cost that we have to incur in terms of getting him in and out of his employment etc. is quite significant.  This morning, I was at a meeting on the European Year of the Rail and it was about independent and spontaneous engagement with the rail system.  One can put anything after "independent and spontaneous".  The way it is structured at present in Ireland, particularly around the lack of additional funding to cover all these matters, means that independent and spontaneous actions by persons with disabilities are severely restricted and that needs to be addressed in the greater scheme of things.</p> <p>  Deputy Wynne mentioned a comprehensive employment strategy.  I sit on the implementation group and when I finish here this afternoon, I go to a monitoring committee meeting of that.  That is one of the areas that has been lacking or at least that was the first committee strategy that ever had its own monitoring committee.  That is something that should be replicated in other strategies across the board within Ireland which will give it greater credence when it comes to reporting on the CRPD.  I believe that should an approach to be made to the implementation monitoring group for its comprehensive employment strategy, I am sure that the chair of that committee and some of the members would be delighted to enlighten this committee as to the work and what the group has achieved in the recent past.</p> <p>  The main point is funding for the disability organisations in order to get meaningful engagement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Markus Schefer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021052700002#F00900"><p>On the impact of not ratifying or ratifying the optional protocol, I would say it has a legal and political impact and a symbolic impact.  The legal and political impact is you add the Judiciary to the players promoting rights of persons with disabilities.  If you ratify the optional protocol, the Judiciary will have to take the CRPD and the rights in the CRPD seriously and apply them.  You do that if you incorporate it.</p> <p>  If you can have recourse to the Judiciary against an Administration that is not quite willing to implement the laws that Parliament has passed to the degree necessary, an active Judiciary will have an impact on the Administration and that then will transform, hopefully, into better implementation of the laws by the Administration.  It adds the regular parts of government that we usually rely on in order to implement the laws.  If you do not ratify the optional protocol, you will leave out the Judiciary and, as in all areas of law, if you leave out the Judiciary something is lacking and implementation will suffer.</p> <p>  Then there is a symbolic consequence.</p><p>Not ratifying the optional protocol tells the world community you are not comfortable enough with what you are doing to have an external body in a court-like procedure examine whether your internal actions, as they transform to individuals, are in conformity with the CRPD.  It creates the impression among the rest of the world that you are not confident enough that you are doing enough or whether you are implementing what you are doing to the degree that suffices under the CRPD.  The optional protocol and the convention together are one whole.  That is why the committee continuously urges and recommends member states to ratify the optional protocol.  I am the special rapporteur on new communications on the committee so I deal with all the individual communications as they come in as well as with, for example, the interim measures that have become more important.  It is important that, even from the international level, we give people who think their rights have been violated under the convention a recourse outside of their country that gives them the assurance that the person looking at their case is not entangled within the confines of the political system of a specific country.  The optional protocol can assure that.</p></speech>

As the only Member of the Oireachtas with a declared physical disability and a Senator in my third term, I think the establishment of the committee is very welcome and I hope we will see benefits from the work it does.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  I thank the contributors.  It very interesting to listen to the international perspective on this.  I was struck by a comment made earlier about how poor Ireland is in respect of employment of people with disabilities, and that is true.  We have an appalling record in that regard.  Education and employment are intrinsically linked.  Is there an example internationally of near full participation of people with disabilities in integrated education which then leads on to a better prospect of employment?  I would like to know whether there is an example of good education which has led on to good-quality employment.</p> <p>  As for the review of the UNCRPD, I note the EDF is essentially monitoring it and picks a different topic each year.  It was Covid last year.  Are there other NGOs that do similar monitoring?  I am thinking in particular of the Zero Project, which holds a conference in Vienna every year.  Is that part of the EDF's network, or how does that work?  I would be concerned if there were a plethora of organisations monitoring but not working together on this.</p> <p>  Does the EDF have any statistics on the number of policymakers across Europe who have a declared physical disability?  I am referring to people who participate in other European countries.  Our system is PR-STV, so our Parliament is very much elected by the people.  The Seanad is elected in part by county councillors and Members of the Oireachtas.  There are list systems in many countries.  Is there an area where the witnesses see best practice and where the list system is used to put people with physical disabilities into positions of influence?  If so, has that resulted in a better and a more equal politics?  Those are just some reflections on my thought process from what I have heard so far today.  I would like to hear our guests' views on those points.</p></speech>

While the witnesses are reflecting on Senator Conway's contribution, Deputy Cairns raised the question of truly ensuring participation of people with disabilities in the implementation of the UNCRPD.

They are great questions.  I thank Senator Conway.  I would be very interested in Mr. Schefer's viewpoint as to whether any country reviewed by the CRPD committee has seen its education system found to be completely aligned to the convention.  I think that is a work in progress in most countries.  I do not know that you will find a country that would say it has managed to fully include children with disabilities with adequate support in mainstream classrooms, making sure they have education on an equal basis with other children.  Certainly, in European countries and in most other countries, there is a lot of work still to be done to ensure that.</p> <p>  The Zero Project is a kind of annual conference which celebrates good practice.  It does not monitor the convention.  Rather, it shows snapshots of good practice in different fields.  It brings people together to discuss matters, highlights what is going well and stimulates international co-operation.  It does not have a formal role in monitoring the convention.</p> <p>  It is true, however, that co-ordination and collaboration are extremely important.  At the European level, when we had, for example, the last and the first review of the EU by the CRPD committee, as the EDF we worked together with all our members and with any other organisation that contributed to the review of the EU.  We had meetings and discussed priorities.  When the review took place in Geneva, we also met with all the people concerned.  We tried to work out what the top priorities that affect everyone were.  However, you still have, and I think the committee appreciates having, the viewpoints of different sectors and organisations.  The committee probably also appreciates it when the organisations can come together and define priorities so it is possible for the committee itself to see what the top issues at stake are.</p> <p>  In addition, at the international level there is the International Disability Alliance, which tries to support the disability movement to engage with the committee in Geneva.  When any country is being reviewed, the International Disability Alliance gives advice and support to the disability movement to contact the committee, to present its priorities and to act as a sort of support and clearing house in Geneva, working directly to make sure that in every country the disabled persons organisations, DPOs, can find out who the committee member reviewing in their country is and what the different committee members specialise in.  We in the disability movement try to act at the national, regional and international level to do that co-ordination without trying to curtail too much the involvement that could come.  For example, when the EU was reviewed, we found that organisations such as those working on corporal punishment of children and very many other issues that we had not really included in our work added a richness to the report given to the committee.</p><p> On the number of decision makers, I do not know.  It is a really good question.  We try to look at it every time for the European Parliament.  The number is always extremely small.  We always look at the representation between men and women, which is easier to assess, more or less.  As the Senator says, many people with disabilities do not declare as such, they do not put it forward and it is not counted very specifically.  In the European Parliament at the moment there are a small number of members with disabilities, fewer than ten, that we know of.  Some of them are active in the disability intergroup of the Parliament.  They immediately come and join the intergroup and work on disability issues.  Some of them are less involved in disability issues and are working more on other issues, so it is not always that parliamentarians with disabilities work on the disability agenda straight away.  I do not have a number across Europe but I think in the Parliament it is something like five or six.  Again, this is something I could come back to the committee on in more detail.  We could try to do some research on it if it is of interest to the Senator.</p></speech>

I suspect that if you were to look at the number directly elected, it is a minute - tiny - proportion, because of the ten in the European Parliament, my understanding is that a number of them get elected through the list system.  I think that for a long time, former MEP Mr. Brian Crowley was the only one directly elected by the people.  If there were more who were directly elected or got through the list system, it would certainly help the programme of work the forum is trying to achieve.</p></speech>

It is not even ten; it is fewer.  The reason I said ten is I know there will be people who do not come forward as saying they are a parliamentarian with a disability.</p></speech>

Of course, from the side of the committee, I cannot now go into naming the countries which do best and worst but an aspect that frequently contributes to low unemployment is the transfer from the education system into the labour market.  That proves to be very difficult.  There was no single exception we have looked at where that was not a main difficulty for persons with disabilities.  Therefore, as I said in the opening statement, implementing the CRPD is something which every single member state struggles with and education is one of the areas where the struggle is particularly intense.</p></speech>

In speaking to our colleagues in the Spanish Senate, I was very struck by what Senator Escudero Ortega mentioned about playgrounds and that idea of participation.  Can our guests comment on the importance of those aspects that are not necessarily the basic needs?  So often it can be such a struggle to access education, healthcare and appropriate housing that is not institutionalised that the measures required to give access to those other aspects of life such as cultural participation and participation in public life and political life can sometimes be left to the side.  Perhaps our guests can comment on that full picture within the UNCRPD in terms of full access, full expression of rights and full participation.  What I like about that as well is that it flips not just the notion of society having an obligation to certain of its members but more the picture or the vision of the society we want, namely, one where we are all benefiting from each other.  That is one piece I would like a little bit of comment on.</p> <p>  The other piece concerns the optional protocol and its importance, as that is a key focus for us today.  Something we encounter again and again in the committee is individuals with a disability or sometimes their families who, as well as all the other challenges they must face, must take on a huge body of work in advocacy.  They must spend many hours in advocacy work, not in creating new rights but in accessing those rights they already hold.  One of the reasons I believe the optional protocol is important, which I would like our guests' thoughts on, relates to people who are engaging in that advocacy which can be so difficult.  One of the hopes within the optional protocol is that when individuals engage in advocacy through its mechanisms, they do not simply win a resolution, outcome or improvement for their own situation but that maybe it establishes a body of case law so there is then a wider giving of that benefit rather than the same battle being fought in multiple places again and again.  I also hope we will be looking to case law in other countries in the context of the optional protocol, such as at what was decided around what is a meaningful vindication of a particular article in a certain country.  Will our guests comment on the importance of building up the interpretations that might flow from something like the optional protocol in shaping that wider implementation and delivery of the full vision of the UNCRPD?</p> <p>  I have another comment for our colleagues in the Spanish Senate.  I was interested in the national vision and the local municipality embracing of that.  What has been the experience of good things happening in a particular municipality getting extended?  I refer to the flow back upwards whereby if there is a municipality or local authority showing leadership, how do we give it mechanisms to spread that?  In this regard I am very conscious that the UNCRPD, like the SDGs, is universal in that it has a universal vision.  I am hoping we get a flow whereby we are taking the best practice from a town in Spain and we are applying it in a town in Ireland, for example.  I hope that will be the case for the SDGs as well as for the UNCRPD.</p> <p>  Perhaps there will be comments on those issue.  I thank our guests again.  It has been a really interesting discussion.</p></speech>

First of all, I congratulate all the members of the committee for all the work they have been conducting.  Disability is a fundamental issue.  It is important we give our best efforts to improving the quality of life of persons with disabilities.  Here in Spain we have made great progress in the past 62 years.  I say 62 years because I am a person with disabilities myself and for 62 years I have not had full vision, so I know what I am talking about.  These days, thanks to new legislation, children with vision problems are fully integrated within the education system.</p><p>Thanks to new legislation, children with vision problems are fully integrated within the education system.  I wish that had been my experience.</p><p> We are fully convinced by the Spanish Government that the new education law has two main objectives.  The first is integrating all people with disabilities and the second is raising awareness in the rest of students.  Both of these are of fundamental importance.  Those of us who have felt what it is to have a disability are fully aware of how hard it is to live in society.  It is hard when somebody has a disability and they must hide it when looking for employment, for example.</p><p> When I was 20, I joined Telef&oacute;nica, a very big corporation in Spain, after passing an exam.  It was the achievement of a great goal.  After three months of training, I went to a doctor for a physical exam, and the decision was made that due to my visual disability, I could not work with the company.  I have been in the army but I could not work with that company because of my sight.  It is important to learn to fight and all people with disabilities have a special and very important gift that lets us make a greater effort to become a better person.</p><p> I founded a company when I was 30.  I am the general secretary of a province, &Aacute;vila, and I am a Senator in Spain.  It is an honour for me to be here to testify at this committee discussing disabilities.  We are all working to try to improve the awareness in society.  It is very important we all work together.</p><p> We have done much in Spain with committed organisations and important associations.  Some of them are local and some are national.  We have the Organizaci&oacute;n Nacional de Ciegos Espa&ntilde;oles, ONCE, in Spain, for visually disabled people and those with other physical disabilities.  It is mainly focused on visual disability.  For many years these organisations have guided us, raised awareness and recognition and improved access to the labour market.  It is important for people with a disability to be able to work to get recognition.  At the beginning, I stated it was important to raise awareness for people when they are children and it is even more important when those people must access the labour market.  It is important that there should be no limitations.  As I need to be brief, I cannot go into detail.</p></speech>

We should have these kinds of meetings more often and it may at some stage be possible to meet in a physical room.  This pandemic is especially hard for people with a disability but it should not hinder us from meeting to discuss matters affecting people from different countries.  It is important to include this in the political agenda of countries in Europe.  It is important if we are to solve this.</p></speech>

That is at a cultural perspective.  If that could be replicated across the country, it would be a great advantage to including persons with disabilities from a very young age in society.</p> <p>  Senator Conway asked a question about education and the transition from education to work for people with disabilities.  I mentioned the comprehensive employment strategy, the implementation group and the work it is doing.  There is also quite a deal of work being done by various disability organisations like WALK and Down Syndrome Ireland in preparing people with disabilities for access to the workplace.  There are good examples of projects funded by the Government.  They demonstrate what can be done with the right attitude and mentality.</p></speech>

When the committee decides on cases under the optional protocol, it contributes not only to deciding individual cases but also the development of a body of law.  That is true for any court.  We have not been able to do this in the committee to a very large extent because we have only existed for a couple of years.<br/><br/>Even during this short period we have created a body of law on the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>in the area of disabilities rights.  Migration authorities may have decided an asylum seeker from another country may need to be removed from the country and repatriated to the country of origin.  What would be the legal requirements under the convention?  We have spelled this out in several cases and they come to us quite often.  Quite frequently we are required to take interim measures.  It is not each individual case that is being decided on its own and we are creating a body of law that pertains to the problem of removing persons with disabilities from a country and repatriating to a country of origin, where he or she might face death within a couple of months or persecution by family and society as a whole and so on.<br/><br/>The Senator mentioned a definition of disability under the convention.</p><p>Our case law under the optional protocol clarified that albinism is also an impairment that transforms or may transform into a disability depending on the society.  Participating in the individual reporting of the optional protocol allows a country to also give the input necessary through its cases to contribute to the body of law that we develop in the committee.</p><p> In addition, our cases are structured in a way that give recommendations in the individual case and the general recommendations on what laws to change.  That is certainly also important for other countries to look at, when one looks at the concluding observations.  For example, if one looks at the first case against Spain in which we decided on the right to education, that is a case that will also set the tone for other countries.  </p><p> It is an integral part of what the UNCRPD means.  The UNCRPD is law and under the European Convention on Human Rights we are all used to the fact that the European Court of Human Rights creates a body of law and the same applies under the UNCRPD. </p></speech>

On the impact on people with disabilities across the EU, how can countries within the EU work together to ensure alignment with the UNCRPD?  Have lessons been learned here?</p> <p>  People with disabilities in Ireland were impacted significantly in loss of services by both the financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.  Can the witnesses discuss how we can ensure the most vulnerable are protected? </p> <p>  A further question which has already been highlighted is how we ensure effective implementation of the UNCRPD at local government level to ensure a co-ordinated approach.  I know that Mr. Clarke spoke about Wicklow County Council where the roll-out has been quite slow.  We have 31 local authorities and it is very important at local and national level that we have a co-ordinated approach and we need a plan for that.  What are our witnesses' ideas on that?</p> <p>  Finally, what are our witnesses' views on a medical model of disability?  We have not spoken about the medical area.  I was wondering what we might do in that area because it will be a very important issue.  I thank the speakers again.</p></speech>

Which of our guests would like to deal with those questions?  I call Ms Naughton to speak now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/DMJ2021052700002#K00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions and I am very happy to answer on the European co-operation question.  This is very timely and a very good question because the European Union adopted its disability strategy in March which outlines activities at both EU and national levels to try to harmonise and co-ordinate in a better way, as the Deputy has mentioned.  A disability platform will be set up which should include representatives from EU and national level.  It is very important for Ireland to have a robust engagement on the disability platform as it is set up to see whether, from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view, it wants to set up working groups on specific topics that it may want to co-operate on with other European countries.  The more dynamics that come from the national level, the more this will energise that disability platform.  This is an opportunity for setting up a structure of co-operation.  The terms of reference have not been launched for this yet but an online platform should be possible for national and European engagement, peer exchange and sharing on various topics.</p> <p>  One part of EU laws and policies which is a weakness in European co-operation is that the convention calls on all state parties to have a focal point and co-ordination mechanism.  We discussed earlier that it would be very good in Ireland, for example, to have something like this in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office which has that horizontal mainstreaming.  This has not yet been very well established at EU level but the European Parliament has a disability interest group that is looking at creating a focal point and it already has a UNCRPD network which is somewhat advanced.  We all know that the members of the Council of the European Union are people who stay up all night to make decisions about large and important political and economic issues within the Union.  The Council has no focal point on the UNCRPD.  That means that there is no part of the Council where we have a contact point person who would look at horizontal mainstreaming and the rights of persons with disabilities.  These are the discussions and this is the place where important legislation is reshaped in a real way by member states.</p> <p>  Another thing that would greatly contribute to a harmonised approach in Europe would be to have a focal point in the Council of the European Union and the EU Council where the Ministers and heads of state sit and make decisions about resource allocation.  Many more parts could have been added to the European accessibility act, which is an EU directive that was adopted a couple of years ago and is a very strong piece of legislation concerning accessibility mainly in the digital field mainly for the European Single Market, but in the negotiations with the Council of the European Union many parts were removed.  These discussions do not take place with people with disabilities and their representative organisations.  The Council of the European Union has more of a closed-door discussion.  The European Ombudsman has also been working on the transparency of decision-making, and this is something that Ireland can contribute to.  If it believes that people with disabilities should be at the table in the national discussions, then it would also be important to be present at the European level.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Does anybody else wish to contribute?  I thank our guests very much for their engagement.  It is very important that we have cross-European engagement.  With Covid-19, physical meetings have been more difficult.  I thank our colleagues in the Spanish Parliament for joining us this morning.  I thank all those on the team who have discussed so freely with our committee and who are clearly on top of their brief.  It is clear that a great deal more work has to be done right across the country, Europe and the world to make the lives of people with disabilities more inclusive with better outcomes for everybody.  We thank everybody for their engagement.  We will certainly return to our guests.  If Covid-19 allows, we may take them up on their offer to meet physically.  I thank our committee members for their contributions, time, patience, and perseverance in the work we are trying to do on the committee.</p></speech>

He has experience and plenty of knowledge in this area.</p> <p>  The purpose of the meeting is to discuss and set the backdrop to the protected disclosure legislation review that will take place shortly.  The format will see Mr. Devitt and Mr. Clifford each giving an opening statement, after which we will have a questions and answers session.</p> <p>  I remind everyone about privilege.  If witnesses are in the Leinster House campus or at the convention centre, they have privilege.  If they are not, they may only have limited privilege.

I am joined by Ms Heffernan, acting legal counsel for Transparency International Ireland, TI Ireland, and managing solicitor of the Transparency Legal Advice Centre; Ms Casey, programme manager at TI Ireland responsible for our Integrity at Work programme; and Dr. Kierans, BL, lecturer in law at Maynooth University and an associate of TI Ireland.  Their biographies have been included in our written submission and we would be happy to answer whatever questions members may have.</p> <p>  I should explain who we are and what we do, particularly our work with whistleblowers and organisations.  TI Ireland was founded in 2004 and is a member of the Transparency International movement of anti-corruption organisations, which has its international secretariat in Berlin.  We engage in lobbying, research and advocacy aimed at addressing the risk of corruption.  In 2009, we began lobbying for what became the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  In 2011, TI Ireland launched the country's only freefone helpline for whistleblowers and witnesses of wrongdoing.  In 2016, we established an independent law centre, the Transparency Legal Advice Centre, which provides free legal advice to people making protected disclosures or disclosures of wrongdoing, and launched Integrity at Work, a programme aimed at helping organisations to create safe working environments for people to speak up.</p> <p>  Since we launched our Speak Up helpline, we have helped in or around 1,850 clients, of whom approximately one in three have been categorised as having made protected disclosures.  We observed a 120% increase in the volume of calls to the helpline after the 2014 Act was introduced.  Of these, more than 100 clients have been referred to the law centre for free legal advice.  Each client receives an average of more than 30 hours of free support, valued at approximately &euro;10,000 per client.  In addition, 30 organisations have joined the Integrity at Work initiative, including 12 agencies sponsored by the Department of Justice and three institutes of technology sponsored by the Department of Education.</p> <p>  The work we do informs our analysis and recommendations to employers and the Government and is published in our biennial Speak Up report.  We have also gathered data through our integrity at work survey, which highlights some cultural as well as systemic issues that the committee might find of particular interest.  Workers might gain some encouragement from the perhaps counter-intuitive finding that most people blowing the whistle at work say that they have not suffered as a result.  Of the 150 or so private sector employees who took part in our integrity at work survey in 2016 and said that they had spoken up about wrongdoing at work at some point during their careers, only 21% said that their disclosures had had a negative impact on them.  In contrast, 28% said that the outcome had been positive.  This finding is similar to those highlighted in employee surveys in other jurisdictions and suggests that most employers act responsibly.</p> <p>  However, it would be unwise to take this statement at face value alone.  If one concludes that one in five workers is penalised for speaking up and translates that figure to the Irish workforce, it suggests that more than 30,000 people have suffered some type of detriment for blowing the whistle at some point in their careers.  Indeed, it only takes one person to be made an example of for their co-workers to be silenced or one nurse to remain silent for patients' lives to be put at risk.  Conversely, we can see the role that just one public servant can have in exposing malpractice to understand the importance of whistleblowing in making our public services more open and accountable.</p> <p>  The benefits of whistleblowing are increasingly recognised, and according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in the United States, 48% of all cases of fraud are exposed through tip-offs from staff.  The evidence in favour of protecting them from reprisal by their colleagues or employers is incontrovertible and is why Ireland and other EU member states have begun enacting and implementing stronger legal safeguards for whistleblowers.</p> <p>  Despite the introduction of these safeguards, whistleblowers continue to bear the overwhelming burden and risk of speaking up.  According to our research, workers lose more than 90% of protected disclosure claims brought before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  Work by Professor Kate Kenny and others shows how whistleblowers in certain sectors such as banking can find it impossible to find work in their given professions again.  The impact of reprisal on family, physical well-being and the mental health of whistleblowers can be devastating.</p> <p>  It should also be noted that it is the fear of futility as much as the fear of reprisal that serves to deter people from speaking up.</p><p>It might not be surprising that one of the most common sources of complaints to our helpline relates to a failure to investigate wrongdoing.  When an employer or regulator fails to address a concern, it exposes the worker to reprisal by allowing his or her colleagues to infer that the worker is in some way unreliable or untrustworthy.  Indeed, the UK courts have found that a failure to investigate may be considered a form of whistleblower detriment.  When the employer&rsquo;s default position is to challenge a legal ruling in favour of a whistleblower, it risks prolonging unnecessary hardship for the whistleblower and his or her family, courting public controversy and undermining public confidence in that institution.</p><p> The difficulties employers face in dealing with protected disclosures should also be taken seriously.  They often struggle to meet the expectations of workers who might reasonably ask that they be kept informed of the progress of investigations.  They might not be aware that a whistleblower is being penalised.  Balancing the rights of whistleblowers and respondents can be difficult, and those accused of wrongdoing and their representatives will often mount stiff challenges to assessments or investigations.  Employers might not have the resources to investigate or the necessary skills or knowledge to do so, while State bodies often find themselves investigating concerns only to find that an investigation is already under way by a different agency.</p><p> More guidance and support for employers in dealing with protected disclosures will help, as will forthcoming changes to the law, but training, education and public awareness are essential. Our research suggests that only 30% of Irish private sector employers have procedures in place.  It is essential that organisations of all sizes and sectors adopt policies and procedures in preparation for the transposition of the EU whistleblowing directive later this year.</p><p> Members will see that we have made recommendations to the Government on overcoming many of these challenges and we are happy to discuss the solutions we offer or propose.</p></speech>

I am happy to answer questions about any of the issues raised.  My familiarity with the Protected Disclosures Act comes through my work, in which I have encountered dozens of people who have made disclosures.  For the greatest part, these people have been from elements of the public rather than private sector, although not exclusively.  I have been in the position where disclosures have been made to me as a journalist, which is provided for in the Act, but mainly it has involved people coming to me after making a disclosure.  In that respect, I highlight the report of the disclosures tribunal, in which Mr. Justice Peter Charleton suggested the Oireachtas might revisit the Act to see whether it required further legislation to ensure that disclosures would not be leaked to reporters or politicians.  His recommendation came on foot of events that surrounded the leaking of disclosures at one point in the Maurice McCabe case, which was the focus of that tribunal.<br/><br/>My experience, including from that case, suggests that any such move would be retrograde.  For instance, I dealt with one case in which an anonymous disclosure was made against management in a State agency. The allegations in the disclosure were serious, involving the misuse of public money and alleged sexual harassment in the workplace.  It would have taken two phone calls to confirm the bones of the allegations within the disclosure, opening the requirement to proceed with a full investigation.  Instead, nothing was done for three months.  The<i>Irish Examiner</i>published details of the disclosure at that point and an investigator was appointed within days.  Ultimately, the allegations were found to have been entirely accurate.  It is reasonable to wonder whether anything of substance would have been done if the issue had not found its way into the public domain.<br/><br/>That case points me towards the second issue I will highlight, namely, the period it takes to complete investigations on foot of disclosures.  The case I outlined lasted almost a year.  I am aware of two cases that are still live more than three years after the disclosures were made.  Frankly, I find it difficult to accept that matters could not be progressed with greater urgency, especially given that many cases have been farmed out to external agencies for investigation.<br/><br/>As an example of how long it takes to process some disclosures, another story I worked on involved allegations of malpractice in the Prison Service that emerged in an affidavit.  This is all on record and has been published and officially acknowledged, so I am not revealing anything under privilege that is not in the public domain.  The then Minister for Justice and Equality ordered an inquiry from the Inspector of Prisons into the matter.  There were some complicated aspects to the investigation, yet the inspector delivered her report within four months.  I find it difficult to believe that many of the investigations into disclosures could not be conducted with that level of urgency.<br/><br/>Finally, I turn to the issue of penalisation.  I have on numerous occasions encountered disclosers who were adamant they had been penalised as a result of their actions.  Sometimes it is possible to confirm this and I have done so, whereas in others it is not as easy or accessible.  I am acutely aware a discloser may well perceive penalisation when it is not happening, but experience has shown me that in many cases, penalisation does occur.  Again, being a member of the media, this may well sound as if it is coming from a place of self-interest but it is the truth as I perceive it - I have experienced occasions when the publication of details of penalisation has resulted in it easing, if not stopping.  I think there has been only one major case in which a discloser has had his allegations of penalisation confirmed by the Workplace Relations Commission and compensation awarded.  That is an onerous route to take, however, so one element of the Act that might require further examination is that which deals with protections for the discloser and issues relating to penalisation.</p></speech>

In particular, I welcome Mr. Devitt and acknowledge the great work Transparency International Ireland does.  This is a really interesting topic for us to discuss and I welcome the opportunity to ask questions.  When we deal with the transposition of the EU whistleblower directive later in the year, I am sure TI Ireland will make valuable contributions to the debate.  I have read its recent report, Speak Up 2020, in which it highlighted some significant causes for concern, such as the 120% increase in the number of whistleblowers seeking advice from the Speak Up helpline.  The organisation&rsquo;s legal advice service is encouraging in the sense that people are increasingly speaking out but, on the other hand, it is disconcerting because if they have to call TI Ireland, they must believe the internal mechanisms in their organisations are perhaps not offering an appropriate avenue for redress.  As we saw with Maurice McCabe, it took many years, great sacrifice and personal suffering before the truth was acknowledged.  Following on from that case, are the avenues for people to blow the whistle adequate?  Where do the greatest improvements need to be made?</p></speech>

The other issue, although this probably cannot be dealt with through legislation, relates to delays in respect of investigations.  I try to look at the issue neutrally but, to me, this appears in some instances to be connected to a wish not to get to the bottom of things.</p></speech>

When a client comes to us it is often the situation that he or she is aware of a wrongdoing but is afraid to disclose and wants to know the protections.  Support for people making disclosures is very important because people want to know how to approach this technical and legal arena.</p> <p>  In terms of reprisals, one thing to be mindful of is that unscrupulous employers will invent things so they can accuse an employee in order to distract from a wrongdoing.  Therefore, it is important that we train people so that they know when they receive a disclosure what they are dealing with, how to identify what a protected disclosure is and certainly how to penetrate any inventions that employers might make.</p></speech>

Where are the biggest gaps in public bodies, local authorities and private businesses, etc?  I ask the witnesses to explain the recommendation that the employment law system should include all workers who have been penalised for making protected disclosures.</p> <p>  The Speak Up report noted that there is a general lack of trust in public institutions in this State, as evidenced in a recent survey on corruption in the EU that was conducted by Eurobarometer.  Corruption in this State is viewed by the public to be a significant problem and I was startled that 68% of respondents said that corruption is widespread.  Transparency International's division here and its global organisation more generally have dealt with corruption risk in public procurement.  I have a particular interest in public procurement.  It is an area where significant corruption risks can arise.  How do the witnesses view the risks posed to this State's public procurement regime?  What risk reduction measures would they like to see introduced?</p> <p>  We have heard that retaliation against healthcare whistleblowers is a common phenomenon and is believed to pose serious risks to patients and safety.  Almost 40% of healthcare whistleblowers who contacted the Speak Up helpline between 2017 and 2019 reported that they were penalised after raising concerns about wrongdoing.  Recently serious issues were highlighted in the media about the Department of Health collecting information on children with autism, which seems to have taken place completely without the knowledge of the Minister.  We know that Ministers are ultimately responsible for their Departments but in reality there are things that they are not aware of.  Do the witnesses think something needs to be done to improve accountability, within the Civil Service or elsewhere, when there is an awareness that these things are going on?  If so, what recommendations would the witnesses make in regard to this matter?</p></speech>

It is a programme of support that is provided to employers around the whole area of whistleblowing and protected disclosures.</p> <p>  On the question around channels for reporting, the facilitation of reporting and is there enough out there, it is quite interesting to understand how people want to report.  We carried out the first national survey on attitudes towards whistleblowers and whistleblowing in 2016 before we launched this programme.  We found that the majority of workers want to report to their line manager in the first instance, which is a view that is reflected in international research.</p> <p>  When we consider internal whistleblowing systems, or the external systems Mr. Clifford talked about which can involve reporting to journalists or Deputies, it is very important to recognise that the work must start within the organisation to build a culture where staff feel safe enough to come forward and raise a concern in the first instance, and where that report can be dealt with rapidly because that is where people want to go.  They want to go to their line managers and report internally, which we have seen in some of the cases that have been referenced, such as the case in the Department of Health and other cases in the public domain.</p> <p>  Deputy Farrell is right that the increase in the volume of calls to the Speak Up helpline reflects a growing awareness or, indeed, a growing need among workers to speak up.  It also reflects the work that we have done through the programme and through our work in Transparency International Ireland to promote the helpline as an additional resource that is there for workers.  They can call the helpline before they report.  We do not want people to approach us as their last course of action.  We want to be their first course of action and our promotion of that also explains some of the increase in calls.</p></speech>

To reiterate what Ms Casey has said, the helpline is a first port of call for people.</p> <p>  In terms of the earlier question, the helpline complements the support that employers might give their staff.  As Ms Casey might have said, we work with about 30 employers that are mainly in the public service.  They are asked to advertise the availability of these free supports through the helpline.  Our goal is to make sure that people make an informed decision before they speak up, which is considered good practice in the corporate sector.  A number of multinational companies provide the facility to allow people to think an ethical dilemma through and seek advice on whether what they have witnessed is a protected disclosure or a grievance.</p> <p>  The goal is to make sure that people make an informed decision before they go to a lawyer.  One of our goals is to make sure that people do not litigate.  If workers and employers are at loggerheads and are before the Workplace Relations Commission or the civil courts, we see that as a failure.  These protections and the legislation should not be seen as the last resort.  We want to encourage employers to make sure they have the necessary support in place so that people can seek advice and think these dilemmas through before things escalate.  We also want employers to be well positioned to act on concerns promptly and thoroughly.</p></speech>

My encounters with whistleblowers, so to speak, have largely occurred when they have perceived that internal efforts have failed.  In one instance, for example, a person made a protected disclosure to me as a journalist on the basis that a colleague of the person had made a protected disclosure internally and not only did it not go anywhere, but the person was perceived to have been penalised.  People going outside tends to be largely a last resort, unfortunately.</p></speech>

The Speak Up report notes a general lack of trust in public institutions in the State.  I was quite surprised that 68% of people think corruption is a widespread problem.  I know that Transparency International, both within the State and as a global organisation, has dealt with corruption risk in public procurement.  Public procurement is an area of particular interest to me.  What are the views of the witnesses on the risks posed to the State public procurement regime?  What risk reduction measures would they like to see introduced?</p></speech>

I discovered that in 85.6% of the cases the worker had gone internally with the disclosure in the first instance.  There was only one case in which the worker had gone externally in the first instance to make the disclosure.  However, in 22% of the cases where the worker had gone internally, the worker subsequently went externally because he or she was dissatisfied with the response or there was no response whatsoever.  The legislation allows for that.  It allows for alternative disclosure recipients.  Under the EU directive in particular, we will see the extension of an obligation.  All public bodies are currently obliged to have whistleblowing procedures in place to deal with disclosures from their employees but this will be extended to the private sector for organisations that have more than 50 employees.  Further, there will be no threshold if the organisation is in the area of financial services, preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, national transport or the environment.  Essentially, this means workers mostly go internally but if the disclosure is not handled correctly, they go externally.  It is to be hoped that the new obligations under the EU directive will enhance the responses internally to workers' disclosures, meaning they will not have to go outside the organisation with the disclosure.</p></speech>

According to the EU, between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;2 billion is lost to the EU economy through corruption in public contracting.  Ireland was considered to be relatively low risk compared with some other member states, particularly newer members of the bloc.  It is a risk nonetheless and we have highlighted it in previous reports.  I will not go into too much detail on our recommendations around public contracting, which go back to 2012.  Needless to say, enhanced transparency, including the publication of all contracts awarded above a certain value, would be helpful, as would anti-corruption training for public contracting and those in sensitive roles in public procurement, as well as enhanced disclosure of their financial interests.  According to the report commissioned by the EU in 2017, the benefits of implementing whistleblower procedures in Ireland outweigh the financial cost by a factor of between 1.4:1 and 2.3:1.  It is believed that for every euro invested by the State in promoting whistleblower procedures, the State saves between one and a half and two times that amount in potential procurement fraud.  In the context of the role of whistleblowing in preventing losses through fraud, waste and corruption, the investments made in protecting whistleblowers far outweigh the costs of implementing those procedures.</p></speech>

When the Protected Disclosures Act was enacted in 2014, it was probably among the most significant legislation to have been enacted by the Oireachtas in the past 20 years or so but it is very complicated.  Under section 17, protected disclosures can, in certain circumstances, be made to Members of the Oireachtas if they relate to certain law enforcement issues.  Several years ago, my former colleague, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, and I received a protected disclosure.  Obviously I cannot go into too much detail on the disclosure.  It is a legal minefield but in the circumstances of that disclosure it worked out very well and quite promptly.  Mr. Clifford referred to the need to speed up the process.  Has it become a very legalised process and is that part of the reason it has become so slow?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.543" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mick Clifford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#D01000"><p>That is quite possible.  I am not really sure what the reason is.  I find it difficult to understand, particularly because several State agencies, as a result of previous experience, now farm out investigations to outside agencies.  Obviously, those agencies are paid by the hour.  The case to which I referred went on for the best part of a year.  I find it amazing that it took so long.  Notwithstanding that, one of the issues that has arisen in several of these investigations is slow co-operation from people asked to provide evidence.  That has definitely been an issue and it is ongoing.  I do not know whether it is because they have become overly legalistic.  It may be the case that some of these agencies are involved in several different jobs and, therefore, only dedicate a certain amount of time to each investigation on a weekly or monthly basis.  I find it very difficult to understand how it continues to take so long.</p> <p>  The other issue in that regard is that once an investigation is completed, there is often a protracted period before the whistleblower is informed that there has been an outcome - he or she is not given the full result - and told what exactly is being done in pursuit of it.  That is also an issue that is protracted.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, time limits have been put into other legislation, for example, particularly in relation to the assessment of children with needs.  Very often the limits are just not observed, leaving the person with the prospect of going to court to have it rectified.  There certainly would be no harm in it.  Mr. Devitt and his colleagues would probably be more well versed in the details of it.  There would be no harm in something like that.</p></speech>

Do any of the representatives from Transparency International Ireland wish to comment on the issue of the new protected disclosures office that has been proposed in the general scheme of the amending Bill?  Do they think it is a positive development and how do they think it will operate when it is enacted?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about investigations.  Under the directive, Ireland will be expected to implement provisions in the Protected Disclosures Act, requiring employers over a certain size or within a defined sector to provide feedback to their employees.  They will have to acknowledge protected disclosures within seven days and outline what action has been taken within a period of three to six months.  It very much depends on the nature of the concern raised.  If an allegation of a criminal nature is raised, the stakes are that much higher.  Obviously, people have the right to fair procedure and rights under the Constitution to a good name, and so on.  Therefore, those rights will also have to be considered when undertaking an assessment and investigation.  However, clear guidance will be essential to employers and public bodies on how to assess and investigate these concerns in a way that means that whistleblowers are not left waiting years for a response or an outcome on foot of their concern.</p> <p>  The second question the Deputy asked was around-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#E00400"><p>It was around the protected disclosures office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Devitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#E00500"><p>We have suggested that something similar to an office of special counsel, as the US Federal Government has in place, protecting whistleblowers or reporting on the manner in which investigations have been carried out by federal agencies, be implemented here.  We understand that the protected disclosures office here will help Departments and other prescribed persons like regulatory agencies to investigate and assess concerns that they might not be able to.   We also suggest that this protected disclosures office also reports on the operation of the Act as it relates to the conduct of Departments and prescribed bodies so as to help improve or enhance internal procedures aimed at ensuring that both whistleblowers are protected and that the concerns they raise are acted on promptly.  It is not clear from the heads of Bill, from what we can see, what the precise powers of that office will be.  It should be more than just a postbox through which people can raise concerns.</p> <p>  Again, I come back to the point about resourcing and capacity.  It is essential that State agencies, whether they are prescribed persons or Departments, are also equipped with the training awareness and resources they need to be able to effectively assess those concerns and then refer them on to whatever agency they believe has the particular capacity or is the appropriate one to deal with those concerns.</p></speech>

Obviously, in the public mind, protected disclosure and whistleblowers are represented by people such as Sergeant McCabe or the great investigative work that Mr. Clifford does.  However the vast majority of reliance upon this Act takes place within the sphere of employment law and it never really gets into the public domain.  It consists of disputes between employers and employees.  Many of the cases end up going to the WRC.  Others are resolved before then.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses think that it is an issue that under the 2014 Act, an employee can receive up to five years' salary by way of compensation if they are penalised, but if they just leave under unfair dismissal in the orthodox way, they can only get up to two years' salary by way of compensation?  I am not asking the witnesses to give a definitive view on it but do they think that it is an issue that there is a difference between what an employee could receive by claiming protected disclosure if there is penalisation on the one hand, as opposed to just orthodox unfair dismissal, on the other?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.551" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lauren Kierans" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#E00700"><p>To clarify, if a person alleges that he or she has been dismissed wholly or mainly for having made a protected disclosure, they can be awarded up to five years' gross remuneration.  The cap on two years' remuneration for ordinary unfair dismissal does not apply.  However, it is arguable that this is, unfortunately, a limitation.  If we look to the UK, to claims under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, on which the Irish law was originally modelled, there is no cap on the amount of compensation that can be awarded.  The EU whistleblowers directive requires full compensation to be made.  The Workplace Relations Act 2015 requires that awards that are just and equitable are also afforded.  Therefore, a cap in compensation would not necessarily be considered to be just and equitable, or arguably full compensation.  I would purport for the removal of a cap on any compensation.  Further, the heads of Bill propose for the extension of protection against penalisation to other forms of individuals such as volunteers, trainees and those who were penalised in the course of making a protected disclosure when it comes to their attention in the recruitment process.  It is proposed that there will be a cap on compensation for them of &euro;13,000 for claims relating to penalisation.  I would argue that this is not full compensation.  It is not clear, from my perspective, where the figure of &euro;13,000 is arising.  I may need to look into it further.</p></speech>

It is important to bear in mind that the level of award under the Unfair Dismissals Act is confined to pure financial loss.  Therefore, if a worker is dismissed for having made a protected disclosure and they get another job fairly quickly, the level of compensation is going to be very limited.  That also causes the disparity between someone who has been penalised while he or she is actually working and who potentially has access to a greater level of compensation than somebody who has actually been dismissed and has lost his or her job.  I think there is an issue there.</p> <p>  I would also like to comment on the timeframes for investigations.  The balance of power is not with the discloser; it is with the employer.  The employer is in full control all the time.  I have come across an investigation being dragged out.  Often these workers are actually very loyal employees.  They trust their employer to do the right thing.  It is very disconcerting when they discover that something is going on  the employer does not react in the way they think they ought to, an investigation then eventually starts but it gets dragged out.  What happens then is that the employee loses their rights at the WRC if they trust in the process.  It could be that they have been penalised and perhaps a period of over six months has passed.  It is quite difficult to get an extension of time from the WRC if one does not bring one's claim within six months.  That is another factor to bear in mind in trying to rein in those long investigations.  Certainly, in my experience, client investigations regularly go on for over one year.</p></speech>

In a study of 92 whistleblowers across different countries, they found that 63% were dismissed, 62% were demoted and 28% ended up resigning as a result of speaking up.  They found that the average cost of making a protected disclosure is in the order of about &euro;28,000 per year to a whistleblower and the average income that is lost to a whistleblower, because of loss of income or a loss of job, is about &euro;65,000 per annum.  Therefore, there is a very significant cost involved for whistleblowers, which speaks to the point Dr. Kierans was making around the necessity to look at removing the cap on compensation.</p></speech>

It is very interesting.  I want to begin by picking up on the issue of compensatory measures.  I worry that the signal that very often gets sent in Ireland is that whistleblowers get punished and that they basically carry the price of taking action and of performing that public good by highlighting an issue.  Therefore, I welcome the suggestions in respect of the changes to the compensation cap.</p> <p>  I have also encountered specific concerns and the witnesses might have a sense of whether these are more widespread.  In particular, where there are compensatory measures to which persons are entitled and which they may be seeking after a process or after a whistleblowing, it may sometimes be the same persons about whom they made the disclosure who are effectively still in place within an organisation and who are part of the process for accessing the compensatory measures.  Again, I do not want to speak to specific cases but that is a situation which has certainly come to my attention where persons have raised concerns about a body where they worked, or individuals in a body where they worked, and, effectively, they have seen the obstruction of ever receiving compensatory payments or measures.</p> <p>  I agree that it is appropriate that it is higher.  It is different from unfair dismissal in that this often involves people at very senior level.  When I looked at the breakdown of the age profile of those who are making protected disclosures within the Transparency International annual report, it was interesting how many people were older.  I would like the witnesses to comment on whether security of contract is in itself one of the reasons that people who are 45 and older feel confident in terms of making protected disclosures because it does seem that the age skews quite a bit towards the older.  Is there a concern around insecurity of contracts, particularly within very important organisations, State bodies and so forth, in terms of creating a culture where people are less likely to feel confident to raise concerns and blow the whistle?</p> <p>  I was also very interested in the comments in regard to the running of the clock and where an investigation takes a long time.  It was mentioned that the Workplace Relations Commission option might expire for an employee but I also know there are situations where people have raised a concern and are blowing the whistle on something, and they then feel that they are under scrutiny.  During a dragged-on investigation, there can be a period when the spotlight is on the whistleblower and they know excuses are being looked at in regard to undermining their future employment.  That is one of the consequences of that dragged-on process.  We want this legislation to create a situation in which people feel confident, safe and fully supported by the law and by best practice in coming forward.</p> <p>  On another issue, what is the experience of the witnesses on the practice of containment versus the expansion of inquiry, when an issue is identified by a whistleblower?  What we would hope is that, where an issue is identified, it is used as a flag to spark wider investigation but it seems that is sometimes not the case.  We are even seeing it, potentially, in regard to the files in the Department of Health recently, where they are talking about those specific files where concern was raised rather than maybe a pattern where vulnerable persons, such as those families with autism, may have been the subject of files within a Department.  The witnesses might comment in terms of what best practice would look like where a flag is raised around bad practice and that becomes an examination of a pattern.  Maybe that is something this new entity could facilitate or could drive, rather than it kicking into a process of containment around that specific aspect of the issue the whistleblower has flagged.</p> <p>  The witnesses might comment on those issues, namely, the question around the compensatory measures, the issues around how we create greater security in the workplace for those who are whistleblowing and the issue of how we go to a pattern examination rather than a containment response</p> <p>.  A further issue is one that follows up on the procurement piece.  I have put a lot of focus on trying to bring more qualitative measures into public procurement.  There is sometimes this idea that, in the State, our decision-making should be complex and we should be thinking about lots of things, such as environmental factors, social impact and all of these things in regard to procurement.  However, one of the arguments I get is that they want processes to be simpler to avoid corruption, when it seems to me that, instead, we need processes to tackle corruption in order that we can have good quality processes.  It is almost as if they like to strip it down to two variables as a way of mitigating against corruption when, in fact, eight variables would be good practice.  It is a question of how we keep both of those parts of good practice at work.</p></speech>

I am happy to take one or two of the questions and I will leave it to my colleagues, who are better placed than I, to talk about compensatory measures.  When it comes to good practice, there are a number of resources and a great deal of research has been undertaken on this already, which we can send to the committee.  One of the recommendations made in a report published a number of years ago by the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants, ACCA, in the UK was that employers use the information shared with them to address risk and to learn from their employees how they can improve their internal systems of controls, irrespective of whether wrongdoing is found.  Too often, employers will consider the complaint, or the disclosure, purely on the basis of whether it meets the standard of a protected disclosure.  Employers need to be equipped with the skills and resources they need to use this information as intelligence that can help to enhance internal systems of controls.  It is something we have been trying to do through our Integrity at Work programme and we provide feedback to organisations which are members of the programme.</p> <p>  There is also a role for the protected disclosures office.  I answered a question from Deputy Jim O'Callaghan about the role of the protected disclosures office in providing feedback to Departments, regulators and prescribed persons on how they can improve their internal controls, irrespective of whether any wrongdoing is found or whether someone meets the tests set out in the prospective disclosures legislation.  There is an awful lot of information that is filed away, without being looked at again, that could be used to help improve those procedures.</p><p> On the question about protections, in our submission to the Department on the transposition of the directive we called for the extension of protections imposed under the directive to all categories of worker and for equal treatment of those on contracts of service as well as those on contracts for service to be able to avail of civil remedies.</p></speech>

In that regard, a very strong argument has been put forward that local elected representatives should be within the new expanded category of worker in terms of who might be protected under the Act.  Will Mr. Devitt comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.563" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Devitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#G00300"><p>I was going to add that.  I agree that protections should be extended to local authority members, and to Members of the Oireachtas, perhaps, and members of the Judiciary, so they would be able to avail of the civil protections, be protected against civil liability for making a protected disclosure and be entitled to safeguards regarding their identity and confidentiality if they are making a protected disclosure.  Case law is emerging in the UK which has defined members of the judiciary as workers as well.  While not all workers will be treated the same or be entitled, for example, to bring a case before the Workplace Relations Commission, no more than a member of the Defence Forces would be able to avail of the same rights as somebody working in the Department of Defence, we could extend existing civil remedies and protections to other categories of worker and make it safer for those to speak up too.</p></speech>

Do our other guests wish to respond?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Heffernan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#G00500"><p>On the question about greater security for whistleblowers, the answer lies in providing training for the disclosure recipients and a greater awareness of the rights of both the discloser and the persons of concern.  When somebody makes a disclosure of wrongdoing in the workplace, it can be hard to hear that from an employer's perspective, and everyone feels under threat.  If you treat the situation whereby everyone knows he or she is taken care of and that both the whistleblower and those who are implicated are going to be protected, that would enhance how things play out in the workplace and, it is hoped, would create a more secure environment for everybody.</p> <p>  With regard to a wider application, if you had a disclosure made to you and you wanted to carry out an audit of your systems, that will depend on the diligence of an employer.  I have experience of that, where a discloser fed into a bigger process for strengthening financial controls inside the system.  That happens and that is where you see the system working properly - somebody discloses something, it is taken on board and addressed.</p> <p>  With regard to procurement, that arose twice in the Senator's questions.  One aspect of the Protected Disclosures Act that the whistleblower directive seeks to address is the area of penalties.  The heads of the Bill are silent as to what penalties are envisaged under this new amendment, but if there are issues with procurement, it might be necessary to look at the penalties.  It might be an area where sanctions are necessary to encourage it to work properly.</p></speech>

They are in a scenario whereby even their fellow workers are suspicious of them and they are not really sympathetic until such time, perhaps, as it has been shown that the disclosure the person made had a basis and was being done for the greater good of people in the workplace.  That suspension leads to great stress for individuals who are left like that.</p> <p>  The other issue is whether investigations are approached as a matter of containment as opposed to looking at wider systems.  By and large, I have found that if the management perceives the investigation as in any way - even remotely - reflecting badly on it, in that scenario all it is interested in is the containment option - get it done, ensure you go through the process and then, effectively, just sweep it aside.  That is the experience I have had in dealing with people in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lauren Kierans" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#G00700"><p>In respect of the point the Senator made about time and the clock running as regards when the investigation is taking place, there is a risk that during that time the person is being subject to retaliation but is not, perhaps, aware of it because the person is sitting on the sidelines and waiting for everything to come to a conclusion.  The problem with the person bringing claims is the time that runs from the date of the penalisation.  I will explain that, and this ties into Mr. Devitt's point about to whom the protections are afforded.  Employees can enforce their rights before the Workplace Relations Commission, while all other workers, including employees, have to go to the civil courts.  Employees have to elect to go to the WRC while workers, other than employees, can only go to the civil courts.</p> <p>  If an employee is bringing a claim before the Workplace Relations Commission, he or she only has six months to bring that claim.  The problem with regard to penalisation is that the time runs from the date of the first penalisation.  Many claims have been deemed out of time.  Some 30% of cases that have been unsuccessful are unsuccessful due to procedural grounds such as being out of time.  In contrast, under the legislation in the UK, time runs from the date of the last penalisation, when the penalisation ends.  There have been cases before WRC which were cases of suspension, allegedly because the person made a protected disclosure.  They were filed before the WRC outside of the six-month time period, although the person was still on suspension.  However, it was found that the person was out of time in filing the claim.  That six months can be extended to 12 months in exceptional circumstances, but it is very rare that it would be extended.  That is one issue in respect of the timeframe.</p> <p>  Second, we talk about the whistleblower protection as being the pan-sectoral whistleblower protection that gives protection to all workers, in contrast to the preceding sectoral approach to whistleblowing law.  The differentiation of individuals as being employees or workers and where they can bring their claims is not a level playing field.  Workers who bring claims before the civil courts are limited to bringing claims of detriment.  Detriment is defined differently from penalisation under the Act.  The definition of penalisation under the Act is a non-exhaustive list and contains a range of acts of omission that cause detriment to an employee.  Furthermore, that is extended under the EU whistleblowers directive, but under the heads of the Bill it is only that definition of penalisation that applies to employees that has been extended.  The claims before the civil courts are for this more limited form of detriment.  Of course, if you go to the civil courts, there are some disadvantages in respect of a costs order being made against you if you are unsuccessful and the time it takes for a case to be heard before the civil courts.  Arguably, we need to treat them all in such a way that they all can go to the WRC, as Mr. Devitt mentioned.</p></speech>

Would the witnesses have comments, within their answers to other representatives later, on the importance of us putting in place a senior executive accountability regime?</p><p> Also, could there be some clarity around the prescribed person?  Sometimes there is ambiguity, whereby somebody is given something because he or she is the prescribed person, and then, when that person changes role, he or she says it was given to the role rather than to the person.  When something is given to a prescribed person because of his or her role, is the disclosure regarded as having been given to the role or to the person?  My understanding is that it would be the person when he or she was in that role.  However, I have had ambiguous opinions given to me about that.  I know others need to come in, so perhaps there may be a chance for the witnesses to come back on that later.</p></speech>

It has been a very informative session.  I pay tribute to their enormous work over the years in this area.  Some things they have said in both submissions are stark with regard to the delays in investigation, accountability as to who undertakes an investigation, and the issue of penalisation.</p> <p>  My first question relates to who should conduct an investigation.  I note Mr. Clifford said in his submission that many cases are farmed out to external agencies for investigation.  I would like to hear the perspectives of TI and Mr. Clifford on who should undertake an investigation.  Should it be solely an external agency or does it need to be a public body?  Do we need to standardise that process?  I am aware of a protected disclosure at the moment about which there is an argument between two Departments as to who should be investigating.  I would like to hear the perspectives of the witnesses on best practice in terms of who investigates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mick Clifford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#H00500"><p>From my observation, a number of State agencies have adopted the position that best practice when it comes to protected disclosure is to farm them out to consultants from investigative bodies to do it.  From what I can see, though, that has done nothing to shorten the time of investigations.  In terms of perception, an issue that could arise when the senior management of a State agency retains a particular agency to an investigation is the relationship between the two.  You can have an unspoken understanding.  For example, there could be a situation whereby an investigative body will be aware that if it goes down a particular route, its services might not be retained the next time someone is employed to do such an investigation.  It is difficult to get somebody who is completely removed or hands off from the management of a particular arm against whom a protected disclosure is made or within whose body a protected disclosure was made.  That is very difficult.  Obviously, the ideal thing would be to be as hands off or as removed as possible from the senior management of an agency or arm of State.  Most of my experience is with public bodies.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.573" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Devitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#H00700"><p>I will come in and then allow my colleagues to come in if they have any additional points.  It depends on the nature of the wrongdoing disclosed.  An employer, whether a Department or otherwise, might be best placed to investigate directly, for instance, in a health and safety concern.  There may be circumstances where it does need to retain the service of an assessor to do a preliminary investigation if is a protected disclosure, who would then suggest it be referred on or that a full investigation takes place. It very much depends on the nature of the wrongdoing alleged and on the competence of that body to investigate the concern.  This is because not all Departments or State agencies would be able to undertake or, for example, have people trained in investigative techniques to undertake a fair, thorough and swift investigation.  More often than not, it is a botched investigation that will lead to more delays.  It is better to get it right in the first place.</p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as members will probably be aware, has a framework in place whereby it publicly advertises for investigative and assessment services.  That framework can be used by Departments or other agencies to refer on requests for an assessment and investigation.  I do not have any data or analysis available to suggest whether that is working as it should.  However, examples other jurisdictions should strike a cautionary note here.  In the Netherlands, for example, a centralised house of whistleblowers or a whistleblowing authority was established number of years ago.  It led to even more delays because all concerns had to be raised through, and investigated by, the same agency.  It did not always have the capacity to investigate concerns related to everything from civil aviation to fraud or whatever the concern might have been.  It is important to note that point about the nature of the concern.</p> <p>  There were questions about enhancing protections for whistleblowers.  The best protection is the one that does not have to be called on.  We have talked about public contracting.  Prevention is better than cure.  Workers would be better served, or just as well served, by enhanced transparency within, for example, our public contracting system as they would by enhanced whistleblower protections.  Nobody should have to bear the burden of making our public contracting service or system more transparent.  More information needs to be disclosed more proactively by State agencies at a pre-tender stage and at all stages of the public contracting cycle.  More information needs to be disclosed on the awardees of public contracts so that it is not left up to a single public servant to have to leak information to a journalist about alleged malpractice in the public contracting system.</p> <p>  Likewise, our freedom of information, FOI, regime, while stronger than it was up until 2014, could also be reconsidered in light of our discussions around whistleblower protection so that more information is proactively released.  This would also be so that journalists or those working in civil society would not have to pay disproportionate fees for appeals or search and retrieval fees for information that should already be in the public domain.</p></speech>

I would like to pick up on what they said with regard to experiences in other countries.  We have the transposition of the EU directive later this year.  Particularly on the detail of the Bill we will have to enact in this country, are there practices in other countries we can adopt here?  Mr. Devitt spoke about the experience in the Netherlands and perhaps centralisation of an investigation is not the road to go down, but are there other aspects of systems in other countries, especially in regard to penalisation and best practice, from which we can learn and adopt?</p></speech>

In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority can impose administrative fines on senior executives in banks who have been found to penalise workers for raising concerns.  One example involved a fine of more than &pound;600,000 against a senior executive who had sought to find out who had made a protected disclosure against them.  Administrative sanctions would assist.  I have forgotten the question.</p></speech>

I have a question regarding the heads of the Bill we have now, particularly the reversal of the burden of proof in the context of the WRC.  I am conscious Mr. Devitt has said it should not have to go to the WRC but, for the cases that do, it seems a positive development that the reversal of the burden of proof puts the onus on the employer rather than the worker to prove the case.  Are there other areas in that Bill where we need to go further?  I heard about the lifting of the salary or compensation caps and the timeframes.  Are there other parts of the Bill we have an opportunity to change that would strengthen the system for whistleblowers in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.577" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Devitt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2021052700002#J00300"><p>Members ought to be cognisant of Article 25.2 of the directive, which contains a non-regression clause.  Transposition of the directive cannot weaken existing safeguards for whistleblowers.  A number of suggested provision proposals in the heads may be perceived as undermining existing protections, such as the current right to report to a Minister or Department.  That ought not to be weakened and Departments need to be strengthened in dealing with protected disclosures or given the option of referring them on to the protected disclosures office or a relevant agency.  Public service workers should still be able to report to a Minister for the Department to determine whether he, she or it has the capacity to deal with that.  Likewise, they should be able to make anonymous disclosures.  The 2014 Act is silent on anonymous disclosures, meaning people can remain anonymous and, depending on the quality of information shared, there may still be an obligation on the recipient to investigate that concern.</p> <p>  Going back to the question of protections, all employers should be obliged, as is the case with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, to have policies and procedures in place.  Many charities, including small ones, will already have protected disclosure policies.  Sample policies are available under the code of practice from the WRC which can be adapted or adopted by employers of all shapes and sizes in all sectors.  In our view, there is no reason the provision around procedures and policies should be limited to employers with only 50 or more staff.  That would create confusion.  Many employers are small to medium-sized enterprises whose staff sizes fluctuate from year to year and it is important they all understand they have to have these procedures in place in the same way they have to have procedures and policies around bullying, harassment and other health and safety risks.</p></speech>

It is worth bearing in mind that the EU whistleblowers directive is about minimum standards.  Member states, including Ireland, are entitled to go beyond those.  This is a fantastic opportunity for Ireland to fill the holes regarding what is in the directive and not in our legislation currently and to learn from mistakes we have observed over nearly seven years of the legislation being in place.  For example, in Australian legislation there is an obligation on employers to carry out a risk assessment of harm to workers who make protected disclosures.  Part of their internal process of dealing with the disclosure is to look at the risks to the individual raising the concern and at what measures need to put in place to ensure they are not at risk of retaliation.</p> <p>  The Senator raised the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof.  That is within the EU whistleblowers directive.  It is not currently in the heads of the Bill.  It is expected it will be included.  Under our legislation currently, in any legal proceedings it is accepted a disclosure is protected until the contrary is proved.  That is great.  It is one hurdle the worker does not have to overcome.  It is assumed to be a protected disclosure.  However, depending on the nature of the claim, the burden is different.  If it is for unfair dismissal, the burden is on the employer to show why the employee was dismissed.  In penalisation claims, however, the burden of proof is on the employee to show why he or she was penalised.  It can be extremely difficult to prove as the employee does not have access to the relevant information the decision-maker had access to.</p> <p>  Mr. Devitt mentioned the research carried out by Transparency International Ireland on success rates under the Protected Disclosures Act.  Having looked at that in my research, I found 88% of cases were unsuccessful and 12% were successful.  The burden of proof is one issue to be taken into consideration.</p> <p>  Something we could do beyond the directive, which the Senator mentioned, concerns accountability for organisations that do not have protected disclosure procedures.  Obligations on the public sector include prescribed persons.  They are only obliged to have procedures for their own employees, but I discovered in my research that 68% of prescribed persons had no information about their role publicly available on their website.  This will be a new obligation under the whistleblowers directive but we need to see some accountability and sanction for failure to comply.  If the public sector does not have procedures in place, there is no redress or remedies for the worker.  In legal proceedings, if there is evidence the public body did not have a policy in place, that is not taken into account in assessing the protected disclosure, retaliations and so on.  There is no point in having these provisions in place unless there is some recourse for failure to comply.</p></speech>

These were the decisions I was able to locate.  I assessed the successful-unsuccessful rate under the Act of 156 cases.  Of the successful claims, which amounted to 12%, or 19 claims, eight were successful on the grounds the employee was found to have been dismissed wholly or mainly for having made a protected disclosure, nine were successful on the grounds they had been penalised because of or in retaliation for having made a protected disclosure, while two were in respect of interim relief applications before the Circuit Court, whereby an employee can file a claim for his or her dismissal before the hearing of the substantive unfair dismissal claim.</p> <p>  As for the unsuccessful cases, I must correct the record.  I stated that 30% were unsuccessful on procedural grounds but I should have said 30 cases, or 22%.  A total of 107 cases, or 78%, were unsuccessful on their merits.  Breaking that down further, I found that 45% of the cases were unsuccessful because there was no protected disclosure, 53% were unsuccessful because there was either no unfair dismissal or no penalisation, while two cases before the High Court were unsuccessful on the grounds they were appeals on a point of law from the Labour Court to the High Court where it was found that no error in law had been made by the Labour Court.  In the majority of unsuccessful claims, therefore, it was found the employee had not been dismissed or penalised for having made a protected disclosure, while a total of 45% were unsuccessful because it was found there had been no protected disclosure.</p></speech>

We advise employers to ensure they have policies, systems and procedures in place, not just to investigate but to assess or screen a concern or potential protected disclosure when it is made.  In doing so, they can determine its credibility and whether, in the first instance, it is a protected disclosure as defined in the Act or whether it should be handled through grievance procedures.  As my colleague Ms Heffernan might have said earlier, provision should be made in the revised Act to distinguish between interpersonal grievances and protected disclosures.  Employers will need to be offered guidance and training on how to sift the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, to distinguish between the two.</p> <p>  Ultimately, it is up to a court to determine whether a disclosure was a protected disclosure but we want to avoid, insofar as possible, cases reaching the courts because if they do, both the employer and the employee, and more often the employee, will have lost a great deal in taking a legal challenge.  It is important, therefore, that employers have these systems in place.  That is one reason we suggest the obligation to have policies and procedures under the revised Act should be extended to employers of all sizes and sectors.  Ms Casey might have spoken about services we provide through the Integrity of Work programme to public bodies and members of the initiative.  There is no easy answer to this.  Rather, we suggest that all employers should seek to have policies and procedures and that they should be adequately resourced, in terms of both time and finances.</p></speech>

When clients come to us, that is the first step we take.  We have to check whether the information has come to them in connection with their employment and whether they have a reasonable belief that it shows one or more of the relevant wrongdoings set out in the Act.  This is tied in to the issue to which Mr. Devitt referred.  People who receive disclosures need to be trained to recognise a protected disclosure.  He referred to grievances.  At a webinar we held this morning, I commented on the proposed new section 5(9) in the heads of the Bill.  It states "A matter is not a relevant wrongdoing if it is a matter concerning interpersonal grievances exclusively affecting the reporting person, namely grievances about interpersonal conflicts between the reporting person and another worker and the matter can be channelled to other procedures designed to address such matters."  My point was that while I am sure that has been proposed as something perceived as helpful, when the definition is broken down there are four parameters to be met.  Moreover, it refers to only one type of grievance, an interpersonal grievance.  A High Court decision highlights the point I want to make, namely, that a grievance can contain elements of a protected disclosure.</p><p>That is why a recipient of a disclosure needs to be trained to recognise that something which might appear as a grievance in the beginning could have protected disclosure elements.  If someone is not properly trained, he or she might dismiss something as merely a grievance when it does, in fact, contain protected disclosure elements, which can result in wrongdoing either not being detected or being wilfully ignored.  We must also take into consideration the fact that the employment arena, as well as being a business arena, is a human relationships arena.  Things do not happen within neatly defined parameters.  A worker who comes across wrongdoing, particularly one who is a loyal employee, usually reports something but often is blindsided by the reaction of an employer who does not want to hear it.  Something that will eventually become a protected disclosure may begin as a grievance.  It is important to think about that issue.</p><p> In connection with the same issue, I will just mention that the directive is not something we are obliged to transpose.  It is referred to in a recital and is suggested as something that we could consider doing.  In my experience, it is something about which one would need to think carefully.  The idea that a grievance can contain protected disclosures elements would need to be encompassed.  That is the main point I wanted to clarify.</p></speech>

The protection of whistleblowers legislation in Serbia requires judges dealing in the area of protected disclosures and whistleblowing to receive training.  Six years after the enactment of that legislation, 1,100 judges have received protected disclosures or whistleblowing training.  They are only entitled to hear those sorts of cases if they have received the training.</p> <p>  Protect, a whistleblowing charity based in the UK, has also suggested that similar obligations to those for judges and employment tribunals should be in place for decision-makers before they hear discrimination cases.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan earlier mentioned that this is a complex area of law.  It is important that we have well-rounded training, not only for managers but also for those who are actually making decisions under the Act.</p></speech>

The UK has the Magna Carta but it is not the same thing.  The constitutional entitlements of the individual are particularly important in this country, or at least some of us think they are.  Their rights must be observed and the discharge of duty in their interests must be, or should be, observed at all times.  Two other questions arise.</p></speech>

I have dealt with cases that were before the courts and the WRC.  I will not go through them all.</p> <p>  I want to refer in particular to cases in which the interpersonal relationships within an organisation are particularly repugnant to an individual.  A victim may have to suffer for a considerable time.  What compensation is available in those particular cases where the victim is targeted over a period and is, in some cases, driven out of the employment by virtue of there being no recourse, as far as he or she is concerned, from any quarter and as a result, he or she is being victimised?  </p></speech>

In the recent judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys in the case of John Clarke <i>v</i>. CGI Food Services Limited, and I hope I have read this right, the judge said that the financial repercussions in the case were significant for the employer because the employer must now continue to pay the former employee pending the resolution of the matter.  Do I take it from that judgment that a whistleblower is entitled to be paid for the duration of the period the case is being dealt with?  Does that judgment stand?  Will our guests comment on that and reply to the question put by Deputy Durkan?  Perhaps Dr. Kierans would like to respond.</p></speech>

In this particular case, the applicant secured interim relief and secured payment until the hearing of his claim for unfair dismissal.

This situation applies when a specific application is brought.  However, it is worth bearing in mind that the heads of the Bill propose interim relief to be available to employees who have been penalised.  The nature of the interim relief may be along the lines that an individual alleges that he or she is being harassed as a result of making a protected disclosure.  In that case, relief may be an order for the harassment to cease, as opposed to an order for payment.</p></speech>

I am asking about what Mr. Clifford said earlier.  It appeared as if the individual in the Prison Service was awarded a sum but that was challenged later.  It just begs the question in all of this of the cost to the whistleblower of having to stay in the process while, at the same time, being penalised and, in some cases, out of a job while the State uses taxpayers' money to bring that whistleblower through the courts time and again.  Would any of the witnesses like to comment on this?</p></speech>

The default position of State agencies, whether in medical negligence claims, claims on wrongful dismissal or penalisation under this Act, seems to be to challenge the application.  I do not think it is a problem unique to this particular area of law.  My colleagues might disagree or may have something to add.  It is important that the Chief State Solicitor's office, or someone other than those drafting the legislation, also considers what strategies might be employed or reconsider the legal strategies employed in defending cases of this nature.  As I said in my opening address, they can serve to prolong the distress that whistleblowers endure and serve to undermine public confidence in the agency if it is seen to challenge the decision in this way.</p></speech>

In the public sector, it seems to be quite different, in that there is free use of taxpayers' money and money paid into the State to defend the entity, whether a Department, an agency or a third level institution, whatever it might be.  It is this which prolongs the time it takes to deal with it.  The State has put in place whistleblower legislation and certain parts of the State turn around and challenge it at every corner and bend, to the extent that the whistleblower is the person who suffers and the wrongdoing continues.  It is containment in a highly aggressive way.  The State itself is culpable of causing further damage and harm to the individuals concerned and it does not seem to care.  This sort of financial muscle on one side takes on an individual and literally blackguards him or her from start to finish and causes a mental breakdown or illness of some sort, and finally the person might give up.  How does this get addressed in legislation?</p> <p>  In the context of a whistleblower who has made a protected disclosure and finds himself or herself in that predicament and reaches out to another party for help to highlight the issue, what is the obligation of this other party to support the whistleblower or to do something about it to highlight what is, in effect, further bullying and harassment by the State using the money the State has?  Surely there has to be a level playing field for those who find themselves making a protected disclosure as loyal employees.</p> <p>  We have been discussing the make-up of legislation but the practical application of the legislation has caused serious damage to individuals and the State seems to get away with it.  We need robust legislation that goes beyond the EU directive, which acknowledges the utter failure of the current legislation in the context of what is happening.  Without Transparency International Ireland, and without Mr. Clifford in particular, many whistleblowers would have suffered really badly over a longer period.  We need to address what will happen between now, under the current legislation, and a time when we will have new more robust legislation.  Whistleblowers are really suffering.  They reach out to Members of this House to support them and when they do, they get that support but if it goes up along the chain and they ask a Minister, the Taoiseach or whoever it might be for support, do they have an obligation at least to pay attention to what whistleblower tells them?</p></speech>

It is essential, and the directive does provide under measures to support Article 20 and elsewhere, for free legal aid to be given to people making protected disclosures, as the Chair has said.  The balance is tipped in favour of employers, whether in the public or private sector, and it is essential that workers are given free legal aid and support when taking challenges.  It is also important that trade unions play a pivotal role in promoting the welfare of whistleblowers and in educating workers on their responsibilities to make sure their colleagues do not suffer as a result of speaking up.  In many cases, it is not the employer who is directly responsible for reprisal but the co-workers of the whistleblower.  They also have a role to play.</p></speech>

In my experience of dealing with some of these issues, if there is a scenario in which one member of a trade union makes a protected disclosure and the person who may be an aggressor or who has transgressed is also a member of the union, what I have observed is the union is more inclined to side with the person who is the subject of the disclosure rather than the person making the disclosure.</p> <p>  On the point regarding the public sector, there definitely seems to be a scenario whereby in the private sector if a disclosure is made the relationship with the shareholders of that entity is such that they want the issue resolved, on the basis it will make the company or entity in the private sector function better and it is regarded in this way.  This is largely the case but not exclusively.  In the public sector there is an issue whereby senior management, in particular if it is a serious issue, perceive it as being a personal attack on them and they respond on this basis and, as the Chair pointed out, they do so with the full resources of the State behind them.  It is certainly the case that it is very difficult to see how the public interest is being served in this scenario and it is definitely an area that, hopefully, could be addressed in some way through legislation.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.  I sincerely thank Transparency International Ireland for the work it does.  I particularly thank Mr. Clifford, who has led the way in regard to exposing quite a lot of the issues relative to the current legislation and how whistleblowers are treated.  It is appropriate to caution the State that where a Department or agency is currently dealing with a case, it should deal with it in the context of the improvements that are being made to the legislation and of ensuring that the rights of the individual are not trampled upon and that they are dealt with fairly.  The experience I have had to date leads me to believe the whistleblower becomes the target after the protected disclosure is made.  They end up losing their jobs, they end up in poor health and they end up maybe not being able to be employed in the sector in respect of which they are qualified.  That is not good enough.  The State should lead by example and should not in any way undermine the rights or the dignity of an individual who is putting forward a protected disclosure and is a loyal employee of the agency or Department.  It is frightening what is happening in Ireland relative to whistleblowers.  I hope this discussion we have had as part of our pre-legislative scrutiny will help to bring forward a better piece of legislation and go beyond the European directive, as some of the witnesses have suggested.  I again thank the witnesses.  I am sure we will meet again in the course of the pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></speech>

I need about five minutes to get to Agriculture House.  I have booked a room in the Leinster House 2000 building to avoid the problem but I do not have a working Internet connection from there.  I hope it will be working from next week.  I am requesting at least four minutes to get back to the office so that I do not miss what is happening.</p></speech>

Have we discussed amendment No. 42?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.633" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#A01100"><p>I am unsure whether I spoke to them and I made that point at the end of our previous meeting.  Amendment No. 42 provides that the agency must be publicly owned and controlled.  I want to emphasise this because one of the big problems with these agencies that are set up is that they are at one remove from direct control by elected representatives.  Essentially, they become buffers against proper oversight.  To be honest, I am sick to my back teeth of dealing with these entities, which are sort of State agencies.  A councillor may attend a council meeting to try to find out what a body, a supposedly public body, is doing.  Then he is told the council cannot give an answer because it is the responsibility of a given body and the council will see if it can get representatives in and get an answer from them.  It is at one remove from real direct public control.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that is what will happen with the Land Development Agency, LDA.  Theoretically, the council will still have a role.  In reality, the LDA will be a law unto itself unless it is directly publicly controlled and unless there is direct public oversight over what is being done to develop public land.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 is next.  We are including the term "relevant private".  The reason for this is because, as we discussed previously, the LDA should not be acting in substitution for local authorities in the context of their responsibility for public land or for opening up such land to private interests.  The agency should be doing the opposite.  It should be grabbing relevant private land, including that which is being hoarded by private developers.  I refer to vacant land that is being hoarded, being used for the purposes of speculation or that is simply unused and that could be used for housing.  What the LDA should be doing is getting hold of such private land because it could be used to deliver much needed housing.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 49 provides that the definition of public housing should be housing that is operated by local authorities and approved housing bodies with differential rents.  Again, this is critical because the Minister's definition of "affordability" is linked to market prices and rents rather than people's income or the cost of housing.  That is not affordable at all.  What we want in defining public housing is that anything built by the State on public land or anything that is being defined as affordable in any context should be affordable relative to people's incomes.  Specifically, public housing must be based on the differential rent scheme.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 79 is next.</p></speech>

I know we are starting off but we have gone back to group 1 and now we are going back to group 2.  I know there was a question about whether we have dealt with amendments Nos. 42 to 44, inclusive.  It is difficult to follow.  We are back on the grouping we dealt with.  We are not on group 2.  I am not sure whether the Chairman can give some advice on this.  I am trying to be helpful rather than interrupt.</p></speech>

To say it is hard to follow is putting it mildly.  We have four different groupings within one group.  It is pretty crazy to be honest.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive, have been spoken to by Deputy Boyd Barrett and the Minister.  Amendment No. 49 has been covered.  Deputy Boyd Barrett may wish to move on to amendments Nos. 79 and 80.  Amendment No. 213 has been covered.  Finally, we will cover amendments Nos. 236 to 259, inclusive, all of which relate to the Title.</p></speech>

Of course, that sort of vague phraseology gets to the heart of what is wrong with the LDA and the Government's proposals for dealing with the housing crisis.  A phrase like "for public good" does not mean anything.</p> <p>  What we need is an agency whose sole purpose is to deliver public and affordable housing.  We need a strict definition of what public and affordable housing is so that it is genuinely public and genuinely affordable.  That is the logic.</p></speech>

I will deal with his initial comments first.  We are talking here about a commercial semi-state company.  It is 100% publicly owned.  It is fully accountable to the Oireachtas.  There is full oversight.  I have ensured that there will be full freedom of information provisions and oversight from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It could not be more publicly owned than it is.  We will have to agree to differ on this because it is not only 100% publicly owned but its remit is to deliver and build on public land.</p> <p>  I take the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett with regard to the hoarding of private land.  That needs to be addressed, but let us be aware of and deal with the reality.  There is a great deal of publicly owned land that should be used more productively.  That is what we need to do.  That is why this legislation has been brought forward.  The State is the biggest hoarder of land and that needs to stop.  We need to put our land to use to build homes for our people, including social and affordable homes.</p><p>Amendment No. 49, which is related to amendment No. 79, is jointly tabled by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Barry.  It seeks to amend section 3 of the Bill which provides definitions for references made in the Bill.  In particular, the amendment seeks to insert a definition of public housing.  I am opposing the amendment as a specific term for public housing is not referenced at any point in the Bill.  As such, a definition is not required.  The Bill already includes multiple references to affordable and social housing, which we discussed at length on Tuesday.  Local authorities are the housing authorities.  They will be the main drivers of delivery of social and direct-build affordable homes.  The LDA will assist them in implementing that role, but also in delivering on State agency land, which is not happening at the moment.  On nine sites that we know of already, and others, that will be moving forward.  As such, local authorities have the primary role with regard to the delivery of social housing, including in regard to the allocation of such housing and the setting of appropriate rent levels.  I will be opposing these amendments.</p></speech>

I am speaking also in support of the intent of Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendments.  Amendment No. 80 attempts to provide that all of the homes on land that the LDA is developing should be affordable housing.  I cannot see any justification for allowing the very scarce resource of public land to be used for unaffordable housing.  If the Minister wants to make a case as to the reason that land should be used for houses that will be sold at prices of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000, he can do that, but this amendment makes clear that where the LDA is involved in residential development all of the homes on that land would be affordable and social as well.  That seems to me an eminently sensible proposal.</p></speech>

This is about delivery.  The main purpose of the LDA will be to deliver affordable and social housing.  In many instances, particularly in our urban centres, we will have 100% affordable and social in the sense that entire developments will be made up that mix of housing, particularly in Dublin and in Cork.  We need to ensure the agency also has latitude to be able to deliver on sites into the future.  I will not be accepting amendment No. 80.</p></speech>

I do not know in what order they indicated, but I will call Deputy Cian O'Callaghan first and then Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.649" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#B00600"><p>This is the bit I do not understand.  The case has not been made, and no rationale has been offered, as to the reason we would want to build homes at full market price on public land, or what the advantage is of doing that.  We have a huge demand and crisis in terms of housing affordability.  We need to be using public land to deliver affordable and social housing.  That is abundantly clear, and the Minister has said that a great deal himself.  There is gap between what he says in terms of his mantra of public homes on public land and what is actually being done and being delivered.  I am highly sceptical of the Land Development Agency.  We hear that mantra, yet what we see is majority, private, full market price homes being built on public land.  That is what happened under the previous Government, and it is what is happening under this Government.</p> <p>  I want to make a point on delivery.  It slows down delivery to do that mix because to be able to sell homes at full market price the homes have to be drip fed for sale over a number of years.  If the houses were built at prices that people could genuinely afford, for which there would be huge demand, we would be able to build-out a lot of these housing schemes much quicker and thus we would have much quicker delivery of homes.  We would have quicker delivery and more affordable homes.  I have yet to hear any rationale as to the reason, in terms of public land, there should be any provision of unaffordable, full market price homes when there are already private developers who have plenty of land to be delivering that type of build.  That is not where there is a gap.  There is a particular gap in terms of affordability and also social housing.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.650" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#B00700"><p>I want to respond to the Minister's claim that delivery could not be more public than it is.  We need to put this in a concrete context.  At the moment, in my area there is virtually no public housing being developed.  The local authority build for this year for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area is zero.  All of a sudden and out of the blue, notice was given of allocations from the council list to a private development that the elected representatives had no idea was going to be allocated for social housing, although always through approved housing bodies and not as direct council housing.  Out of the blue, this popped up and none of the elected representatives had known about it.  Why is that?  It is because the development was built privately and behind the scenes there is commercial negotiation is going on.  Once that commercial element is brought in, oversight and democracy go out the window.  This is what is going to happen with the public land bank through the Land Development Agency.  Everything will be about commercial negotiations and negotiations with financiers and the elected representatives of local authorities will not have direct input or knowledge of what is going to happen, when it is going to happen or how it is going to happen until it is a done deal and a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p><p>The idea that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be able to drill down into the details of developments on particular sites in the multiple local authority areas is nonsense.  The people who potentially could have oversight and real input and serve the public interest at a local level are the elected representatives of the local authorities.  That will all go out the window.  They are going to be at more than one remove in respect of many of the key decisions that will be made about the development of the public land banks in their areas.  It is for this reason I am stressing in the amendment that housing has to be publicly owned and controlled.  What this Bill does is supplant the role of local authorities and bring in people who are operating largely to a private commercial agenda.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is correct that there is no justification for building full market price housing on public land.  It is outrageous.  What we should be doing is further encroaching on the dominance of the private sector over the housing market.  The Government, through the Land Development Agency, is expanding the influence of the private and commercial sector into the public land bank.</p></speech>

I am trying to understand why the Minister thinks it is a good idea for the scarce resource of public land to be used to build and sell homes that will be priced between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  I accept that there is a shift in this Bill from the original Fine Gael proposition, which was that, on average, 60% of all the homes delivered through the LDA would be unaffordable full market price sales.  The Minister is right in saying that he has introduced a series of measures to change that, but I cannot understand why he would allow any homes to be sold.  Taking the Dundrum Central site as an example, there will be some level of private build there, but the median market price for a two bedroom apartment in that location is currently over &euro;500,000.  In that regard, the Government is using public land to build homes at an exceptionally high price.  Why is that a good idea?  If the Minister wants us to withdraw our amendments he needs to convince us that is a good idea.  There are already homes being developed for &euro;500,000 for the people who can afford to buy them.  Homes costing &euro;230,000, &euro;250,000 and &euro;260,000 are desperately needed.  Therefore, I cannot understand the rationale of 10%, 25% or 50% of a site being used for unaffordable open market price sales.</p></speech>

It also means supporting people who want to purchase privately like first-time buyers or those who want to downsize.  The Minister clearly outlined that in areas like Dublin and Cork where affordable is most needed, it will be prioritised and delivered.  He indicated that sites in these areas will have up to 80% or 90% affordable and 10% social housing.  That is good and where we want to get to.  We want to get to a point where the local demand is met through the LDA.  Local authorities are doing their local housing demand-needs assessment.  It is right and proper that those local needs will be reflected in the master planning of public sites by the agency.  That is going to vary with every local authority.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that.</p> <p>  I intend to align the provisions of Part 9 more closely to the provisions of the recently published Affordable Housing Bill.  This significant affordable housing legislation is in the Seanad and will, hopefully, pass Committee Stage there tomorrow.  I assume the Deputies who have tabled these amendments will support that Bill.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins is correct about the mix.  In major urban areas, particularly in Dublin, Cork and Galway, most of the LDA sites would be 90% affordable, 10% social or a mix of that, meaning 100%.  We need to allow latitude in other parts of the country and for specific sites to allow the choice to be given within those areas.  We should not have a continuing debate about restricting tenure type.  We only have to look at what happened earlier this week with a good proposal for 1,200 homes in Fingal, a mix of public and private with 238 affordable purchase, 238 social, 150 cost-rental plus some private.  In some areas, it will make sense to have that mix of affordable, social and public, depending on the area.  The Deputies know that too.  Those who tabled these amendments opposed that particular development.</p> <p>  In general terms, we need to allow the LDA to operate within certain parameters.  I will set out the areas around affordability in more detail through the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is clear that there will be no instance whereby the agency will offer unaffordable, open-market sales as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has put forward.  This legislation will endure, hopefully, for years and the agency will endure for decades.  We need this agency.  It will not be, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin put it, a land management quango.  On Tuesday, he said he wanted an agency that does not plan for or build anything.  His would be an agency that would simply put together a summary of State lands and then farm it out to different public bodies that he thinks will deliver those homes.  We have gone past that.</p> <p>  In the Government's view, the LDA will be used to provide an additional dividend to our local authorities.  It is on top of what they will be doing.  This means it will be more social and more affordable houses.  Activating State lands will provide additional social and additional affordable homes to what our local authorities will be doing.  Deputies should not forget this.  This is not a case of instead of but on top of.  That will help us drive the type of numbers we need to be able to continue to build more public homes and to start building affordable homes at scale.  That is what everyone wants.  The LDA, as constructed in this legislation, will be empowered to do that.  It is important that we get this legislation passed to capitalise this agency and have it moving with the development of social and affordable homes in addition to what our local authorities will be doing.</p> <p>  These amendments seek to add references to social and affordable in the Bill.  As I said earlier, there are sufficient references in it.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p> <p>  With regard to the amendment seeking to remove the reference to address deficiencies in the housing market, it is clear such deficiencies exist.  That is why the LDA will play an important role in addressing this.</p> <p>  Additionally, I do not propose to accept amendments seeking to delete or amend the references to the role of the LDA relating to master planning, design and project management, as well as its key role as a development agency in land assembly.  That would fundamentally change the agency.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about the agency not being publicly owned, it absolutely is a publicly owned entity.  The shareholders will be the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I do not intend to accept the amendment to insert the proposed definition for public housing.  This term is not used in this Bill and there are sufficient references to affordable and social housing.  The whole purpose of this is that the LDA will play an important role in delivering affordable and social housing, including providing services to local authorities and assisting them in developing some of their own housing schemes.</p></speech>

I am actually in the convention centre now.  I will be speaking in the Chamber in the centre in a few minutes.  If a vote is called on these amendments, I am going to have to fly over to Leinster House.  The whole operation of trying to speak in the Chamber - I get limited speaking time as it is because of the restrictions - has to be looked at.  I want to attend meetings and speak at the committee.  I also want to vote and speak in the Chamber.</p> <p>  I disagree with the Minister on his points on social and affordable housing and for not accepting our amendments.  At the end of the day, this is public land to deliver social, affordable and cost-rental homes for people who need them.  They are crying out for such housing.  Our amendments are at the core of this Bill, namely, that we want to deliver public houses on public lands. That is what this Bill should be about.</p> <p>  Apologies but, hopefully, I will be in Leinster House shortly.  Again, I disagree with the Minister's analysis.  What we are proposing are real solutions and they should be adopted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.658" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#C00500"><p>Before I speak to that last list of amendments in this grouping, the Minister said something important and in his response I would like him to confirm this.  He said that in no instance the LDA would be involved in the delivery of unaffordable, open market price homes.  Does he mean that there will not be a single home on any LDA site that would be sold at the full open market value?</p> <p>  For example, in the scheme he cited, he said there would be some homes for the private market.  In fact, 60% of the homes, almost 800, will be private.  Fingal County Council did a market analysis of that area which it shared with its elected members.  It showed the market price was between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  This is eminently unaffordable for two- or three-bed family homes in that area.  Likewise, for example, cost rental does not work if one is buying the property at full market value, which is what Glenveagh has proposed in that area.  Of course, it will sell half of the apartments in the unaffordable private section at full market value.</p><p>Why would it not?  It is a blocked sale.  The financing of this would mean the rents on those properties would be &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,800.  It is not cost-rental.  Cost-rental removes the profit element from the development and charges rent at cost.  This is essentially the worry I aim to address with amendments Nos. 80, 213 and 236.  All of these say that not one single home on any of these sites should be sold at a price of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000.  Will the Minister clarify whether he means that that will not happen when he says there will be no such instances?  If so, why will he not accept the amendments?</p><p> I will move on to the final group of amendments in this grouping, Nos. 236 to 259, inclusive, some of which are mine and some of which were tabled by others.  I will pick out a number of key ones.  Obviously, these relate to rewriting the Long Title of the Bill.  The Long Title is really crucial because it outlines what this Bill is going to do.  I have also tabled more specific technical amendments which aim to change the relevant sections of the Bill.  With specific regard to amendment No. 242, I have yet to hear the Minister make the case for the agency being a commercial semi-State body as opposed to a non-commercial semi-State body.  A non-commercial semi-State body would be much more accountable to the Oireachtas and to the Minister.  Its decisions and details of its financing would be fully available rather than being available in the redacted form the Land Development Agency, LDA, would be allowed to provide if it was a commercial semi-State body.</p><p> Likewise, in respect of amendment No. 247, why would the LDA be allowed to engage with a private developer to do the type of deal we saw agreed by Government parties and some Opposition parties in Donabate today?  Surely, it should all be not for profit and surely it should be about ensuring the lowest possible delivery cost at the development stage so that we can have the lowest possible cost for first-time buyers and others.</p><p> With regard to amendment No. 251, one of the things I do not understand is why the Minister has retained in the Bill the Fine Gael proposition that subsidiary designated activity companies be created.  This is a very controversial practice that is widespread in the commercial development sector.  A company decides to set up individual designated activity companies for each individual development.  It is one of the primary mechanisms by which that small but significant number of rogue builders and developers have been able to build and sell developments that are defective before walking away from any responsibility, having dissolved the designated activity company.  I do not see the rationale for subsidiaries, even if the Minister favours a commercial semi-State model.</p><p> Finally, I will address one of my big concerns, on which I have tabled substantial amendments which we will discuss when we get to these sections.  We have more than 31 planning authorities.  They are very competent and have planners, architects and an enormous level of skill.  We do not need a centralised State agency to get involved in gazumping the really good work of our local authorities.  We just need Government to properly resource those local authorities.  How would a State agency based in Dublin be better placed to develop a master plan for a site in Galway, Limerick or Cork than the democratically accountable planning departments of the local authorities in those areas?  I would have no difficulty whatsoever with this provision if it were in the context of a an active land management agency, which is not a quango but something the State desperately needs which the Government is not providing, which also provided additional shared services to local authorities to assist them in their primary function.  If the LDA, however, is given development agency status and is involved in, for example, developing a master plan for the Colbert lands in Limerick, which I suspect is intended here, this would dramatically reduce the key role of elected members of a local authority in that strategic development zone, SDZ, master planning process.  </p><p> It would also allow the agency, under the provisions of the Act, to bypass the council in making decisions and to go straight to the board, which again dramatically undermines the democratic process and the involvement of elected members.  That is not just my view but the view of many councillors in the Minister's own party which was expressed by members of the Association of Irish Local Government when they met us with regard to this Bill some time ago.</p><p> All of these amendments are about a different vision for this agency that would allow it to do the things that are needed.  We have local authorities.  It is about time that Government properly resourced and properly funded them to deliver the 20,000 public homes the Minister himself promised in the general election campaign last year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.660" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#D00200"><p>I have to respond to two of the Minister's points.  The idea that the LDA is acting as some sort of supplement to the local authorities rather than supplanting them is, quite honestly, just nonsense.  There is no better example than Shanganagh.  There has been delay after delay for years and years.  Central government has refused to just give the local authority the money to build on its own land because it had the LDA, or something like it, in mind for years and wanted to have a private commercial component to the development of that public land, which is now crystallised in the LDA.  Whereas there could have been one way of applying for central funding and building out if the local authorities were the lead and were resourced to build, nothing has happened because central government could not make up its mind as to how precisely it was going to drag the private market and private finance into the whole process.  As a consequence, we still have no idea what the price of affordable housing at Shanganagh will be and, of course, not a sod has been turned.</p> <p>  This brings me to my second point.  Could the Minister please explain why the cap on affordable housing in my area, for example, is &euro;450,000 while in other areas it is &euro;400,000, &euro;350,000, &euro;250,000 and so on?  Will he please explain that?  As I see it, the Minister is setting the level of so-called affordability in my area based on the fact that house prices are much higher there.  Affordability is being linked to local market conditions and, therefore, such housing will not be affordable.  A cost of &euro;450,000 or even &euro;400,000 is not affordable but that is what we are going to get from the LDA.</p> <p>  That brings me to the amendments themselves.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has already made the point about the designated activity companies, DACs.  There is to be the LDA itself, which will then set up subsidiaries which are allowed enter into commercial arrangements with other bodies.  Guess who those other bodies are.  It is a reference to private finance and private developers.  That is what it is all about.  Through our proposed deletions of parts of the Title of the Bill, we are trying to guard against all of that stuff and to ensure that the sole purpose of any such agency is to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing to people on a broad range of incomes and to ensure that, insofar as we build affordable housing, not only will it be genuinely affordable, but it will stay genuinely affordable in perpetuity.  This housing could never be marketised.  Of course, the Minister does not want that because it would be no good at all to his private financier and developer friends in their efforts to profit from the public land bank.  That is the logic of amendments Nos. 236 and 238.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#D00300"><p>I have tabled amendments No. 240 and 258.  I hope the Minister will accept amendment No. 240.  Rather than putting the focus on housing alone, the amendment suggests that housing has to be developed in the context of sustainable development and creating sustainable communities.  That is very important.  I cannot see any reason the Minister would not accept this amendment.  We should be talking about developing housing in the context of sustainable development and sustainable communities.  I look forward to hearing the Minister say that he will be supporting the amendment.  I cannot see any reason he would not.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 258, the Minister said that no one is talking about unaffordable housing.  He said that there will be no full-price sales on the open market.</p><p>He has said that he is looking at up to 100% of homes built by the Land Development Agency on public lands being affordable and social homes.  At the same time, he has defended the recent decision by Fingal County Council to sell public land to a private developer so that 60% of those homes can be sold at full market prices.  On the one hand, he is saying 100% affordable and social housing is good while, on the other, he is defending sales of public land which provide for the majority of homes to be sold at full market price.  </p><p> In terms of the Land Development Agency, we will find out very quickly how serious the Minister is because if he is serious about not having any homes sold at full market price, he will be happy to accept my amendment.  Amendment No. 258 proposes to delete the words "a proportion of" so that, rather than having a proportion of all dwellings provided on relevant land and former relevant public land made available at a price below market price, all of them would be made available at a price below market price.  If the Minister is in any way serious about the comments he just made about not having any homes on these lands sold at full market price, he will be happy to accept my amendment No. 258.  I look forward to his support for it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#E00200"><p>I assure Deputy O'Callaghan I am extremely serious about delivering affordable and social homes to the Land Development Agency at scale.  That is not just talking about it but actually doing something about it, as colleagues in Fingal County Council did on Tuesday.  I do not defend that by the way, but I welcome it.  The Deputy will have to explain, as Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett did, why his colleagues voted against 238 social homes, 238 affordable homes and 150 cost rental homes.  That is for the Deputy to do.</p> <p>  We need to move on from the sound-bite element of the Deputy's contributions to dealing with the facts on the ground.  We need affordable and social homes at scale.  The Government has brought forward the largest housing budget in the history of the State to deliver 9,500 new builds and new social homes through our local authorities.  On top of that, the LDA will not supplant local authorities, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, but supplement them.  That is exactly what it will do and is what we intend it to do.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Shanganagh Castle.  I accept that we are at the start of this Bill.  We can discuss specific sites and what has happened in the past but the reality is the housing on the Shanganagh Castle site will be 100% social and affordable.  I intend that the LDA will break ground on the site this year.  That is the position.  I will not accept these amendments.  </p> <p>  To go back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, it is a fact that the agency he wants will not be allowed to build or plan.  He wants a land management agency that cannot build homes or plan to build homes.  That is fundamentally what he has said today and also on Tuesday.  That is not a reasonable proposition or one that anyone could stand over.  If we all agree we need to utilise State-owned land productively for our people in the middle of a housing crisis, we had better get on with it.  </p> <p>  We are establishing the LDA as a commercial State company on the basis that we want the agency to be able to access the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and other funding in the future to be able to deliver.  This is so it can operate on a counter-cyclical basis and can have a real role in delivering housing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin regularly refers to building 20,000 public homes each year but never says where they will be built, who will build them or how long it will take.  We have an agency that can add to our public and affordable housing stock by managing and developing State land above and beyond council land.  We need to get on with that.  </p> <p>  The amendments seek to amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect other amendments the Deputies have tabled.  While we are early in the Committee Stage process, we have been jumping from one grouping to another and referring to other amendments that are further down the line.  We will address those when we reach that part of the Bill.  As I said, I am open to looking at amendments that are reasonable if they will benefit the legislation and the operation of the agency.  I appreciate the consideration Deputies have given to the Bill and the detailed amendments they are seeking to have made.  However, I cannot accept the amendments to the Long Title in this group as they do not reflect the intent of the Bill.</p> <p>  The Bill seeks to increase supply of housing, particularly affordable and social homes, by ensuring that public land is not being underutilised by not being made available for housing.  It also provides for the establishment of the LDA as a commercial State body to deliver that housing.  There is obviously a fundamental difference between what the Government wants - a land development agency to deliver housing - and what Deputy &Oacute; Broin wants.  He has said he does not want the agency to develop homes and does not believe it should be involved in residential development.  That is not a reasonable proposition in any way, shape or form.</p> <p>  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA will be established as a designated activity company under the Companies Act.  This is in line with other commercial State bodies.  As I said, the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform will be the shareholders.  There will not be any other shareholders.  This will ensure the LDA is publicly owned, as it is.  Whatever way people want to try to twist the narrative, the agency will be fully publicly owned.  It is necessary that the LDA has a shareholding as this facilitates the &euro;1.25 billion investment from ISIF.  What is that money and investment from ISIF for?  It is to deliver social and affordable homes for our people.  Who could be against that?  </p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, the LDA is being assigned a key role in housing delivery and will also work as an additional resource, providing services to assist the local authorities, such as master-planning.  A couple of Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Broin, have said the LDA should not be involved in this.  One would have thought that should be a shared service and that on appropriate sites the LDA could offer its expertise to local authorities.  Is there something wrong with that?  I fail to see what is wrong with that, other than it is another opportunity for Members to find a reason not to support the Bill.  It is appropriate and in line with other State bodies that have a development role, such as IDA Ireland and the Grangegorman Development Agency.  It will not, however, have the full development agency role involving planning powers that local authorities have.  As I said on Tuesday, it will not have the full development agency role.  I will not be accepting these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#E00300"><p>If parties were agreeable to this, we could have 1,200 affordable and social homes being delivered quickly in Donabate.  If we are to get the kind of delivery we need, selling off that land to a private developer and not getting those badly needed 1,200 affordable and social homes is hugely regressive in terms of what needs to be done.</p> <p>  The Minister stated the amendments in this group, including my amendments, go against the intent of the Bill.  My amendment No. 240 provides that part of the function of the Bill is the creation of sustainable development and sustainable communities.  For clarity, the Minister is refusing my amendment because he believes the creation of sustainable development and sustainable communities goes against the intent of this Bill.  That is what he said.  He should explain why he does not believe the Land Development Agency, as part of its remit, should be interested in sustainable development and sustainable communities because that is exactly what my amendment is about.  </p> <p>  To be very clear, he also said that amendment No. 258 goes against the intent of this Bill.  Amendment No. 258, if passed, would provide that all homes delivered by the Land Development Agency on public lands would be sold at below market prices, not just a portion of them.  The Minister has confirmed that the intent of this Bill is that only a portion of homes delivered by the Land Development Agency on public lands will be sold at below market prices.  That simply does not tally with his earlier comments because by rejecting this amendment, he is clearly showing that he does not agree that all homes should be below full market prices on public lands delivered by the Land Development Agency.  I will certainly be pressing both amendments.</p></speech>

I was not ignoring the Deputy's question but it relates to the Affordable Housing Bill, which is not the Bill in front of us.  It is a matter of caps, not targets.  We are not setting affordability at the levels of the caps; rather, we are saying the cap in an area is unaffordable.  The measures being introduced in the Affordable Housing Bill, such as shared equity, direct-build affordable housing, cost rental and the increase in the Part 5 proportion from 10% to 20%, will help to deliver affordability in all areas.  The caps are based on the median sale price from the previous year.  They are not targets.  There will be houses priced well below them.  Again, it is a matter for the Affordable Housing Bill, not the Bill before us.  We will get to Part 9 of the latter later.  The reality is that we are not setting a target of &euro;450,000 for affordability.  It is not remotely like that so I ask the Deputy to examine the Affordable Housing Bill and the regulations when we publish them.  House prices will be well below the amount in question.  For the first time, through the Affordable Housing Bill, genuine assistance will be afforded to those who have been locked out of buying their own home for the past several years, and they will be helped in bridging the affordability gap.  That relates to the Affordable Housing Bill, which will be before the committee.  I look forward to that.</p></speech>

Both are significant Bills.  They were introduced by the Government within a year of its establishment.  The Land Development Agency Bill was in gestation for years but we have changed it and brought it forward.  It will have a genuine impact on delivering affordable and social homes on State agency land.  The Affordable Housing Bill is related but it is in addition.  It relates not only to affordable homes on public land but also to the provision of affordable housing on private lands.  Again, I would have expected Deputy Boyd Barrett to have welcomed that.  When we get to Part 9 of this Bill, we will be dealing with aligning the Affordable Housing Bill with the Land Development Agency Bill.</p> <p>  The differences in price caps, which are not targets, reflect the fact that there are different house prices in different parts of the country.  There are regional price caps because one size does not fit all in the Irish housing market.  In parts of the country, no private homes have been built in ten years.  The only homes that are being built are public homes.  Including throughout the midlands and north-west, there are large swathes of the country with a viability problem.  It will not be fixed in just one Bill.</p> <p>  The Bill, along with the Affordable Housing Bill, which will be proceeding to Committee Stage in the Seanad, contains real measures to help real people to own their own homes or, indeed, rent their own homes with State-backed cost rental.  That is what we are talking about.  Let us not get into conspiracy theories on this.  The Affordable Housing Bill is genuine legislation that is related to the Land Development Agency Bill.  I envisage the latter delivering affordable, social and cost rental housing at scale.  We cannot do that unless the agency is set up on foot of primary legislation.  In this way, we can capitalise the agency to the tune of &euro;1.25 billion.  This is Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, money.  I do not know whether Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett or others are opposed to that capitalisation.  It will allow the agency to borrow a further &euro;1.25 billion, thereby being capitalised initially with &euro;2.5 billion to deliver social and affordable homes at scale on State-owned lands that have been sitting idle for far too long.  I could get into more detail.</p></speech>

It is not just that members of the Traveller community have to wait longer times, whether for Traveller-specific accommodation or general needs social housing, but the failure of local authorities up to 2020 to spend the money the Government had given to them added to that scandal.  In fairness to the previous Government, it increased the Traveller accommodation budget to local authorities - modestly but it was an increase nonetheless.  In the years 2016 to 2019, however, only half of the total budget allocation was spent.  If that is compared with general needs social housing, in most of those years the Government came back seeking additional funds in a Supplementary Estimate.</p><p>Last year was different.  For the first year in a long time, 100% of the Traveller accommodation budget provided by the Department to local authorities was spent.  The problem is a large portion of that was not spent on new housing.  Of course, it was absolutely necessary for it to be spent on Covid-19-related safety measures, as well as other site improvements but until we start to deliver significant volumes of new Traveller-specific accommodation and larger general needs social housing to meet the needs of Traveller families, we will continue to have this problem.</p><p>Professor Michelle Norris, one of the members of the expert group on Traveller accommodation who presented to the committee previously, described this as an eminently solvable problem.  She outlined that there are legally binding Traveller accommodation programmes for local authorities, as well as budgetary allocations.  The number of individuals and households we are talking about is not very large but the failure of State institutions and, in particular in this instance, local authorities to do what they are meant to do to implement Traveller accommodation programmes is the starting problem.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work of the Minister of State, Deputy English, who headed up the expert review group on Traveller accommodation, which produced a very good report.  I also welcome the fact that in the programme for Government, the full implementation of that report is referenced, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is leading a subgroup of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee in regard to its implementation.  Nevertheless, given the role the Government is giving to the Land Development Agency, it seems remiss not to place the same legal obligation on the agency that currently exists with local authorities to deliver Traveller-specific accommodation.  My fear is that while the Minister may say nothing is preventing the LDA from including Traveller-specific accommodation in any of the sites it is developing or master-planning, my experience tells me that if something is not referenced specifically in the Bill, particularly in a section such as this, the likelihood of it not happening, particularly in light of the history of Traveller accommodation not being provided, is significant.</p><p>Both amendments Nos. 5 and 91 seek to place, in the two appropriate sections, a very clear legal obligation on the LDA, where it is involved in residential development or master-planning, to ensure there is appropriate provision of Traveller-specific accommodation to meet the needs of the Traveller community in those developments.  My amendment is not so specific as to state it has to be in every LDA development, although that is what I would ultimately like to see if we go down this route, but it would place an important legal obligation on them.  If that is not in the Bill, I think we will be back here in a year or two asking why the LDA is not contributing to the tackling of this important deficit in our housing system.</p></speech>

It is very important and it has to be included in the legislation.  If it is not, we run a high risk that it will just be something the LDA does not do because it will say it is not specifically in its remit and it is not listed in the legislation.  We will then be reliant on individuals in the management of the LDA, on its board or whatever to ensure this is included and that is not satisfactory, especially given the current deficits in Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  The report published by the Ombudsman for Children earlier this week details serious issues with accommodation and standards faced by Traveller children in particular in Cork.  It outlines problem with rat infestation, a lack of sanitary facilities or heating and damp conditions.  Children in the report describe their living conditions as hell, which is completely unacceptable for any group of children in this country.</p> <p>  It is really important that the Minister accept the amendment and we make a specific provision in the Bill.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the House yesterday and he was quite supportive of seeing these sorts of issues resolved.  I hope the Minister will take on board the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.690" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#H00400"><p>I fully understand where the Deputies are coming from and I am certainly happy to examine the remit of the agency.  Following on from our debate on the previous grouping of amendments, we need to be clear that the LDA is not a housing authority or a planning authority.  The primary responsibility for the delivery of homes and of Traveller accommodation is with the local authorities, and I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on that.</p><p>Progress is being made in that space and we must ensure that continues through the local authorities.  Under section 14 of the Bill, the LDA can provide services directly to local authorities and that would include master planing and other development related works.  We want mixed developments as well.  They will have a role in the provision of social and affordable housing, and accommodation when requested for the Traveller community.</p><p> I want to look at the remit in more detail.  I have had discussions with the relevant Ministers about this, just to let the Deputies know.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has been doing an impressive job here.  He has intensified contacts in that regard to ensure local authorities spend what they have been given and deliver the new homes that we need them to.  We will come to this later, but I also had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, on asylum seekers and direct provision, where we see that happening and what State agencies can play a role in that space.</p><p> I am sympathetic to the position the Deputies have put forward.  It is something the LDA can have an impact on, but I just have to see how it fits best in that space.  Right now on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 5, because the LDA is not a housing authority or a planning authority and I do not want to, in any way, shape or form, dilute the authority or the responsibility of our local authorities across the country to deliver accommodation for the Traveller community.  We are making progress in that space and I do not want anything to take away from that, but I understand the reason the Deputies put forward this amendment.  I would like some time to look in more detail at how we can look at the remit of the LDA.  I expect, in some instances, that local authorities will, under section 14, receive requests to provide services in this space.  For the purpose of Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

We worked very well together on this issue when the Minister was in opposition, along with our former committee colleague, Senator Pat Casey.  At some point, we must grasp the nettle of tackling the real obstacles to the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is significant that the report by the expert group on Traveller accommodation was published in 2019.  While I know there has been some progress - our committee has written to the national Traveller consultative committee to get regular updates on that because the subcommittee looks at that - the big problem many of us have is that some of the key recommendations of that report around Part 8 planning powers and section 183 land disposals for ensuring the delivery of Traveller accommodation have yet to be progressed.  I have not seen them in the legislative programme.  They may be included in some of the Bills which the Minister intends to bring forward; he might tell us that.  The difficulty is that unless we have clear legislative commitments, the core issue of providing adequate supply of Traveller-specific accommodation, in a culturally appropriate way, will not happen.  This section of the Bill is the correct place to put that.</p> <p>  While I am not, in any way, trying to remove the obligation of local authorities in playing the lead role - they are the bodies that design and approve the five-year Traveller accommodation programmes - if this Bill is passed, which is likely given the Government majority support, the LDA will develop housing developments within the administrative areas of local authorities on lands which are not belonging to local authorities' lands.  We have seen this on a number of sites.  Therefore, it should have a legal obligation to explore, in conjunction with local authorities in the context of Traveller accommodation programmes, how its lands can be utilised to assist in this.  If the Minister is willing to give a commitment to explore the possibility of a Government amendment on Report Stage - I know he cannot commit definitively to this - I am willing to withdraw this amendment at this point.  To be clear, I will resubmit this amendment and amendment No. 91 on Report Stage, and I will press the amendments if the Minister, at that point, does not come back with something.  I accept his bona fides on this, but if there is no legislative requirement, there will be no guarantee it will happen and that is why it must be in the Bill.</p></speech>

We have a general housing crisis at the moment, but the housing crisis which is affecting Travellers is especially severe, not just in terms of conditions.  We also see that Travellers are greatly over-represented in the number of people who have become homeless.  Given that the LDA is, and will be, dealing with such a large amount of public land, if we do not have something specific in the Bill, a large amount of land which would have previously been available for social housing and specifically for Traveller accommodation, will be out of the equation.  It is very important that this is addressed and I hope the Minister can agree to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's suggestion.</p></speech>

We take on board what the Minister said.  I hope he will take on board the recommendations made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  There was a shocking report issued about a halting site in Cork.  The description given by the children who live there was unbelievable in this day and age.  We live in a society that allows children to grow up in this environment and it is something we must tackle.  We must support the local authorities, there is no doubt about that, but if the LDA Bill is to go through, and if the LDA deals with the amount of public land that is expected, Traveller accommodation must be considered as part of it.  It must be included and delivered on.  I support Deputy &Oacute; Broin's suggestion and I hope the Minister takes it on board.</p></speech>

It is particularly important because I fear that, as this Bill envisages, the involvement of private finance, commercial interests and so on, one will get the usual stuff occurring, which is the real answer as to why the affordable caps are different in different areas.  It is because they are worried about the impact on the market.  Those sorts of prejudices are often what drive anti-Traveller sentiment.  There have been efforts by certain political parties to cynically trade on anti-Traveller prejudices to stop Traveller-specific accommodation, because it will affect the price of housing.  That is a terrible prejudice.  A Member who was a Minister in the previous Government, I think she is now a Minister of State, helped get herself elected on the basis of opposing Traveller-specific accommodation on the Mount Anville site in our area.  I wonder whether that site will be given over to the LDA, which is designated for Traveller-specific accommodation but was opposed by Fine Gael councillors.  I wonder whether the requirement to provide Traveller-specific accommodation on sites like Mount Anville will be a legislative obligation.  I support what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.</p></speech>

I fully understand the intent of the amendments.  To follow on from what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, I have always been, and continue to be, a full and unambiguous supporter of Traveller-specific accommodation and improving the lot of our Traveller community.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has been really engaged within the Department.  Last year was the first year the full allocation of &euro;14.5 million was spent on Traveller accommodation.  This year the capital budget is &euro;15.5 million and there are significant developments happening in that regard.  We have much work to do in this space.  There is no question about that.</p><p> I will give a commitment to look at this in more detail between now and Report Stage.  I will engage with Deputies on that.  This should not divide us because all of us on the committee want to ensure we are providing the Traveller accommodation that is needed.  I see the LDA having a role in that space.  I want to balance that with the fact that I do not want to see any dilution of responsibility for the local authorities.  Their fundamental principal responsibility is to deliver accommodation in this space as well as for social housing.</p><p> I am happy to look at this.  Useful amendments have been tabled.  I need a bit more time to see how we could advance this.  I reaffirm our absolute commitment to ensure we improve the lot of our Traveller community, particularly in the area of accommodation.  I am an unambiguous supporter of that programme, which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is driving in accordance with the commitments in the programme for Government in this area.  I will look at this in more detail, engage with the Deputies who tabled this amendment and look to come back with something before Report Stage, if that is agreeable.</p></speech>

The appalling accommodation regime that has been in place for people seeking asylum in our State is well documented.  Large numbers of people, many fleeing wars, persecution and economic devastation, come to our country seeking asylum.  We are a country that has had that experience ourselves.  There is probably not a generation of the families of any member of this committee which did not at some point in the 19th or 20th century have to leave Ireland for similar reasons.  Being a nation of emigrants, it surprises me that we have had such a poor State response to accommodating people who come here seeking asylum.</p><p>I acknowledge that, for the first time in 20 years, there is a programme for Government commitment to addressing this issue.  I also acknowledge the important work the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, has done in bringing forward a plan for bringing an end to direct provision and providing a human rights-compliant own-door accommodation system for people on a temporary basis while they wait for their asylum applications to be processed.</p><p>The key is in the implementation, and that brings me to this amendment.  The primary responsibility for transitioning to a human rights-compliant accommodation system for people applying for asylum will not rest with the Land Development Agency.  However, given that the agency is being set up to do large-scale residential developments at the direct delivery end and the planning end, it should also have a legal obligation to consider how it can best play a role in assisting the relevant Department and State agencies in what will be a very challenging task in the years ahead.  If it is not in this legislation, it will not happen.</p><p>We have many amendments so, to progress the debate more quickly, if the Minister was willing, as he was with the last, to give an undertaking to examine the issue, discuss it with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and consider a Government amendment on Report Stage, I would be happy to withdraw this amendment.  Given the scale of the development the Minister is promising under this legislation, I think it would be a real missed opportunity to ensure human rights-compliant own door accommodation for people in the asylum system.  To allow them to live with dignity in a traumatic system would be the right thing to do.  There needs to be in this section of the Bill an explicit commitment to play a role in this.</p></speech>

It affords me the opportunity to mention a couple of things with regard to the work I have been doing with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I recognise the commitment in the programme for Government to ending direct provision.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has done an incredible amount of work on that, into which we fed through the White Paper and the process with Catherine Day.  We are really focused on doing it.</p> <p>  I have already agreed with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and we have set up a mechanism to look at this, so there is a focus on housing those with direct provision and the main responsibility would lie with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We will assist in that process very specifically with the Housing Agency.  That has been put into the White Paper.  The Housing Agency and the expertise will provide expert advise on sourcing, delivering and managing housing and accommodation.</p> <p>  Our local authorities have already quietly been doing much work in this space over recent years for those whose status has been regularised, helping them source permanent accommodation.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is engaging in that.  There will potentially be elements of change within that as to how local authorities interact with the asylum seeker process, and that has been outlined in the White Paper.</p> <p>  While I fully understand and respect the intent here, it might be premature in the process to tie this in right now.  I would be happy to come back with a detailed note in advance of the next Stage on the work we have been doing with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and on how the Housing Agency will work with the local authorities and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We know we need to provide a certain number of homes each year in this space.  We are focused on ending direct provision for those who have languished in it for far too long.  We are committed to that and the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, and I have met on this issue.  We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure we make good on the commitment in the programme for Government.  Much detailed work has been done already in this space.</p> <p>  I am happy to provide a briefing to members on this to see how we could move this on.  It is similar but not the same as the previous issue because we are well advanced on a new phase of ending direct provision and I do not want to do anything that might further complicate that matter in relation to the focus the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's Department has shown in this space.</p> <p>  I assure colleagues we are assisting in every way we can and have agreed that the Housing Agency will have a specific role with regard to sourcing, delivery and management of housing and accommodation to ensure those in indirect provision can exit from it.</p></speech>

I am not arguing that local authorities or the LDA should be providing that accommodation.  My understanding of the White Paper from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is that the outworkings of the work described by the Minister will provide a mechanism to deliver that accommodation.  The problem is that mechanism will not have any land.  The provision of land will be key.  Again, I am happy to withdraw this amendment, but I would urge the Minister to go one step further than his commitment to give us a paper.  I think a briefing note would be very useful, and we would welcome that, but the provision of land will be key to whether whatever mechanism emerges out of the White Paper is able to deliver on the very ambitious, and rightly so, timetable that is set out in that White Paper.  I am not asking the Minister to commit 100% to bringing back his own amendment.  I am asking him to consider whether to place some kind of obligation on the LDA to assist in the provision of land, where that is appropriate, in the context of the relevant agencies delivering on the human rights-compliant own-door accommodation system for asylum applicants.  I am asking him to at least consider that as an amendment.  If he decides not to do that, we can re-table these amendments on Report Stage.  </p><p> The Minister will know as well as I do that land is a key element in the delivery of this stream.  Given the volumes of land that the Minister is promising will go through the books of the LDA, giving it some role in assisting the State in making an appropriate portion of that land available for human rights-compliant own-door accommodation would be the right thing to do.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I would ask the Minister to comment on whether he will, at least, examine the possibility of a Report Stage amendment from Government on this issue.</p></speech>

More work is needed on the amendment.  As drafted, it asks that land be provided for the provision of accommodation for those from the asylum application process.  I am sure that like me Deputy &Oacute; Broin would not like to see any unintended consequences arising from the designation of land within a development for asylum seekers.  That would be very problematic and it could to lead to many other issues.  I am not raising the spectre of far right, but, unfortunately, there are some in this space who could argue that particular land is land for the asylum seekers and we are not providing homes for our people.  All of us want integrated communities.  We want developments that will be available to all of our people, whether born in Ireland or not.  Our focus is on ending the direct provision system and providing a real mechanism through which to get people into permanent accommodation.</p> <p>  I could take another look at the proposal, but the Deputy would, probably, agree that the wording of it as tabled might be, in an unintended way, problematic.  I will ensure there is a briefing on the matter for members who are interested.  I am happy to take another look at it, but I do not want to do anything that will impact on what we have already agreed with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on foot of the White Paper.  I believe we now have a plan that will deliver homes and ensure direct provision is ended by this Government, and by this Oireachtas.  The idea of designating a specific proportion of land in a Land Development Agency portfolio, or in a specific development, as land for asylum seeks would, in and of itself, be problematic.  I give a commitment that we will engage further on this aspect.  It is important.  As I mentioned in regard to the previous amendment, the Land Development Agency, when asked to perform certain functions under section 14, or requests from local authorities, would activate at that stage.  The Housing Agency is already tied into this particular process.  I will brief members further on that.  We can arrange to have a full briefing such that they are clearer on what is planned between myself and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the acting Minister for Justice, Heather Humphreys.  I appreciate Deputies' co-operation in that regard.</p></speech>

For me, amendment No. 9 is important.  There is a very unfortunate language that has become pervasive in a lot of housing policy documents.  It started many years ago in housing policy documents approved by previous Governments, but it has become a way of talking about social housing, in particular housing for working class people that, in my personal view, is inaccurate, is not backed up by evidence and is deeply patronising to the communities who live in that housing.  We often hear some people talk about large local authority housing estates as, in all circumstance, producing ghettos and being centres of crime and social alienation.  We know from very significant research from Tony Fahey and Michelle Norris and others over a decade and a half that the overwhelming majority of our local authority housing estates are really good places to live.  They have settled and sustained communities.  While there are issues in terms of under-funding of key resources, they are places where people are happy to live and want to live.  They are places in which their children want to live.  Most of us in this room who represent people living in large local authority housing estates know that people would chew off one's right and left arm to get a house in one of those estates because they are seen as vibrant communities.  </p><p>Unfortunately, when people talk about mixed tenure, there is a tendency for the thinking to be that there should not be too many working class homes in one place.  If is perfectly acceptable under existing law for a large private development to offset its Part 5 obligations to have 10% social by locating that social in another area and having 100% private housing in a development, often many hundreds of apartments or houses.  The idea that having more than 75 or 90 social houses in a particular location, in all instances, is inherently a problem is a mistake.  The research from Tony Fahey and Michelle Norris makes it clear that the issue is not tenure, it is income.  One of the reasons the majority of our local authority housing estates are great places to live is because they have great mixed income and sustainable communities.  People may all have the same tenure or they may have mixed tenure between tenant purchase and so on, but that mix of income, occupation and people makes those communities sustainable.</p><p>The language I seek to replace in this section is, therefore, problematic.  It is patronising.  Instead, we should be positive and say that the priority of the LDA or whoever is developing public housing - and the Minister will know that, in my view, it should be the local authorities but we have already had that discussion - should be "to ensure the delivery of vibrant and sustainable mixed income communities".  Tenure is a secondary issue.  It is really important that we get this language right.</p><p> For example, there are a number of mixed tenure communities that were built during the Celtic tiger era that are, unfortunately, as segregated as large monotenure estates.  Even though they appear to be mixed tenure on paper, the social housing is all in one place, affordable housing in another and higher-end private housing in a third.  Within such housing estates, therefore, the level of segregation is very significant.  As we move towards more apartment developments, the same phenomenon arises because it is financially more viable for the social housing required under Part 5 to be in a single apartment block.  I am trying to find much better wording to describe what should be a key objective of all of us who advocate for increased amounts of public housing.  The priority should be sustainable, vibrant mixed-income communities.  We should really dispense with this old, out-of-date, patronising language, which stigmatises many working-class communities very unfairly.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 10 seeks to delete references to "undue segregation" included in the Bill while No. 11 seeks to replace the term "social background" with "incomes".  I also aim to replace references to counteracting undue segregation of persons to again emphasise incomes rather than social backgrounds, which is what the Bill does.  Amendment No. 37 proposes making reference to "a broad range of incomes".</p> <p>  I will explain the thinking behind this.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  In the D&aacute;il last night, we discussed apartheid against Palestinians.  What we are talking about here is social apartheid and housing apartheid, which has always existed in the Irish housing sector but which has got considerably worse.  The prejudice against social housing and housing for working-class people has reached such a level in Government thinking that a form of social and housing apartheid has become institutionalised.  This Bill replicates that, as does the general thinking of Government and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of the provision of social housing.</p> <p>  Let me explain what I mean.  What on earth does "undue segregation" mean?  Is there a due form of segregation?  There is undue segregation, which must be avoided, but perhaps there is segregation that is legitimate and due.  It is absolutely outrageous.  There is no acceptable level of segregation at all.  Of course, the reason the Government has included "undue segregation" in the Bill is that it is aware that segregation is widespread.  </p> <p>  How does the segregation manifest?  It manifests in the Government's refusal to raise income thresholds for eligibility for social housing lists.  This refusal means that those who qualify for social housing are on ever lower incomes.  Whereas, in the past, bus workers, nurses, postal workers and bank workers could get on a social housing list, none of them can do so anymore.  They cannot afford housing on the open market but they are not eligible for social housing because the Government is using social housing to segregate people on the very lowest incomes.  This perpetuates and deepens the level of segregation which social housing traditionally avoided because it was available to people on a broad range of incomes.  People on middle and even sometimes high incomes would live alongside people on very low incomes and all were eligible for social housing.  In my view, if we want to avoid segregation and apartheid, there should be no income thresholds.  Anybody should be able to go on a social housing list.  If this is not allowed, it is implied that there is something wrong with social housing.  In much of Europe, everybody from the university professor and the doctor to the council worker, the nurse and the person who is dependent on social welfare lives in social housing.  That is how to avoid any form of segregation, not only this undue segregation.</p> <p>  The other reason the Government has used this phrase "undue segregation" is that segregation is a standard feature of the social housing component of private developments under Part 5.  In my area, there is a very big development on the former golf course in D&uacute;n Laoghaire called Honeypark and Cualanor.  How does the so-called mixed tenure which the Government says it favours to deal with so-called undue segregation manifest in this development?  All the social housing tenants are in one block and kept absolutely separate.  In many cases the actual quality of the accommodation, including the finishes and general standards, for the social housing component and the private component is different, perpetuating the apartheid.</p></speech>

The Government now envisages that certain people will be social housing tenants, certain people will have cost-rental accommodation, certain people will purchase affordable homes and certain people will be the sort of people who buy in the private market.  In other words, there is to be a sort of caste system of housing which perpetuates and institutionalises this notion of segregation rather than removing it.  The State should build housing that does not distinguish between so-called social backgrounds.  It should provide housing that is affordable based on people's incomes and which is available to people on a broad range of incomes.  That is the logic of the amendment.</p></speech>

I have a bit of housekeeping to go through and I would ask our guests to bear with me while we do that.</p> <p>  This meeting has been convened with representatives of Screen Producers Ireland and the Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group as our ninth public hearing to discuss the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting who will be joining us remotely via Microsoft Teams.  I welcome Ms Susan Kirby, CEO of Screen Producers Ireland.  With Ms Kirby is Ms Mary Callery, head of international with ShinAwil productions.  I also welcome, from the Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group, Ms Birch Hamilton, executive director, Screen Directors Guild of Ireland, Mr. Ronan McCabe, CEO, Animation Ireland, and Mr. James Hickey, producer-consultant and former CEO of Screen Ireland.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is such that I will invite witnesses to make opening statements, which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on its website following the meeting.  Before I invite them to deliver their opening statements, which are limited to three minutes for each organisation, I want to advise the witnesses of the following relating to parliamentary privilege.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if the statements of witnesses are potentially defamatory of any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and I would ask them to do so.  As our witnesses are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House or the convention centre to participate in our public meeting.  I will not permit members to attend unless they are adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask that members identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the debates office staff preparing the Official Report and to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback.  I ask that members use the raise hand button when they want to contribute.  I also ask everyone joining today's meeting to ensure all mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Kirby to make her opening statement on behalf of Screen Producers Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to appear here today to discuss the importance of the online safety and media regulation Bill to the Irish independent production sector, and wider creative sector.<br/><br/>With more than 130 company members, Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, is recognised as the voice of independent audiovisual production in Ireland.  SPI members are creative entrepreneurs who produce globally celebrated film, animation and television, creating high-value, all-island and regionally spread employment, fostering Ireland's media education ecosystem along with preserving Ireland's artistic heritage.<br/><br/>The Olsberg report of 2018 estimated the gross value added, GVA, of film, television, TV, and animation production in Ireland in 2016 at &euro;692 million, with full-time equivalent employment at in excess of 11,960 jobs.  No doubt these numbers have grown since then.<br/><br/>In this statement we want to focus on the audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive content levy provisions.  The AVMS directive now allows EU member states to place financial obligations on audiovisual media service providers such as pay TV services like Sky and streaming video on demand, SVOD, services like Netflix.  These financial obligations include levies and investment obligations.  We welcome head 76 of the proposed Bill, which introduces a levy, and head 77 of the proposed Bill, which provides for the setting up of schemes to administer the proceeds of the levy to fund film and television projects.<br/><br/>In 2019, the chair of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, said:</p> <blockquote> 	The existing regulatory structure and funding model require an overhaul.  As part of that overhaul, ways need to be found to ensure providers who take revenue from the Irish market give something back in return, in terms of appropriate content or otherwise. </blockquote> <p>Last week in this committee, the major Irish broadcasters &ndash; RT&Eacute;, Virgin Media and TG4 - all spoke in favour of bringing in the levy which we feel is important to recognise here today.<br/><br/>As we set out in our pre-legislative scrutiny submission, we believe these issues can be dealt with through the implementation of the AVMS directive without delay.  Levies at a minimum of 3% to 4% should be applied to pay TV and video on demand, VOD, services turnover and to television advertising, including opt-out advertising, on services targeting Irish audiences.  A commencement date for the levy's collection is set in the legislation.  This date should be 1 January 2023.  This should mean the revenue from the levy could be shared with Irish content makers from 2023.  The BAI should hire a specialist staff member without delay to begin work on the levy as part of its transitionary work from the BAI to the media commission and to work on the collection system for the levy and on the administration of the production fund.<br/><br/>Crucially, all applications to the fund should be done through an independent Irish production company to ensure the investment is spent on original Irish content and supports original content creation by Irish creatives.  Intellectual property, IP, ownership should be retained with the Irish producer as a condition of the fund.<br/><br/>We would ask that the committee members strongly consider including these recommendations in their report to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on the legislation.  Introducing the content levy without delay will create new funding possibilities for Irish producers to create original Irish content for Irish audiences and increase the amount of Irish stories online without any additional cost to the Exchequer.</p></speech>

She has given a very good insight.  The numbers employed in the sector are impressive and, as she said, are growing.  They have gone from strength to strength, prior to the pandemic, of course.  I am sure that will inspire a lot of questions from the members.</p><p>I now invite Ms Hamilton to address the committee on behalf of the Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group and I understand that Mr. McCabe will be playing a video shortly afterwards for the members following that statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Birch Hamilton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman. The Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group welcomes the opportunity to talk with this joint committee with specific reference to the proposed levy scheme in the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill.  We believe this levy could seed a national media creative content fund that will stimulate the audiovisual creative industry, allowing the Irish production sector to compete internationally by bringing stories to a global audience and in so doing, creating and sustaining additional high quality jobs and cultural capital.</p> <p>  Audiences are consuming high-quality, high-budget content, with exponential growth in the subscription video on-demand sector with Netflix and Disney Plus the market leaders. The budgets required to compete with this content are impossible for the indigenous sector to fund on its own.  A content fund can become an enabler of this quality programming, as Irish producers will be in a stronger position if they approach the international market with a greater proportion of the budget already in place.  This would transform the industry here in Ireland and, combined with existing funds, for example, from broadcasters and section 481, would deliver the additional funding required to compete at the highest level.</p> <p>  The national media creative content fund would support Irish independent producers to develop and produce a range of high-end Irish programming aimed at both the domestic and the international markets.  Recent examples would be Golden Globe and BAFTA-nominated "Normal People" and Golden Globe, BAFTA and Academy Award-nominated animated film "Wolfwalkers".  These projects used Irish production companies, directors, composers, crew, writers and post- production facilities.  Such projects supported by this content fund would be authentic and relevant to Ireland, but with international appeal.</p> <p>  It would be mandatory that all qualifying projects be owned or co-owned by Irish independent producers.  This will retain the intellectual property, IP, with the producers, allowing them to build a catalogue and a set of assets and thus to expand.  The downstream benefits of retaining IP cannot be overstated and it is how the Scandinavians and the Israelis have transformed their creative industries.</p> <p>  There would be an emphasis on projects which will be carried on online platforms and players, as well as on more traditional broadcasting channels.  This will allow this content to be consumed by younger audiences.  A national media creative content fund would allow the Irish creative sector to develop its own distinctive brand based on what Ireland is best known for, namely, its people, its warmth and its scenery.  There are huge downstream benefits to the Irish economy from an Irish audiovisual brand.  Visiting the locations of "Game of Thrones" is the single biggest tourist attraction in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  We recommend that thought be given to establishing the national media creative content fund on the west coast of Ireland.  The benefits of the fund are as follows: it preserves Irish storytelling against huge international competition; it encourages Irish and international broadcasters and platforms to fund Irish productions; with Irish independent producers retaining IP, and it allows these companies and the industry to grow and prosper.  Ireland has a unique position as an English-speaking country within the EU and can produce series in English that are far more attractive internationally.  In addition, high-end, high-budget programming employs large numbers of highly skilled people on both a full-time and contract basis; and there are also very significant downstream benefits in tourism from Irish-based series.</p> <p>  The national content creative sector believes that there is significant untapped potential within Ireland and we look forward to engaging with the committee to discuss these issues further.  </p> <p>  As I have already said, we have a video which we have made especially for all members here today, which explains this far better by utilising the craft of our writers, directors, and composers.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

I am not a tech person and I will go through my checklist to ensure that we do this properly.  I will now play our video, &quot;The Power of a Levy&quot;:</p> <blockquote> 	  	<i>This is a story of a small island on the edge of Europe whose writers, directors, producers, animators and composers have claimed their place on the global stage with the calibre of their output, world-class content that stands beside any international offering but this powerhouse of creativity and output is under threat.  The dominance of global streamers and pay TV services is putting our audiovisual sector in an extremely vulnerable position.  The speed of the growth is jaw dropping.</i><br /><br /><i>The numbers make for uncomfortable reading.  The stakes could not be higher.  Our ability to tell our own stories is being eroded, download by download.  The EU recognises the urgent need to address this situation and has responded with the audiovisual media services directive, which allows member states to introduce financial obligations on global media service providers.  We are advocating a content levy on streamers and pay-TV services targeting Irish audiences to generate a fund ring-fenced to produce new Irish stories rooted in our culture.  This is not a consumer tax.  It is a give-back from global streamers and our European partners have already paved the way.</i><br /><br /><i>Even a small percentage of a levy could generate &euro;20 million a year unlocking an additional &euro;100 million in production funding per annum.  That is &euro;500 million over the next five years.  That would mean more jobs, more tourism and more great Irish stories going out into the world but we must act now.  Ireland needs to implement this content levy as a matter of urgency or the sequel to this story will not be written by us.</i>  </blockquote> <p>I trust that the video played okay.</p></speech>

I am a great believer in a picture painting a thousand words and that has been achieved so eloquently and in such a sophisticated way in his video.  I thank him for going to the trouble of making it for our committee and presenting it to us.</p> <p>  Without further ado I will move to our members, who will have a slightly longer time of five minutes for both questions and answers.  I ask members to be mindful of that and to give our guests as much opportunity to respond to the questions as possible.  I ask members therefore to keep their questions as precise as possible because this is an area of great importance for the industry.  I call Senator Cassells first to speak and he has five minutes.</p></speech>

A number of years ago when I was a member of Meath County Council, in another life, a Labour Party councillor called Eoin Holmes, a very creative and eccentric man, was involved in television production.  One day I asked him about the costs of producing a particular piece of drama.  When he set out the costs, it blew my mind.  Could Ms Kirby give us a synopsis of the costs involved in producing a piece of original Irish television drama?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Kirby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#C00200"><p>It is an excellent observation.  The cost of production is key to the business model.  It is a very competitive space.  As a producer on the ground, my colleague Mary Callery might like to speak on this point.  It is a bit difficult.  It is a bit like asking what the cost of a car is.  It depends on the car one wants to buy.  It depends on the production one wants to do.  Is it an episodic piece, a feature film or a short?  Suffice to say that the funding requirement or model for funding the costs is essentially a patchwork sought by the producer as part of the production.  One is essentially drawing funding from numerous sources.  In Ireland, one is looking at the well-known sources of funding, which would include RT&Eacute;, the major broadcasters, Screen Ireland, section 481, the Arts Council in some cases, the BAI and in some cases, the western region audiovisual producers, WRAP, fund for regional funding.  Essentially, the role of the producer is to source all of that funding.  The costs have grown exponentially in the past number of years based on inflation.  In this period, we also have seen significant costs related to Covid.  To maintain quality and fair remuneration as part of the overall equation, the costs are very significant when it comes to competing globally.  The role of the producer involves drawing down the funding.  Of relevance to the conversation today is the fact that we see the content levy as an additionality to that patchwork of funding.  We see the content levy as an opportunity to introduce new funding to the sector.  Ms Hamilton referred to "Normal People".  Obviously, we celebrate "Normal People", the producers of which, Element Pictures, are members of Screen Producers Ireland.  We are very proud of that but there are "Normal People"-type projects that did not get made and that all of our producers have sitting ready to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#C00300"><p>Could I jump in on that point?  On the other pieces that did not get made, I was trying to ascertain how much in general a programme costs.  Looking at the income streams since I had that conversation with Eoin Holmes over the past ten years or so, we have seen it fall from a high of &euro;80 million in 2007, in terms of what RT&Eacute; would have spent on independent production, to around &euro;40 million.  Looking at one of its last reports, it stated that approximately 732 pitches for television programmes from independent production companies were made to it, of which 121 were made.  This equated to 428 hours of television.  How many good-quality pieces do not make it to the screen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.743" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Kirby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#C00400"><p>It is really significant.  The Senator's points illustrate clearly where the challenge is.  The level of funding available to broadcasters in the sector has decreased from a high of &euro;80 million to a &euro;40 million investment in the sector through RT&Eacute; and Circuit 24 from TG4.  At the same time, their traditional advertising revenues are declining and streaming video on demand's share of the market is increasing exponentially.  What we require is increased funding in the sector overall.  We see the content fund as part of the infrastructure of that funding.  We estimate that on the basis of 3% of a content levy, which is not at the more ambitious scale that it could be, it could inject &euro;23 million back into the sector and about &euro;100 million in overall economic return.  Obviously, that would grow over the course of the years, so we would advocate strongly for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.744" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#C00500"><p>Could I redirect the question about the levy to Ms Hamilton?  Before I finish, I wish to give a shout out to the independent radio productions as well, because they receive significantly less than independent television productions and there have been some significant ones such as Second Captains and items like that on Radio 1.  Ms Kirby said that a minimum of 3% could yield &euro;23 million.  The video we just saw mentioned &euro;20 million.  In her submission, I think Ms Hamilton said that 2% could raise &euro;10 million.  What is the methodology behind this?  Is there a firm amount that is agreed upon by the sector?  If so, how did it come up with that particular figure because, as has been said, it is trying to introduce a new strand of funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.745" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Birch Hamilton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#C00600"><p>I think my colleague Mr. Hickey could speak to that.  We have done various amounts of levels that it could be, based on what they are doing in Europe, so it is a 2%, 3% or 4% levy.  It depends on the percentage we pick.  It is what Ms Kirby noted earlier, which is it would create a &euro;20 million fund that would unlock a further &euro;100 million in total.  This could then create productions from there.</p></speech>

Depending on the point at which the levy is set, these paid-for services may pass it on, as we can see.  Every year, people get an email around Christmas telling them the cost of their subscription has increased.  Have the witnesses seen examples of that in other countries where this levy has been introduced?</p></speech>

It is becoming a very competitive market for streamers and platforms because far more of them are appearing so becoming competitive and remaining competitive are very important.  We do not believe it is possible for subscription video on-demand, SVOD, or transactional video on-demand, TVOD, services to increase their subscription models.  They could try to pass it on to consumers but as it is a very competitive market at present, we do not believe that is viable.</p></speech>

How important is it to incorporate retention of IP into the proposed national creative content fund and the Bill?  Do the witnesses think the promotion of indigenous media benefits the tourist industry?  Could they give me an estimate of the amount of funding the proposed entity would involve?  What would be the real benefit of this for Irish citizens?  How important is it to have a regionally-based film-making focus outside of Dublin?  How is this working at present?</p></speech>

One generates one's own ideas and if one owns them, that translates into revenue.  If one takes one's project abroad, one generates revenue from one's own IP, which is then reinvested in the development of the next idea and the next project.</p><p>That secures jobs and creates new jobs.  Animation alone employs more than 2,000 people.  Those jobs tend to be long term and in many cases are permanent.  </p><p> On the point regarding the regional side of things, animation is spread across the country.  There are big animation hubs in Galway and Kilkenny, as well as in Dublin.  </p><p> The retention of intellectual property, IP, creates a virtuous circle, rather than Irish companies becoming glorified outsourcing companies for international players.  It also leaves a legacy of training, upskilling and career development.  How it works in the context of the content levy is that the more finance an Irish studio can attach to a project before bringing it to the international market, the greater the amount of rights the Irish company can retain.  It gives a bigger negotiating strength if one is bringing more funding to a project.  This fund would help to achieve that.</p><p> As regards the tourism side, my colleagues in the live action sector can address it more than I can, but just as it relates to animation, we are currently considering devising an immersive experience for tourists to capitalise on the popularity of Irish animation.  That would showcase animation and Ireland.</p></speech>

As regards Disney and the other players, it just means that if one gets one's ideas financed, one can pitch it to those companies.  However, I do not know whether they would invest.</p></speech>

First, I fully endorse the point made by Mr. McCabe in respect of IP.  It is the cornerstone of the development of a sustainable, globally competitive sector.  I fully support his points in that regard.</p> <p>  From my point of view and that of Screen Producers Ireland, we have seen brought to life the real impact that place making and destination building can have in connection with productions such as "Game of Thrones" and "Star Wars" filmed in Ireland.  Someone mentioned to me that one cannot get a booking in Lahinch on the back of "Smother" having recently been broadcast.  I believe one cannot get a booking anywhere in Ireland and more power to them.  I know the committee sits over some very challenged sectors in terms of tourism, the arts, culture, entertainment and hospitality.  This absolutely has the ability to place-make for Ireland.  It is being done all over the world and it is something in respect of which Ireland can really compete.  There is already a lot of work happening between the tourism agencies and the kind of outward-facing agencies for Ireland Inc.  We advocate very strongly that this has a wider impact than the immediate economic impact, but also what one sees on the ground when the big productions arrive.  Members will have heard of the Disney production being filmed in Enniskerry.  The film crew are buying coffee from the coffee shops there and staying in local hotels.  There is an immediate impact on the ground.  It is a very substantial tool for Ireland Inc. to promote itself. </p> <p>  In terms of the Irish citizen, it is so important that we see stories that represent ourselves and that we see ourselves on screen.  We certainly have the artistic and creative talent to create those stories, direct them and compose the music to attach to the story.  We strongly believe it is a part of our citizenship and nationhood to have the ability to tell those stories.  The Deputy made a very good point regarding access.  Key to this is that the independent Irish producer would be the one drawing down the funding or accessing the content levy.  To bypass them would be inconceivable because that would mean there would be direct access to the fund and then the smaller producers and other producers would not benefit.  Realistically, that is a protection for the sector.</p></speech>

It is worth saying that indigenous television drama, even at the modest level, costs in the region of &euro;1 million per episode to make.  That gives a sense of the scale of money that is needed in terms of investment.  That is why a fund of &euro;23 million is really important in terms of what can be done.  Television drama costs a minimum of &euro;1 million per full episode.  A modest feature film will cost between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;2 million.  That is the scale of expenditure involved.  These productions create significant jobs and significant numbers of people are employed on them.  That is how it works.</p> <p>  On the question regarding calculating the levy and from where the figures are coming, Indecon produced a detailed report, which was commissioned by the committee on which I have the honour to serve and on behalf of which Ms Hamilton, Mr. McCabe and I are speaking.  The report gives a detailed presentation of the alternatives and how much a levy would create.  It provides alternatives based on, for example, a levy of 2%, 3% or 4%.  The various figures are given in detail by Indecon and I hope all members of the committee have that report which shows exactly how much money can be raised.</p></speech>

Obviously, the whole point of this is around the levy and so on.  Last week, Sky Ireland told the committee the levy would be a tax on consumers.  I think it is fairly obvious from what the witnesses have said today that it would simply claw back some of the revenue that leaves here for these international offices.  I suppose the representatives of Sky Ireland were kind of implying that it is like double taxation.  My understanding is that all three domestic broadcasters support the levy.  Do any of the witnesses wish to comment on that?  When language such as double taxation and so on starts being used, the narrative becomes very confusing and messy.  I think I am correct in my understanding that the money is simply going somewhere else and, as the witnesses have clearly outlined, we are not availing of it.  Do the witnesses wish to respond to those remarks that it is double taxation or that we do not need to tax them because they are already paying it elsewhere?</p></speech>

It is an excellent question.  In my opening statement, I referred to the fact that we were obviously really pleased to see there is real commonality in the sector around the importance of the levy, its introduction being expedited and that it has ambition.  I refer to some of the features we have mentioned around IP and the Irish producer having access to the fund.  It is important to note that TG4, Virgin Media and RT&Eacute; are of one mind on this.  I appreciate the opportunity to say that in my opinion, the picture painted last week by Sky Ireland is plainly wrong.  This is not a tax on either the service or the consumer; it is a give-back - I think that is the language used in the video - that may bring that to life.  A 3% levy on the &euro;600 million revenue gathered by Sky Ireland would deliver &euro;18 million to the sector.  It is really about Ireland aligning itself with what is happening in the EU.  This is already in place in various territories in the EU.  It is about significant revenues that are being generated leaving the country but which could support Irish creative talent and storytelling.  What is currently happening is that creative talents and storytellers are leaving the country.  It is important that we correct the point made by Sky Ireland that it is double taxation and I appreciate the opportunity to do so,.</p><p>It is not.  It is a giveback for the very substantial business Sky is deriving from this market.  Mr. Hickey referenced something which is also important, namely the Indecon report, which maybe pointed towards this being very complex to bring in, as a further barrier to its introduction.  I make the point that the Indecon report actually gives a number of options for how this could be introduced.  Essentially, we are looking for a roadmap to that introduction from the Department.  That might include what the percentage is, which body will introduce it and what the timeframe for its introduction is.  To reiterate the point I made in my opening statement, we would like to see some urgency around its introduction and suggest it should happen on 1 January 2023.</p></speech>

Thus it is really a small amount.  On the words "giveback" or "tax", a levy may be a very abstract concept to the people in this group but it is a very real thing for our directors.  I want to get across to the committee today that this actually a loss because we have given members scenarios of what could be gained here, that is to say, &euro;100 million, but every day, every week and every month that goes by, that is a loss to our industry.  It is jobs on which our directors, writer and composers cannot work.</p> <p>  It is disappointing, as someone who works with directors, to get on Zoom calls lately and see everybody in Los Angeles, Vancouver and London.  I am happy for them because they are working on really substantial projects, like Marvel films, Disney films and BBC dramas, but I would really love to see Irish talent being able to work in their own country and to harness the raw talent of our creative industry to work in Ireland.  One particular director I can think of is doing huge global shows with budgets of &euro;6 million per episode.  He has four children.  It would be wonderful if he could tuck his children into bed at night because he has been working all over the world for the last five years.  We are not being smart about investing in our own talent.  We have the talent and we have the capacity to really build this industry, so it is just very disappointing to be on the front line and see the talent leaving.  What happens when we invest in our writers and directors?  We have "Normal People".  Applications to Trinity go up for the first time.  There is a boom in applications to Trinity.  Sales of the chain worn by Connell, the lead character in "Normal People", exploded.  There is a renewal of interest in Ireland again.  Kim Kardashian is watching "Normal People".  That is what happens when we invest in the talent.  We are not doing that right now so there is a real tangible loss every day that goes by, which we feel on the front line.  We need significant investment.</p> <p>  We were talking about costs there.  Everybody was talking a couple of years ago about "Game of Thrones" being $15 million for one episode and that broke the barrier.  Now Disney Plus is averaging $25 million per episode of the "The Mandalorian".  That $25 million is approximately more than the entire budget for Screen Ireland.  Thus, we are not investing in any meaningful way.  We are not at the table in any meaningful way to be able to compete globally and to be able to engage and co-produce.</p></speech>

I turn first to the Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group.  How do the representatives envision the creative content fund operating?  Would it do so in much the same way as the sound and vision fund, or what would be the main difference between it and the fund the group is putting forward?</p> <p>  The importance of producers retaining intellectual property rights over their work was discussed.  Can the group comment on what the current norms are in the industry and how it would like to see them change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.764" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#E00400"><p>I can reply to the Deputy about the intellectual property side of things.  It is very simple.  The amount of investment an Irish producer brings to the international market dictates the extent to which such rights can be retained.  It tends to be correlated - if a person brings 10% of the funding, he or she ends up owning 10% of the rights.  As Ms Hamilton was saying, we are not at the table financially because we do not have the amounts of money some of the international players have.  The more money we bring as producers, the greater our bargaining power and leverage and the more money we can then attach to our projects and the greater the rights we can retain.  Again, if we bring 20% or 30% from Ireland, we can retain 20% or 30% of the intellectual property.  As I have said, that becomes a virtuous circle and flows back into the next development and the next production, retains jobs, creates new ones and brings new people into the industry so it is a win-win.  At the moment there obviously is investment from Ireland into projects but it is at a fairly modest level so any additional funding we can attract makes our job easier, as producers.  Irish producers have a great track record in going overseas.  Those in animation are actually particularly good at it because it is impossible to fund an animation solely from Ireland because they are so expensive.  It was asked earlier how much an animation costs.  Animation costs, at the bare minimum, around &euro;8,000 per minute.  That would be the floor for a basic 2D animation for television.  As Ms Kirby said, after that it is like asking how long is a piece of string: the sky is the limit.  This is a creative industry but unfortunately, a lot of the time it comes down to finance.  I hope that answers Deputy Munster's question.</p></speech>

On the creative content fund, how would it operate in comparison to the sound and vision fund?  Does anyone have any ideas on that?  What would be the main differences between it and the creative content fund the Joint Creative Audiovisual Sectoral Group is proposing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.766" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Hickey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#E00600"><p>First of all, what is very important and what we would like to see the fund doing in the future is something the sound and vision fund does not do, namely, fund the development of projects.  The research and development investment into creative projects is a hugely important part of what will help the independent production sector in Ireland to develop projects.  It must be a new, separate and different fund.  The sound and vision fund is very much linked to broadcasters and to the television licence fee because it is a percentage of that fee.  This new fund should reflect where the contributions are coming from, which would largely be from the pay TV and subscription services like Sky and Netflix.  We want an ambitious fund for higher-end, high quality projects which require the kind of investment that needs to be made.  We would also like to see the fund providing development funding for these projects because it is the most difficult money to find.  This creates a degree of equality and participation for everybody because it gives independent producers access to money to develop their projects so they can then bring them to the market in a condition which is much more responsive to the way in which international and national funding can provide them with money.</p> <p>  Mention has also been made of making this fund a regional one, a fund based in the regions, as a way of recognising the importance of keeping investment in the regions as a way of moving this forward as well.</p><p>They are two suggestions in which I think this group is interested in stating should be part of a new high-quality, highly content-focused fund for the future of Irish creative talent.</p></speech>

Is that what Mr. Hickey is primarily hoping for?</p></speech>

That is greatly important.  As the Deputy can imagine, money for research and development is very important to the development of high-quality creative projects.  We know it is also very important in the pharmaceutical sector.  To provide development funding to Irish independent producers to enable them to develop projects for both Irish and international consumption, is the way in which we can grow the industry.  We can provide the creative talent &ndash; writers, directors, cast, crew &ndash; all the people working on projects the opportunity to work on a consistent and regular basis.  If we can get the investment, the work and investment can take place in Ireland.  Therefore, it would be Irish people working and telling their own stories.  I hope that is what we can achieve with this new fund.</p></speech>

Its submission called for an amendment to the Broadcasting Act 2009.  They are seeking the statutory spend of RT&Eacute; and the independent production sector to be increased from &euro;40 million to &euro;80 million.  Can its representatives talk me through that figure, how they came to it and why they think it is necessary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.771" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Kirby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#F00500"><p>I fully endorse Mr. Hickey&rsquo;s comments, and I will make one addition to them.  Screen Producers Ireland also supports a number of our producers.  We have a regional base of producers all over Ireland.  We have Irish language producing companies and we understand that circa 20% of the fund will be allocated to Irish language production.  I wanted to add that additional point to Mr. Hickey&rsquo;s previous point.</p> <p>  We have advocated for the increase in investment into the Irish independent production sector through RT&Eacute;.  Our producer members are the largest creative partner to RT&Eacute;.  I refer to my colleague who is present, Ms Callery, from Shinawill.  Some of the top shows which are seen in people&rsquo;s homes are produced by Screen Producers Ireland members.  We have come from the level, which one of the members who spoke previously mentioned, of &euro;80 million in 2008, down to &euro;40 million now.  We are advocating to have that reinstated.</p> <p>  TG4 is a publisher-broadcaster.  What that means is that, barring news and current affairs, its entire catalogue of content is produced from the Irish independent production sector.  We are advocating that there should be an increase of funding for TG4.  That funding is part of the ecology.  It supports regional based producers, creating content and telling Irish stories, in this case, tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge in the Irish language.  In the case of RT&Eacute;, we are advocating that the independent producing sector can produce significant content of quality at a more cost-competitive price point than can RT&Eacute;.  We are advocating that as its main creative partner, as RT&Eacute; itself calls us, an increased investment in this sector is just course-correcting us.  It would bring us back to the previous levels.</p> <p>  It may speak to the point I made earlier about the concept of how one creates a project and a production and the costs attached to that.  It is a patchwork and a portfolio of funding.  At the moment, the domestic market does not have the bandwidth to invest adequately to allow producers to create.  Not necessarily &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, of which we obviously are very proud, but what about the projects like "Normal People" that are sitting on the desks of independent producers in Ireland currently and are not being made?  We cannot compete.  Ms Hamilton made the point very well earlier that we cannot compete globally because domestically, the funding is nowhere near where it should be.</p> <p>  We are fully advocating that we want to see a reinstatement of RT&Eacute; funding.  I might ask Ms Callery from Shinawill to speak on that from a practical point of view from her experience in producing and with the RT&Eacute; fund.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.772" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Callery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#F00600"><p>It is very interesting and is a case in point that the Deputy raised the issue of increasing the RT&Eacute; amount being spent on the independent sector.  At a previous point in my career, ten or 15 years ago, I was a commissioning editor for drama in RT&Eacute;.  In that time, we commissioned projects like &ldquo;The Clinic&rdquo;, &ldquo;Love is the Drug&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bachelors Walk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Paths to Freedom&rdquo; and shortly thereafter, series like &ldquo;Love/Hate&rdquo;, all of which have become household names.  The reality of the funding model of those projects at that time was that the domestic market was able to provide up 40% or 50% of the funding required.  Therefore, one was able to rely on that small amount of tax incentive and some overseas sales to make the projects.  Over those ten to 15 years, as the sector has developed its skill set and more creative voices have come in through working on domestically produced and incoming projects, we have seen the independent sector grow in terms of its skill space and the quality of work it produces.  We are very proud of that but at the same time, there has been a decrease in the amount of moneys available from the domestic market.</p> <p>  We are at a point where there is a significant demand for content.  Irish content travels very well.  International distributors and international broadcasters want to see Irish content because we have a reputation as a nation of storytellers and producers of high-quality content.  However, because of the failure of the domestic market part of our funding patchwork, the patchwork to which Ms Kirby has referred, we are inevitably left with a gap of about 20%, having raised the maximum amount of funding available on the international market.  That 20% deficit is made up of shrinking investment from the broadcasters and the lack of other supports available. Although we are appreciative and cognisant of the essential component of funding from Screen Ireland and the BAI provide us, as well as the access to section 481.  On that point I would say that there is a tax incentive available in every territory, in every part of the world.  It is a component of every financing plan, whether that is an Irish, English, American or a French production, so that has to be discounted.  We just do not have enough money in the market.</p> <p>  This levy, along with the restoration of the level of independent production investment from broadcasters in Ireland, will result in more Irish content for Irish audiences.  That is the bottom line.  We make projects that travel globally.  We are very lucky as an island nation we have always been outward looking.  Irish storytelling has always been a local story for a global audience.  That is very true now.  Unless we can secure the potion of the financing we need from our domestic market, as Mr. McCabe refereed to earlier, we end up selling off bits of the idea in order to raise the money to make it.  It is like selling off the family silver.  The Irish creators who come up with the idea, who have the imagination and creativity to pull it all together, basically end up owning very little of it because they have to sell it off to get the money in to make it.  That is the dysfunction of the market here.  That is why restoring RT&Eacute; and the broadcaster investment in independent production, and introducing this levy, will go a significant way in filling that deficit.  The net result will be more Irish production for Irish audiences, which is what we as the independent sector in Ireland want.  That is our mission: to have more Irish content for Irish audiences.</p></speech>

I have read them.  I was in the D&aacute;il Chamber, so I was not able to hear them.  I have enjoyed the conversation very much.</p><p> I want to go on to quite a broad question.  I would like to hear a contribution from all of the witnesses in regard to potential economic benefits, given the Screen Producers Ireland opening statement refers to 11,960 jobs.  I want to hear about the potential for growth.  Let us say the content fund goes towards industry.  Has any work been carried out or published showing the economic benefits in terms of direct employment and indirect employment?  For example, to come back to the favourite example of the moment, we see what &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo; has done for the north west in terms of creating tourism.  I am here in west Cork and, locally, I can think of &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo;, which was shot here and which gave a huge tourism boost.  I would like to hear about this aspect.  If we want buy-in, not everybody is interested in the direct creative work that the Irish industry produces, although it is incredible, but some people will get behind this if they can see overall economic benefits.</p><p> I agree 100% with the contribution of Ms Callery in terms of our reputation for the quality of work we produce.  We need only think of the writers, the screenwriters, the directors and even the composers we have, and some of our composers are internationally renowned for composing scores.  Considering the size of the nation, we are batting way above the average and it is something we can all be very proud of.  Some of the content put together by independent artists is mind-blowing in terms of the style, the imagery and the story art, so I fully agree with Ms Callery on that.  It is something we need to convince everybody about, and it is easy enough to do that.</p><p> Overall, my question pertains to the direct and indirect economic benefits of this industry to Ireland.  That should convince the rest of the nation we need to make sure the industry gets a fair share of that content fund.</p></speech>

In regard to the content levy, we have suggested that a levy of &euro;20 million could free up the sum of around &euro;100 million.  We published a PwC report on section 481 earlier this year and it refers to a multiplier of about four to one, so for every &euro;1 spent, the Government got that back four times.  That follows on from the Olsberg-SPI report from four or five years ago.  There is definitely a multiplier effect.  While I cannot give the Deputy specific figures with regard to jobs, I know the economic modelling shows a very positive benefit to Ireland Inc. when we spend money on the creative industries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Susan Kirby" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#G00300"><p>I think Mr. McCabe is referring to the Indecon report in which we outlined in quite a bit of detail the potential economic benefits in terms of direct and indirect benefits and wider induced benefits.  We would all be familiar with the direct benefits.  In speaking to the indirect benefits, we have mentioned the idea of screen tourism.  We are looking at cast and crew and the very substantial direct investment in high-quality employment the Deputy would have seen in west Cork.  We are then looking at the spend those companies make so that, down the line, there is a continued investment.  I worked on bringing Mark Hamill here with the &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; project.  Something which struck me at the time was that it was incalculable, if that is the word, for Tourism Ireland to measure the impact online of the engagement and amplification of that.  In fact, I will change the word and say the potential benefit we could be looking at from screen tourism is immeasurable.  Across the whole life cycle of benefit, it is an economic benefit, it is a social benefit because we see ourselves on screen, and it is a cultural benefit because our entire creative ecosystem is supported by this.</p> <p>  While I agree with the Deputy that not everybody will respond to the cultural creative argument, there is a rock solid economic argument which, in the simplest form and at the least ambitious end of this, is that a 3% levy would deliver in the region of &euro;20 million, which would then have a net economic benefit of &euro;100 million.  In our minds, this is something we need to get moving on to realise the benefit.</p></speech>

The bit that was shot in west Cork was shot at a place called Brow Head.  No one can identify for sure whether or not it actually appears in the movie, yet Mark Hamill drank in the local pub and it is now an absolutely thriving tourist destination for that reason alone.

Looking through the submissions, there seems to be an awful lot of money involved.  I see these levies have already been implemented in countries like France, Germany, Spain, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.  Will the witnesses explain the difference between the levies in those countries and the levies the witnesses are talking about being introduced here?  With regard to the joint creative audiovisual group, I see the witnesses are looking for speedy introduction of the levies.  I welcome this because the more we can get Irish television and film producers and creators involved, the better, given the number of jobs involved.  Will the witnesses provide information on the way they calculate the proposed levies and funding?  Where do they get their figures and percentages?  Will they explain exactly what they mean by that?</p> <p>  The witnesses also mentioned tourism opportunities.  This is creating more jobs and I am sure it is about more than just a cup of tea.  I and my family are big fans of &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, and when we watch it, we always talk about Sligo and Trinity College.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the opportunities for tourism?</p> <p>  How would Screen Producers Ireland like to see the funding structure operate?  There are two different types of levy here at the moment.  I would like to know what kind of evidence and information they can give me.  Where did Screen Producers Ireland get the percentages?  People want to know.  The submissions refer to millions of euro.  It is important we follow suit with other European countries, and it is very important the money is well spent.  I am a big fan of Irish productions and of keeping it local.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

Based on a relatively modest level of expenditure, something like &euro;24 million in value was created in the region with 1,100 full-time equivalent jobs created.  The WRAP fund is operating in the west of the Shannon region.  It had total funding of &euro;2.5 million, so &euro;24 million of production activity in the area is a great contribution back to that region and shows how successfully regional investment can work.</p> <p>  I will come back to the Deputy on what other European Union countries are doing in this regard.</p><p>France is always mentioned as the first example.  It has a 5.14% levy.  These levies are all imposed on the turnover of the service providers in the country concerned.  Therefore, in France, that 5.14% levy is imposed on all those services delivering content to French audiences and it is based on what those audiences pay in subscriptions to the companies providing those services.  Germany has a levy of 1.8% to 2.5%, Poland has a 1.5% levy, and other countries are considering such levies now because much of this activity in the implementation of the AVMS directive is ongoing.</p><p> It is also important to mention that countries are introducing not only levies but also investment obligations.  It is not a case of a contribution being made to a fund which is then administered but where companies are required to invest in particular types of production.  Those investment obligations are applied throughout Europe.  France, for example, has an investment obligation associated with subscription services such as Netflix of 20% to 35% of turnover in France.  Everybody can see the figures involved are substantial.  France is undoubtedly a leader in this area and it is undertaking these measures in an extraordinarily effective way.  Investment obligations in other countries, though, include a 12.5% investment obligation in Italy and a 5% investment obligation in Spain, while Portugal has opted for a levy of 1% and an investment obligation of 4%.  An investment obligation rate of 6% is being discussed in the Netherlands.</p><p> Complications accompanying investment obligations include the necessity to define the kind of programming in which people will invest money.  The challenge, of course, in Ireland, because we speak English, is that the investment obligation is harder to define.  Hence, an effort is being made now to suggest that a levy is the best Irish approach in respect of the mutual options allowed in the AVMS directive.  We are allowed to do two things under the provisions of the directive, namely, impose levies and specify investment obligations, and each member state is working out the best way to do that.  It is hoped, with what we are proposing, that we are at the beginning of ensuring we at least introduce a levy based on turnover.  To answer the question posed by Deputy Fitzpatrick, there are examples to be found throughout Europe of how this is being done and the Indecon report commissioned by this group gives a very detailed and exact explanation of how much is to be levied, what is being levied and how the whole process should be operated.</p></speech>

The committee members will be aware of this themselves.  New platforms, such as Disney Plus, are popping up and the box office is changing radically as a result.  Things are progressing and now is the time for this levy to be introduced, and not in one, two or five years.  Silos and structures are being formed now, and we will miss out if we do not get into this area during this pivotal moment in the transformation of the digital landscape.  Companies will invest instead in infrastructure in other places in Europe, as they are doing already.  Ireland will miss out as a result.  We must, therefore, be at the table in this regard and be able to offer something to draw in the extra investment required for us to have a robust future.  If we do not do that, I fear we could miss out on the developments under way in this area and the future of our entire broadcasting and audiovisual industry could be at risk.  That is why we are recommending the implementation of this levy immediately.</p></speech>

I will put a blunt question to Ms Kirby concerning the model for RT&Eacute;.  Is it her view that RT&Eacute; should become a publisher-broadcaster in the same format as TG4?  If that is her view, does she believe that would result in a greater number of independent productions and help to enhance the sector?</p> <p>  Turning to Mr. Hickey, that last discussion was interesting regarding the question of a content levy versus direct investment.  An interesting paper published by researchers from the Free University of Brussels, or Vrije Universiteit Brussel, in December 2018 compared the models in different countries.  It found that using the content levy was a more direct way of ensuring the funding was provided.  Putting it bluntly, is there a specific territory we should look at in the European Union as a general model, whether in respect of a content levy or direct investment?</p> <p>  More generally, I support the content levy.  It will be essential and we as a committee have an obligation to help support and develop the sector in Ireland.  We must have a vibrant content creation sector for all the reasons we have been talking about, including economically and helping with tourism.  It is going to be essential.  We must ensure Irish stories are told and we must also look at this sector as an export industry with international distribution potential.  Any of the witnesses might address my next point, which concerns how and in what way we use the content levy.  There has been, rightly, talk of using such a levy for development funding.  Should some of the levy be used for specific requirements in training and upskilling people in the industry?  Should we use some of the resources gained from the levy to attract some large international productions and the associated inward investment?  If we are going to go after productions like "Game of Thrones" and "Star Wars", for example, should we use some of the levy to allow us to be able to attract them?</p> <p>  I was conscious of some of the discussion regarding a contestable fund.  Should we be dividing the levy in two ways?  One strand could be concerned with those big international productions that may be able to operate on the international stage, while the other strand could be aimed at those smaller productions which may not necessarily travel.  When the money starts to come in, how will we see the content levy be divided?  I will start with those questions and points.</p></speech>

He posed a question to me directly, so I will kick off.  I reiterate that RT&Eacute; itself would acknowledge the Irish independent production sector is its largest creative partner.  Our position regarding advocating for an increase in its ability to invest in the sector recognises that fact.  Screen Producers Ireland has also made submissions to the Future of Media Commission, and we were clear we would support RT&Eacute; moving towards a publisher-broadcaster model, which is, effectively, the model in place for TG4, as this committee is aware.  Adopting a publisher-broadcaster model will mean everything outside of news, sports and current affairs would be created in the independent sector.  We see such a situation as being mutually beneficial, although it is not without its challenges.  Something similar can be achieved by RT&Eacute; increasing its fundamental investment in the sector from &euro;40 million to &euro;80 million.  As I have said before, and I think Ms Callery also pointed out, it would essentially just be reinstating the previous funding level.</p><p>RT&Eacute; was sitting at the same table here as well.  RT&Eacute; is part of the group.  It also realises that it has decreased funding available.  It supports the idea that this fund would add additionality in any sense; whatever its design, it will complement existing funding.  It would be additional to the existing infrastructure and complementary to it.  It would essentially address in some small way the declining broadcasters' funding.  We would advocate for an increase in funding to RT&Eacute;.  We have previously stated that there is an option for it to explore a move towards the publisher-broadcaster model.  We would advocate that the fund would have additionality.</p><p> To speak to Senator Malcolm Byrne's later points, it is important that this is a contestable fund.  Key to this is that applications for the fund can be made only by independent producers.  That would be Mr. McCabe and Irish Screen Editors, ISE, members being able to apply for the fund.  As I understand it, the fund has to support genres that are eligible under the EU cinema communication of 2013, which would point us towards TV drama, film, animation and documentaries.  Within that, there will naturally be projects that are successful and which will support inbound and smaller indigenous productions.  We would support that.</p><p> Another important element, which every witness has spoken about, is that I understand it will be brought in via the media commission.  In our submission, we also pointed towards the fact that there needs to be a focus in the BAI on how this will be delivered and there needs to be significant industry consultation on the final design or mechanism of delivery of the fund.</p><p> There is also a couple of wider points around the AVMS directive, which would speak to prominence and the idea of the percentage of European work.  In both of those cases we would also advocate that whatever the system is, there needs to be real transparency that the work that we produce, that is made by the creative talent here, is essentially visible and accessible on the platforms because it is written into the content levy that they must benefit from it.  If they benefit from it, we then want them to give us fair prominence for the work.  Those are the types of elements that need to be considered in designing how the fund would be used and how it would be delivered into the market.</p></speech>

First, because that allows for the opportunity of investment and development, which we think is really important in relation to the future fund.</p> <p>  The second reason is that for an investment obligation, the kind of work that must be produced has to be defined.  For most European countries that is a very straightforward thing to be able to do.  In other words, in France one says the works must be in French.  In Portugal one says they must be in Portuguese.  In Spain one says it must be in Castilian, Catalan or Basque.  In Italy it must be Italian.  For us, that presents a challenge.  I know we have Irish language projects and I very much support that some of this fund at least would go to Irish language films.  There are wonderful films like "Arracht" which competed at the highest level at the Oscars.  It was shot in Connemara in the west.  All of these things point to a levy being the better option in Ireland because it is so difficult to define what projects qualify under an investment obligation.</p> <p>  The other difficulty with investment obligations is that under an investment obligation an organisation can simply invest in one big project and that is it.  For example, if a company had an investment obligation of, let us say, &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million it could spend it on one large TV drama, and that does not give the broad spectrum of independent producers an opportunity in a contestable fund to be able to get funding for a multiplicity of projects.

I thank Senator Byrne for his questions.  As Senator Warfield is not available I will make a contribution.  I thank the witnesses so much for covering this entire sector, up, down, inside and round about again.  We very much appreciate that.  From my knowledge of my colleagues, the witnesses are speaking to the converted.  Many of us have been watching TV over the past year or so.  We watched "Normal People" and "Smother".  It creates great excitement in any household to see Irish films and drama appearing on our screens.  The witnesses are correct: people are really hungry for that.  The Irish population, including all the new Irish living in this country, are really enthusiastic about it.  It is a storytelling exercise, as well as everything else.</p> <p>  Many of the questions I wanted to ask have been asked but I am curious about screen tourism, which Ms Kirby referred to.  It is an aspect of tourism I had not considered as a category.  She is correct: we know that Lahinch has been swamped with visitors and people have been going to Sligo after "Normal People".  Enniskerry has seen a surge in visitors since "Disenchanted" started filming.  People have been calling for coffee or a newspaper just to see the village who might not have had a reason to visit there before.  Has F&aacute;ilte Ireland interacted with the witnesses about screen tourism?  Has there been any formal mapping out of the island in that regard?  I see it as something that has great potential.  It identifies hidden gems around this island that people would not ordinarily visit.  Perhaps Ms Kirby could comment a little further on that.</p> <p>  Mr. Hickey covered the investment obligations extensively.  For the witnesses, the levy is the key and that is what will bring the investments here.  It is disappointing that domestic funding has decreased over the years.  Mr. Hickey made the point very well that this is about correcting it rather than any big source of investment.  It is realigning what should always have been there in terms of domestic funding.  The witnesses are speaking to the converted.</p> <p>  I would like to hear a bit more from Ms Callery.  She made some very interesting comments on the dysfunction of the market and she also made a point about the levy.</p> <p>  I will go to Ms Kirby first to talk about screen tourism and if there has been any engagement with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on it.</p></speech>

In terms of screen tourism, a huge amount of work is happening in the space of what I consider Ireland's outward-facing agencies.  They are collaborating together not just on screen tourism but across the whole gamut.  There is a huge amount of collaboration and work happening between Tourism Ireland, Screen Ireland, the IDA and Creative Ireland looking at how we create a sense of destination and place and leverage screen tourism.</p><p>Ireland is familiar with screen tourism from "The Quiet Man" to more contemporary expressions of Ireland, but there is still a significant potential.  We are keenly aware of the fact that this committee covers some of the most challenging briefs in terms of the areas most impacted by Covid, for example, tourism.  There is considerable potential to create and leverage tourism, including screen tourism.  We are open to collaborating.  I have had initial conversations with Tourism Ireland about how to achieve that and how Screen Producers Ireland might feed into it.  Tourism Ireland has released some funding for producing content.  While it has not been able to go out into the market and promote, it can promote Ireland through storytelling and documentaries-as a means of placeholding so that, when people can travel again, Ireland is on their bucket lists for the following reasons: the beautiful scenery, the wonderful people, the urban and the rural.  Tourism Ireland has done a super job of that despite the challenges of Covid over the past year.</p><p> That notwithstanding, I maintain that there is a large untapped potential.  I am keen to see not just large inward-bound productions being the expression of Ireland.  Instead, this fund could support Irish storytelling in the creative sector that is meaningful and attracts domestic and international tourists to the country.  It is as much about saying that we must put Lahinch or Sligo on the list for ourselves as for international travellers, although I recognise that the return of international travel will be far more significant for the economy.</p><p> Considerable work has been done, but as the saying goes, "Lots done, more to do".  That is my analysis of where we stand with screen tourism.  The committee could consider how to leverage screen tourism further to the benefit of our indigenous sector, as well as of the wider economy.  Does that answer the Chair's question?</p></speech>

The impact of that on such a tiny village was phenomenal.  We would like to see more of the same.  There is no reason a screen tourism mapping of the island could not continue for many years after such an event.  Perhaps that is another trick we are missing out on where tourism is concerned.</p> <p>  Does Ms Callery wish to comment on the dysfunction of the market and the domestic funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.794" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Callery" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#K00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity.  As Mr. Hickey mentioned, asking how much it costs to produce an hour of television drama is like asking how long a piece of string is because many different factors influence the answer, for example, whether the drama is period, genre or whatever.  It is safe to say that we in the independent sector are mostly working in the budgetary space of &euro;1 million to &euro;2.5 million per hour.</p> <p>  Let us forget about the exact figure, though.  As a rule of thumb, when one is looking for finance for one's series from the patchwork of funding sources, as Ms Kirby called it - it is like trying to put together a large jigsaw puzzle - one typically expects to raise 30% to 35% on the international market through pre-sales or distribution advances against future sales.  One would also access 20% to 25% of the funding through tax incentives, wherever they were.  On top of that, one would need to bring to the table approximately 40% from the domestic territory.  Ten or 15 years ago, Irish broadcasters were making commissioning decisions that involved investments of 30% to 40%, or even more, into a project.  Today, one is lucky if one gets 10% to 15%, or 20% at a maximum.  As Irish producers, we are always left with a 20% gap.  This is after one has maximised the value of one's product on the international market.  I reiterate there is considerable demand for Irish products internationally.  We are out there every day trying to sell those products.  There is that level of demand because we are recognised as a nation of storytellers and producers of high-quality content, whatever the genre or medium.</p> <p>  This situation is frustrating.  Perhaps members can sense the frustration in my voice.  Day after day, people manage to raise their 80%, but the Irish market, which should ideally be providing 40%, is typically providing just 20%.  Where do people get the extra 20%?  Returning to the point that Mr. McCabe made about the importance of intellectual property, people sell off a bit of their projects to try to get money from some other source or they end up trying to close a small gap through bank deficit financing, which adds more cost to the budget, or deferring fees, meaning that they will not get paid for their work.  There is considerable frustration.</p> <p>  The net effect of all of this is that we have very good projects for which we know there is demand domestically and internationally, yet we cannot get over the final hurdle and get them made.  The Irish projects do not get made and Irish audiences do not get to see stories that reflect them back to themselves in the way they should.  Thankfully, there are projects that get made.  "Normal People" was mentioned, but we could also include "Smother", "Dead Still", "The South Westerlies" and "The Young Offenders".  There are many projects for which we know there is a demand, and when they get made, they are always hits, but there are many more shows like "Smother", "Normal People" and "The Young Offenders" that are waiting to be made.  I could pull a few out of my bottom drawer if the committee likes.  Shows are ready to go but we cannot get them made, and that is a shame.</p> <p>  It is not just about providing work and an outlet for the Irish creative voice in this moment, or about feeding current audience demand.  There is a large development process.  I am beginning to sound like the elder lemon here, but I will hark back to my past.  The first season of "The Clinic", which I believe was made in 2005, was the first screen role for a young aspiring teenage actor by the name of Saoirse Ronan.  Amy Huberman went through "The Clinic", as did Chris O'Dowd, Domhnall Gleeson and Robert Sheehan.  They all had early parts in it.  We have world class directors directing big international and high-budget series, for example, Neasa Hardiman, Dearbhla Walsh and Ciaran Donnelly.  They all started out on domestic Irish productions.  There is a future that is at risk in this regard.  We are not providing the outlet or platform for young creative talent to get a start.  This additional funding in the domestic marketplace would make a significant difference.  We would have more projects, outlets and potential to bring on the next generation of directors, performers and writers.</p> <p>  As Ms Hamilton mentioned, this train has already left the station.  The demand is out there now, as is the opportunity.  We need to address the deficit now, and this levy would be a significant step towards doing so.  That is why we are so passionate about it.</p></speech>

We can all hear that in her voice.  Speaking as someone who worked in the arts, it is frustrating to think of the creatives who have to go through the tedious job of putting applications together for the patchwork of funding and convincing people to give them money.  That happens even before they enter the real creative process of making a production.  It must be frustrating.  Ms Callery has made the case well.</p></speech>

One of the big success stories for Ireland has been animation.  I refer to the success of Cartoon Saloon with "Wolfwalkers", "The Secret of Kells" and "Song of the Sea".  There are many other companies in this space as well.  Will Mr. McCabe outline how the funding model might be able to help the animation sector?  People listening in today might recall there was some criticism in the D&aacute;il of the film industry without an opportunity for it to respond.  It is important to stress this is a good sector in which to work and a good career path, particularly in light of the new film agreements that SPI has negotiated.  I would like to give Ms Kirby an opportunity to respond to some of the criticisms.</p><p> In regard to drama, Ms Callery spoke about "The Clinic".  Many of us here today would love to see a good political drama created at some stage, although perhaps as politicians we create enough drama here.  An Irish political drama is much needed.</p></speech>

SPI members are committed to quality employment provision.  SPI advocated for a Workplace Relations Commission audit, which was conducted in 2019 and found overall a very clean bill of health in the sector.  It is a buoyant sector.  One of the great pleasures of my job is meeting with and speaking to SPI producer members and noting their pride in the work they produce, the importance they place on their employment and how they give back.</p> <p>  In regard to the audit, it is important to note four key areas were highlighted that we as a sector are addressing with the support of the key agencies responsible, those are, Screen Ireland, Screen Skills Ireland and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  One of the four areas alluded to is good industrial relations.  As Senator Byrne mentioned, SPI recently signed a shooting crew agreement and work on a number of other agreements is under way.  We are committed to having industry stability through these agreements.  Sectoral development was also pointed to.  Senator Byrne mentioned a commitment to training and sectoral development.  I do not think anyone would argue with that.  We see that as core to our strategic development, both as SPI and as the sector.  We are working with Screen Ireland and other partners on competency frameworks and skills traineeships as part of section 481 compliance.  These are independently adjudicated upon by the Department.  The producer companies are compliant.</p> <p>  The guild structures were identified as an important part of the sector.  Again, we have detailed engagement with the guild structures.  They were part of the consultation process for the agreement with the shooting crew and they are involved in some of the upcoming agreements.  The final area pointed to was HR practice.  As SPI and as industry partners, we work closely.  Mr. McCabe will, I am sure, say similar in terms of development of the animation sector and reporting on how we can continue to develop the sectors in all areas of the life cycle in terms of entry and access, which includes everything from diversity and inclusion to encouraging people such that they see the sector as an attractive career path within which there is career progression, while also future-proofing the sector because this is a sector that has enormous potential and ambition to grow.  We want to be future-proofed by way of the skill set that is there.</p> <p>  The fantastic talent and quality that comes from partnership is testament to the inward investment that happens in the sector.  For clarity, there is no agreement currently between Irish Equity and Screen Producers Ireland for film.  There was an agreement which was negotiated in good faith and signed by us, but due to internal governance issues for Irish Equity, the agreement was deemed by it to be invalid.  We understand Irish Equity has taken steps to address the issues and we would welcome and are committed to re-engagement.  Our members operate all of the agreements with ICTU-affiliated unions.  As I said in my first point, this is a sector with enormous potential, quality and talent.  It is strategically important and business critical to us as SPI and to our members that sectoral development is at the forefront of our future.  I hope I have answered the Senator's question.</p></speech>

It is an important sector.  I would like to hear from Mr. McCabe how, especially with the content levy, we might be able to help the animation sector.</p></speech>

Earlier, he and the Chairperson mentioned screen tourism.  I would not like Ms Callery to feel like the elder lemon.  I am very proud of my baby photograph on the set of "Ryan's Daughter" with Robert Mitchum and Sarah Miles, which has pride of place on our mantlepiece.</p> <p>  On animation, it is an expensive business, a time-consuming business and an international business that is reliant on co-production.  In terms of this fund, if it is contestable, Animation Ireland is confident its projects would apply and be successful.  Any additional funding is welcome.  We have not asked for the funding to be specific in terms of any particular genre relating to animation because, as I said, it is an expensive business, whether it is television animation or animation feature films.  We are pretty much all on the same page.  When it comes to the fund, the live and animation sectors are on the same page.  I do not think there is any fear of us being overlooked, but I appreciate the Senator's concern.</p></speech>

Should the content levy be used to attract international productions?  If not, what mechanisms could best be used in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.805" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan McCabe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#L00900"><p>On attracting international funding, it comes back again to the IP question.  If Irish producers are taking a budget to market and, in terms of the finance, we have a greater percentage of the finance already raised in Ireland, that strengthens our position from a negotiating point of view and it strengthens us in terms of the rights we hold.  The amounts available are quite modest.  Anything that helps increase funding and brings us to market with greater funding will be positive for Irish producers in animation and live action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.806" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Hickey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2021052700002#L01100"><p>I agree with Mr. McCabe.  On Senator Byrne's question, this fund should be devoted to indigenous production.  Development funding can be provided to Irish independent producers and we can hold on to the intellectual property rights.  There would not normally be any involvement with inward production in terms of intellectual property rights being assigned to the local producer.  Section 481 has been very successful in terms of attracting inward production.  It is important the fund is used to encourage indigenous production, which would include feature films, television drama and animation and documentaries, all of which would tell Irish stories for Irish and international audiences.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Kirby, Ms Hamilton, Ms Callery, Mr. McCabe and Mr. Hickey for their insightful, helpful and enthusiastic presentations to the committee.  We really appreciate it and it will be very helpful to us as we continue our pre-legislative scrutiny.  I also thank my colleagues for their insightful engagement with our guests.</p> <p>  We will adjourn until 11.30 a.m. Wednesday, 2 June, for a private meeting on MS Teams followed by a meeting in public session, to take place virtually at 12.30 p.m. in committee room 1, with representatives from the Irish Heart Foundation, the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, Epilepsy Ireland and Dr. Norah Campbell, associate professor in marketing at Trinity Business School, to continue the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the online safety and media regulation Bill.</p></speech>
