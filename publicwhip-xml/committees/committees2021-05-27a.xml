    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#A00400"><p>No apologies have been received.  I understand that Deputy Devlin may be late joining us due to prior commitments.</p> <p>  I will begin by welcoming all to this online meeting.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, the clerk, support staff and I are in the committee room.  We are joined in person by Deputy Sherlock as he cannot attend remotely due to technical issues.  You are all very welcome.  The remaining members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings Members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the convention centre.  I will ask members to confirm their location before contributing to ensure they are adhering to the constitutional requirement.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee and is attending remotely.  Today we engage with officials from the Department of Transport to examine the 2019 Appropriation Accounts, specifically Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport, and expenditure related to the following matters: BusConnects, the driver licence and testing process, the western rail corridor and the search and rescue contract.  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from the Department of Transport: Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary general, aviation sector; Mr. Garret Doocey, principal officer, sustainable mobility investment division; Mr. Dominic Mullaney, principal officer, regional and local roads division; Mr. Eugene Clonan, principal officer and acting director, the Irish Coast Guard; and Mr. Ray O'Leary, assistant secretary general, land transport.  We are joined remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House by Ms Niamh Callaghan, principal officer in the transport, tourism and sport Vote section at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  When we begin to engage, I will ask members and witnesses to mute themselves when not contributing so we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.  Before we start, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  However, a number of today's witnesses are giving evidence remotely, from a place outside the precincts of the Parliament, and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist the broadcasting and debates services, I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not directed to a specific witness, I ask each witness to state his or her name when first contributing.  The fact that we are doing this virtually means proceedings will not always run as smoothly as at a meeting at which we are physically present, so I ask members and witnesses for their co-operation in that regard.</p> <p>  I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#A00500"><p>The appropriation account for Vote 31 - Transport, Tourism and Sport records gross expenditure of &euro;2.3 billion in 2019.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes of widely varying value.</p> <p>  The bulk of the expenditure in 2019 was under programme B, for land transport.  Expenditure on that programme amounted to &euro;1.9 billion and accounted for 83% of gross voted expenditure.  This comprised mainly investment in roads and road safety and regulation and current and capital spending on public transport.  I note that spending allocated to the land transport programme has increased substantially since 2019.  As recorded in the Revised Estimates Volume, the allocation for the programme for 2021 totals &euro;3.3 billion.  It may accordingly be time for the Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to consider splitting the programme.  This would allow the Department to provide more useful detail about the various spending lines, in both the Estimates and future appropriation accounts.</p> <p>  The largest of the other expenditure programmes for Vote 31 in 2019 related to programme E, tourism services, and programme D, sport and recreation services.  Expenditure on these programmes in 2019 amounted to &euro;158 million and &euro;106 million, respectively.  Both these programmes were allocated to the new Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media following the formation of the Government in mid-2020.</p> <p>  Programme C relates to maritime transport and safety.  Expenditure on this programme amounted to &euro;96 million in 2019.  This mainly comprised expenditure on the Irish Coast Guard service, which operationally is part of the Department.  It includes recurrent expenditure on the long-term contract with a private sector supplier for provision of a helicopter search and rescue service.  Expenditure under the contract in 2019 is not itemised in the appropriation account, but members may wish to note that the estimated residual financial commitment under the contract is shown in note 2.8.  This amounted to &euro;155 million at end 2019.</p> <p>  Programme A relates to civil aviation services.  Expenditure under the programme totalled &euro;34.8 million in 2019, including financial support for regional airports amounting to &euro;21.8 million.</p> <p>  Receipts into Vote 31 as appropriations-in-aid are relatively small.</p> <p>  The surplus on the Vote for 2019 was &euro;69.8 million.  With agreement from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;48.6 million in unspent capital allocations was carried over for spending in 2020.  The remainder of the surplus, &euro;21.2 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer at the year end.</p> <p>  I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account.</p> <p>  The Department has an oversight role in respect of a substantial number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include bodies substantially funded from Vote 31 such as Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the National Transport Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety; bodies that are funded mainly through charges and levies such as the Road Safety Authority, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Commission for Railway Regulation; and transport-related commercial State bodies such as the CI&Eacute; Group, Dublin Airport Authority, the Irish Aviation Authority and a number of port companies.</p><p>A list of bodies under the aegis of the Department can be seen in the appendix to the appropriation account.</p><p> Members may wish to note that, in the statement on internal financial control, the Accounting Officer discloses that shortcomings were identified in the process for procurement of vehicles for the Irish Coast Guard motor fleet.  Having reviewed the circumstances of the procurement as part of the audit of the 2019 appropriation account, I decided to examine the matter further from a value for money perspective.  We are in the process of finalising a special report about this procurement, which will be presented in due course.</p></speech>

While you have your opening statement prepared, in fairness to you, I would ask that you keep within the five-minute limit, please.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00300"><p>In 2019, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport was one of the largest capital spending Departments.  Its net allocation in the Revised Estimates for 2019 was &euro;2.327 billion, comprising &euro;1.85 billion capital and &euro;742 million current expenditure.  The allocation of capital was in line with the Department&rsquo;s core remit in investing in transport infrastructure and assets.  Some 92% of the capital allocation was allocated to the land transport programme.  Our allocation and expenditure in 2019 was closely aligned with our statement of strategy for 2016 to 2019.</p> <p>  The high-level goal for aviation in 2019 was to maximise air transport connectivity with a safe, sustainable and competitive transport network and services.  We invested &euro;26.188 million in current expenditure and &euro;10.579 million in capital in the aviation sector.  This financed public service obligations for the regional airports as well as capital investment.  The Exchequer is not responsible for financing major projects at State airports.  However, two of the biggest projects ongoing in the State during 2019 were financed by the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, namely the north runway and the visual control centre, both at Dublin Airport.</p> <p>  For land investment, our goal was to service the needs of society and the economy through safe, sustainable and competitive transport networks and services.  In this regard, we are responsible for the corporate governance of the two lead planning and investment agencies, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority, NTA.  It is worth noting that over 75% of all inland passenger kilometres travelled in Ireland in 2019 were by private car.  Public service obligation, PSO, funded public transport providers carried more than 295 million passengers.  Of public transport passenger journeys, bus journeys accounted for more than two-thirds.  Until the time Covid-19 struck, there was a steady upward trend in growth in all public transport services, with near-term forecasts suggesting limitations in public transport capacity were being reached, particularly at peak times.</p> <p>  The Department has clearly defined investment programmes in all the main modes of transport - active travel, heavy rail, light rail, bus, and road - geared towards supporting the ambitions of the national planning framework, the programme for Government, and the climate action plan.  The Government has also signalled its ambition to provide competitive fares and socially beneficial services for consumers through a system of public service obligations.  In 2019, PSO payments accounted for 38.3% of the Department&rsquo;s gross current expenditure allocation.  Protection of these vital services during the Covid-19 pandemic required an additional emergency allocation of &euro;460 million for PSO services in 2020, on top of the annual core allocation of approximately &euro;300 million.  A further emergency allocation of &euro;370 million is required this year.</p> <p>  Under the maritime programme, our goal was to facilitate safe and sustainable maritime transport and the delivery of emergency management services.  Of the &euro;103.068 million allocated to the maritime sector, &euro;77.235 million supported Coast Guard services, &euro;62.515 million of which was invested in the Coast Guard search and rescue service delivered by CHC Ireland DAC.  A budget allocation of &euro;5.659 million was also invested by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who are responsible for maintaining marine navigation systems in Irish waters.</p> <p>  Turning to sport, our goal in 2019 was to contribute to a healthy and more active society by promoting sports participation, supporting high performance and the provision of sport facilities.  A total of &euro;126.162 million in Exchequer funding was provided to sport that year.  The bulk of the funds were allocated to the sports grants scheme and to Sport Ireland.</p> <p>  On tourism, we focused on supporting the industry to grow in a sustainable way.  The vast bulk of Exchequer funds were disbursed directly to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and to Tourism Ireland, which has responsibility for promoting tourism on an all-island basis.  Some &euro;175.655 million was allocated for tourism investment.  Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the marketing and product development funds managed by the two agencies accounted for over 91% of the budget allocation.</p> <p>  Projects under our remit will be key to improving citizens&rsquo; quality of life.  We all want less congestion, cleaner air and pleasant journeys.  We also want to play our climate part and improve our economy&rsquo;s productive capacity.  As we progress towards the tendering and construction phases of major infrastructure projects, we must be mindful of the reasons major projects overrun on cost, but also, if the right projects are successfully planned and delivered, of the significant benefits that will accrue.  I am confident that, as a Department, we are taking an effective governance approach which emphasises responsible and prudent management of public funds and that we will see the benefits of careful planning and investment starting to emerge over the coming years.</p> <p>  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s remarks regarding it potentially being time for the Department to consider splitting the programme.  That is something we will take up with our colleagues at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

Deputy Dillon has 15 minutes.  The second speaker is Deputy Sherlock, who has ten minutes.  All other speakers have five minutes.  As time is limited, I will keep members to that time and will try to allow for a second round of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00500"><p>I welcome our witnesses here today.  I acknowledge their work done during the pandemic to keep their Department functional.  As time is limited, I will jump straight in.  My first question is for Mr. Spratt regarding the national development plan, which is being revamped and is due for publication in July.  I would like to get Mr. Spratt's thoughts on whether priority should be given to balanced regional development in the building of infrastructure, be it rail, road, regional airports, ports, or whatever.  Given that the west and north west was downgraded by the European Union from a developed region to a region in transition last year, and in this case there is urgent need for positive discrimination into the future, what is Mr. Spratt's assessment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00600"><p>We are engaging with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the national development plan.  We have our own sectoral strategy which is called the national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI.  That sets out a number of priorities for us, and balanced regional development is one of them.  We also have other priorities and none of them are ranked, so they are equal priorities.  They are decarbonisation, protection and renewal, urban mobility of people and goods, movement of people and goods in the regions, and regional connectivity.</p> <p>  We also have a number of hierarchies which guide us on how we should invest.  Those hierarchies are modal and investment.  From a modal perspective, we try to prioritise active travel before we move to public transport, and before we move to private car.  From an investment perspective, we try first to maintain, then optimise, then improve, and only following this only will we get into new investment.  Having said that, balanced regional development is very important.  It is one of the priorities and one of the things we have uppermost in our minds as we engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the review of the national development plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1601" speakername="Alan Dillon" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#B00700"><p>I thank Mr. Spratt for that.  Coming from a rural constituency and representing people in Mayo, it is concerning that a report commissioned by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly, Region in Transition - the Way Forward, found that there is a startling level of inequality in investment across key areas, one being infrastructure and transport.  Certainly, a failure to address these critical investment shortfalls means there will be a two-speed economy developed in Ireland, with one being on the east coast and the other being left behind on the west coast.</p> <p>  Looking at the appropriation accounts, making provisions for the regional airport programme is crucially important for my constituency and for Knock Airport.</p><p>I want to get an understanding of the expenditure in 2019.  It was increased to &euro;21.8 million to maintain and improve air access to the regions.  How was the amount calculated and determined per airport?  Can we be provided with a breakdown of the expenditure in subheading A3? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#C00200"><p>If I point to the total capital provision over the five years, 2015 to 2019, Knock had &euro;14,751,520 in capital funding.  On top of that, there was current funding of &euro;8.441 million over 2015 to 2020.  It is a fairly significant amount over five years.</p> <p>  The national aviation policy recognises the role of smaller airports in supporting regional development and commits to supporting them to make a sustainable contribution to their respective local economies and communities through the regional airports programme.  The 2019 outturn for Knock was &euro;9.48 million.  I will refer to some of the investments we made.  The grant aid total at Knock of &euro;27 million was provided under the regional airports programme to support essential safety and security-related projects and activities at the three regional airports, Donegal, Knock and Kerry, over 2018 to 2020.  The larger of the capital projects recently funded through the regional airports programme include the following at Knock Airport: &euro;207,000 provided for a medical fitness facility for fire crew project in 2018 and around &euro;526,000 for a whole baggage screening upgrade project in 2018, and &euro;850,000 in 2019.  Exchequer funding of around &euro;1.173 million was given to a runway overlay project; &euro;6.6 million and &euro;550,000 were paid during 2018, 2019 and 2020.  For 2019 the figure for the overlay project was &euro;6.6 million.  I hope that answers the question.</p></speech>

Given the impact of Covid-19 has been enormous, what supports has the Department offered during the pandemic?  Has it assessed the impact on each of the regional airports?  It is hugely important that they continue to be supported.  As what level has the Department engaged with Knock on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#C00400"><p>There are a number of things that we can do for airports, as well as ferry ports and airlines around Covid.  The first thing the Government did was provide horizontal supports which help employees in the airports and ferry ports.  There were three things we were very focused on during the pandemic.  We needed to keep the airports open, we also needed to engage with our colleagues across Government on the restrictions to ensure the impact on airports and ferry ports was fully understood.  We did that with our colleagues in the Department of Health and through the Department of the Taoiseach as well.  The third thing will be incentives in due course, once the restrictions are eased, and what levels of incentives we need to ensure the airlines come into those airports.</p></speech>

The construction cost of some 500 m of this tunnel is estimated at &euro;650 million, three times what the western rail corridor will cost for 52 km.  What are Mr. Spratt's thoughts?</p></speech>

We do have instructions to deliver as set out in the programme for Government.  We know we have to improve public transport provision, not only in Dublin city but all cities and all regional and rural areas.  It is hugely important that we give the consideration required to all the projects at the outset.  While it might look like a huge amount on a relatively small piece of connectivity we believe once we go through the public spending code and cost benefit analyses, we will get to a point where we can decide whether it is good value for money.  Those figures are being spoken about by third parties but we have not got to the point where those costs and benefits have been assessed.  We do not have that level of detail.  There is a public spending code which we have to go through which we will do.</p></speech>

When we see projects that cost billions of euro compared to what we are looking for in the west, it leads us to question the Department's priorities.  It is difficult for us to accept some consultants' reports discussing the economic feasibility of a project against what is determined by officials in the Department.  There is frustration out there.</p> <p>  I will briefly touch on the Coast Guard.  I come from a constituency where it has units in Westport, Achill, Killala and Ballyglass.  They are a hugely important part of coastal areas, with volunteers providing an important service.  There was an underspend in Coast Guard purchases and upgrades in 2019.  Why was that and what was the reason for the delay?  What, if any, impact was there on services by not having this equipment?  </p></speech>

The Coast Guard has Westport, Achill and Ballyglass and another 44 stations around the coast.  We started from a very low base.  We inherited the Coast Guard stations going back to 1993, which are mostly the old rocket houses, which were basically garages fit for a horse and cart and some equipment.  Since then we invested an awful lot of money and brought them up to scratch.  We have a building programme with the OPW.  The priority in the building programme is Greystones, followed by Westport -----</p></speech>

We have a budget available, we are going through the planning process with Greystones, Westport and Killmore Quay and to a lesser extent in Cleggan.  The OPW getting planning permissions and going to tender has been delayed because of Covid.  The delays account for some of the underspend.</p> <p>  We hope to turn the sod at Greystones later this year and we hope to award the contract for the tender at the end of this year for Westport.

More priority needs to be given to the upgrading of facilities in many of these areas which are crying out for better training centres and facilities to provide their services.  We have seen a tremendous effort in Blacksod following the Rescue R116 incident.  It is imperative that we respond to all of these people in a way that ensures that their value is fully recognised.  That is the response from the constituents that I talk to in these areas.  Westport and Ballyglass need a certain focus and this could be expedited as we move forward with the capital programme.</p></speech>

We have a building programme.  There are 11 buildings on the list and we have 44.  We normally get a new building across the line every two to three years.  It started approximately ten years ago.  We have a methodology and are going through the scope.  Where we do not have adequate resources, which are some of the rocket houses, including the house in Cleggan, we have put in temporary facilities.  If we cannot get the temporary facilities in due to the leasing of land or whatever, we have to make arrangements with local hotels for such facilities, where they can do their training.  That is what we are trying to do and I assure the Deputy that we are very much on top of the building programme and in touch with our volunteers on the coast.  After all, these are the people who risk their lives and we support them with training.</p></speech>

I welcome the officials.  I will focus on programme B, land transport, which is 80% of the overall gross expenditure for 2019.  I also acknowledge that the 2021 total is &euro;3.3 billion.  Arising from land transport, there is the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  The Secretary General will be aware that there is a serious backlog in driver theory testing and driver testing.  Approximately 100,000 people are waiting for driver theory testing and the number is similar for the other test.</p> <p>  Today's issue is the relationship between the Department of Transport and the RSA in working through the backlog of lists.  I wish to explore further that relationship in how resources are deployed by the Department to the RSA.  The reason I am asking specifically about the RSA is that notwithstanding the positive engagement that I have had with the agency on driver theory testing and driver test backlogs, the announcement in the past number of days of an interim solution to be provided by moving driver theory testing online did not get off to a great start because the number of people who will be tested under that online system will be 4,000.  </p> <p>  There are also further inherent issues then as to how the technology is deployed.  Why, for instance, are only 4,000 people being tested online with this new interim solution?  How is the Department resourcing that?  What is the nature of the relationship of the RSA with the Department to ensure that we move from 4,000 being tested up to the full cohort and backlog being tested, which is the full 100,000 plus of people who are waiting for tests?  </p> <p>  What are the technological issues arising from this interim solution where we are being told that to apply for the online driving test someone has to have a Windows 8 personal computer, PC, or above and that those using a phone, tablet or Mac computer will be excluded, as will those using android or iOS?  Applicants must also be able to use Google Chrome and the minimum speed has to be 5 Mbps.  </p> <p>  I want to explore with the Department its relationship with the RSA on the basis that it is a key Department in getting Ireland moving again in a post Covid-19 society.  If we are to get people off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other Department of Social Protection payments to enable them to move, we need driver theory and driver testing to be fit for purpose.  What is Mr. Spratt's current appraisal on when the Department expects that full cohort of people to be tested and what resources are being deployed by his Department to ensure that the RSA is fully resourced so that people can get back on the road?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.36" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#D00600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  There are a number of questions and I will do my best to answer as many as I can.  I may in due course call on my colleague, Mr O&rsquo;Leary, who heads up our roads and related matters division.</p> <p>  First, there is a significant backlog in the number of tests as a result of Covid-19.  That is something that we want to tackle as quickly as we possibly can.  Our colleagues at the RSA were looking at an additional 80 contract testers to be hired.  It is also looking at permission to retain or rehire 36 testers which the authority previously had or may have on its books at the moment, but wants to ensure that it has the full 36.</p> <p>  Initially, we gave approval for those 36 to be retained or rehired and for an additional 40.  However, given that the pandemic has lasted longer than we had anticipated when we first decided on this, the management board just on this past Tuesday took a decision to provide the additional 40.  Now, instead of there being an additional 40, there will now be an additional 80 testers.  The first tranche of 40 are in training at the moment and will be testing through their training in June and July.  The second tranche of 40, once we have settled everything and have crossed the t's and dotted the i's with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, will be taken from the panel we have in place as we do not have to go through a recruitment process, and provided that we get that sanction, we will be able to put those in place reasonably quickly.  That will give us additional testing capacity.      </p> <p>  The RSA is also working on the setting up of additional centres.  We are hoping that we will be able to move through the backlog reasonably quickly.  That should make a good and decent dent in the testing backlog.</p> <p>  As to the theory testing, I agree with the Deputy that in this day and age people want to access public services on all platforms and want user-friendly services to be provided very quickly.  I was disappointed when I read reports on the online theory test being confined to certain technologies and operating systems.  That is something that I am just hearing about in the past number of days and is something that I want to engage on with the RSA.  If it is the case that this needs additional help from us, that is certainly something that we will be willing to consider.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, I have a very good personal relationship with the RSA as I believe has the Department.  I meet with the chief executive of all of the agencies at least twice a year with nothing on the agenda.  I also meet with them from time to time when needs arise.  We have a good relationship but are very conscious of the need, to use the Deputy&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo; to get Ireland moving again&rdquo; to ensure that people can get back to work, education  and can go about their business as usual.  In rural Ireland, in particular, that means that people must be able to drive their cars.  We are very conscious of the need to get going on all of this.</p><p>We will leave no stone unturned to make sure we get the backlog cleared as quickly as possible.  I commit to taking up the matters the Deputy raised with the chief executive before the close of business tomorrow.</p></speech>

The 100,000 people waiting for the driver theory test and the 100,000 who are waiting for the full test may take some comfort from those words.  For the cohort who are waiting on the driver theory test, the technology needs to be user-friendly and fit for purpose and there should be protocols put in place in terms of the use of the technology, in that when camera technology is being used, assurances are given to the person who is being tested that any data collected is collected in a safe and appropriate way.  That is important for people who have decided to put trust in the system.</p> <p>  If the RSA can reach a target of 50,000 per month, the lists will be got through within a short space of time.  I welcome the statement by the Secretary General on providing us with an update and commitments in respect of close of business tomorrow.  It is important we ensure we can get people moving again.  So many people are reliant on this.  It is an important service for everybody in this country.</p></speech>

On B6 in the Vote, the smarter travel carbon reduction, particularly as it relates to small public service vehicles, SPSVs, there was an &euro;8.9 million budgeted amount and a &euro;5.6 million outturn.  Will Mr. Spratt talk through the reasons for that shortfall?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#E00400"><p>I mention the electrification of small public service vehicles, such as the fleets and taxis.  We have a national electric SPSV grant scheme.  It was established in 2018 by the then Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to support the electrification of taxi, hackney and limousine fleets.  The scheme initially provided grants of up to &euro;7,000 for battery electric vehicles, BEVs, and up to &euro;3,500 for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, PHEVs.  To encourage greater take-up, the grant levels were increased in 2020 to &euro;10,000 and &euro;5,000 for BEVs and PHEVs, respectively.  Between 2018 and 2020, this initiative supported the registration of 101 electric SPSVs through grants of &euro;627,000.</p> <p>  In addition, &euro;1.5 million was allocated in 2020, to support a small public service vehicle recharging network scheme, which will see the installation of SPSV dedicated electric vehicle, EV, fast charging infrastructure at transport hubs around the country.  Chargers were installed at Dublin and Cork airports as well as Heuston Station, Cork Kent Station and Limerick Colbert Station.</p> <p>  While we in the Department have just taken responsibility for EVs, we have been supporting the EV tolling incentive scheme since 2018, as I am sure the Deputy knows.  The EV tolling incentive scheme provides discounts of approximately 50% on tolls for electric cars and vans.  To date, registered vehicles have made more than 1.3 million discounted journeys and can claim up to &euro;1,000 back every year.</p></speech>

We all want to see a decarbonisation of the fleet, but there are clearly issues other than the grants which are being made available, especially to taxi drivers.  As Mr. Spratt knows, taxi drivers will gather in Merrion Square today and many will say, in terms the end-of-life vehicle changes, they are not in a position to be able to garner credit, even with the electric vehicle grants, especially given the past year but also generally.  Clearly, there is an inability to spend it as a result of structural problems, and we need to look at those structural problems.  Are the Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, looking at why that shortfall was not spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.42" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Spratt" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#E00600"><p>We are.  There was a lower than anticipated uptake of the grants.  We accept that.  It might be owing to a trend of drivers delaying vehicle purchases pending the anticipated launch of longer range models.  That might be something to do with it.  To encourage a greater take-up of EVs in the sector, which plays an important leadership and normalisation role, the grant levels of the scheme have been increased from seven to ten.</p> <p>  However, we need to do more.  We are required to reduce our carbon emissions by 51% by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050.  A big part of what we do between now and 2030 will be around biofuels and electric vehicles.  We are working through the options on that, but we need to figure out how we can get the behavioural changes we need.  We are conscious of the exemplars that taxi drivers are when it comes to EVs, so we are working through that.  We expect, with the revision to the climate action plan, we will be able to set out our stall and we might need to do more on that front.  That is something we are considering, but we are glad to take the Deputy's feedback on it.</p></speech>

The NTA regulates taxi licences, but we do not have anybody looking at the taxi industry.  What has been spent in terms of research on the taxi industry, the impact Covid-19 has had on it and how we can assist thousands of operators within a sector to ensure they are a key and important part of the public transport network?  I do not believe the NTA is approaching it from the perspective of researching best practice and working with the industry.  It seems to be approaching it purely from a regulatory perspective.</p></speech>

The old Great Southern and Western Railway terminated at Heuston Station.  It needs to be connected.  It went to railway order in approximately 2015.  It is only a comment.  It is the game changer and the missing piece, which is not to say the western rail corridor is not important, but this requires to be done.  Will Mr. Spratt give us a note on how much of the previous work in bringing it to railway order level can be reused if there is an evaluation?</p> <p>  On the rollover and the extension of the search and rescue, it is due.  It is 2012 to 2022 and there is an option of another three years.  A lead-in piece has to be done.  In terms of the capital cost, did the Department or the State fund any of the capital costs for the purchase or financing of helicopters?  If so, is there an ownership?  I know there is a depreciation of approximately 25 years on these.</p><p>Does the State own any assets?  If a new company comes in or if it is split between State-run and a combination of State-run and private sector, there will be a training component.  Is this component built into the cost?  I find it quite difficult to see how this rolls over without there being sizeable work.  Are there any assets?</p></speech>

The Chairman could extend the Deputy's time if that is okay.  There has been much interest in our search and rescue responsibilities and I would be grateful to set out important facts.  The existing contract with CHCI was to run for ten years from July 2012 with an option for three one-year extensions.  The contract has been extended to July 2023.  The annual cost is approximately &euro;60 million.  The current service was procured on the basis of a thorough scoping exercise at the time involving all stakeholders, including the Department of Defence and the Air Corps.  Based on that analysis, the recommendation for the new service was to significantly enhance the search and rescue capability, which involved modernising and upgrading the helicopter fleet to cater for the wide range of scenarios for maritime search and rescue, including a mass rescue.  Thankfully, we have not had to do that but we have the capability to do so should we need to.</p> <p>  It was tendered by open competition.  A compliant process was followed and independently audited.  This resulted in a Government decision to award the contract to CHCI at the time.  The construction of the tender bids was a matter for each tenderer based on the specification required.  It was not for the Department or the Coast Guard to dictate whether it should buy or lease but to assess the relative costs between the two final bidders.  The tenders were evaluated on the basis of the stated award criteria and CHCI was determined to be the preferred bid.  This is not a fixed-cost contract.  There are agreed monthly standing charges and variable elements on top of that.  There are costs associated with modifications, which are agreed with the Coast Guard.  There can be other additional costs, all of which are provided for in the contract terms.  The contract costs on average &euro;60 million per year, which is broadly in line with expectations at the outset.  CHCI has provided an excellent service and the contract has delivered on all key performance metrics.  The Air Corps was not in a position to deliver the service at the time and this was acknowledged by the Department of Defence.  The question of the State purchasing helicopters, which was raised by the Deputy, was considered at the time.  This would require significant upfront costs and would have involved significant associated risk to the State.  In buying a service, the risk of helicopter loss or depreciating values of the asset, which is important, is carried by the service provider.  To sum that up, it was something that was considered at the start but it was decided on the basis of what we required to procure that it was better not to be the owner of those assets.  I might ask Mr. Clonan to address the training component.</p></speech>

It approached the Department at the end of 2017.  At that point, unless emergency funding was provided, the airport would have been at risk of entering liquidation.  That would have had immediate implications for the continuance of the search and rescue base at the airport.  Arising from that, emergency funding was provided to the airport and this has continued on the basis of plans for works that would enable the return of scheduled services put forward by the airport and accepted by the Government.  However, arising from changed circumstances, the Minister has confirmed to Waterford Airport that the continuation of funding on that basis would not be possible.</p></speech>

We are not doing it for Sligo Airport, which does have needs, does have a rescue service and does house the CHC choppers in Strandhill, where I live, but it is one rule for Waterford and no rule for Sligo.  Is that not the case?</p></speech>

In his second response to me, he changed that to say that the work was really to do with assisting the return of scheduled services whereas the truth is that the former Minister, Deputy Ross, just decided that we were going to give &euro;5 million to Waterford.  What I am trying to establish is whether if he was so disposed, the current Minister could make funding available to Sligo Airport, which, as Mr. Towey probably knows, has had to realign its runway from a safety perspective to keep CHC at the base.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

If the Minister of the day is so disposed, can we get money for Sligo Airport so that we can maintain the high standard of air and sea rescue currently carried out by CHC Ireland on behalf of the State at the bargain price of &euro;60 million a year?  We need a safe airport and a small amount of capital support.  I am not talking about capital expenditure or operational expenditure.  The airport is not run for profit but is owned by the people of Sligo.  Can Mr. Towey confirm that, if the Minister is so disposed, money can be made available to Sligo Airport for this purpose?</p></speech>

Why did it take the Road Safety Authority so long to make the driver theory test available online when the test for bus drivers was already available online?  What were the challenges the RSA was unable to overcome until now?</p></speech>

A new service was being introduced.  An element of systems analysis and design had to be gone through.  The RSA had to test that online system.  This is something that is new to the authority.  It is, therefore, introducing it incrementally.  It was initially introduced for a particular type of vehicle.  The RSA hopes to roll it out for other drivers but, as I mentioned earlier, there have been some teething problems and challenges.  That is something I will be taking up with the chief executive of the RSA with a view to determining what can be done to roll it out more quickly.</p></speech>

What sort of engagement has his Department had with the RSA in light of the fact that the number of people on waiting lists was spiralling out of control and had reached almost 100,000 people?  The Department was aware that the RSA had requested 80 additional testers, although the Department initially granted it only half of that number.  Mr. Spratt has said the process of securing the others is now in train.  Given the seriousness of the issue and given that waiting lists are spiralling out of control, it does not appear that the Department had very much engagement with the RSA over the past 12 months or so, especially as Mr. Spratt only became aware of the access problems in recent days.</p></speech>

I personally engage with the chief executive a couple of times a year with nothing on the agenda.  I also engage with him several times a year between those meetings with regard to any issues that have arisen.  Mr. O'Leary is the assistant secretary with responsibility for road safety and related matters.  He might be able to update the Deputy on the more detailed engagement that happens between the Department at divisional level and the RSA.  My sense of the matter is that we are very close.  We are as engaged as we need to be.  The RSA comes to us and we come to it whenever issues arise.  We are working with the RSA to address these backlogs as quickly as possible.  I accept that, as the Deputy has said, we initially only gave the RSA 40 of the 80 testers it had requested but, given that the backlog is growing, we moved this week to provide it with all of the testers it needs.  Is there anything Mr. O'Leary wants to add?</p></speech>

The authority has described it as a temporary position, which is not really satisfactory.  I want to highlight the fact that, as he has said, Mr. Spratt only recently became aware of this despite the constant engagement with the RSA he has mentioned.  I just wanted to flag that.  The effort the Department seems to have put into enabling the RSA to tackle those figures is quite shocking given the numbers on waiting lists.</p> <p>  I wanted to touch on another matter, if I have time.  It was reported last month that the Pensions Authority had warned the trustees of the CI&Eacute; pension scheme that they could face prosecution if they do not come up with a plan to address a deficit in that scheme.  Can Mr. Spratt confirm that the current total deficit does not exceed &euro;975 million?</p></speech>

It proposed that the retirement age be increased to 65 and this proposal was approved in June 2020.  CI&Eacute; has submitted a draft statutory instrument in that regard, which is being worked through.  The second scheme, which I believe is the scheme to which the Deputy is referring, is known as the 1951 scheme.  Proposals in respect of this scheme were initially voted down by 80% of the members who voted in a ballot last September.  However, the trade union group recently balloted members on Labour Court proposals which emerged in November 2020 and, on 5 May this year, the Department was notified that there had been an overall acceptance of those proposals.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped that things will become clearer over the coming months.  The Minister will then introduce a draft statutory instrument for consultation.

I had thought the Chairman said that my time was up.  Mr. Spratt said earlier that the Department wants to improve transport provision.  Last week, it was reported that Bus &Eacute;ireann is to cut some of its intercity Expressway services.  I believe nine regional routes are affected.</p><p>It seems an odd time to suspend services when the country is on the brink of reopening.  What is the Department's view on that?  Should we be seeking to increase public transport capacity?  </p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann is obviously one of our agencies.  There is a commercial operation, which is that particular part of the company's operations.  It needs to take decisions based on the market.

Over &euro;1 billion has been spent on road improvement and road maintenance programmes.  The big complaint I constantly hear is about where major road improvement is carried out and shortly afterwards another utility company comes along and excavates it again to put down ducting, cables or whatever.  What kind of co-ordination involving local authorities takes place before work starts to avoid duplication and excessive expenditure?  I was a member of Cork City Council during 2003 and 2004 when there was major refurbishment in Cork city.  We notified all the utility companies that we would not allow any excavation to take place for ten years once it was completed, meaning that they had to put in all their required ducting.  Is it the Department policy to co-ordinate work with all the utility companies that operate in the State?</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite right.  There is an issue which in the past required to be addressed regarding road openings.  Quite recently the Department updated what is called the purple book, which provides the guidelines on road openings.  It also has put in place centralised portal systems in order that all applications come through the one system and are then diverted to the relevant local authority.  It is a single portal which speeds up the whole process.  What the Deputy says is right.  There is provision for local authorities to have embargoes on reopening a road.  If for some reason a road has to be reopened by a utility within a short period before the period of five years, or in some cases ten years, is up, there is a surcharge to be paid by the person who does so.</p></speech>

That is my question.</p></speech>

The road programmes are made available to them because three-year plans are prepared on a rolling basis.  They are made available to utilities so that they can see where the works are taking place and they can plan their work in order that they get in before it.</p></speech>

Can we get details of the number of companies where surcharges were imposed?  Do particular utility companies incur a higher number of surcharges because of their not planning ahead and not being there before the major road infrastructure work takes place?</p></speech>

I would not like to say I could have it to the Deputy immediately because we will have to go back to the local authorities to collate the information and go to the road management office, RMO, which operates the central system.  We can certainly follow up and check how it is being applied across the country.</p></speech>

This is about planning into the future, whether it is ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  Is that option being made available?</p></speech>

It is not the norm.  Longitudinal ducts are put in place along roads in order to cater for future things like variable message signs.  TII has put in extra ducting along dual carriageways where there are gaps in the network.</p></speech>

I have come across cases where the local authority has carried out major resurfacing or major drainage work and six months later, I have seen the same roadway being excavated again.</p></speech>

I also thank them for the detailed information they provided in advance of today's meeting which is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. Clonan.  I represent D&uacute;n Laoghaire and obviously I have great affinity and respect for the work that the Irish Coast Guard does, in particular the volunteers in the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard unit.  My information is that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard is quite busy and I expect it to be far busier this summer given the requirements for an outdoor summer.  That will place considerable pressure and strain on the volunteers.  My information is that 20 volunteers are attached to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard.  How is the recruitment of new volunteers nationally going?  Obviously, I am sure that the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Coast Guard could do with more.  Is there a cap on the number of volunteers attached to each Coast Guard station?  I also seek information about the replacement of and investment in equipment for Coast Guard stations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene Clonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#J00100"><p>There is quite a lot in those questions but I will do my best to go at them.  Regarding the Coast Guard maritime search and rescue function, we have the three rescue co-ordination centres and search and rescue units on the coast to respond.  There is our search and rescue helicopters, the RNLI and, finally, our Coast Guard units, of which there are 44.  There are three functions.  Every team has a search function.  They have vehicles, they break into teams, they have PPE and they search the coast.  The next function a Coast Guard team could have is a boat.  The Howth team, over on the other side of the harbour, has a boat.  They are trained in that, equipped and so on.  Another function a Coast Guard team has is a cliff team.  Greystones has a cliff team, a boat and a search team.  They are trained on that.</p> <p>  I will concentrate now on D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire has a small search team, an RNLI unit in the harbour and the helicopter behind it in Dublin Airport.  Based on the risk assessment, that is the search unit for that area and it is very busy.  With Covid, and looking at last year and this year so far, in the first quarter of this year we responded to about 435 incidents nationwide.  During the month of August last year we responded to 430 incidents in just one month.  We are expecting a huge ramping up of incidents this year.  It is not the fishermen or the merchant ships; it is the people of Ireland availing of recreational facilities, particularly around D&uacute;n Laoghaire: the Forty Foot, Seapoint and the surrounding areas.</p> <p>  As for the number in each station, generally a search team has about 15 people.  If you add boats and cliff teams, the number goes up to 25.  As to how we recruit, every team has 15 members.  It has a volunteer person in charge, a volunteer deputy, an education officer and a training officer.  They are the main functions and they recruit locally.</p></speech>

Staying with that issue, Mr. Clonan mentioned vehicles.  Is it true that volunteers cannot use their vehicles?  I understand that in some stations they can.  Obviously, however, it limits their ability to respond if they cannot.  I understand that the Coast Guard vehicles are one of the four blue light vehicles but they are limited in where they can use those vehicles.  Maybe that is more a question to the Department than Mr. Clonan, but that hampers the ability of volunteers, depending on their location, to respond to incidents.  I am just thinking ahead to this summer, as I said.  I am nervous because they do fantastic work, the volunteers are on call 24-7 and we need to ensure they can respond but my information is that some stations can use the vehicles and bring them home so they can respond more quickly to incidents while other stations cannot.  What are the criteria there?  Who can use the vehicles and when?</p></speech>

We need vehicles for towing boats and vehicles for moving the equipment.  They have to be extremely mobile.  Most units have two four-by-fours and, depending on their functions, may have a cargo van, a quad or whatever, but it is based on that.  There is no restriction on using vehicles.  If they are on exercise, they use the vehicles.  If they are on a call-out, they use the vehicles.  The officer in charge, OIC, has charge of his or her vehicles.  If they are on exercise or are called out to an incident, they use the vehicles.  There is no restriction on using vehicles.  In the event of distress or someone being in immediate danger of loss of life, they can put on the blue lights and respond.  We are working with the Road Safety Authority.  It has emergency driving courses for the emergency services.  Deputy Devlin is correct that we are one of the blue light services along with the fire service, the ambulance service and the Garda.  For a small organisation there is a huge burden, if you want to call it that, or a requirement to train people to be able to drive safely.  All our volunteers have been trained in driving with blue lights.  We are a little different from the other three services in that they are allowed to break the rules of the road, basically, where it is safe to do so, whereas our guys must stay within the rules of the road when there is an emergency.  We are in discussions with the Department on legislation to amend that.  With the other emergency services there are specific blue light driving courses on which you drive at speed and that type of thing.  That is in the pipeline.</p></speech>

I am up early enough for it to be the afternoon.  I welcome everybody to the committee meeting.  As we have only five minutes each, I want to make a couple of observations that have been brought to my attention.  One is the theory test going online.  It appears it is not the only problem, in that you have to have a certain type of software on your computer to use it but if you apply for a test you do not get one until 2023.  Maybe that can be brought back to the RSA.  It could be that nobody knows the answer to this but could somebody supply to the committee a figure for the cost of putting the theory test online and how much was spent on it?  Ultimately, it is a bit of a disaster at the minute.</p><p>Regarding the appropriation accounts - and this is probably a question for Mr. Spratt - paragraph 2.10 relates to the &euro;1.2 million that was paid out in respect of the Smith <i>v</i>. Meade case.  That case arose because, effectively, the wrong transposing of a directive on car insurance occurred.  Who within the Department has been held accountable for that failure?  If the Exchequer is down just short of &euro;1.2 million due to that mistake, have lessons been learned?  If so, what lessons have been learned?</p></speech>

I have a very long note in front of me which, if I were to read through it, would probably take up all her time and probably even go over it, so what I might do about the lessons learned is come back to her with a context note but also set it out in a note for-----</p></speech>

However, it has been brought to my attention that significantly, &euro;7.5 million was paid out perhaps over ten years ago in respect of night vision goggles in addition to CHC helicopters.  As the training has yet to be completed, it would appear that those goggles are not being used in the service at all.  I need to understand how we spent &euro;7.5 million on something that has not yet been used.  Would Mr. Spratt be able to compile something on that for me?</p></speech>

Obviously, we need to recruit board members.  We have processes in place to recruit those board members.  We need to make sure we have the knowledge, skills, expertise, capacity, competence and capability for all our board members, so filling the board member vacancies does take time.  Yes, we have some vacancies on a number of our boards but we are trying to fill them as quickly as we possibly can.</p><p>In that context, did the Deputy mention the board of CIE?</p></speech>

I have a number of questions for Mr. Spratt.  If he can keep his answers short, that would be helpful.  A couple of hundred thousand people are waiting for both the theory and the full driver test.  Why was the theory test suspended?  The theory test can be run in a cubicle with a screen, similar to what is in every bank, post office and public building.  Members of the public have asked me this question and I do not have an answer for them but I told them I would raise it with the Department today.  I am at a loss as to why the theory test was suspended.</p></speech>

As was the case with many of the decisions that were taken, the Chief Medical Officer had his view and made his input, and when it came to marginal decisions, public health guidelines overruled and took precedence.  While we fought as hard as we possibly could to keep the theory test going and we contributed to the final decision, public health guidance was also submitted and it was a decision that went against us.</p></speech>

I also welcome the fact Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s Department pushed this matter.</p> <p>  I also ask about the instructors, and Mr. Spratt clarified earlier there will be 80 and not 40 extra employed.  I very much welcome this good news.  On clearing the waiting lists backlog, how many does Mr. Spratt&rsquo;s Department hope to clear in each of the months, July, August and September?</p></speech>

It is starting incrementally with the longest waiting non-essential drivers, which has already started.  The authority is finding there is quite a heavy dropout rate because these are very often the people who are taking longest to pass their tests.  It will be ramped up over time, and as the additional testers are deployed, the numbers will increase during July and August.

Again, a constituent who needs a motorcycle to get to work contacted me about this last week.  I failed to provide an answer to that person as to how you would catch Covid-19 on a motorbike.  I have observed the test because my office is on a circuit used for the motorcycle driving test and I regularly see the candidates passing.  There is a motorcyclist and a tester some distance behind him.  I fail for the life of me to see how that kind of testing could not have continued.  It is just to highlight that.  It is to be hoped we will not be into another lockdown or semi-lockdown.  If we are, I appeal to the Department that we please keep the theory and the motorcycle tests going.</p> <p>  On the NCT centres, my understanding is these centres are not accepting cash.  I have had complaints, especially from pensioners who may not have a card, online banking, plastic card, or whatever.  They arrive in to pay by cash and discover they cannot to do so.  Is that the case and can the Department do anything about this?  While it may be a minority now who may wish to pay by cash, can this matter be looked into and followed up because it is an important issue?</p> <p>  Reverting to Mr Spratt, on the search and rescue business, to date and over a ten-year period, there are commitments of &euro;638 million.  Mr. Spratt clarified we will not own any choppers at the end of this period, but yet there is a capital element of &euro;35 million that has been spent, according to my understanding of this.

We have rules around how we procure contractors and consultants.  Whether or not there is a specific check on a balance sheet, I am not entirely sure, but what I can say is that this process serves us very well and ensures we get reputable contractors and consultants to supply us with the services we need in a way that is good value for money.</p></speech>

Would the Department examine that?  Would it be the case that a company with a thin track record or level of experience in the work being undertaken would not be hired?  Would that be checked out thoroughly by the Department?</p></speech>

This process has served us well.  We check referees and the quality of work done previously.  The process has served us very well in terms of the skills and expertise we have procured from consultants and contractors.  I would be surprised if there were a suggestion that we were not getting good value for money or purchasing knowledge, skill, expertise, competence, capability that did not exist.  To my mind, based on my experience of the last 20 years in similar situations, all the contractors and consultants, while their service is variable, tend to be very good value for money.</p></speech>

That is standard fare.  When looking for contractors or consultants, we require them to set out the CVs of the teams that will be working on a project.

If there is not sufficient traffic, the State must pay the toll road operators compensation.  Was there anything built into the contract that would have envisaged something like the unimaginable Covid scenario?  Was there any safeguard built into the contract for anything like that?  Separately, on road maintenance, can we expect to see an underspend in 2020 because of Covid?  If so, will that underspend go back to the Exchequer?</p></speech>

We have two concession PPP contracts.  One is for the M3 from Clonee to Kells and the other is for the N18 Limerick tunnel.  They provide for variable operational payments to the operator when traffic volumes fall below specified levels.  Variable operational payments continue to be payable on both of these contracts and estimates of future liabilities are based on observed traffic data, forecasts of traffic growth and inflation.  Inflation indices are derived from the forecast consumer price index on the assumption that toll charges will rise in line with that index.  Where return traffic growth and-or inflation differ from the forecast, this impacts on the variable operational payment amounts provided for.  Such payments were included in PPP contracts for these important groups, which are less trafficked than those on which such payments are not provided for, to ensure an appropriate balance of risk between the commercial operators and the Exchequer.  They were subject to scrutiny before contracts were signed to ensure they deliver value for money and the economic and social benefits they bring.  That is a long way of saying there is a risk to be balanced and there are compensation payments provided for in those contracts.</p></speech>

Was there anything built into the contract in relation to unforeseen circumstances like the loss of traffic last year because of Covid?  Is there a get-out-of-jail clause for 2020 or does the State carry all the risk?</p></speech>

If so, they can drop me a line afterwards.  I note that the Department is responsible for the Coast Guard and search and rescue services.  My question is about an agreement in Castlefreke, west Cork, that Coillte would transfer land for a new base to be established there.  Contracts were furnished to the Chief State Solicitor's office over 18 months ago and there is still no progress.  Perhaps the witnesses will get back to me with an explanation as to why that has occurred.  I know the OPW is dealing with the matter but ultimately it falls within the Department's remit.

Staying with programme C, in terms of the volunteer use of vehicles, if I am a volunteer, the vehicle has to be stored at the base, but is not practical for me to get from my home to the base.  Can Mr. Clonan drop a note to clarify the use of those vehicles?  It is important we get more vehicles for our stations, but also that they are able to be used.</p> <p>  Is there a strategic plan for the Irish Coast Guard?  If there is, can Mr. Clonan furnish me with a copy?  The national oil spill contingency planning is under the remit of Department of Transport.  When was the last time that was undertaken or practised?  I ask the witnesses to come back to me in writing.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Spratt for the information.  What subheading does the marine casualty investigation board come under?  I could not find it in the accounts.</p> <p>  In March, I put a question on the transfer of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, among five harbours included.  I am sure Mr. Spratt and his Department are delighted to have all that handed over to a different Department.  I am inquiring about the funding.  I have asked about the funding which was given to local authorities on the transfer of that.  It seems funding was given to certain local authorities and not to others.  My main concern was D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown not getting a penny.  Can Mr. Spratt do a review of that and furnish the committee or me with that?</p></speech>

Maybe they will come back in writing and I can forward that to the clerk.  I would like to know how the Department assessed the efficiencies and effectiveness of the agencies under its remit.  What programme of assessment does it carry out to ensure they are operating?  I have huge difficulty with some constituents contacting me, who have been waiting for a walk around check for nine months.  Without that they cannot move on to take their artic licence.  It is a significant issue.  I cannot understand it.  It is not similar to the theory test.  It is carried on outside.  I will submit some more to Mr. Spratt, but how does he measure the effectiveness of the agencies under him?</p> <p>  I want to come back to the roads.  It is a significant issue.  County Wexford has a deficit of &euro;68 million, accrued in a shortfall over the past ten years, in road maintenance moneys.  We have approximately 5,600 km of roads in the county  One councillor recently said due to the state of the roads in County Wexford, it is similar to trying to keep the tide out with a fork, in terms of performing maintenance at the level of funding which is given.  It is difficult to see a 500% increase in commercial traffic on roads which are underfunded.  I want to make the point on the &euro;68 million deficit accrued over a ten-year period.  We are firefighting all the time.  It just maintenance, maintenance, maintenance.  There is no resurfacing.</p> <p>  On the national oversight and audit committee, in terms of roads, we have the worst roads in the country, second only to County Donegal.  I would be looking at how roads funding is allocated.  I do not believe for one minute it is of benefit to the Exchequer to be funding through the kilometre system, on the basis some of our counties have good roads.  As Deputy Murphy alluded to, if maintenance does not need to be carried out, that money should be disbursed into other counties where the roads are significantly worse.  That is according to National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, not my opinion.</p> <p>  I thank the members of the Department for coming in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.200" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2021052700002#M00900"><p>I have a couple of things to mention to Mr. Spratt before we close up.  I do not want Mr. Spratt to give me an answer now, in terms of the roads in County Offaly.  There is a special case for north County Offaly, because the roads are over peat.  Mr. O'Leary is nodding in agreement.  There is a serious issue there, in terms of road safety.  Can someone please have a look at the R400?  The engineers and councillors need the money for it.  The local population needs it.  There are road safety issues with the R400 in the area where the old Derrygreenagh works were.  There is a serious situation in north Offaly, because it is going over peat.</p> <p>  The other thing I wanted to briefly mention was the 1951 CI&Eacute; pension scheme.  I do not want to go into it in detail.  There are people there for 40 years who have paid into a pension scheme and are left in a precarious situation.  The trustees have made a High Court application.  There should be no further discussion of the 1951 scheme, until that happens.  Another member of the committee has already raised this.  The Department needs to keep an eye on it, because there are people who have paid into that scheme throughout their term of employment with CI&Eacute;.</p> <p>  The last thing I want to raise with the witnesses is the issue of bus shelters.  I have had to write, as a member of a local authority and as a Deputy, to the chair of the National Transport Authority, about bus stops for Mountrath, Castletown, Borris-in-Ossary, Doonane, Crettyard and Ballylynan.  It is crazy stuff.  There is provision under the local authority Act brought in by the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, whereby that power is given to local authorities.  I did not agree with him on many things, but one of the things he did was the provision in that Act.</p> <p>  There is huge frustration at local authority level, because they feel there is significant micromanagement by the Department of Transport.  Local authorities have excellent engineers.  There are good local authority members.  There are good management systems in place.  I know it is a matter for the Minister of Transport more than the witnesses, but I do not want to let the opportunity pass.  We need to allow the local authorities to breathe.  We need to breathe a bit of life and democracy back into local authorities.</p> <p>  Can the issue of bus shelters be delegated back to local authorities?  If one goes over the Border, into the Six Counties, there are bus shelters all over the place.  There are bus shelters at every half-mile point on the road, including for school buses.  We cannot seem to get them in counties Laois or Offaly and every other Deputy here will concur with me on this, in terms of their counties.  It is too bureaucratic.  It is the local authority.  Give it the money.  Let it do it.  It will do it cheaper as well.  I ask Mr. Spratt to come back to me with a note on that.  I am saying that in a constructive way.</p> <p>  It is good news about the driving tests.  I welcome that staff numbers are being increased.  We look forward to that being expedited.</p> <p>  We are out of time.  I thank all the witnesses for joining us and the Department for the information it provided on a wide range of issues.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending and assisting the committee.  It is agreed for the clerk to seek any follow up in the information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed.  Is it also agreed we publish any opening statements and briefings provided for us today?</p><p> I remind members of the committee that directly after the meeting there will be a photo shoot outside, on the Plinth, so they should have their best suits on.  I remind members also that we will launch a report on our engagement with the Office of Public Works at 12 o'clock and that the launch will be published on the Oireachtas website.  I thank everyone.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.  The committee is adjourned.  On 9.30 a.m. next Tuesday, 1 June, the committee will meet in private session.</p></speech>

I need about five minutes to get to Agriculture House.  I have booked a room in the Leinster House 2000 building to avoid the problem but I do not have a working Internet connection from there.  I hope it will be working from next week.  I am requesting at least four minutes to get back to the office so that I do not miss what is happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#A01100"><p>I am unsure whether I spoke to them and I made that point at the end of our previous meeting.  Amendment No. 42 provides that the agency must be publicly owned and controlled.  I want to emphasise this because one of the big problems with these agencies that are set up is that they are at one remove from direct control by elected representatives.  Essentially, they become buffers against proper oversight.  To be honest, I am sick to my back teeth of dealing with these entities, which are sort of State agencies.  A councillor may attend a council meeting to try to find out what a body, a supposedly public body, is doing.  Then he is told the council cannot give an answer because it is the responsibility of a given body and the council will see if it can get representatives in and get an answer from them.  It is at one remove from real direct public control.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that is what will happen with the Land Development Agency, LDA.  Theoretically, the council will still have a role.  In reality, the LDA will be a law unto itself unless it is directly publicly controlled and unless there is direct public oversight over what is being done to develop public land.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 43 is next.  We are including the term "relevant private".  The reason for this is because, as we discussed previously, the LDA should not be acting in substitution for local authorities in the context of their responsibility for public land or for opening up such land to private interests.  The agency should be doing the opposite.  It should be grabbing relevant private land, including that which is being hoarded by private developers.  I refer to vacant land that is being hoarded, being used for the purposes of speculation or that is simply unused and that could be used for housing.  What the LDA should be doing is getting hold of such private land because it could be used to deliver much needed housing.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 49 provides that the definition of public housing should be housing that is operated by local authorities and approved housing bodies with differential rents.  Again, this is critical because the Minister's definition of "affordability" is linked to market prices and rents rather than people's income or the cost of housing.  That is not affordable at all.  What we want in defining public housing is that anything built by the State on public land or anything that is being defined as affordable in any context should be affordable relative to people's incomes.  Specifically, public housing must be based on the differential rent scheme.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 79 is next.</p></speech>

I know we are starting off but we have gone back to group 1 and now we are going back to group 2.  I know there was a question about whether we have dealt with amendments Nos. 42 to 44, inclusive.  It is difficult to follow.  We are back on the grouping we dealt with.  We are not on group 2.  I am not sure whether the Chairman can give some advice on this.

Amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive, have been spoken to by Deputy Boyd Barrett and the Minister.  Amendment No. 49 has been covered.  Deputy Boyd Barrett may wish to move on to amendments Nos. 79 and 80.  Amendment No. 213 has been covered.

Of course, that sort of vague phraseology gets to the heart of what is wrong with the LDA and the Government's proposals for dealing with the housing crisis.  A phrase like "for public good" does not mean anything.</p> <p>  What we need is an agency whose sole purpose is to deliver public and affordable housing.  We need a strict definition of what public and affordable housing is so that it is genuinely public and genuinely affordable.  That is the logic.</p></speech>

I will deal with his initial comments first.  We are talking here about a commercial semi-state company.  It is 100% publicly owned.  It is fully accountable to the Oireachtas.  There is full oversight.  I have ensured that there will be full freedom of information provisions and oversight from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It could not be more publicly owned than it is.  We will have to agree to differ on this because it is not only 100% publicly owned but its remit is to deliver and build on public land.</p> <p>  I take the point made by Deputy Boyd Barrett with regard to the hoarding of private land.  That needs to be addressed, but let us be aware of and deal with the reality.  There is a great deal of publicly owned land that should be used more productively.  That is what we need to do.  That is why this legislation has been brought forward.  The State is the biggest hoarder of land and that needs to stop.  We need to put our land to use to build homes for our people, including social and affordable homes.</p><p>Amendment No. 49, which is related to amendment No. 79, is jointly tabled by Deputies Boyd Barrett, Gino Kenny, Paul Murphy, Br&iacute;d Smith and Barry.  It seeks to amend section 3 of the Bill which provides definitions for references made in the Bill.  In particular, the amendment seeks to insert a definition of public housing.  I am opposing the amendment as a specific term for public housing is not referenced at any point in the Bill.  As such, a definition is not required.  The Bill already includes multiple references to affordable and social housing, which we discussed at length on Tuesday.  Local authorities are the housing authorities.  They will be the main drivers of delivery of social and direct-build affordable homes.  The LDA will assist them in implementing that role, but also in delivering on State agency land, which is not happening at the moment.  On nine sites that we know of already, and others, that will be moving forward.  As such, local authorities have the primary role with regard to the delivery of social housing, including in regard to the allocation of such housing and the setting of appropriate rent levels.  I will be opposing these amendments.</p></speech>

I am speaking also in support of the intent of Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendments.  Amendment No. 80 attempts to provide that all of the homes on land that the LDA is developing should be affordable housing.  I cannot see any justification for allowing the very scarce resource of public land to be used for unaffordable housing.  If the Minister wants to make a case as to the reason that land should be used for houses that will be sold at prices of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000, he can do that, but this amendment makes clear that where the LDA is involved in residential development all of the homes on that land would be affordable and social as well.  That seems to me an eminently sensible proposal.</p></speech>

This is about delivery.  The main purpose of the LDA will be to deliver affordable and social housing.  In many instances, particularly in our urban centres, we will have 100% affordable and social in the sense that entire developments will be made up that mix of housing, particularly in Dublin and in Cork.  We need to ensure the agency also has latitude to be able to deliver on sites into the future.  I will not be accepting amendment No. 80.</p></speech>

I do not know in what order they indicated, but I will call Deputy Cian O'Callaghan first and then Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#B00600"><p>This is the bit I do not understand.  The case has not been made, and no rationale has been offered, as to the reason we would want to build homes at full market price on public land, or what the advantage is of doing that.  We have a huge demand and crisis in terms of housing affordability.  We need to be using public land to deliver affordable and social housing.  That is abundantly clear, and the Minister has said that a great deal himself.  There is gap between what he says in terms of his mantra of public homes on public land and what is actually being done and being delivered.  I am highly sceptical of the Land Development Agency.  We hear that mantra, yet what we see is majority, private, full market price homes being built on public land.  That is what happened under the previous Government, and it is what is happening under this Government.</p> <p>  I want to make a point on delivery.  It slows down delivery to do that mix because to be able to sell homes at full market price the homes have to be drip fed for sale over a number of years.  If the houses were built at prices that people could genuinely afford, for which there would be huge demand, we would be able to build-out a lot of these housing schemes much quicker and thus we would have much quicker delivery of homes.  We would have quicker delivery and more affordable homes.  I have yet to hear any rationale as to the reason, in terms of public land, there should be any provision of unaffordable, full market price homes when there are already private developers who have plenty of land to be delivering that type of build.  That is not where there is a gap.  There is a particular gap in terms of affordability and also social housing.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.232" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#B00700"><p>I want to respond to the Minister's claim that delivery could not be more public than it is.  We need to put this in a concrete context.  At the moment, in my area there is virtually no public housing being developed.  The local authority build for this year for the D&uacute;n Laoghaire area is zero.  All of a sudden and out of the blue, notice was given of allocations from the council list to a private development that the elected representatives had no idea was going to be allocated for social housing, although always through approved housing bodies and not as direct council housing.  Out of the blue, this popped up and none of the elected representatives had known about it.  Why is that?  It is because the development was built privately and behind the scenes there is commercial negotiation is going on.  Once that commercial element is brought in, oversight and democracy go out the window.  This is what is going to happen with the public land bank through the Land Development Agency.  Everything will be about commercial negotiations and negotiations with financiers and the elected representatives of local authorities will not have direct input or knowledge of what is going to happen, when it is going to happen or how it is going to happen until it is a done deal and a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p><p>The idea that the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts will be able to drill down into the details of developments on particular sites in the multiple local authority areas is nonsense.  The people who potentially could have oversight and real input and serve the public interest at a local level are the elected representatives of the local authorities.  That will all go out the window.  They are going to be at more than one remove in respect of many of the key decisions that will be made about the development of the public land banks in their areas.  It is for this reason I am stressing in the amendment that housing has to be publicly owned and controlled.  What this Bill does is supplant the role of local authorities and bring in people who are operating largely to a private commercial agenda.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan is correct that there is no justification for building full market price housing on public land.  It is outrageous.  What we should be doing is further encroaching on the dominance of the private sector over the housing market.  The Government, through the Land Development Agency, is expanding the influence of the private and commercial sector into the public land bank.</p></speech>

I am trying to understand why the Minister thinks it is a good idea for the scarce resource of public land to be used to build and sell homes that will be priced between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  I accept that there is a shift in this Bill from the original Fine Gael proposition, which was that, on average, 60% of all the homes delivered through the LDA would be unaffordable full market price sales.  The Minister is right in saying that he has introduced a series of measures to change that, but I cannot understand why he would allow any homes to be sold.  Taking the Dundrum Central site as an example, there will be some level of private build there, but the median market price for a two bedroom apartment in that location is currently over &euro;500,000.  In that regard, the Government is using public land to build homes at an exceptionally high price.  Why is that a good idea?  If the Minister wants us to withdraw our amendments he needs to convince us that is a good idea.  There are already homes being developed for &euro;500,000 for the people who can afford to buy them.  Homes costing &euro;230,000, &euro;250,000 and &euro;260,000 are desperately needed.  Therefore, I cannot understand the rationale of 10%, 25% or 50% of a site being used for unaffordable open market price sales.</p></speech>

It also means supporting people who want to purchase privately like first-time buyers or those who want to downsize.  The Minister clearly outlined that in areas like Dublin and Cork where affordable is most needed, it will be prioritised and delivered.  He indicated that sites in these areas will have up to 80% or 90% affordable and 10% social housing.  That is good and where we want to get to.  We want to get to a point where the local demand is met through the LDA.  Local authorities are doing their local housing demand-needs assessment.  It is right and proper that those local needs will be reflected in the master planning of public sites by the agency.  That is going to vary with every local authority.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows that.</p> <p>  I intend to align the provisions of Part 9 more closely to the provisions of the recently published Affordable Housing Bill.  This significant affordable housing legislation is in the Seanad and will, hopefully, pass Committee Stage there tomorrow.  I assume the Deputies who have tabled these amendments will support that Bill.</p> <p>  Deputy Higgins is correct about the mix.  In major urban areas, particularly in Dublin, Cork and Galway, most of the LDA sites would be 90% affordable, 10% social or a mix of that, meaning 100%.  We need to allow latitude in other parts of the country and for specific sites to allow the choice to be given within those areas.  We should not have a continuing debate about restricting tenure type.  We only have to look at what happened earlier this week with a good proposal for 1,200 homes in Fingal, a mix of public and private with 238 affordable purchase, 238 social, 150 cost-rental plus some private.  In some areas, it will make sense to have that mix of affordable, social and public, depending on the area.  The Deputies know that too.  Those who tabled these amendments opposed that particular development.</p> <p>  In general terms, we need to allow the LDA to operate within certain parameters.  I will set out the areas around affordability in more detail through the Affordable Housing Bill.  It is clear that there will be no instance whereby the agency will offer unaffordable, open-market sales as Deputy &Oacute; Broin has put forward.  This legislation will endure, hopefully, for years and the agency will endure for decades.  We need this agency.  It will not be, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin put it, a land management quango.  On Tuesday, he said he wanted an agency that does not plan for or build anything.  His would be an agency that would simply put together a summary of State lands and then farm it out to different public bodies that he thinks will deliver those homes.  We have gone past that.</p> <p>  In the Government's view, the LDA will be used to provide an additional dividend to our local authorities.  It is on top of what they will be doing.  This means it will be more social and more affordable houses.  Activating State lands will provide additional social and additional affordable homes to what our local authorities will be doing.  Deputies should not forget this.  This is not a case of instead of but on top of.  That will help us drive the type of numbers we need to be able to continue to build more public homes and to start building affordable homes at scale.  That is what everyone wants.  The LDA, as constructed in this legislation, will be empowered to do that.  It is important that we get this legislation passed to capitalise this agency and have it moving with the development of social and affordable homes in addition to what our local authorities will be doing.</p> <p>  These amendments seek to add references to social and affordable in the Bill.  As I said earlier, there are sufficient references in it.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p> <p>  With regard to the amendment seeking to remove the reference to address deficiencies in the housing market, it is clear such deficiencies exist.  That is why the LDA will play an important role in addressing this.</p> <p>  Additionally, I do not propose to accept amendments seeking to delete or amend the references to the role of the LDA relating to master planning, design and project management, as well as its key role as a development agency in land assembly.  That would fundamentally change the agency.</p> <p>  Going back to the Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about the agency not being publicly owned, it absolutely is a publicly owned entity.  The shareholders will be the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  I do not intend to accept the amendment to insert the proposed definition for public housing.  This term is not used in this Bill and there are sufficient references to affordable and social housing.  The whole purpose of this is that the LDA will play an important role in delivering affordable and social housing, including providing services to local authorities and assisting them in developing some of their own housing schemes.</p></speech>

I want them to address amendments Nos. 236 to 259, inclusive.  I need to move this on as we are two and a half hours into this but only one amendment down.  We have 258 amendments to go.  I would appreciate Deputies' assistance in moving this along.</p></speech>

I am actually in the convention centre now.  I will be speaking in the Chamber in the centre in a few minutes.  If a vote is called on these amendments, I am going to have to fly over to Leinster House.  The whole operation of trying to speak in the Chamber - I get limited speaking time as it is because of the restrictions - has to be looked at.  I want to attend meetings and speak at the committee.  I also want to vote and speak in the Chamber.</p> <p>  I disagree with the Minister on his points on social and affordable housing and for not accepting our amendments.  At the end of the day, this is public land to deliver social, affordable and cost-rental homes for people who need them.  They are crying out for such housing.  Our amendments are at the core of this Bill, namely, that we want to deliver public houses on public lands. That is what this Bill should be about.</p> <p>  Apologies but, hopefully, I will be in Leinster House shortly.  Again, I disagree with the Minister's analysis.  What we are proposing are real solutions and they should be adopted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#C00500"><p>Before I speak to that last list of amendments in this grouping, the Minister said something important and in his response I would like him to confirm this.  He said that in no instance the LDA would be involved in the delivery of unaffordable, open market price homes.  Does he mean that there will not be a single home on any LDA site that would be sold at the full open market value?</p> <p>  For example, in the scheme he cited, he said there would be some homes for the private market.  In fact, 60% of the homes, almost 800, will be private.  Fingal County Council did a market analysis of that area which it shared with its elected members.  It showed the market price was between &euro;350,000 and &euro;450,000.  This is eminently unaffordable for two- or three-bed family homes in that area.  Likewise, for example, cost rental does not work if one is buying the property at full market value, which is what Glenveagh has proposed in that area.  Of course, it will sell half of the apartments in the unaffordable private section at full market value.</p><p>Why would it not?  It is a blocked sale.  The financing of this would mean the rents on those properties would be &euro;1,600 to &euro;1,800.  It is not cost-rental.  Cost-rental removes the profit element from the development and charges rent at cost.  This is essentially the worry I aim to address with amendments Nos. 80, 213 and 236.  All of these say that not one single home on any of these sites should be sold at a price of &euro;350,000 to &euro;450,000.  Will the Minister clarify whether he means that that will not happen when he says there will be no such instances?  If so, why will he not accept the amendments?</p><p> I will move on to the final group of amendments in this grouping, Nos. 236 to 259, inclusive, some of which are mine and some of which were tabled by others.  I will pick out a number of key ones.  Obviously, these relate to rewriting the Long Title of the Bill.  The Long Title is really crucial because it outlines what this Bill is going to do.  I have also tabled more specific technical amendments which aim to change the relevant sections of the Bill.  With specific regard to amendment No. 242, I have yet to hear the Minister make the case for the agency being a commercial semi-State body as opposed to a non-commercial semi-State body.  A non-commercial semi-State body would be much more accountable to the Oireachtas and to the Minister.  Its decisions and details of its financing would be fully available rather than being available in the redacted form the Land Development Agency, LDA, would be allowed to provide if it was a commercial semi-State body.</p><p> Likewise, in respect of amendment No. 247, why would the LDA be allowed to engage with a private developer to do the type of deal we saw agreed by Government parties and some Opposition parties in Donabate today?  Surely, it should all be not for profit and surely it should be about ensuring the lowest possible delivery cost at the development stage so that we can have the lowest possible cost for first-time buyers and others.</p><p> With regard to amendment No. 251, one of the things I do not understand is why the Minister has retained in the Bill the Fine Gael proposition that subsidiary designated activity companies be created.  This is a very controversial practice that is widespread in the commercial development sector.  A company decides to set up individual designated activity companies for each individual development.  It is one of the primary mechanisms by which that small but significant number of rogue builders and developers have been able to build and sell developments that are defective before walking away from any responsibility, having dissolved the designated activity company.  I do not see the rationale for subsidiaries, even if the Minister favours a commercial semi-State model.</p><p> Finally, I will address one of my big concerns, on which I have tabled substantial amendments which we will discuss when we get to these sections.  We have more than 31 planning authorities.  They are very competent and have planners, architects and an enormous level of skill.  We do not need a centralised State agency to get involved in gazumping the really good work of our local authorities.  We just need Government to properly resource those local authorities.  How would a State agency based in Dublin be better placed to develop a master plan for a site in Galway, Limerick or Cork than the democratically accountable planning departments of the local authorities in those areas?  I would have no difficulty whatsoever with this provision if it were in the context of a an active land management agency, which is not a quango but something the State desperately needs which the Government is not providing, which also provided additional shared services to local authorities to assist them in their primary function.  If the LDA, however, is given development agency status and is involved in, for example, developing a master plan for the Colbert lands in Limerick, which I suspect is intended here, this would dramatically reduce the key role of elected members of a local authority in that strategic development zone, SDZ, master planning process.  </p><p> It would also allow the agency, under the provisions of the Act, to bypass the council in making decisions and to go straight to the board, which again dramatically undermines the democratic process and the involvement of elected members.  That is not just my view but the view of many councillors in the Minister's own party which was expressed by members of the Association of Irish Local Government when they met us with regard to this Bill some time ago.</p><p> All of these amendments are about a different vision for this agency that would allow it to do the things that are needed.  We have local authorities.  It is about time that Government properly resourced and properly funded them to deliver the 20,000 public homes the Minister himself promised in the general election campaign last year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#D00200"><p>I have to respond to two of the Minister's points.  The idea that the LDA is acting as some sort of supplement to the local authorities rather than supplanting them is, quite honestly, just nonsense.  There is no better example than Shanganagh.  There has been delay after delay for years and years.  Central government has refused to just give the local authority the money to build on its own land because it had the LDA, or something like it, in mind for years and wanted to have a private commercial component to the development of that public land, which is now crystallised in the LDA.  Whereas there could have been one way of applying for central funding and building out if the local authorities were the lead and were resourced to build, nothing has happened because central government could not make up its mind as to how precisely it was going to drag the private market and private finance into the whole process.  As a consequence, we still have no idea what the price of affordable housing at Shanganagh will be and, of course, not a sod has been turned.</p> <p>  This brings me to my second point.  Could the Minister please explain why the cap on affordable housing in my area, for example, is &euro;450,000 while in other areas it is &euro;400,000, &euro;350,000, &euro;250,000 and so on?  Will he please explain that?  As I see it, the Minister is setting the level of so-called affordability in my area based on the fact that house prices are much higher there.  Affordability is being linked to local market conditions and, therefore, such housing will not be affordable.  A cost of &euro;450,000 or even &euro;400,000 is not affordable but that is what we are going to get from the LDA.</p> <p>  That brings me to the amendments themselves.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has already made the point about the designated activity companies, DACs.  There is to be the LDA itself, which will then set up subsidiaries which are allowed enter into commercial arrangements with other bodies.  Guess who those other bodies are.  It is a reference to private finance and private developers.  That is what it is all about.  Through our proposed deletions of parts of the Title of the Bill, we are trying to guard against all of that stuff and to ensure that the sole purpose of any such agency is to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing to people on a broad range of incomes and to ensure that, insofar as we build affordable housing, not only will it be genuinely affordable, but it will stay genuinely affordable in perpetuity.  This housing could never be marketised.  Of course, the Minister does not want that because it would be no good at all to his private financier and developer friends in their efforts to profit from the public land bank.  That is the logic of amendments Nos. 236 and 238.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#D00300"><p>I have tabled amendments No. 240 and 258.  I hope the Minister will accept amendment No. 240.  Rather than putting the focus on housing alone, the amendment suggests that housing has to be developed in the context of sustainable development and creating sustainable communities.  That is very important.  I cannot see any reason the Minister would not accept this amendment.  We should be talking about developing housing in the context of sustainable development and sustainable communities.  I look forward to hearing the Minister say that he will be supporting the amendment.  I cannot see any reason he would not.</p> <p>  On amendment No. 258, the Minister said that no one is talking about unaffordable housing.  He said that there will be no full-price sales on the open market.</p><p>He has said that he is looking at up to 100% of homes built by the Land Development Agency on public lands being affordable and social homes.  At the same time, he has defended the recent decision by Fingal County Council to sell public land to a private developer so that 60% of those homes can be sold at full market prices.  On the one hand, he is saying 100% affordable and social housing is good while, on the other, he is defending sales of public land which provide for the majority of homes to be sold at full market price.  </p><p> In terms of the Land Development Agency, we will find out very quickly how serious the Minister is because if he is serious about not having any homes sold at full market price, he will be happy to accept my amendment.  Amendment No. 258 proposes to delete the words "a proportion of" so that, rather than having a proportion of all dwellings provided on relevant land and former relevant public land made available at a price below market price, all of them would be made available at a price below market price.  If the Minister is in any way serious about the comments he just made about not having any homes on these lands sold at full market price, he will be happy to accept my amendment No. 258.  I look forward to his support for it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-27a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2021052700002#E00200"><p>I assure Deputy O'Callaghan I am extremely serious about delivering affordable and social homes to the Land Development Agency at scale.  That is not just talking about it but actually doing something about it, as colleagues in Fingal County Council did on Tuesday.  I do not defend that by the way, but I welcome it.  The Deputy will have to explain, as Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Boyd Barrett did, why his colleagues voted against 238 social homes, 238 affordable homes and 150 cost rental homes.  That is for the Deputy to do.</p> <p>  We need to move on from the sound-bite element of the Deputy's contributions to dealing with the facts on the ground.  We need affordable and social homes at scale.  The Government has brought forward the largest housing budget in the history of the State to deliver 9,500 new builds and new social homes through our local authorities.  On top of that, the LDA will not supplant local authorities, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, but supplement them.  That is exactly what it will do and is what we intend it to do.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned Shanganagh Castle.  I accept that we are at the start of this Bill.  We can discuss specific sites and what has happened in the past but the reality is the housing on the Shanganagh Castle site will be 100% social and affordable.  I intend that the LDA will break ground on the site this year.  That is the position.  I will not accept these amendments.  </p> <p>  To go back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's point, it is a fact that the agency he wants will not be allowed to build or plan.  He wants a land management agency that cannot build homes or plan to build homes.  That is fundamentally what he has said today and also on Tuesday.  That is not a reasonable proposition or one that anyone could stand over.  If we all agree we need to utilise State-owned land productively for our people in the middle of a housing crisis, we had better get on with it.  </p> <p>  We are establishing the LDA as a commercial State company on the basis that we want the agency to be able to access the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and other funding in the future to be able to deliver.  This is so it can operate on a counter-cyclical basis and can have a real role in delivering housing.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin regularly refers to building 20,000 public homes each year but never says where they will be built, who will build them or how long it will take.  We have an agency that can add to our public and affordable housing stock by managing and developing State land above and beyond council land.  We need to get on with that.  </p> <p>  The amendments seek to amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect other amendments the Deputies have tabled.  While we are early in the Committee Stage process, we have been jumping from one grouping to another and referring to other amendments that are further down the line.  We will address those when we reach that part of the Bill.  As I said, I am open to looking at amendments that are reasonable if they will benefit the legislation and the operation of the agency.  I appreciate the consideration Deputies have given to the Bill and the detailed amendments they are seeking to have made.  However, I cannot accept the amendments to the Long Title in this group as they do not reflect the intent of the Bill.</p> <p>  The Bill seeks to increase supply of housing, particularly affordable and social homes, by ensuring that public land is not being underutilised by not being made available for housing.  It also provides for the establishment of the LDA as a commercial State body to deliver that housing.  There is obviously a fundamental difference between what the Government wants - a land development agency to deliver housing - and what Deputy &Oacute; Broin wants.  He has said he does not want the agency to develop homes and does not believe it should be involved in residential development.  That is not a reasonable proposition in any way, shape or form.</p> <p>  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA will be established as a designated activity company under the Companies Act.  This is in line with other commercial State bodies.  As I said, the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform will be the shareholders.  There will not be any other shareholders.  This will ensure the LDA is publicly owned, as it is.  Whatever way people want to try to twist the narrative, the agency will be fully publicly owned.  It is necessary that the LDA has a shareholding as this facilitates the &euro;1.25 billion investment from ISIF.  What is that money and investment from ISIF for?  It is to deliver social and affordable homes for our people.  Who could be against that?  </p> <p>  Under the programme for Government, the LDA is being assigned a key role in housing delivery and will also work as an additional resource, providing services to assist the local authorities, such as master-planning.  A couple of Deputies, including Deputy &Oacute; Broin, have said the LDA should not be involved in this.  One would have thought that should be a shared service and that on appropriate sites the LDA could offer its expertise to local authorities.  Is there something wrong with that?  I fail to see what is wrong with that, other than it is another opportunity for Members to find a reason not to support the Bill.  It is appropriate and in line with other State bodies that have a development role, such as IDA Ireland and the Grangegorman Development Agency.  It will not, however, have the full development agency role involving planning powers that local authorities have.  As I said on Tuesday, it will not have the full development agency role.  I will not be accepting these amendments.</p></speech>

If we are to get the kind of delivery we need, selling off that land to a private developer and not getting those badly needed 1,200 affordable and social homes is hugely regressive in terms of what needs to be done.</p> <p>  The Minister stated the amendments in this group, including my amendments, go against the intent of the Bill.  My amendment No. 240 provides that part of the function of the Bill is the creation of sustainable development and sustainable communities.  For clarity, the Minister is refusing my amendment because he believes the creation of sustainable development and sustainable communities goes against the intent of this Bill.  That is what he said.  He should explain why he does not believe the Land Development Agency, as part of its remit, should be interested in sustainable development and sustainable communities because that is exactly what my amendment is about.  </p> <p>  To be very clear, he also said that amendment No. 258 goes against the intent of this Bill.  Amendment No. 258, if passed, would provide that all homes delivered by the Land Development Agency on public lands would be sold at below market prices, not just a portion of them.  The Minister has confirmed that the intent of this Bill is that only a portion of homes delivered by the Land Development Agency on public lands will be sold at below market prices.  That simply does not tally with his earlier comments because by rejecting this amendment, he is clearly showing that he does not agree that all homes should be below full market prices on public lands delivered by the Land Development Agency.  I will certainly be pressing both amendments.</p></speech>

I was not ignoring the Deputy's question but it relates to the Affordable Housing Bill, which is not the Bill in front of us.  It is a matter of caps, not targets.  We are not setting affordability at the levels of the caps; rather, we are saying the cap in an area is unaffordable.  The measures being introduced in the Affordable Housing Bill, such as shared equity, direct-build affordable housing, cost rental and the increase in the Part 5 proportion from 10% to 20%, will help to deliver affordability in all areas.  The caps are based on the median sale price from the previous year.  They are not targets.  There will be houses priced well below them.  Again, it is a matter for the Affordable Housing Bill, not the Bill before us.  We will get to Part 9 of the latter later.  The reality is that we are not setting a target of &euro;450,000 for affordability.  It is not remotely like that so I ask the Deputy to examine the Affordable Housing Bill and the regulations when we publish them.  House prices will be well below the amount in question.  For the first time, through the Affordable Housing Bill, genuine assistance will be afforded to those who have been locked out of buying their own home for the past several years, and they will be helped in bridging the affordability gap.  That relates to the Affordable Housing Bill, which will be before the committee.  I look forward to that.</p></speech>

The credibility of the Land Development Agency Bill is entirely, or largely, dependent on what affordability means.  If affordability turns out to be unaffordable, the Land Development Agency will be as bad as some of us believe it is.  I asked the Minister a question and he did not answer it.  Batting it off to the discussion on the Affordable Housing Bill is not good enough.  I asked the Minister a very simple question: why is the cap different in different areas?

Both are significant Bills.  They were introduced by the Government within a year of its establishment.  The Land Development Agency Bill was in gestation for years but we have changed it and brought it forward.  It will have a genuine impact on delivering affordable and social homes on State agency land.  The Affordable Housing Bill is related but it is in addition.  It relates not only to affordable homes on public land but also to the provision of affordable housing on private lands.  Again, I would have expected Deputy Boyd Barrett to have welcomed that.  When we get to Part 9 of this Bill, we will be dealing with aligning the Affordable Housing Bill with the Land Development Agency Bill.</p> <p>  The differences in price caps, which are not targets, reflect the fact that there are different house prices in different parts of the country.  There are regional price caps because one size does not fit all in the Irish housing market.  In parts of the country, no private homes have been built in ten years.  The only homes that are being built are public homes.  Including throughout the midlands and north-west, there are large swathes of the country with a viability problem.  It will not be fixed in just one Bill.</p> <p>  The Bill, along with the Affordable Housing Bill, which will be proceeding to Committee Stage in the Seanad, contains real measures to help real people to own their own homes or, indeed, rent their own homes with State-backed cost rental.  That is what we are talking about.  Let us not get into conspiracy theories on this.  The Affordable Housing Bill is genuine legislation that is related to the Land Development Agency Bill.  I envisage the latter delivering affordable, social and cost rental housing at scale.  We cannot do that unless the agency is set up on foot of primary legislation.  In this way, we can capitalise the agency to the tune of &euro;1.25 billion.  This is Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, money.  I do not know whether Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett or others are opposed to that capitalisation.  It will allow the agency to borrow a further &euro;1.25 billion, thereby being capitalised initially with &euro;2.5 billion to deliver social and affordable homes at scale on State-owned lands that have been sitting idle for far too long.  I could get into more detail.</p></speech>

It is not just that members of the Traveller community have to wait longer times, whether for Traveller-specific accommodation or general needs social housing, but the failure of local authorities up to 2020 to spend the money the Government had given to them added to that scandal.  In fairness to the previous Government, it increased the Traveller accommodation budget to local authorities - modestly but it was an increase nonetheless.  In the years 2016 to 2019, however, only half of the total budget allocation was spent.  If that is compared with general needs social housing, in most of those years the Government came back seeking additional funds in a Supplementary Estimate.</p><p>Last year was different.  For the first year in a long time, 100% of the Traveller accommodation budget provided by the Department to local authorities was spent.  The problem is a large portion of that was not spent on new housing.  Of course, it was absolutely necessary for it to be spent on Covid-19-related safety measures, as well as other site improvements but until we start to deliver significant volumes of new Traveller-specific accommodation and larger general needs social housing to meet the needs of Traveller families, we will continue to have this problem.</p><p>Professor Michelle Norris, one of the members of the expert group on Traveller accommodation who presented to the committee previously, described this as an eminently solvable problem.  She outlined that there are legally binding Traveller accommodation programmes for local authorities, as well as budgetary allocations.  The number of individuals and households we are talking about is not very large but the failure of State institutions and, in particular in this instance, local authorities to do what they are meant to do to implement Traveller accommodation programmes is the starting problem.</p><p>I acknowledge the good work of the Minister of State, Deputy English, who headed up the expert review group on Traveller accommodation, which produced a very good report.  I also welcome the fact that in the programme for Government, the full implementation of that report is referenced, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is leading a subgroup of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee in regard to its implementation.  Nevertheless, given the role the Government is giving to the Land Development Agency, it seems remiss not to place the same legal obligation on the agency that currently exists with local authorities to deliver Traveller-specific accommodation.  My fear is that while the Minister may say nothing is preventing the LDA from including Traveller-specific accommodation in any of the sites it is developing or master-planning, my experience tells me that if something is not referenced specifically in the Bill, particularly in a section such as this, the likelihood of it not happening, particularly in light of the history of Traveller accommodation not being provided, is significant.</p><p>Both amendments Nos. 5 and 91 seek to place, in the two appropriate sections, a very clear legal obligation on the LDA, where it is involved in residential development or master-planning, to ensure there is appropriate provision of Traveller-specific accommodation to meet the needs of the Traveller community in those developments.  My amendment is not so specific as to state it has to be in every LDA development, although that is what I would ultimately like to see if we go down this route, but it would place an important legal obligation on them.  If that is not in the Bill, I think we will be back here in a year or two asking why the LDA is not contributing to the tackling of this important deficit in our housing system.</p></speech>

It is very important and it has to be included in the legislation.  If it is not, we run a high risk that it will just be something the LDA does not do because it will say it is not specifically in its remit and it is not listed in the legislation.  We will then be reliant on individuals in the management of the LDA, on its board or whatever to ensure this is included and that is not satisfactory, especially given the current deficits in Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  The report published by the Ombudsman for Children earlier this week details serious issues with accommodation and standards faced by Traveller children in particular in Cork.  It outlines problem with rat infestation, a lack of sanitary facilities or heating and damp conditions.  Children in the report describe their living conditions as hell, which is completely unacceptable for any group of children in this country.</p> <p>  It is really important that the Minister accept the amendment and we make a specific provision in the Bill.  I raised this issue with the Taoiseach in the House yesterday and he was quite supportive of seeing these sorts of issues resolved.  I hope the Minister will take on board the amendment.</p></speech>

Following on from our debate on the previous grouping of amendments, we need to be clear that the LDA is not a housing authority or a planning authority.  The primary responsibility for the delivery of homes and of Traveller accommodation is with the local authorities, and I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin on that.</p><p>Progress is being made in that space and we must ensure that continues through the local authorities.  Under section 14 of the Bill, the LDA can provide services directly to local authorities and that would include master planing and other development related works.  We want mixed developments as well.  They will have a role in the provision of social and affordable housing, and accommodation when requested for the Traveller community.</p><p> I want to look at the remit in more detail.  I have had discussions with the relevant Ministers about this, just to let the Deputies know.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has been doing an impressive job here.  He has intensified contacts in that regard to ensure local authorities spend what they have been given and deliver the new homes that we need them to.  We will come to this later, but I also had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, on asylum seekers and direct provision, where we see that happening and what State agencies can play a role in that space.</p><p> I am sympathetic to the position the Deputies have put forward.  It is something the LDA can have an impact on, but I just have to see how it fits best in that space.  Right now on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 5, because the LDA is not a housing authority or a planning authority and I do not want to, in any way, shape or form, dilute the authority or the responsibility of our local authorities across the country to deliver accommodation for the Traveller community.  We are making progress in that space and I do not want anything to take away from that, but I understand the reason the Deputies put forward this amendment.  I would like some time to look in more detail at how we can look at the remit of the LDA.  I expect, in some instances, that local authorities will, under section 14, receive requests to provide services in this space.  For the purpose of Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

We worked very well together on this issue when the Minister was in opposition, along with our former committee colleague, Senator Pat Casey.  At some point, we must grasp the nettle of tackling the real obstacles to the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is significant that the report by the expert group on Traveller accommodation was published in 2019.  While I know there has been some progress - our committee has written to the national Traveller consultative committee to get regular updates on that because the subcommittee looks at that - the big problem many of us have is that some of the key recommendations of that report around Part 8 planning powers and section 183 land disposals for ensuring the delivery of Traveller accommodation have yet to be progressed.  I have not seen them in the legislative programme.  They may be included in some of the Bills which the Minister intends to bring forward; he might tell us that.  The difficulty is that unless we have clear legislative commitments, the core issue of providing adequate supply of Traveller-specific accommodation, in a culturally appropriate way, will not happen.  This section of the Bill is the correct place to put that.</p> <p>  While I am not, in any way, trying to remove the obligation of local authorities in playing the lead role - they are the bodies that design and approve the five-year Traveller accommodation programmes - if this Bill is passed, which is likely given the Government majority support, the LDA will develop housing developments within the administrative areas of local authorities on lands which are not belonging to local authorities' lands.  We have seen this on a number of sites.  Therefore, it should have a legal obligation to explore, in conjunction with local authorities in the context of Traveller accommodation programmes, how its lands can be utilised to assist in this.  If the Minister is willing to give a commitment to explore the possibility of a Government amendment on Report Stage - I know he cannot commit definitively to this - I am willing to withdraw this amendment at this point.  To be clear, I will resubmit this amendment and amendment No. 91 on Report Stage, and I will press the amendments if the Minister, at that point, does not come back with something.  I accept his bona fides on this, but if there is no legislative requirement, there will be no guarantee it will happen and that is why it must be in the Bill.</p></speech>

We have a general housing crisis at the moment, but the housing crisis which is affecting Travellers is especially severe, not just in terms of conditions.  We also see that Travellers are greatly over-represented in the number of people who have become homeless.  Given that the LDA is, and will be, dealing with such a large amount of public land, if we do not have something specific in the Bill, a large amount of land which would have previously been available for social housing and specifically for Traveller accommodation, will be out of the equation.  It is very important that this is addressed and I hope the Minister can agree to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's suggestion.</p></speech>

We take on board what the Minister said.  I hope he will take on board the recommendations made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  There was a shocking report issued about a halting site in Cork.  The description given by the children who live there was unbelievable in this day and age.  We live in a society that allows children to grow up in this environment and it is something we must tackle.  We must support the local authorities, there is no doubt about that, but if the LDA Bill is to go through, and if the LDA deals with the amount of public land that is expected, Traveller accommodation must be considered as part of it.  It must be included and delivered on.  I support Deputy &Oacute; Broin's suggestion and I hope the Minister takes it on board.</p></speech>

It is particularly important because I fear that, as this Bill envisages, the involvement of private finance, commercial interests and so on, one will get the usual stuff occurring, which is the real answer as to why the affordable caps are different in different areas.  It is because they are worried about the impact on the market.  Those sorts of prejudices are often what drive anti-Traveller sentiment.  There have been efforts by certain political parties to cynically trade on anti-Traveller prejudices to stop Traveller-specific accommodation, because it will affect the price of housing.  That is a terrible prejudice.  A Member who was a Minister in the previous Government, I think she is now a Minister of State, helped get herself elected on the basis of opposing Traveller-specific accommodation on the Mount Anville site in our area.  I wonder whether that site will be given over to the LDA, which is designated for Traveller-specific accommodation but was opposed by Fine Gael councillors.  I wonder whether the requirement to provide Traveller-specific accommodation on sites like Mount Anville will be a legislative obligation.  I support what Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.</p></speech>

I fully understand the intent of the amendments.  To follow on from what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, I have always been, and continue to be, a full and unambiguous supporter of Traveller-specific accommodation and improving the lot of our Traveller community.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has been really engaged within the Department.  Last year was the first year the full allocation of &euro;14.5 million was spent on Traveller accommodation.  This year the capital budget is &euro;15.5 million and there are significant developments happening in that regard.  We have much work to do in this space.  There is no question about that.</p><p> I will give a commitment to look at this in more detail between now and Report Stage.  I will engage with Deputies on that.  This should not divide us because all of us on the committee want to ensure we are providing the Traveller accommodation that is needed.  I see the LDA having a role in that space.  I want to balance that with the fact that I do not want to see any dilution of responsibility for the local authorities.  Their fundamental principal responsibility is to deliver accommodation in this space as well as for social housing.</p><p> I am happy to look at this.  Useful amendments have been tabled.  I need a bit more time to see how we could advance this.  I reaffirm our absolute commitment to ensure we improve the lot of our Traveller community, particularly in the area of accommodation.  I am an unambiguous supporter of that programme, which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is driving in accordance with the commitments in the programme for Government in this area.  I will look at this in more detail, engage with the Deputies who tabled this amendment and look to come back with something before Report Stage, if that is agreeable.</p></speech>

The appalling accommodation regime that has been in place for people seeking asylum in our State is well documented.  Large numbers of people, many fleeing wars, persecution and economic devastation, come to our country seeking asylum.  We are a country that has had that experience ourselves.  There is probably not a generation of the families of any member of this committee which did not at some point in the 19th or 20th century have to leave Ireland for similar reasons.  Being a nation of emigrants, it surprises me that we have had such a poor State response to accommodating people who come here seeking asylum.</p><p>I acknowledge that, for the first time in 20 years, there is a programme for Government commitment to addressing this issue.  I also acknowledge the important work the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, has done in bringing forward a plan for bringing an end to direct provision and providing a human rights-compliant own-door accommodation system for people on a temporary basis while they wait for their asylum applications to be processed.</p><p>The key is in the implementation, and that brings me to this amendment.  The primary responsibility for transitioning to a human rights-compliant accommodation system for people applying for asylum will not rest with the Land Development Agency.  However, given that the agency is being set up to do large-scale residential developments at the direct delivery end and the planning end, it should also have a legal obligation to consider how it can best play a role in assisting the relevant Department and State agencies in what will be a very challenging task in the years ahead.  If it is not in this legislation, it will not happen.</p><p>We have many amendments so, to progress the debate more quickly, if the Minister was willing, as he was with the last, to give an undertaking to examine the issue, discuss it with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and consider a Government amendment on Report Stage, I would be happy to withdraw this amendment.  Given the scale of the development the Minister is promising under this legislation, I think it would be a real missed opportunity to ensure human rights-compliant own door accommodation for people in the asylum system.  To allow them to live with dignity in a traumatic system would be the right thing to do.  There needs to be in this section of the Bill an explicit commitment to play a role in this.</p></speech>

It affords me the opportunity to mention a couple of things with regard to the work I have been doing with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I recognise the commitment in the programme for Government to ending direct provision.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has done an incredible amount of work on that, into which we fed through the White Paper and the process with Catherine Day.  We are really focused on doing it.</p> <p>  I have already agreed with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and we have set up a mechanism to look at this, so there is a focus on housing those with direct provision and the main responsibility would lie with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We will assist in that process very specifically with the Housing Agency.  That has been put into the White Paper.  The Housing Agency and the expertise will provide expert advise on sourcing, delivering and managing housing and accommodation.</p> <p>  Our local authorities have already quietly been doing much work in this space over recent years for those whose status has been regularised, helping them source permanent accommodation.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is engaging in that.  There will potentially be elements of change within that as to how local authorities interact with the asylum seeker process, and that has been outlined in the White Paper.</p> <p>  While I fully understand and respect the intent here, it might be premature in the process to tie this in right now.  I would be happy to come back with a detailed note in advance of the next Stage on the work we have been doing with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and on how the Housing Agency will work with the local authorities and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We know we need to provide a certain number of homes each year in this space.  We are focused on ending direct provision for those who have languished in it for far too long.  We are committed to that and the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and McEntee, and I have met on this issue.  We are committed to doing everything we can to ensure we make good on the commitment in the programme for Government.  Much detailed work has been done already in this space.</p> <p>  I am happy to provide a briefing to members on this to see how we could move this on.  It is similar but not the same as the previous issue because we are well advanced on a new phase of ending direct provision and I do not want to do anything that might further complicate that matter in relation to the focus the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's Department has shown in this space.</p> <p>  I assure colleagues we are assisting in every way we can and have agreed that the Housing Agency will have a specific role with regard to sourcing, delivery and management of housing and accommodation to ensure those in indirect provision can exit from it.</p></speech>

I am not arguing that local authorities or the LDA should be providing that accommodation.  My understanding of the White Paper from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is that the outworkings of the work described by the Minister will provide a mechanism to deliver that accommodation.  The problem is that mechanism will not have any land.  The provision of land will be key.  Again, I am happy to withdraw this amendment, but I would urge the Minister to go one step further than his commitment to give us a paper.  I think a briefing note would be very useful, and we would welcome that, but the provision of land will be key to whether whatever mechanism emerges out of the White Paper is able to deliver on the very ambitious, and rightly so, timetable that is set out in that White Paper.  I am not asking the Minister to commit 100% to bringing back his own amendment.  I am asking him to consider whether to place some kind of obligation on the LDA to assist in the provision of land, where that is appropriate, in the context of the relevant agencies delivering on the human rights-compliant own-door accommodation system for asylum applicants.  I am asking him to at least consider that as an amendment.  If he decides not to do that, we can re-table these amendments on Report Stage.  </p><p> The Minister will know as well as I do that land is a key element in the delivery of this stream.  Given the volumes of land that the Minister is promising will go through the books of the LDA, giving it some role in assisting the State in making an appropriate portion of that land available for human rights-compliant own-door accommodation would be the right thing to do.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but I would ask the Minister to comment on whether he will, at least, examine the possibility of a Report Stage amendment from Government on this issue.</p></speech>

More work is needed on the amendment.  As drafted, it asks that land be provided for the provision of accommodation for those from the asylum application process.  I am sure that like me Deputy &Oacute; Broin would not like to see any unintended consequences arising from the designation of land within a development for asylum seekers.  That would be very problematic and it could to lead to many other issues.  I am not raising the spectre of far right, but, unfortunately, there are some in this space who could argue that particular land is land for the asylum seekers and we are not providing homes for our people.  All of us want integrated communities.  We want developments that will be available to all of our people, whether born in Ireland or not.  Our focus is on ending the direct provision system and providing a real mechanism through which to get people into permanent accommodation.</p> <p>  I could take another look at the proposal, but the Deputy would, probably, agree that the wording of it as tabled might be, in an unintended way, problematic.  I will ensure there is a briefing on the matter for members who are interested.  I am happy to take another look at it, but I do not want to do anything that will impact on what we have already agreed with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on foot of the White Paper.  I believe we now have a plan that will deliver homes and ensure direct provision is ended by this Government, and by this Oireachtas.  The idea of designating a specific proportion of land in a Land Development Agency portfolio, or in a specific development, as land for asylum seeks would, in and of itself, be problematic.  I give a commitment that we will engage further on this aspect.  It is important.  As I mentioned in regard to the previous amendment, the Land Development Agency, when asked to perform certain functions under section 14, or requests from local authorities, would activate at that stage.  The Housing Agency is already tied into this particular process.  I will brief members further on that.  We can arrange to have a full briefing such that they are clearer on what is planned between myself and the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and the acting Minister for Justice, Heather Humphreys.  I appreciate Deputies' co-operation in that regard.</p></speech>

For me, amendment No. 9 is important.  There is a very unfortunate language that has become pervasive in a lot of housing policy documents.  It started many years ago in housing policy documents approved by previous Governments, but it has become a way of talking about social housing, in particular housing for working class people that, in my personal view, is inaccurate, is not backed up by evidence and is deeply patronising to the communities who live in that housing.  We often hear some people talk about large local authority housing estates as, in all circumstance, producing ghettos and being centres of crime and social alienation.  We know from very significant research from Tony Fahey and Michelle Norris and others over a decade and a half that the overwhelming majority of our local authority housing estates are really good places to live.  They have settled and sustained communities.  While there are issues in terms of under-funding of key resources, they are places where people are happy to live and want to live.  They are places in which their children want to live.  Most of us in this room who represent people living in large local authority housing estates know that people would chew off one's right and left arm to get a house in one of those estates because they are seen as vibrant communities.  </p><p>Unfortunately, when people talk about mixed tenure, there is a tendency for the thinking to be that there should not be too many working class homes in one place.  If is perfectly acceptable under existing law for a large private development to offset its Part 5 obligations to have 10% social by locating that social in another area and having 100% private housing in a development, often many hundreds of apartments or houses.  The idea that having more than 75 or 90 social houses in a particular location, in all instances, is inherently a problem is a mistake.  The research from Tony Fahey and Michelle Norris makes it clear that the issue is not tenure, it is income.  One of the reasons the majority of our local authority housing estates are great places to live is because they have great mixed income and sustainable communities.  People may all have the same tenure or they may have mixed tenure between tenant purchase and so on, but that mix of income, occupation and people makes those communities sustainable.</p><p>The language I seek to replace in this section is, therefore, problematic.  It is patronising.  Instead, we should be positive and say that the priority of the LDA or whoever is developing public housing - and the Minister will know that, in my view, it should be the local authorities but we have already had that discussion - should be "to ensure the delivery of vibrant and sustainable mixed income communities".  Tenure is a secondary issue.  It is really important that we get this language right.</p><p> For example, there are a number of mixed tenure communities that were built during the Celtic tiger era that are, unfortunately, as segregated as large monotenure estates.  Even though they appear to be mixed tenure on paper, the social housing is all in one place, affordable housing in another and higher-end private housing in a third.  Within such housing estates, therefore, the level of segregation is very significant.  As we move towards more apartment developments, the same phenomenon arises because it is financially more viable for the social housing required under Part 5 to be in a single apartment block.  I am trying to find much better wording to describe what should be a key objective of all of us who advocate for increased amounts of public housing.  The priority should be sustainable, vibrant mixed-income communities.  We should really dispense with this old, out-of-date, patronising language, which stigmatises many working-class communities very unfairly.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 10 seeks to delete references to "undue segregation" included in the Bill while No. 11 seeks to replace the term "social background" with "incomes".  I also aim to replace references to counteracting undue segregation of persons to again emphasise incomes rather than social backgrounds, which is what the Bill does.  Amendment No. 37 proposes making reference to "a broad range of incomes".</p> <p>  I will explain the thinking behind this.  I feel very strongly about this issue.  In the D&aacute;il last night, we discussed apartheid against Palestinians.  What we are talking about here is social apartheid and housing apartheid, which has always existed in the Irish housing sector but which has got considerably worse.  The prejudice against social housing and housing for working-class people has reached such a level in Government thinking that a form of social and housing apartheid has become institutionalised.  This Bill replicates that, as does the general thinking of Government and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of the provision of social housing.</p> <p>  Let me explain what I mean.  What on earth does "undue segregation" mean?  Is there a due form of segregation?  There is undue segregation, which must be avoided, but perhaps there is segregation that is legitimate and due.  It is absolutely outrageous.  There is no acceptable level of segregation at all.  Of course, the reason the Government has included "undue segregation" in the Bill is that it is aware that segregation is widespread.  </p> <p>  How does the segregation manifest?  It manifests in the Government's refusal to raise income thresholds for eligibility for social housing lists.  This refusal means that those who qualify for social housing are on ever lower incomes.  Whereas, in the past, bus workers, nurses, postal workers and bank workers could get on a social housing list, none of them can do so anymore.  They cannot afford housing on the open market but they are not eligible for social housing because the Government is using social housing to segregate people on the very lowest incomes.  This perpetuates and deepens the level of segregation which social housing traditionally avoided because it was available to people on a broad range of incomes.  People on middle and even sometimes high incomes would live alongside people on very low incomes and all were eligible for social housing.  In my view, if we want to avoid segregation and apartheid, there should be no income thresholds.  Anybody should be able to go on a social housing list.  If this is not allowed, it is implied that there is something wrong with social housing.  In much of Europe, everybody from the university professor and the doctor to the council worker, the nurse and the person who is dependent on social welfare lives in social housing.  That is how to avoid any form of segregation, not only this undue segregation.</p> <p>  The other reason the Government has used this phrase "undue segregation" is that segregation is a standard feature of the social housing component of private developments under Part 5.  In my area, there is a very big development on the former golf course in D&uacute;n Laoghaire called Honeypark and Cualanor.  How does the so-called mixed tenure which the Government says it favours to deal with so-called undue segregation manifest in this development?  All the social housing tenants are in one block and kept absolutely separate.  In many cases the actual quality of the accommodation, including the finishes and general standards, for the social housing component and the private component is different, perpetuating the apartheid.</p></speech>

The Government now envisages that certain people will be social housing tenants, certain people will have cost-rental accommodation, certain people will purchase affordable homes and certain people will be the sort of people who buy in the private market.  In other words, there is to be a sort of caste system of housing which perpetuates and institutionalises this notion of segregation rather than removing it.  The State should build housing that does not distinguish between so-called social backgrounds.  It should provide housing that is affordable based on people's incomes and which is available to people on a broad range of incomes.  That is the logic of the amendment.</p></speech>

It is not on the amendment.  Obviously, it is taking us some time to get through this, although we have got through approximately half of the amendments at this stage.  It would be valuable if the Chair and the clerk of the committee were able to get consecutive meetings for next week so that we could try to finish out the discussion.  While we want to have proper scrutiny, we also need to get through this because we have other work on the programme.  As we will not have a private session until next week, may I informally suggest that the Chairman try to seek two select committee meetings consecutively on the same day with a break of half an hour?  Some other committees have held such meetings before.</p><p>We might be able to get through it that way.  I am also conscious of the Minister's diary.</p></speech>
