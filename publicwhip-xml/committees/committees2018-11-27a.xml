Apologies have been received from Deputies Pearse Doherty and Michael McGrath.  Deputies Quinlivan and Eugene Murphy are attending in substitution for them.  We are considering the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 13 for the Office of Public Works on foot of the order of the D&aacute;il of 21 November that it be referred to the select committee.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112700002#B00300"><p>I am here as Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with special responsibility for the Office of Public Works and flood relief to present a proposal for a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;20 million for the Office of Public Works, OPW.  The Supplementary Estimate will bring the 2018 net Estimate for the Vote to &euro;424.214 million.  The gross Supplementary Estimate is &euro;22 million which comprises costs of &euro;18 million associated with the papal visit this year and an estimated additional spend of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions.</p> <p>  The Government agreed to facilitate a visit by Pope Francis to the World Meeting of Families during August.  It was a large and complex event.  The OPW, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, devised the papal visit management plan with the World Meeting of Families, adopting a whole-of-government approach to ensure the health, safety and welfare of participants and visitors.  In implementing the plan the OPW did outstanding work to facilitate the event.  It facilitated the safety of all involved, while at the same time showcasing, nationally and internationally, the attractiveness of Ireland as a country and its ability to host such an event.  Like any event of this magnitude, there are associated costs involved which, in this case, amount to &euro;18 million.  As the event had not been finalised when the 2018 Estimates were published this time last year, the OPW Vote contained no allocation in the 2018 Estimate for the visit.</p> <p>  The OPW also expended an additional sum of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions.  They include work on Leinster House and the rationalisation programme for the Department of Justice and Equality which was committed to in 2019 but advanced by the OPW to 2018.  In order to reduce the required Supplementary Estimate, I have sought to allocate &euro;2 million in additional appropriations-in-aid received by the OPW against this request, thereby reducing the requirement to &euro;20 million.  It is worth noting that the OPW expects to provide &euro;25.749 million for the Exchequer for appropriations-in-aid in 2018.  The vast bulk of this income is from the effective promotion of Ireland's heritage sites and efficient management of visitor demands and events at managed facilities of the OPW, including Dublin Castle, Kilkenny Castle and Castletown House.</p> <p>  The request for the Supplementary Estimate feeds from efficient and effective work undertaken by the OPW on behalf of the Government.  I am happy to recommend it for consideration and approval by the committee and answer questions members may have about the additional requirement.  If some of the questions are technical, my officials will be able to provide assistance.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State might explain the work being done in Leinster House.  He referred to projects, including Leinster House, in the context of additional expenditure in 2018.  It is not just on the Pope's visit as it includes other figures.</p></speech>

There are works being carried out, but the refurbishment work on the electrics in different areas of Leinster House is the reason we require some of the supplemental money.</p></speech>

There is the main refurbishment of the old historical Leinster House which is under way.  The entire project will be completed by the summer of next year.  However, other works were undertaken on the Oireachtas campus.  The Chairman will recall the relocation of the Seanad Chamber to the Ceramic Room in the National Museum of Ireland, as well as the refurbishment of the committee rooms that was carried out during the summer.  There were other works of that nature.  It is an accumulation of smaller works contracts that are separate from the main refurbishment project.</p></speech>

It was a huge logistical exercise, involving dozens of contractors, all procured under frameworks and in accordance with the rules and regulations.  We also deployed much of our direct labour force.  We had set-ups in ten areas, not just the Phoenix Park, although the one there was by far the biggest.  We also had set-ups at Dublin Airport, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, the Dublin Castle State Apartments, along the papal city route, at St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral, the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People, Knock airport, Knock, Knock Shrine, as well as the three media centre set-ups.  It was an enormous logistical exercise and from a management perspective we were delighted with the outcome and how it went.  There were no incidents or accidents.  It should be said, with reference to the previous papal mass in 1979 and the one this year, that health and safety represent a far more prevalent requirement now than it might have been in 1979.  It required many onerous but necessary actions by us.</p> <p>  I will not go through the process of how we got to it as the committee is interested in the cost.  The cost of which we are absolutely sure, in other words, what has already been paid, is &euro;16.5 million.  There is a further expense of approximately &euro;800,000, of which the biggest element is the cost of meeting the condition of Dublin City Council which allowed us to take down the Phoenix Park gates.  We took down most but not all of the park gates for health and safety reasons and to allow people in and out.  The condition was that we would refurbish them and put them back up.  In fact, they were taken down in 1979 and put back up again.  They were taken down again in 2018.  They are the old historical metal gates in the park which have huge heritage value.</p><p>The cost of refurbishing them has not yet been quantified.  We have an idea, but we do not know the precise cost.</p></speech>

He has said &euro;16 million was paid out.  Therefore, why is he not sure about the remaining &euro;2 million?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McMahon" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018112700002#D00500"><p>The gates were taken down under contract.  It is a separate contract and the gates are now in storage.  The work that has to be done on them is very specialised and technical and being assessed before going to tender.  It will not be done for the next six or seven months, when the original gates will be put back up.  Temporary gates are in place.</p></speech>

It is estimated that approximately &euro;800,000 will need to be spent as a consequence of the papal visit.  That will bring us up to a figure of &euro;17.4 million.</p></speech>

If the OPW spent &euro;5 million on camera platforms, media risers and so on, I expect Mr. McMahon to be able to tell us that there were four or five quotations and that the tender was awarded to an Irish firm or whoever else.</p></speech>

However, I want to ask about a number of matters both in this case and regarding the fact that the park does not receive any money from some enormous lucrative events that are held there.</p> <p>  At the time of the Pope's visit, one particular firm's signs were all over the place, namely, a company called Actavo.  Was this company on a informal contract or was it a preferred bidder?  It seemed, to expand on what the Chairman was asking, to be providing a vast amount of the facilities at the time of the Pope's visit.  Can Mr. McMahon enlighten us as to whether Actavo was contracted for that?  What kind of money was Actavo getting in OPW contracts in the context of the Pope's visit?</p></speech>

The company was contracted on the basis of a framework contract that was already in place.  As I explained earlier, as we do many events other than the papal mass, we have framework contracts in place from which we draw.  The drawing on the framework contracts in this instance was necessitated by the fact that the confirmation of the papal visit and the State support for it only happened in the middle of the year, in mid-June, and we only had weeks to prepare for that.</p></speech>

Many of them are small businesses.  In fact, as with the walled garden and the organic vegetables, it is fantastic.  I was merely surprised that none of them seemed to have been involved in being preferred caterers, other than being asked to be open.  Clearly, when staff and members of the Garda were working in the final days of the preparation, they had more business.  I am really concerned.  My understanding is that Actavo is part of Mr. Denis O'Brien's commercial interests and he is either the managing director or chairperson of that company.</p><p>There are many small cafes in the park and I am not aware that they are part of bigger conglomerates.  I merely wonder what role, if any, did such businesses in the food sector, which could involve people from Kilkenny, Carlow or anywhere around Ireland, play in the papal mass.  Everything seemed to be stamped "Actavo".  The company seemed to dominate everything in what was a world conference.  Normally, one would expect local providers.  I am aware the Pope's visit was not confirmed until late.  I want to be fair but I would like to know about that.</p><p> There were Ed Sheeran concerts in the park earlier in the year which, I am told, were fabulously successful but I am not aware that a ha'penny of any of the money made on them went back into the park.  I accept there is an estimate here for the railings.  For those who might not know the park, the railings are historically important and practically must be remade by expert craftspeople over a long period.  I understand that.  In the case of the Bloom festival, for example, there was considerable traffic congestion all around the park for days and residents were basically locked in their homes.  Can the OPW confirm whether anything went back into the park from the Bloom receipts and the Ed Sheeran concerts?</p><p> Much work needs to be done in the park.  I commend the OPW on the work it has commenced on the Magazine Fort, in reinstating what is a bit of a ruin and a wreck, and which will eventually be a world-class attraction for Dublin.  I am aware, from acquaintances who are working on that project, that it will take years because there is an insufficient supply of funding.  Significant events are being run in the park, they are packed out but yet the park itself, and for that matter, the OPW, seem to be getting nothing back.  Did any money from the Bloom festival or from the super-successful, fantastic Ed Sheeran concerts go towards park infrastructure?  I ask because local residents agreed to put up with a lot of disruption on the understanding there would be a dividend for both the park and the OPW for all of the infrastructure it looks after well around the country.  I put it to the OPW that there needs to be a return from these important public events and I would like an account of it.</p><p> All I can say is whoever organised the Pope's visit - it was not the OPW, as it was a taker of orders based on a Government decision - scared most older people in Ireland into thinking that they could not do a two-mile walk up the main avenue.  Those in charge of health and safety went overboard.  People in wheelchairs were not allowed on the main avenue.  Buses, which could have picked up many participants, were not allowed on the main avenue.  Did the church group, which was organising it, call the shots on that?  There needs to be a re-evaluation.</p><p> During the first papal visit to Ireland years ago, there were none of these holding pens and gates.  For many, these destroyed the visit because where a family booked four tickets, they got one ticket for one gate, a ticket for another gate and a further ticket for yet another gate.  The park walls, as I am sure the OPW officials will be aware, are nine miles long.  Can the officials imagine a case where a person's mother gets a ticket for one gate, the person's ticket is for a gate two miles away, her husband's ticket is for a gate two miles away from there and the person's granny's ticket is for a gate a further two miles away.  Whoever designed that system, it was mental.  Many elderly people, people in wheelchairs and people with weaker health, who were among those who were keenest to see the Pope in person, were told they were putting themselves at threat.</p><p> The third aspect I want to ask about is the big bill for medical aid.</p><p>Is that in addition to what the Irish Red Cross and the Civil Defence were doing?  They are based in the Department.  I will finish on this one.</p></speech>

The medical provision relates to on-site medical care.  There are hospitals in the general vicinity.  It was expected that we would have a crowd of 500,000 or more in the Phoenix Park alone.  It did not work out that way in the end.  I am talking about the prediction before the event took place.  We also had to provide on-site medical facilities at the other nine or ten venues where we were involved in logistical arrangements for the papal visit.  It was not just the Phoenix Park where we had to make this provision.  It was also needed at the State apartments at Dublin Castle, the papal city route, St. Mary's Pro Cathedral, the Capuchin Day Centre and other locations, particularly Knock.  These on-site medical costs were required.  It turned out to be a very wet day.  I was personally quite concerned about slips, trips and falls on such a wet day.  I have been told that there were a couple of small injuries, but we were very lucky that there was nothing significant.  No bones were broken anyway.</p> <p>  The OPW had no involvement in the issuing of tickets for the event.  That was handled by the Catholic Church as part of the World Meeting of Families.  All of the ticketing arrangements were done by the World Meeting of Families as the event organisers.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, over 1 million people were reportedly in the Phoenix Park in 1979.  I have heard doubts and questions about that figure because there were no counters involved.  We had counters at this year's event.  For control reasons, we knew exactly how many people were coming in through the gates.  No such facilities were used in 1979.  I do not know whether 1 million people were there.  Anyway, let us say that there were.  It was expected that over 500,000 people would show up at this year's event.  Corralling is a necessary control mechanism for a crowd of that size.  As it turned out, a crowd of that size did not show up.  We had to plan on the basis of the best guess prior to the event, which was that there would be more than 500,000 people in attendance.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the effect on the park of three big events that were held there this year - the Ed Sheeran concerts, the Bloom festival, which is in its tenth or 11th year, and the papal visit, which thankfully does not happen very often.  We hosted a multiplicity of things as well as those events.  We host up to 300 events in the Phoenix Park every year, including charity runs.  Approximately 10 million people visit the park every year.  Over 10 million people of all shapes and sizes come in through the gates to do all sorts of things.  I refer, for example, to commuters and those who visit various facilities in the park, including Dublin Zoo and Farmleigh.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for her kind comments about the Phoenix Park.  We are very proud of how good a facility it is.  Deputies might not be aware that it recently won a gold medal at the world urban parks conference in Melbourne.  We are very proud of that as well.  We think we present the Phoenix Park to an exceptionally high standard.  That has been verified by an international benchmark.  I am not saying I could not do even better things with the Phoenix Park if I had an open chequebook.  I would be delighted to do so.</p></speech>

It has grown from very small beginnings into a major event that rivals the Chelsea Flower Show or any similar event.  It is a unique event because it is not just a flower show like Chelsea; it is also a mechanism for small producers of all sorts of food and other artefacts and heritage items, including some of the people about whom the Deputy spoke earlier, to sell their wares.  It is a big showcase for them every year.  The way we look at it is that we are supporting indigenous Irish industry and indigenous Irish food by agreeing to allow-----</p></speech>

I am following up on what the Chairman said.  We know there are costs involved, but is there a kind of financial construct whereby the venues get some reinvestment back through the State from hosting these events?  As I have mentioned, when these mega-events happen, by and large, those who live in the neighbourhood are unable to move out of their houses.  They support these events for the sake of the facilities in the park.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it does not work that way for us.  Any income we get, like the &euro;600,000 I have mentioned, goes into appropriations-in-aid and is returned to the Exchequer.  We have to argue during the Estimates process for moneys to invest in the Phoenix Park and all of our other heritage assets.  We hope and expect that the Government will recognise that these facilities generate income, and support them during the Estimates process by making investment over a prolonged period of time.  As I have said, I cannot lay a hand on a penny of the money that comes in.  I am afraid that is the way it is.  I wish it were otherwise.</p></speech>

It may been outside operators delivering people to the event but when the routes were determined, it emerged that there were branches overhanging them.  This was particularly the case in Knock.  I know this for a fact because I visited Knock.  The route around the shrine is nicely landscaped but the trees there had grown over the years.  When the route for vehicles was determined by the local organisers, health and safety reasons - it always involves health and safety - the branches had to be cut back.  That was the solution.</p></speech>

We are talking about the Phoenix Park but we must take the other areas visited by the Pope into consideration.  Let us take Knock, which I visited, and the Phoenix Park.  A total of 4,000 people worked to make this site available for the Pope's visit.  Can we learn from how the ticketing was organised?  Yes, we can but the OPW was given a task to put forward with regard to the Pope's visit and we did that.  We acknowledge that there is significant cost involved but if something happened and we did not do what we were told to do, the conversation we are having here today would be different.  We got that event up and running with no major injuries or anything like that.</p> <p>  There are costs involved.</p><p>Deputy Quinlivan referred to the gates.

I cannot understand why some smaller businesses and providers would not have got a shot at it.  We should remember that the park is on the edge of Dublin so I would have thought that anyone within a two-hour radius of Dublin or even further would have been quite interested in that tender.  Was Actavo the only one selected?  Was it because it had the exclusive expertise?</p></speech>

The firms that got the work were procured through invitation and tender on existing frameworks, it was not just a case of selecting on the basis of a single tender for this project.  That did not happen; the firms were already on our frameworks.  It is a case of horses for courses.</p></speech>

It got a significant proportion but it was on our framework and had the scale, capacity and experience to deal with an event of this size.  Ideally, we would love to engage a multiplicity of smaller contractors but for the management necessary to knit an event of this magnitude together, one really needs firms with experience and scale.  It is like building work.  One would not get small house builders to build large buildings because they do not have the capacity or experience.  That is the analogy I would use.</p> <p>  The OPW has a good record in terms of apprenticeships.  The Deputy will recall that during the recession, we had conversations at other fora.</p></speech>

That type of work would include work on the gates.  We have taken on some apprentices in the metalwork area.  The gates in the Phoenix Park represent a significant job.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned repainting.  This is not just about repainting the gates; it involves refurbishment and, in some cases, reconstruction.  The gates suffered as a result of being taken down in 1979 and put back up again.  A proper job was not done then.  I cannot say why but it was not done.</p><p>We were obliged to obtain a licence from Dublin City Council in order to hold the event.  This was not required in 1979.  Part of the conditionality around the 2018 event licence for the Pope's mass was that we would refurbish the gates properly.  We are complying with that condition but we wanted to do it in any event.</p></speech>

There are not that many foundries.  I come from a family of foundry workers and I know much about the trade.  There are not that many foundry businesses, although there are some, particularly north of the Border.  My general understanding is that much of this work will go abroad.

The Deputy knows that if we leave something alone, it is okay for longer than if we go at it.

What was the cost to the Army of the Defence Forces personnel working in this way?  There are barracks in the area and other public representatives and I received many complaints about how badly Defence Forces personnel were treated.  They were bivouacked in the trees around Farmleigh and the weather was terrible.  These personnel were not treated with the dignity they deserved.  I am not saying the OPW is responsible but we are only looking at part of the cost of this.  Some people, including those in the Defence Forces and the Garda, gave much service to the event.  What would it have cost for the services provided by the Defence Forces if it was categorised in the same way as the costs of the private security firms listed?  Was somebody from a private security firm on &euro;100 per day or a minimum or living wage?  Our soldiers were not treated very well, although this was not the direct responsibility of the OPW.  At events like this, where Defence Forces personnel are used, they should be treated with dignity and get at least the same consideration as others.  Is there a daily rate for what the private security personnel received?</p></speech>

We asked for volunteers in the OPW.</p><p>Many people volunteered both in Knock and Dublin, particularly in Knock.  As to what it cost the Defence Forces, I am not sure it cost anything in terms of their wages because they were being paid anyway.  I do not think there was any additional cost in having them in the Phoenix Park as opposed to having them in barracks or anywhere else.  That is just my own surmise.</p></speech>

It was an atrocious day but I think Army personnel are well kitted out in terms of protection against the elements.</p> <p>  I wanted to come back to something the Deputy said earlier about the effect of the events in the Phoenix Park.  Even though the park is a big place, there is no doubt that the various events impact on the locality which Deputy Burton represents.  I am fully aware of that.  As a public sector organisation, the OPW wants to be good neighbours to everybody in the area.  To that extent we will engage, as we do in any case through ongoing consultation, in a more intense consultation with our neighbours and internal stakeholders in the park, as well as residents associations and others who are impacted by the park.  That will take place in the new year.  The Deputy might be glad to hear that.  Would the Minister of State like to add anything?</p></speech>

The Deputy may wish to raise matters related to the Defence Forces with the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, as they are not matters for the OPW.</p></speech>

Well done to Mr. McMahon and all the staff involved.  We do not want to lose sight of that.  I seek some clarification on park repairs.  The OPW reportedly sought &euro;924,000 from the State coffers to renovate the Phoenix Park in preparation for the event.  All the gates were to be removed to improve the flow of pedestrian traffic.  I presume the OPW did not need &euro;924,000.  Does the &euro;600,000 figure here refer to the amount spent?</p></speech>

Maintaining, caring for and presenting parks takes place on an ongoing basis obviously.  The grass has to be cut, the flora and fauna looked after, the deer managed and everything else.  Hosting this event was a huge exercise.  There were other significant bits and pieces, a multiplicity of smaller works, that needed to be done to prepare for it.  For example, designated walkways had to be taped off from the main gates up to the event area.  There was an awful lot of stuff like that to be done.</p></speech>

Should we request a far more detailed breakdown of the figures for further consideration?  No one is questioning the event, how it went off or stuff that could or could not have happened.  We are satisfied that the OPW did its job.  However, our job is to check the figures and I am not satisfied with the figures, as presented, or the answers we have been given.  I ask the OPW to resubmit a more detailed breakdown indicating which companies won the contracts and providing detail on the procurement process it used to piggy-back on, as Mr. McMahon put it.  We need to know that.</p></speech>

Given that the OPW gives it as a contribution to Bord Bia, I think we need to know the parameters.  Public parks are important for families and everybody else to enjoy and we need to keep investing in them.</p><p>I would ask the same about the arrangement with MCD for the Ed Sheeran concerts.  I am delighted to hear Mr. McMahon say there is going to be a public consultation and I know a lot of people will be interested in taking part.  Many people are willing to be supportive because they understand something is going back.  If it is all just going to private operators, I think we should be told.</p></speech>

We have been tasked to do this job by the Ceann Comhairle and the D&aacute;il.  That is what we are doing.  The Committee of Public Accounts can review it after the spend.

That crystallised during the course of the year.  Through good management, I would like to say, we succeeded in reducing that cost to what it is now, the figure we are asking this committee to approve.  As to the overall cost of the event, I am not so sure.  I am only focusing my mind on the OPW.</p></speech>

At our previous meeting with the Minister of State on an Estimate, I placed on record an issue in respect of Durrow Abbey in County Offaly. I am deeply disappointed that the matter has not been resolved and that a heritage site of value to the State, now leased to an arts for peace project, has been dealt with in such a way.  I know there was mediation and letters were sent to and fro.  I am aware the council in that county is interested.  I appealed to the Minister of State and his officials before and it has come to naught.  I intend to raise the matter again at the next meeting.  If common sense had prevailed, we might have got to the end of it.  In respect of the Estimate the Minister of State is looking for today, some of it might have been found in the accounts if he was to look at the cost of legal fees arising out of the Durrow Abbey case.  I have no intention of letting it go.  I have serious questions that I am going to put to the Minister of State, not today but the next time.  I will submit my questions to him.  I can assure him that in the interests of the State and taxpayers' money, I have no intention of allowing this go without some genuine and sincere effort on his side to resolve it.</p></speech>
