The scheme has been in existence in various forms in Ireland since the 1970s.  It was previously known as the disadvantaged areas scheme and the less favoured areas scheme.  In its various iterations it has played a very important income support role for farmers in many areas of the country.  To date in 2018, &euro;216 million has been paid to 89,000 farmers under the scheme.  Over the course of the scheme year, a total of &euro;227 million will be paid to 96,000 farmers.  This is indicative of the importance and size of the scheme in Ireland.</p> <p>  I will now outline the new approach to designating eligible lands under the scheme.  Until 2018, Ireland had identified areas eligible under the scheme using a range of socioeconomic indicators such as family farm income, population density, percentage of the working population engaged in agriculture and stocking density.</p><p>This approach is now required to change on foot of EU regulations.</p><p> The genesis of the change in approach lies in discussions at EU level whereby concerns were raised by the European Court of Auditors as to the inconsistent approach taken across member states in the designation of land using socioeconomic indicators.  From 2019 eligible areas must instead be designated using the following list of bio-physical criteria: low temperature; dryness; excess soil moisture; limited soil drainage; unfavourable texture and stoniness; shallow rooting depth; poor chemical properties; and steep slope.  All EU member states that wish to implement the ANC scheme in 2019 must use this new approach to identifying lands, or else take the other option of continuing the old approach but with sharp cuts to payments for all beneficiaries.  The approach of continuing the current system with sharp cuts across the scheme is not a viable one for Ireland, given the importance of the scheme.</p><p> How were eligible areas for 2019 identified?  The process of identifying eligible areas has been carried out at townland level.  Essentially, where a townland displays one or more of the biophysical criteria listed above at a level above the 60% threshold set out in the regulation, it is identified as being "constrained".  In parallel to this biophysical approach, two other processes set out in the EU regulations have been used to refine the identification of eligible land.  First, a number of areas were identified as having overcome the constraint by reference to high levels of stocking density and arable land cover, and are thus not eligible for the 2019 ANC scheme.  This is referred to as the "fine tuning" in the EU regulations and was a mandatory step for all member states.  Second, areas were identified as eligible for the 2019 scheme as they are facing other specific constraints.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this process identified townlands as eligible areas of specific environmental importance and townlands facing structural issues relating to farm size, field size, farm fragmentation and the level of permanent grassland cover.  Taken together, these steps have identified the lands deemed to now be eligible under the scheme.</p><p> What are the impact of these changes?  This has been a lengthy project, involving protracted technical engagement with the European Commission.  The outcome of this process can be summarised as follows.  For the vast majority of farmers who were eligible under the scheme until now, they will remain eligible from 2019, which means 98% of townlands which were eligible to date remain eligible.  Some 700 townlands that would have previously been eligible will not be eligible under the new designation.  The 760 farmers impacted financially by this change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 of 80% and in 2020 of 20%.  In the majority of cases, the financial impact of this change is relatively small.  Some 2,200 new townlands with 4,000 farmers will become eligible under the new approach and these townlands will be eligible to receive a payment for the first time in 2019.</p><p> Given the importance of this scheme to a large number of farmers, the Department is conscious of the need to ensure that farmers are made aware of the changes.  In addition to putting in place a series of meetings with stakeholders, the Department&rsquo;s website has published a list of eligible townlands by county where farmers can check the status of the townlands in which they hold land.  A map representing this is also available to view online, and dedicated email and phone query support is in place.  A copy of the map which is on the website has been circulated for the information of the members of the committee.</p><p> In addition, we are in the process of writing to farmers in regard to the process.  For the vast majority of farmers, this letter will simply inform them there has been no change in the status of any of the land they hold and that no further action is required of them at this stage.  For farmers who hold land in townlands that will no longer be eligible in 2019, this letter will also set out some details of the appeals process that is being put in place.  It is important that farmers can avail of such an appeals process and arrangements are now being finalised to put in place an independently chaired appeals committee, which will also have appropriate technical expertise.  It is important also for farmers to be aware that, if they are in the process of appealing in regard to a particular townland, they can still apply for the scheme when the 2019 basic payment scheme and ANC application period opens next February.</p><p> In budget 2019 an additional &euro;23 million was allocated to the ANC scheme, which means the total allocation for the scheme has increased by &euro;50 million to &euro;250 million over the past two budgets.  Following on from the redesignation project, a proportion of the additional &euro;23 million allocated in budget 2019 will be expended on payments to farmers who will now be eligible for the first time under the scheme in 2019 and existing beneficiaries who are gaining new eligible land under the redesignation.  The remaining allocation is expected to be allocated via increased payment rates across the land categories in the scheme.</p><p> The Department has held a series of meetings with farm bodies to update them on the current position with regard to the redesignation process and to seek their views on the shape of the scheme for 2019.  It is not intended to change existing eligibility requirements in the scheme, in particular the stocking rate requirement.  However, views have been sought in regard to the level of categorisation of land within the scheme and the most targeted way of allocating the additional funds in 2019.  Without pre-empting the outcome of these discussions, the Department would be in favour of continuing the current policy direction of targeting the highest level of funding at those areas experiencing the highest level of constraint or disadvantage.  The feedback from the discussion so far is that the farm organisations are broadly in favour of keeping the structure of the scheme similar to the 2018 scheme.</p><p> The ANC scheme is a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;4 billion rural development programme, which is co-funded by the EU.  Given the changes required in the scheme for 2019, the rural development programme will have to be formally amended.  Discussions with the European Commission have commenced in this regard with a view to providing clarity to farmers in advance of the application period, which starts in February 2019.</p><p> I thank the members of the committee for taking the time to discuss the changes to the 2019 ANC scheme.  As we have set out, the new designation, along with the increased financial allocation for the scheme, will both be implemented in 2019.  It is vital that stakeholders and farmers are aware of these developments.  The Department continues to work towards ensuring that the ANC scheme can continue its important role over the coming years.  I and my colleagues are happy to discuss this further with the committee and we will do our best to answer questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#D00200"><p>I thank Mr. Dillon and the Department for the presentation.  First, I want to express disappointment at our ability to get information on the changes.  I tried everywhere over the weekend to get a list of the townlands that have been added and, for that matter, those that have been taken out.  I can get a list of all the eligible townlands in the country but there are changes in my county, and unless people knew exactly who was in the last time, they do not know who has been added this time.  In my own locality I can identify townlands that have been added.  I would like to have a guarantee that, before the day is out, we get a list of the townlands that have been added and a separate list of those that have been excluded.</p> <p>  I will not argue with the Department's figures, which suggest 700 townlands have been taken out and that this affects 760 farmers.  The same applies to 2,200 new townlands that will be added, affecting 4,000 farmers.  While I find those figures hard to tally, if that is what the Department says, I accept it, but in my neck of the woods townlands are of greater scale.  At the same time, there have not been the kind of extensive changes we feared at the start might happen.  In my part of Tipperary some areas were discriminated against the last time on the basis of income level.  There are a significant number of dairy farmers in the area and, even though the land quality was definitely on the marshy side, they were excluded on the income criteria.  That this has been excluded this time has obviously benefited the area and, in my view, they have got their just reward.  To have the list would make it a lot easier for us to communicate with people and tell them if they are in or out, and I would like the Department to give us that list without delay.</p> <p>  The percentage of the country that is included must be in the middle to high 70s, and perhaps 75% of the country is receiving some disadvantaged area payment at this stage.  How many hectares do we lose because of the ceiling attributed to each farmer?  Exactly how many hectares are paid for?  What percentage of this eligible area is lost because of the ceiling, given the ceiling was reduced in the past?</p> <p>  To be fair to the Department, we could always be accused of criticising it but it has done a good job on this.  There was a lot of trepidation when the review was announced two or three years ago but the changes are minimal and we are definitely gaining more than we are losing.</p><p>It is an outcome we would have accepted when the review was first mooted.  I would like the detailed information to be supplied.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#E00200"><p>I thank Mr. Dillon for his comprehensive report.  I wish to focus on the categorisation of land within the scheme.  Most of the farmers in the west and north-west would be working mountain-type land or land that is considered disadvantaged or more severely handicapped.  The areas where land is of less severely handicapped are in the midlands and the south.  Will the categorisation of land under the new scheme be along the same lines as previously?  Does Mr. Dillon expect there to be much change?</p> <p>  Will the rates of payment be similar or, as suggested in the presentation, will it be the case that areas affected by the highest levels of constraint or disadvantage will be prioritised?  Is it moving in that direction?  In the context of the impact of climate change, we are very conscious that working low-intensity grazing or upland-type land where farmers find it very hard to survive represents a solid, public good.  ANC payments are vital to keep these individuals involved in this type of farming.</p> <p>  It would be useful to get a list of the townlands that have been excluded or included and to obtain a sense of where they are located.  Additional money has been allocated in respect of the scheme.  We will probably have to ask the Minister about it.  Last year, an additional &euro;23 million was put into the budget.  In the context of a new emphasis on areas of natural constraint, is it expected that more funds would go into the pot to ensure that the scheme continues to deliver the public good it was originally designed to deliver?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#E00300"><p>I thank Mr. Dillon and his colleagues.  We should not be churlish.  We should congratulate the Department and the officials on a job very well done.  As I recall, when the issue arose 18 months or two years ago, there was speculation that the roof would cave in.  All sorts of things were said.  People in the media engaged in ill-founded speculation and this gave rise to concern among farmers involved with the scheme and to those who might attempt to become involved with it.  This has turned out to be a good news story.  Let us cut out the nonsense of always being down on things.  This is a good news story so let us acknowledge that.  Ultimately, this new EU regulation has given us an opportunity to examine biophysical factors and criteria that were not available under the previous scheme.</p> <p>  Being parochial, I want to find out what parts of Westmeath are affected.  I am pleased to see many bits of green on the map because areas of Westmeath and Longford were excluded.  There are little bits of pink too but we must accept that there are objective criteria that have been clearly evaluated.  If some area is excluded, I cannot whinge about that for the sake of doing so.  Any scheme dealing with areas of natural constraint should be focused on ensuring that the maximum compensation is paid to those affected by the highest level of constraint, as evaluated.  I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny in that regard.  Areas were evaluated on objective criteria, not for political reasons.  The objective criteria have been greatly facilitated by the biophysical factors or criteria set out.  The country was evaluated at townland level, which I always thought was a good idea, but I accept that some people thought it was not.  The analysis of the biophysical criteria can be used to exceed the 60% threshold and then qualify thereafter.</p> <p>  Is it approximately 100,000 farmers that will qualify for ANC payments and is the pot &euro;250 million?  How much additional money will be required to deal with an increased number of areas or townlands designated?  If 700 townlands are being removed and 4,000 are coming in, that is a net additional 3,300 farmers, and 1,500 new townlands will become eligible for payments from 2019 onwards.  They will consume approximately &euro;12 million of the additional &euro;23 million, which means there is approximately another &euro;12 million, depending on what way it is worked out, available for existing farmers.  That amount will be available to increase the bias of payment for those who are most constrained, which is the objective of the scheme.  Those are the factors must be taken into account in that regard.</p> <p>  How soon will the next stage of the implementation process of the ANC review be carried out?  The officials will have to refine the process and notify people who are not included.  I am interested to hear about the appeals process.  There must always be an appeals process.  Will the appeals process have one independent chairperson or will there be someone with scientific knowledge of dealing with the biophysical criteria?  One cannot put someone in who does not have a clue.  I want to make sure that the people involved will have knowledge of the various criteria.</p> <p>  In terms of the biophysical criteria, I am interested in the additional factors that permitted the refinement of the eligible land.  Land with higher stocking rate levels and more arable land cover were going to be excluded.  Those were the dominant parameters and they were part of the exclusion categories but that was balanced with specific constraints, especially fragmentation, which is fairly predominant in the west, where it is an important issue.  The level of grassland cover deals with rocky outcroppings and other such factors.  It appears that 98% of existing townlands are going to remain eligible.  It is a goodish news story in comparison to where we started off.  Like Deputy Cahill, I was rooting around trying to discover what parts of Westmeath and Longford are in, but I am not very good with maps.  I will take Mr. Dillon's word on it that he will give me a rough idea of what parts are in.  I say well done to the officials in that regard.</p></speech>

Is the mountain grazing area retained?  Also, have the two lowland designations - the more severely impacted and the less severely impacted - been retained?</p> <p>  Reference was made to what the Department is directed to do by the EU.  What are the Department's areas of flexibility?</p> <p>  In terms of the extra &euro;50 million, it was said that an extra 4,000 farmers are being brought into the ANC and is the money divided up among them?  The scheme is designed to compensate for areas that are most severely impacted.  How is that being done?  How has the scheme been balanced so that the areas that the payments will be paid to farmers in areas that have the highest or most severe constraints?</p></speech>

On the face of it, the scheme looks pretty good.  Where can we get the information on the townlands?  There is some information about Shannonbridge and the Eyrcourt area in Galway.</p> <p>  What criteria were used to include areas?  I see some areas down south that I would have imagined was fairly good ground.  What will the rates be and what will be the limit?  Reference was made to the extra &euro;23 million for this year.</p><p>There was &euro;25 million before that and possibly &euro;50 million in total over a three or four-year period.  What will the rates for the different sections be and what will be the maximum amount that can be drawn down?  Is that increasing, as was the case in 2008 or before the financial crash?</p><p> Our guests referred to the appeals system.  Can they explain who will be dealing with appeals?</p></speech>

Obviously, the ANC payment is a hugely important part of farming income.  Overall, it appears that a good job was done but I must focus on my county of Wexford, which seems to be one of the hardest hit.  Matters are only beginning to come right for many farmers in the county who are recovering from the effects of several fodder crises, including those caused by storms, snow and drought.  Can the witnesses tell me how many townlands in Wexford are being removed and how many farmers in Wexford will be affected?  When will these farmers be notified that they are being excluded?  What will be the loss of value in terms of income to the county?  Was the 60% threshold for townlands that takes townlands out decided by the European Court of Auditors or was it set locally in Dublin?</p></speech>

Some townlands are being removed, some are staying the same and others are coming in for the first time.

As a result of the design of the current scheme, farmers get paid up to a maximum so if a farmer has 100 ha of land, the scheme maxes out at 30.  For some of these farmers, while there is a loss in terms of what was designated land, it is not a financial loss to the farmer.  People may have had tillage crops in the past, hence the loss of the land represents a financial loss.  Over 2,000 individuals are farming those townlands and it will have a financial impact on approximately 760 farmers.  With regard to those coming in, we estimate that the number is over 4,000 but history has shown us that not all farmers apply for the scheme.  The number is approximately 4,000 but we are surprised that every year, certain farmers do not fulfil stocking obligations or do not apply for whatever reason so there is an element of estimation regarding what people will do next year.</p> <p>  We will have to come back to the Deputy about the percentage.  I think the Deputy asked how many hectares are, in effect, not paid on due to the ceiling issue.  The Deputy asked about hectares and eligibility due to scheme limits.  Some of that is dependent on what the new scheme limits will be as in whether we carry over the 30 or 34 ha limits.  As Mr. Dillon has already alluded to, in talking to the farm bodies about that, there is broad acceptance that there would be a cap of some sort.  Some of those figures will depend on-----</p></speech>

In 2018, 3.5 million ha were constrained.  We are looking at just over 3.7 million ha being constrained.  There is a net gain between the 2018 and 2019 schemes.  I do not have the exact figure for the total utilised agricultural area in the country but I can send on an explicit figure.  We are looking at an increase of more than 100,000 ha.  In excess of 3.7 million ha are potentially eligible for payment under the scheme.  I will provide the percentage to be sure but they are the figures.</p></speech>

Broadly speaking, that is the thrust of the consultation we have had with the farming bodies so far.  Broadly speaking, our thinking is that we would stay with pretty much the same delineation so what was regarded as mountain or mountain type grazing will be still be regarded as such and the more severely handicapped areas and less severely handicapped areas will still be pretty much the same.  That is the way we are thinking.</p> <p>  In terms of the rates we pay, we have had a round of consultations with the farming bodies.  The issue then is how much money we have to spend and how much money is taken up by the new entrants.  The figure for new entrants is probably of the order of &euro;10 million.  There will be &euro;10 million or &euro;11 million to spend after we accommodate the people who are coming in for the first time.  This then allows us headroom to give increases across all the existing people in the scheme.  That is what we are discussing with the farming bodies at the moment regarding the way they see the greatest increases going.</p></speech>

When we had an extra &euro;25 million to distribute last year for 2018, the way that was approached by the Minister and ourselves involved the greatest increase in terms of percentages and the volume of money going to the people in the mountain-type category and so on down through the categories.  The farming bodies indicate that this is the way they see it as well for now and that they would apply the same logic.  In other words, we will redistribute whatever money is available to people who are there and those who were involved beforehand in that fashion.</p></speech>

To come back to the Chairman's question, we will be setting up the committee straight away.  The Minister will make an announcement about that.  We will be writing to the farmers who are being adversely affected so they will be told about their right of appeal.  They will simply have to write back and say they want to appeal.  That is all they have to do at the outset.</p><p>We can then tell them the reason they have been dropped from the scheme or have not got in, for instance which of the biophysical criteria or fine tuning they have failed and so on.  That would allow them to focus their appeal.  There is no point in making it any longer, which is why there is a two-step process.  That will not take very long.  </p><p> On the timeline, the 2019 scheme will open in February in tandem with the basic payment scheme, BPS, for 2019.  The closing date is 15 May.  Anyone who is in doubt should apply anyway by ticking the box on the BPS form, as they would have done previously.  It is critical that we have those appeals in time for payments in autumn 2019.

I assume those areas met one criterion on the menu of physical constraints.  Is there a formula to decide what areas are severely or less severely disadvantaged?  Do they have to have two or three criteria or is there a formula?  Is it done in an <i>ad hoc</i>way based on what was done before?  I would like some clarity on that.</p><p>Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about how the money was divided out.  In the past, it divided up on a formula of close to 3:2:1.  Were that to be done again, it would make a big difference.  I am very conscious of farmers in the west and north west in particular who probably tick all the boxes, let alone one or two.  I am very conscious of the need to make sure that, while farmers everywhere need support and to be helped and given every assistance possible, we ensure that they are productive and have sustainable farms.  This scheme relates to the constraint of the land and therefore should be paid on that.  We should not lose that focus.  I would like reassurance that there is a clear commitment to pay it on that basis.</p></speech>

To be deemed biophysically constrained, a farmer had to meet at least one of the criteria listed, at least 60% of the townland.  Some townlands had one over 60% applying whereas, the Deputy is correct in saying that others had all of them.  However, within the regulations it was that at least 60% of the utilisable agricultural area had to be constrained.</p> <p>  As we set out in our opening statement, it then had to be fine-tuned.  In our case, we used a stocking rate and arable and the effects that people had learned to live with or functioned with the constraint.  These became fine-tuned out.  In the areas on the map marked pink, some would not have hit the biophysical status, so they would not have got over 60%, where others may have hit that level but, following fine tuning, they then came back out.  There are other specific constraints at play.  Different pink areas on the map are not in the new scheme for different reasons.  Some did not hit the biophysical threshold and others did but were fine-tuned out because of stock levels or the level of arable land.  We have had discussions with all the farm bodies.  There has been broad agreement that the money would move towards the areas of greatest constraint.  Both the percentage increase and the amount increase was greater in the mountain areas.  We anticipate that would broadly be the case in the allocation of moneys to these areas in the new scheme.  </p></speech>

We will set up the process straightaway and write to all of the affected farmers.  As soon as they receive our letter they can lodge their appeal, if necessary.  We will make every effort to get them processed in time for the closing date of 15 May.  Even if the cases are not fully concluded at that stage we advise farmers to apply for the ANC scheme anyway.  We will have the work done by the time we reach the payment date so they will not lose out.  It is easier to do that than for them to not apply, which would create a problem with the EU because the farmers would not have committed to abiding by the terms and conditions of the scheme.</p> <p>  I wish to mention another matter that we have not mentioned.  The new regulation requires us to have an element of what the EU calls "a degressive payment" but what we call front-loading.  Therefore, one must pay a higher rate for the first number of hectares than in each of the tiers.  We have not settled on the first amount of hectares.  Let us say it is ten hectares, for example.  The new regulation means that one must pay more for the first ten hectares per farmer than one does for the rest, and we are required to apply that aspect to each of the three categories.  That clause did not exist for all of the categories before this.  </p></speech>

The horse and greyhound racing industries occupy a special place in the Irish psyche and a key position in the rich tapestry of Irish sport.  They are valuable to our economy, central to our identity and cornerstones of our social and cultural heritage.</p><p>An important pillar of Government policy is to ensure that the horse and greyhound racing industries achieve their maximum potential and, in so doing, contribute to economic and social development across a wide geographic swathe of the country.  Time and again, through the years, Governments have acknowledged the importance of these industries and supported them through legislation and policy initiatives.  The support provided by public funds through investment in these industries has enabled Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing, greyhound racing and breeding.  The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been front and centre in providing this investment and has played a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of these industries. </p><p><b><i></i></b>These industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act  2001.  My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and to Bord na gCon.  In the period 2001 to date, a total of &euro;1.2 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund, provided for under the relevant legislation, has been reached.  Exchequer funding provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries.  In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2019, this cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulation.</p><p>The Estimates for my Department, passed by both Houses as part of budget 2019, include an allocation of &euro;84 million for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  This will be distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, with 80%, or &euro;67.2 million, going to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and 20%, or &euro;16.8 million, going to Bord na gCon.  It is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the fund by &euro;84 million to &euro;1.28 billion to allow my Department to provide the moneys allocated in budget 2019.  This is achieved by way of the regulations submitted to the committee.  The aggregate limit on the fund was increased in this manner in 2004 and 2009 to 2017, inclusive.</p><p> The Deloitte report, the Economic Impact of Irish Breeding and Racing 2017, commissioned by HRI, estimated that the total direct and stimulated expenditure of the breeding and racing industry was &euro;1.84 billion in 2016.  In addition, it is estimated that there are 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry or in directly related industries.  Horse racing generates a significant return to the rural economy in Ireland and a positive international profile for our country.  Behind all the facts and figures, of course, are the thousands of men and women who, directly and indirectly, make the industry what it is today.</p><p> As proven in 2018, Irish owners, trainers, jockeys and horses set standards globally and their stellar achievements and enduring influence underscore Ireland&rsquo;s international prominence.  The equine breeding and racing industry is extremely competitive at a global level, despite other major racing nations having much larger populations and economies.  Despite our size, we are the third biggest producers of thoroughbred foals in the world and estimates place Ireland only behind the United States as the biggest seller of bloodstock by public auction globally.  The significant threat posed by Brexit, however, to the current ease of movement of horses between Britain and France, in addition to the global nature of major breeding operations, illustrate that, while Ireland arguably has leadership position within Europe, its pre-eminence is not guaranteed.  Government funding, in addition to supporting this key industry, also presents an excellent opportunity to yield a high return for its investment leading to a flow of income throughout the economy.  Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society as well as for our economy.</p><p> According to the Power report of 2017, the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly across the economy.  It is estimated that in 2016 the industry supported 5,058 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371.  The industry is deeply ingrained in the social and cultural networks of rural Ireland.  The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare founded on a strong regulatory system.  I am pleased that the Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 is progressing well through the Seanad under the stewardship of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and I look forward to its smooth progression through the D&aacute;il.</p><p> In addition to its focus on the core business of greyhound racing, Bord na gCon places a strong emphasis on regulation of the industry and the welfare of greyhounds.  It is evident that the successful growth and sustainability of the industry is heavily dependent on public confidence in the integrity of racing.  To this end, I welcome that Bord na gCon continues to invest significant resources in regulation and greyhound welfare.</p><p> The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged the Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry.  As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly of remote and online betting operators being outside the tax net.  The measures introduced in the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 had a positive effect on revenue streams with significant increases realised.  Betting tax increased from a total of &euro;31 million for 2015 to &euro;52.2 million in 2017.  I welcome the Minister of Finance's, announcement in his budget speech that betting tax will increase from 1% to 2% next year, which, it is estimated, will contribute &euro;40 million to the Exchequer in 2019.</p><p> Given the wide geographic distribution of these two industries, they are fundamental to the achievement of a more balanced regional economic growth.  Relieving the burden on our major urban centres and nurturing rural economies is a key priority for the Government.  In this context, these industries should be given recognition for the considerable contribution they make to rural economic activity and employment.  Brexit poses an array of substantial threats to the economy and, coupled with the fact that we are a small and open economy naturally prone to volatility, it is difficult to predict what the future holds.  It is, therefore, more important than ever that we support these important industries to help maintain sustainable growth in these sectors.  Both sectors also face a series of challenges in the areas of funding, infrastructure and staffing but even in the face of all these challenges, the industries are steadfast in their ambition to build on recent progress and success.</p><p> Accordingly, I ask members for their support to ensure that Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon receive the funding provided for in budget 2019 and that the important role played by these industries, and the economic activity generated by them, are sustained into the future.  I commend the regulation to the committee and I look forward to discussing any matters which arise.</p></speech>

I understand it has put forward a five-year strategic plan for the industry, in co-operation with the Department.  France is putting its shoulder to the wheel in trying to get this industry going in this country, and it has committed to investing &euro;245,000 in prize money here for 2019.  To date, it has invested &euro;550,000 in harness racing in this country.  A meeting was held in Dundalk last year at which five races were run.  Some &euro;850,000 was bet on those five races on the PMU in France, which shows that the interest in racing is there, as is the potential for the industry to develop and expand.  </p> <p>  As the Minister outlined in his presentation, the increase in the tax from 1% to 2% will yield another &euro;40 million for the Exchequer.  If it can access the funding to get up and running, the harness racing industry has the potential to self-finance once more race meetings are held.  While it does not compare in size with the horse racing or greyhound racing industries, as it is estimated there are only approximately 320 or 330 trainers and owners in the business, I am sure that with more regular meetings this number would increase.  </p> <p>  I understand the request is for a once-off &euro;250,000 seed capital, followed by an ongoing &euro;650,000 per annum to fund the industry and get it established.  The proposal by the IHRA demands careful scrutiny, and the association has demonstrated that it is able to run the industry well.  Its pilot race meetings were successful and, with the funding that it is requesting and a strategic plan in place, this request is worthy of serious consideration.  The IHRA pointed out that the plan was in place for September and the proposal was outlined a several weeks or months before budget day, but if it is left waiting for another 12 months, it will put a handbrake on the development of the sport.  Will the Minister outline his views on immediate funding for this segment of our horse sport industry?  Will the request be given favourable consideration?</p><p>In his presentation, the Minister talked about the excellence of our sport and the way Horse Racing-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#K00300"><p>I am sorry.  There are so many bodies that I get mixed up.  There was one point on which it took me three or four goes to get an answer out of the Sports Horse Alliance last Tuesday evening.  It was about the number of Irish-bred horses jumping internationally as a percentage of the horses competing for Ireland.  The figure we were given was that only 10% of the horses that are jumping competitively for Ireland are Irish-bred.  That is a warning signal as regards the route this business is heading.  Going back to the Aga Khan teams of the 1970s, the vast majority of those horses were Irish-bred.  It is a long time since a representative of the Army Equestrian Centre jumped internationally for Ireland.  The Sports Horse Alliance's presentation contained requests for funding and development for their industry.  That 10% figure shows there is something wrong in our horse sport industry.  It does not have the ability to create finance.  Betting is not widespread in their industry.  Eventing and showjumping do not attract betting to the same degree as other horse sports.  I do not say everything they said here was correct but we have to give serious consideration to where this industry is going with such a low number of Irish-bred horses jumping competitively for the country.  They made requests for funding and most of them were looking for better infrastructure and better prize money for shows.  I suggest to the Minister that we need to sit down and analyse this.  Before it is too late, we need again to start breeding horses here that can jump internationally.  We were renowned for the horses we produced in the past but we have slipped down the scale as regards producing eventers and showjumpers.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that the greyhound Bill is progressing, which is welcome.  I have a suggestion, which I have raised here on a number of occasions, that there should be one laboratory for Horse Racing Ireland and the greyhound industry.  I would like that to be progressed.  The integrity of the greyhound industry has had many  sticks and stones thrown at it.  Whether they are all merited is a different issue.  It is common sense to have one laboratory.  I am told there are different requirements as regards testing dogs and horses but surely having the laboratory under one roof would be the most economical way to go.  We need a laboratory that can look after samples so that they can stand up to any scrutiny in any court.  That is not watertight at the moment.  If someone is found guilty in respect of a prohibited substance, the full rigours of the new Act have to be enforceable.  A properly funded laboratory covering the two industries would be a welcome step forward.</p> <p>   The increase in the betting tax is provided for in the Finance Bill.  I have serious worries about on-track bookmakers.  I fear they are going to disappear from the industry.  They are an integral part of the social scene at horse and greyhound race meetings.  They bring a unique atmosphere to the events.  Their numbers have dropped significantly in the past couple of years.  The turnover at mid-week race meetings is low.  If on-course bookmakers were given an exemption from this increase in tax, it would be an incentive for some of those sole traders to stay in business.  They are competing with the online business and a significant volume of betting is done online.  I am not talking about making that exempt.  The increase in tax is the way to go there and is the way to fund the industry going forward.  However, there needs to be some recognition of on-track bookmakers and we should try to keep them in business.  There is only 30% to 35% of the number ten years ago in the industry now.  If we do not do something to arrest that decline, we will lose an integral part of what makes a day at the races or a night at the dogs enjoyable.</p> <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the allocation of Exchequer funding to these industries and will support the Bill in the Chamber.  I would be grateful if the Minister could respond to those questions and observations.</p></speech>

They are also important for the preservation of our cultural development and so on.  We should maintain our important role in the equestrian and greyhound industries at home and abroad.  The Minister has a copy of the submission from the IHRA.  He wanted a copy of the five-year plan and I understand it was submitted to him in mid-October.  He has an opportunity to review that.  When we raised the matter last year at this committee, we understood that he would give it serious consideration and, therefore, I anticipate that he will do so.  Only &euro;750,000 is required.  It is not just seed funding; the industry needs some capital funding as well.  Seed funding is all right but capital funding is critical.  It will make a contribution in the future and it has set a basis.  The Minister was correct to insist on the IHRA satisfying certain criteria.  It has done so in respect of the protection and integrity of the sport and its structures, as well as in respect of welfare and so on.  It is important for the Minister to recognise this and give the sport an opportunity from 2019.</p> <p>  Last week, the Sports Horse Alliance made a forceful contribution to our committee on various issues and we cannot easily dismiss them.  We should pay attention to the points Mr. Broderick and others made to the committee.  I am long enough here and I think the Minister was here himself in 2001, when the then Minister, Joe Walsh, brought forward the Act in this area, which I supported.  As far as I can remember, the ceiling for the fund at that time was &euro;200 million.  It has increased to &euro;1.3 billion over a 17-year period.  There has been 650% growth in that fund despite a recession in the interim.  We had a couple of recessions, in fact, one of which was not just a recession but a blowout.  That is fairly serious.  It is significant funding that is going directly from the taxpayers to those two industries, and that has to be recognised.  The important issue is to ensure value for money and the Minister is cognisant of that.  The central question is whether the public is getting value for money from this increasing subsidy to both industries.  Doubtless there is importance to preserving and protecting jobs in traditional industries, keeping traditions vibrant and protecting them going forward.  However, the subsidy is increasing far in excess of inflation.  Horse Racing Ireland appears before the committee, and we have certainly put new governance structures and so on in place.</p><p>It has indicated that its objective is to get to the point at which it does not have to rely on the Department or the Exchequer for any funding, and to enable tax revenues to be raised by remote and online betting.  I would like to see that day.  At the end of the day I am hopeful that this will happen.  It is extremely important to people out there.  In 2016, about &euro;37 million went on prize funds.  I am quite happy for prize funds to go to the ordinary small horse trainers and horse owners, and small racecourses like Kilbeggan, Ballinrobe, Roscommon, Thurles, Clonmel and Naas.  Gowran is not too bad.  Connolly's Red Mills is a good sponsor.  </p><p> It is hard for those small concerns to survive.  They are looking for sponsorship.  As far as I can see a lot of prize money goes to two or three places.  The big boys are cleaning up.  Their stallions are tax-free.  They are bringing home the bacon every weekend.  That is grand up to a point, but soon the little people will be washed away.  I do not mind taxpayers' money going towards minding the little people.  I do not mind where it goes as long as it is protecting them.  There are lots of great people down there, the Peter Downes of this world in concerns like Russelltown Stud.  They have been great breeders over the years.  They have given us great horses that have won major races.  It is a tough job for those people to survive with three or four mares.  It is a very easy job for those who can command &euro;75,000 or &euro;175,000 in stallion fees.  It is not too hard surviving in that game.  Those people can then go out on Saturdays and Sundays and clean up.  A lot of this money is going into the prize funds.</p><p> I am in this game, so I have an idea about it.  I am in it to represent the little people.  The people who have accountants and everything else are well able to look after themselves.  I have no sympathy for them at all.  I am looking forward to Mr. Kavanagh's appearance here.  This is not the job of the Minister, Deputy Creed, but I would still like to send a signal to him.  I am looking forward to the appearance of the chairperson or chief executive of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, before the committee.  I have a few points to follow up on.  For example, I refer to Kilbeggan Racecourse.  Senator Daly is its chairperson.  He is not here today as he is at another committee meeting.  That racecourse was looking for a few bob for a long time.  Conditions were attached that are not attached to other loans or grants.  I want to drill down into this.  I am quite happy for money to be provided.  However, prize money must be increased for the sake of the small racehorse trainers, the ordinary owner and the little syndicates that keep the sector going through thick and thin.</p><p> In 2016, HRI saw a group surplus &euro;4.8 million.  That can obviously be achieved when owners are charged for renewing colours.  If an owner has a set of colours in 2017 and wants to have the same set of colours in 2018, he or she has to pay to renew them.  That is a nonsense.  If a GAA club does not change its jersey it does not have to go the county board and pay for a renewal from January.  As the former chairperson of a county board, the committee Chairman knows that.  </p><p> There are too many little obstacles affecting the small players.  As a man said to me years ago, if someone owes a bank manager &pound;1,000 and they do not pay it they will be arrested.  If someone owes &pound;100,000, someone would be scrubbing the floors of the bank in case they fell on their way in.  That was the way it was, and it is the very same with this.  There is an old saying where I am from.  I cannot use it because there is a little profanity in it.  There is too much grease oiling the wheels.  The very well-to-do are getting richer out of this game.  The little people are struggling.  With that reservation I support what the Minister is doing, but I wish to signal that my support is no longer free and easy.  It is qualified support on the basis of ensuring that small tracks get a good share of the money and the small trainers and syndicates have an opportunity to secure decent funding through prize money when they enter horses in races.  </p></speech>

I note the final sentence of the third paragraph of his submission: "The Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund has been front and centre in providing this investment and has played a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of these industries."  Over a period of time some &euro;1.2 billion has been spent on these two industries.  It must be acknowledged that the Irish horse is renowned all over the word.  We have a culture and identity associated with it.</p> <p>  As Deputy Penrose mentioned, the Irish sugar beet industry is trying to get off the ground at the moment.  That industry may look for help and investment from the State.  If in ten years we heard a statement saying it had received &euro;1 billion we would ask what in the name of God is wrong with these people who cannot get a self-sufficient industry going.  There is an element of that here.  There are two different sets of standards.  We have all had representations from people representing harness racing.  That sport is trying to get of the ground and its advocates are looking for relatively small amounts of money to get a fledgling industry going in a particular sector.  They are finding it very difficult.  They have submitted reports and they have been referred here, there and everywhere.  At the end of the day, nobody sits down and works out a solution with them.  They have drawn up a plan which shows serious sustainability and where the industry can go, and yet they are not getting fair winds.  That is certainly my experience, and I think it would be the experience of most members.  That is what we are hearing from that group.</p> <p>  However, the multi-million euro horse racing industry continues to get a lot of support from the State.  I do not make a judgment on the rights or wrongs of that, but I do judge the sense that this will be continued indefinitely.  Representatives of the Department were before the committee earlier to talk about the areas of natural constraints.  These are not areas of natural constraints.  Farmers in County Tipperary say they cannot buy land.  They cannot compete with the big stud farms that come in and buy land from everyone.  I am not saying the market is wrong.  The market does what it does.  However, at some point or other the State must ask if there is a plan for this industry to become self-sustaining.  If it cannot become self-sustaining, what areas of the industry require investment to become self-sustaining?  If there are areas of it that will need ongoing investment, where are they specifically?</p> <p>  I have a problem with writing out a big check, handing it to Horse Racing Ireland and telling that body to spend it how it likes.  That is the problem that we all have.  There needs to be a wake-up call.  I know I have spoken about this before and I have complained about it.  I do not say it to beat anyone up.  I recognise that this industry employs a lot of people.  However, I do have a problem, as I think most honest taxpayers do, with seeing very well-fed sectors getting more and others getting less.  We need to bring a sense of balance back into it. </p> <p>  I know the Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 is progressing.</p><p>The greyhound industry has many critics and a lot of problems and we hope this new legislation will deal with some of them.  I do not think it matters what legislation we put in place.  If people are out to do the wrong thing they will do the wrong thing.  A culture of that nature has developed and I do not know it can be changed.  A very firm hand and a long rod will be needed to get it back into shape.  I ask the Minister to reflect on that and to consider where this is going in the long term.  In ten years time, &euro;2.5 billion or &euro;3 billion may have been spent on these industries and it is not sustainable to continue in this manner.  Some effort has to be made to take a grip of it.  Some elements of the industry need support and we should support them but we should not be handing out a cheque to an organisation only for it to come back and tell us how it spent the money.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#M00200"><p>It is clear that there is a serious commitment to the sector through the &euro;84 million in the most recent budget for the annual Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  When we put in money we support rural development and sustainability and I would like it to be rolled out to Ballinrobe and Kilbeggan because it makes a difference to those communities.</p><p>I also have concerns, which have been put to me by local independent bookmakers, over the rise in betting tax.  They are concerned that they will not be able to continue, whether they are on the high street or beside the tracks.  There is a threat of less sponsorship from the big bookmakers because of the betting tax, which would affect smaller racecourses whose sustainability would be threatened as a result.  We need to be careful about how we proceed and I welcome the fact that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has said he is going to review an aspect of it.  The last thing we want to do is drive more business from the high street and from the independent bookmaker towards online firms which are well able to look after themselves, as are the big bookmakers.</p><p>The Sports Horse Alliance was before us and it has brought forward a report, with an economic analysis carried out by Jim Power.  Given what has been done in the horse racing and greyhound industry, there must be great potential in the sport horse sector and this can also benefit rural Ireland.  It needs support and a framework to proceed and become more professional, with competitions that are more international so that our Olympic athletes and medal winners do not have to go abroad to compete.  Much of the work done with sport horses seems to be a labour of love but there is also a benefit to the local economy.  Some of this has been measured in the report and it is open for discussion.  The Minister increased the budget by &euro;600,000, bringing it to &euro;3 million, but it is nothing like what we are giving to horse racing and greyhound racing.  How will we enable the people who are involved in the sport horse sector, who are now under an alliance, to realise their ambitions?  How can they proceed to present plans to the Minister which he is willing to fund with investment in venues and other things?  Knowledge within the sector seems to be gained in a very <i>ad hoc</i>way.  How can the sector have more educational interventions and become more professional so that we reap the benefits in the rural areas which many of us represent?  How can we advance the cause of the people watching this meeting today?</p></speech>

One of the key parts of the greyhound and horse racing sector is the integrity with which regulations are applied.  The greyhound sector is looking at setting up an independent body in legislation at the moment and we have to ensure that it is in place before any State funding is given to the harness racing sector.  I welcome the increase in funding because, during the recession, we found it difficult to maintain funding for the horse racing sector.  The sector was going through a hard period and, as Deputy Penrose said, there is huge pressure on the horse racing industry at the moment.  Those at the top are enjoying the benefits, something we saw quite clearly with the foal sales in Goffs last week.  The quality horses at the very top end of the market, where a good mare is crossed with a good stallion, are making money but the small breeders with foals are struggling to overcome the cost of stallion fees, which has caused huge worry in the sector.  There are 15,200 people working in the industry but many of them have just one or two mares and are struggling.  If there is anything we can do for them we should do it.  The top end of the market seems to be able to hold its own, no matter what.</p> <p>  There is also a worry about the competitiveness of Irish racing.  As Deputy Penrose said, in the Troytown Chase in Navan last Sunday 11 horses were trained by the same trainer.   </p></speech>

The industry has to look at itself.  We are putting a lot of State money in and HRI has to start looking at what it can do to assist the 15,200 people to whom I referred.  A simple suggestion is races specifically for owners of one or two horses, or a syndicate race.  We should start thinking outside the box so that we can help the smaller people instead of looking after the big guys all the time.</p> <p>  I hope the Minister continues to support the capital spend on racetracks.  As Deputy Penrose said, racetracks receive 40% in State funding but some tracks cannot provide the 60% balance they need to come up with and they have not been able to upgrade their facilities as a result.  The Minister might look at giving up to 70% to smaller racetracks with smaller turnovers which provide for the local economy and less to Leopardstown, the Curragh and others so that there is a bit more fairness in the industry.  The capital spend has been great for racetracks, something I see at my own track of Naas, which is a small racetrack.  A lot of money has been spent on the Curragh, however, and there is an overrun in that project.  The parade ring appears to have been built by engineers, rather than horsey people, as it can only hold 21 horses and is too small for a track that can hold 30 horses.  I hope the extra funding required to adjust it does not come from the State but from the investors who were supposed to be supervising the facility.</p> <p>  The equine centre in Naas is very dear to me as it is an integral part of racing and the horse industry.  It is a world leader in what it does and, while I know it is a private body, whatever support the Minister can give it would be very much appreciated.  The work that is being done there helps to boost the industry and improves its integrity.</p><p>It is being used by the State to assist in disease control.  I ask the Minister to do whatever he can on that issue.  I have scratched my head on the betting tax.  I agree we need to take more tax.  I wonder are we getting the current 1% across the board in all sectors?  Are we getting it through the exchanges, online betting, the bookmakers and the tote?  The tote has an online presence as well and we are not getting the 1% through that.  I have looked at that issue but it has been decided to bring in the 2% rate.</p><p> That is going to impact on small bookmaking firms on the high street in many of our villages and towns.  I would like to see some of the money being collected put into some kind of fund to help people with a gambling addiction.  I would also like not all of the extra money being collected going to the horseracing industry.  Only 30% to 35% of betting now is associated with horseracing.  I do not know if anyone saw this, but last Friday there was a ridiculous golf event in which Tiger Woods played Phil Mickelson.  It was disgraceful that these two fellows had a $200,000 bet on whether one of them would have a birdie on the first hole.  It was disgraceful to see something like being undertaken by two icons of the golfing industry to encourage people to gamble.  I thought it was wrong.</p><p> There is an awful lot of the sector-----</p></speech>

It is a fantastic facility but it is not used enough.  It shuts down for most of the summer.  All weather racing goes on in the UK all the time while we have this fantastic facility that is used perhaps twice a week coming up to Christmas, hardly used at all afterwards and then used once a week after that.  There is an opportunity to run race meetings for small trainers, syndicates, etc.  Let us examine that and start to use our imagination.  I have mentioned the prize funds and how we can use them for imaginative races to encourage the small people involved in the industry.</p> <p>  Anyone who knows racing knows, as Deputy Penrose alluded to, the prizes are all going into the same coffers.  Looking at the main races, we can count on one hand the number of owners associated with it.  It is sad to see.  I am delighted the Minister has come in.  I have a passion for this sport.  I was first brought to the races across the fields at Punchestown when I was about four years old.  I was probably betting.  That cannot be done now but in those days, for under 18s, there could be a tote bet of two shillings or whatever a person might have.  </p></speech>

It is not to encourage people to gamble but it is part and parcel of going to a day's racing.  I have to do the bets for the young fellows I bring with me now because they cannot go up and enjoy the pleasure that was there once.  It does not lead to everyone who makes a bet being gambler.  I know there are problems with that.  It is, however, part and parcel of the enjoyment of the whole thing.  It is a great industry.  I have been to race meetings all over the world and it is a great pleasure to go to the small tracks.  I remember Ballinrobe and Naas.  Families were catered for years ago in those places.  I saw that industry from all sides.  It is a great industry but we need to be able to encourage the small person.  I refer to the fellow who has the few quid in his pocket and who wants to get involved in a little syndicate.  He has to have a chance.</p></speech>

It is obvious that members are deeply interested in the equine industry, as well as the greyhound industry.  Sitting on this side of the debate, the unfortunate position is that there is never enough money to meet all the requests.  In the context of what we are doing today, we are very much restricted by the legislation.  It provides for the allocation of funds, under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, via a statutory instrument that provides for an 80:20 split - 80% goes to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% to Bord na gCon.  On related issues raised about the Sport Horse Alliance, Horse Sport Ireland or harness racing, it is not within my gift, given the constraints of the regulations at the moment, to allocate from the Horse and Greyhound Fund to any of those.</p> <p>  The funding they get comes from the generality of the allocation to the Department.  It is not open under the construct of the legislation to allocate under the Horse and Greyhound Fund.  As I said, there is never enough money.  Another point I will make, that is reflective of a theme of the contributions, is that the top end of the market would survive if Horse Racing Ireland was never there.  Listowel, Mallow, Tramore, Kilbeggan, Gowran, Naas, Tipperary, Cashel or Thurles is where I think there is a need for attention by Horse Racing Ireland.  Later this week, I will be meeting the organisation - as will the committee in due course - and that is a message that needs to be heard loud and clear.</p> <p>  I make no apology for saying this.  In my first budget engagement with Horse Racing Ireland, I made the point to it clearly that I wanted a particular focus on the point to point sector.  I think, in fairness, that it has responded over the last number of years.  That is not to say that there is not more to be done.  It is also the case in respect of the smaller people, if I might use that term, in the industry.  The top end of the market would survive.  We must bear in mind, however, that it is a very mobile industry.  It might survive, but it might not be in Ireland and that is something we need to be very careful about as well.  It is proper that we, holistically, get all the responses.  </p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny made reference to one part of the country and land prices.  If we look at a map of breeding establishments, they are in every one of the counties in the country.  They may be more dominant in one more than another but they are in every county.  It is about small breeders with three or four mares.  They are the backbone of the point to point system and of the smaller tracks as well.  I have been privileged to be in Listowel, Killarney and Mallow to acknowledge the capital investment Horse Racing Ireland has been involved in putting into smaller tracks.  I know that is replicated, even though it is, perhaps, more challenging to come up with the matching funds.</p> <p>  If we turn then to the showpiece investment, the state of the art investment in the Curragh, that is not composed of matching funds.  It is made up of one third, one third and one third.  There is not a one-size-fits all approach.  These are points the industry needs to hear and I will certainly carry the views expressed by the committee to my own engagement with the industry and I am sure the committee will express them directly to Horse Racing Ireland as well in due course.</p> <p>  On harness racing, in the context of the constraints under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 and the fact it cannot be funded under the statutory instrument that we are talking about today, I do not know if I misinterpreted Deputy Penrose's point but &euro;1.28 billion is the cumulative amount up to this point.  It is added to every year.  It is a lot of money.</p></speech>

The harness racing people, with whom I have had engagement, as I know Deputy Penrose has, are very effective communicators and lobbyists for their sector, as the equine industry generally is.  I salute that.  They are a constituent member of Horse Sport Ireland.  The Sport Horse Alliance is a lobby group for the sport horse sector, that is, more or less the showjumping sector, although I do not want to be prescriptive about that.  The opening point I made is that there is never enough money.  We have increased - nearly doubled, in fact - from 2014 the funding we give.  In 2014 we gave &euro;1.8 million to Horse Sport Ireland, and for 2019 the figure will be in the region of &euro;3.5 million.  This is a significant increase.  We could spend multiples of it, but there is an important question here.  Is it the core function of this Department to fund the high-performance end of the sports market?  Horse Sport Ireland receives funding from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, and there is a question of the appropriate balance in this regard.  I appreciate that this is a rural enterprise, that horses are reared on farms, etc., but there is the question of whether it is a core function of this Department to be involved in such a level of funding at that high-performance end or whether that is a function of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, from which Horse Sport Ireland also gets funding.  We will engage with Horse Sport Ireland.  We recently had the Indecon report on it.  We said that once the governance structures were right, we would respond in terms of the allocation to it.  I think we have in the context of the trajectory of its funding.  However, it has a lot of ambition and many constituent members, some of whom work through Horse Sport Ireland, with others working outside it.</p> <p>  The harness racing industry is seeking very substantial capital investment.  We received its draft five year plan for the industry on 12 October, which was after the budget for 2019 had concluded.  This makes it difficult to make any substantial progress on the range of issues raised, which range from the track in Portmarnock to an alternative, which Fingal County Council may make available.  The issues raised concern funding for staffing complement.  Staff are not taken on for only one year; there is a recurring commitment.  We need evidence of matching funds and governance structures.  To be fair, this is an organisation that is trying to get off the ground.  The funding we are allocating today is to HRI and Bord na gCon.  They are subject to the Comptroller and Auditor General's scrutiny, etc., accounts and a board.  This organisation has yet to get to that level of professional presentation.  We are working with it.  We funded the original Indecon report and the development of its strategy.  We have funded the company by way of investment in various programmes and we continue to do so.  We would like to see what else we could do, perhaps even looking at the stud book, which is an area where we might be able to operate.  Is a racetrack development, for example, something that could be usefully explored under the sports capital programme rather than under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's core funding?  It is a sports facility.  These are issues we need to explore.  As I said, we got a draft on 12 October, consideration of which is ongoing.  I do not want to throw cold water over this, but it is not possible under the legislation to take it from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  We are trying to do this within the existing allocations as much as we possibly can, bearing in mind that the Sport Horse Alliance is one of a number of constituent members of Horse Sport Ireland, whose total allocation from this Department is &euro;3.5 million.  Harness racing's ask is a very substantial part of this total allocation in terms of what the cost might be of developing that facility, staffing complement, etc.  We need to explore these matters in further detail and ensure that every step we take we are protecting the public interest and the public purse.  That is important.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised the issue of the single laboratory service, and Senator Lawlor raised the issue of the equine centre.  There is probably the genesis of something there in terms of collaboration, and this could extend to the greyhound sector as well.  Is investment made in things that are transferable?  I hope to visit very shortly the equine centre.  Therein is a requirement for very substantial capital investment.  Can we explore a model whereby something akin to what happened with the Curragh might be partially funded by others as well as the State?  That is important.  Equally important, however, is the following question.  If we put in that level of investment, can we get a return for everyone from what the equine centre does in terms of diagnosis, management, prevention and research and giving the industry here the international reputational standing it has because of a facility like the equine centre?  Can we then use the expertise therein to assist, for example, the greyhound industry with its laboratory requirements, integrity and so on?  We could see a useful collaborative approach to this.  In education and training terms, are there things the broader equine sector needs to do that racing and the equine industry under HRI have done, such that we can leverage some benefit to other aspects?  I have made this point on occasion to key stakeholders, that this should be explored in greater detail.  I certainly see the equine centre as one area where this can deliver.</p> <p>  On-track bookmakers and the betting tax generally are not issues for this Department.  On-track bookmakers certainly add colour to a race meeting.  Mind you, these are the things most people bet on now.  That is the reality, whether we like it or not.  I certainly would like to see that tradition of on-course betting continue and racecourses and HRI, where possible, being able to assist with all the necessary supports, including soft supports outside of the tax system in terms of location, etc.</p> <p>  I think I have covered-----</p></speech>

As I said earlier, without this level of funding, the top end of the market will continue to survive.  This funding is critical to the lower end of the market in particular.  As I said, there are strategic plans.  If the question is founded on an assumption that we could get to a position where this industry will stand without State support, I do not see that happening.</p><p>The top end of it might but the entire edifice of the Irish equine industry is built on a foundation of small owners, breeders and operators and if we lose sight of that we could very quickly have a situation where the base dies out and the mobility of the industry becomes apparent in terms of relocation elsewhere.  That is something we need to guard against.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#P00200"><p>I want to go back to harness racing and trying to get it off the ground.  I wish to follow up on the point Senator Lawlor made about Dundalk racecourse.  Harness racing could and should use that facility rather than try to establish a new track.  The racecourse facility in Dundalk is ideal for harness racing.</p> <p>  In the five races that were held, there was total betting of &euro;850,000 and with the 2% betting tax that is &euro;17,000 in revenue.  This industry might not be able to self-finance but it has the potential to contribute to its upkeep if it could get off the ground.  I am in the Oireachtas three years and those interested in harness racing have been knocking on my door for those three years.  I do not know whether they were making representations before that.</p> <p>  The French have put their money where their mouth is for this industry.  They have put money on the table.  One can only keep an industry like that for so long in the embryo stage.  If we do not take a concrete step it will not develop.  One race meeting a year is not enough for people to keep horses or for the industry to develop.  If we do not expand on harness racing activity in 2019 the project will go backwards rather than forwards.  A number of individuals have put significant effort into it.  They have produced a strategic plan.  I do not doubt the Minister who said it was not ready for budget time, but they said that was not the case.  Lobby groups can always stretch the truth a bit.  We will not get into an argument about when the plan was put on the table.</p> <p>  Unless we make a meaningful contribution to this industry it will go backwards.  The representatives have put an awful lot of work into it.  They have shown that the industry can attract betting from outside the country and we need to make a commitment to it.  The figure of &euro;850,000 on five races in Dundalk was a substantial amount of betting.  It is significant that it could be achieved on a once-off occasion.  We talked about provincial race tracks on several occasions today and they would not generate such betting on the tote in five or six meetings let alone five races.  Unless we take a step forward I am afraid this aspect of horse racing will take many steps backwards.</p></speech>

We have invested.  We need to be careful with public funds that we move in a way that is appropriate.  The Indecon report in 2017 cost &euro;57,000.  The five-year plan for the organisation, which we are paying for, cost in excess of &euro;60,000.  We are paying for its five-year plan.  In excess of &euro;60,000 was spent in 2017.  We gave more than &euro;40,000 for equine technical support in 2018.  Additional funding under the same heading was provided in 2017.  A total of &euro;27,000 was spent on welfare support.  Deputy Cahill is aware some of that was spent in Tipperary to develop harness racing on public roads and to try to increase awareness and improve welfare.  We have put public funds into the sector.  Harness racing is one of many affiliates of Horse Sport Ireland.  If people feel they can go outside the umbrella body then the other affiliates might wonder what the point is in being part of a parent organisation if they can campaign independently.  We must be careful in how we proceed and ensure that it is appropriate.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill's observations on Dundalk track are interesting.  There was a harness racing meeting there.  We must consider whether that is something that could be repeated rather than the approach being pursued in terms of capital investment.  Originally, several hundred thousand was required in the context of Portmarnock.  It then became multiples of that in terms of a new venue in north County Dublin on the border with County Meath.  We must make sure that what we are doing is sustainable.  Anybody can buy a track and develop a track but the question is whether it is sustainable in the long term, if it is the right thing to do, or whether there are opportunities to have further meetings in Dundalk, for example.  Deputy Cahill said that would be the right thing, rather than having a big capital investment.  We must explore whether matching funding will be provided if we put in funding in terms of staffing supports and accommodation, including offices, none of which is there now.  We are working with these people.  We have a draft plan since 12 October, but harness racing is one of many constituent members of Horse Sport Ireland and we need to make sure that we are fair to everybody.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#Q00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to present the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment to the committee.  As in previous years, a rigorous assessment has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the EU Commission&rsquo;s proposals for the fixing of total allowable catch, TAC, for the coming year.  The EU Commission proposal was issued on 7 November and a number of non-papers updating the proposal have issued since.  As the committee will be aware, the final arrangements for 2019 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 17 and 18 December.  The levels of TAC and the quotas for Ireland will be determined at that meeting following intensive negotiations with member states and the Commission.</p><p>The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  Ireland&rsquo;s total allocation of quotas in 2018 amounted to a total value of &euro;266 million.  There are also very valuable inshore species which are not subject to EU TAC including, for example, crab, whelk, scallop and lobster, and are fished by the Irish fleet inside our six-mile coastal zone.  The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations are not included in the proposal as yet, with the exception of mackerel.  While those negotiations are ongoing we know at this stage that there will be at least a 20% cut for 2019 and possibly more. </p><p>Next year will see the full implementation of the landing obligation or discards ban.  This was a central element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and was agreed by all member states as well as the European Parliament.  It will cease the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  This is a common sense goal but the obligation comes with significant challenges.  We must be determined to face these challenges head on if we are to ensure the sustainability of our vibrant coastal communities that depend on healthy fish stocks.  There are a number challenges that can only be addressed by common action from the Commission and the member states and I will pursue these issues vigorously. </p><p>The proposals themselves are based on formal advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  The proposals also take account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice. </p><p>In order to inform my negotiations at the December fisheries Council, I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process was initiated whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2019.  From 7 November an online web portal on <i>www.fishingnet.ie </i>was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  These portals remained open until 21 November and three submissions were received by the closing date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on the <i>fishingnet.ie </i>website.  In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders including fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs,<b></b>on 23 November.  The purpose of this meeting was to give a further opportunity to the main stakeholders to outline their positions on the many aspects of this proposal.  I would like to thank all of the various stakeholders for their contributions to this impact assessment. </p><p>As always, there was a range of views among stakeholders.  However, there were also commonalities and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process.  These include a call for adherence to the available scientific advice to enable responsible and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  However, this must be balanced against the concern that major cuts to TACs could have severe socioeconomic impacts.  In this context, I will not support cuts unless I am satisfied that they are absolutely necessary and fully supported by rigorously assessed, clear scientific evidence.</p><p>A very serious concern in the proposal is the fact that the Commission has not allocated quotas to member states in accordance with our respective shares for a number of key stocks.  Instead, it proposes a by-catch TAC that would be available to any member state.  This is completely unacceptable as it would considerably dilute our share of key stocks and lead to a race to the bottom or Olympic fishing.  Such an outcome would be devastating for our fleets and the sustainability of the stocks in question.  I am working closely with other relevant member states to ensure that these particular proposals are dropped. </p><p>Apart from this issue, I also have concerns with some of the TAC level proposals, for example for haddock in the Celtic Sea, which is minus 14% and for cod in the Celtic Sea which is minus 58%.  This is also a Union TAC.  For our most important demersal stock, nephrops, there is mixture of advice depending on the area.  While some areas are showing an increase in abundance, there is significant reduction in others.  In overall terms, the collective advice is for a 32% cut.  The Marine Institute is currently examining the advice to determine if all relevant information has been considered in its formulation.  Once that analysis is complete I will be able to assess whether there is a case to be made to mitigate to some degree the scale of the cut proposed.  Following the consultation process and the expert advice of the Marine Institute, I do not believe that the full scale of these reductions in quota is either justified or necessary.  I will accept cuts where the scientific advice available to me is unequivocal, for example, for Celtic Sea herring. </p><p>There is some good news in the proposal for certain stocks.  Cod, haddock and plaice in the Irish Sea will all see increases as will megrims, monk and hake in other areas.  The Marine Institute and BIM have again made an invaluable contribution to the assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment before the committee today.  I would like to briefly set out the findings of that assessment. </p><p>From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute's view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that there has been an improvement in the status of some fish stocks.  However, others remain a concern.  In the impact assessment, the Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2018 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in the stock books from previous years.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks, at 32 in total and a higher percentage, at 43%, in 2018 compared with last year.  The percentage and number of stocks overfished, at 22% and 16%, respectively, has also increased in 2018 whereas the stocks with unknown status declined slightly from 28% to 26% or from 38% to 35%.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the document which has been laid before the D&aacute;il and in the stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute and is available on its website.</p><p>The socioeconomic impact assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals does not fully account for Ireland&rsquo;s share of fishing opportunities.  The current proposals exclude a number of important stocks - mackerel, horse mackerel and blue whiting - where the final European Union total allowable catch, and member states' quotas, depend on external, third country agreements.  If agreed as they currently stand, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals would see a net reduction in fishing opportunity, or quotas, of 15% by volume and 17% by value.  In financial terms, this amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;34.67 million.  These figures can be further explained, as follows: a net reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal sector - whitefish and nephrops - of 5.7% by volume and 15% by value, with a direct income reduction of &euro;20 million; and a potential minimum net reduction in fishing opportunity for the pelagic sector of 18% by volume and 20% by value, with a direct income reduction of &euro;14.67 million.</p><p> The regional analysis of these figures is as follows.  For north-west stocks, in what is known as area 6, there would be a 26% increase in fishing opportunity, valued at &euro;2.1 million, for the demersal - whitefish and prawn - fleets.  This will directly impact the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.  For the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and west coast stocks, in what is known as area 7, it is estimated that there will be 14% reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal fleet.  This reduction is valued at &euro;24.31 million and will directly impact the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere and Ros an Mh&iacute;l, as well as other smaller ports.</p><p> In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income is also lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in a number of ancillary industries, such as net making, chandlery, engineering, refrigeration, and so on.  This will obviously have a knock-on effect for employment and BIM further estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, that these reductions could impact 500 full-time and part-time jobs.  This could occur either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies in the seafood sector.</p><p> The proposals do not include the Hague Preferences, which are a safety net for the Irish fleet on specific stocks where total allowable catches are in decline.  Essentially, these are additional amounts of quota that Ireland and the UK claim for important whitefish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quota comes off their allocations.  Ensuring that the preferences are applied will be a key political objective for me in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2019 will amount to at least 1,222 tonnes of fish, with a direct value of &euro;2.4 million and an associated impact on between 40 and 50 full-time and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.</p><p> To conclude, I fully concur with the findings of the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment, which highlights the significant impact the current proposals could have on the Irish fishing industry.  While significant challenges lie ahead over the next three weeks, I will do my utmost to agree a fair and balanced package for Ireland that ensures the continued vibrancy of our industry and the long-term sustainability of our stocks.  I thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of this impact assessment and look forward to the debate on the conclusions.</p></speech>

In particular, there is impact on other EU country fleets which would traditionally fish in what will become British waters, if Brexit powers ahead, as we assume it will.  Their displacement will probably put pressure on the stocks in Irish waters, or what would be Irish waters if we were not in the EU.</p> <p>  In that context and in the discussions the Minister is having at European level, is there any sense of a recognition of the impact this will have on the Irish fishing sector or that there needs to be a full review of the Common Fisheries Policy and where it is going in the context of Brexit?  If we step back and look at the map of Europe, it is clear that Britain leaving takes a huge area of fishing waters out of the EU context.  From an Irish perspective, Irish fishing vessels will either have to go through British waters or international waters to get back into EU waters.  While this meeting is to discuss the total allowable catch and the pressures on the various sectors, and all that comes into play, much of the reason for all those pressures is overfishing and the pressure that comes from the very large fishing vessels from other European states that come into our waters and take a lot of our fish, particularly the super-trawlers.  The impact of those will be even more severe if matters progress with Brexit as we expect them to progress.</p></speech>

In that context, we have been engaged in a very intensive way with the industry since even before the UK vote on 23 June 2016 but this has ramped up significantly since then.  The industry's analysis and our own analysis are <i>ad idem</i>on the scale of the challenge the industry faces in the context of the UK leaving in circumstances where it would control access and quota in its waters.  For example, with regard to our most valuable fishery, we catch 60% of our mackerel and over 40% of our second most valuable stock in UK waters.  We have been working hand in hand with the industry in regard to that challenge and building an alliance across Europe of other member states that are equally impacted in terms of the exposure of their industry to UK waters.  Spain, France, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden are part of a platform that we have been instrumental in constructing with a view to feeding in our shared analysis on what it is we want in the Brexit negotiations, and this has been mirrored by a similar platform constructed by an industry alliance.  There is not an iota of a difference between our shared analysis of the challenge and what it is we want from the outcome of these negotiations.</p><p>What we clearly want is continued access and, effectively, the <i>status quo</i>.  In terms of how we prosecute that, we want to make sure that, in terms of the future relationship, these issues are dealt with in the context of the future trading relationship, not in isolation but in terms of the UK's demands for market access for its products, such as financial services, aviation, pharmaceuticals and the car industry.  We want the negotiations on fisheries to be inextricably linked with those negotiations.</p><p>In terms of the agreement that is now there, that is, the withdrawal treaty and the accompanying political declaration, we are where we wanted to be when we set out originally.  That does not mean there is any room for complacency.  It means that, on the basis the withdrawal treaty is approved, the <i>status quo</i>will apply to the Common Fisheries Policy up to the end of 2020.  During that period, in regard to what is in the political declaration, there will be negotiations around the issues concerning fisheries.  We are very clear on what we want.  We want the continuation of the <i>status quo</i>and we believe that, given what the UK is asking in respect of a close trading relationship, it is right and proper that those two issues would not be separated but would be inextricably linked.</p></speech>

That was a strong selling point for her.  One of the main reasons behind Brexit is that the British want to get away from European regulations and from the constraints placed on them by the EU.  In that context, if they begin to overfish their own waters, what impact will that have on TACs in the future?  Fish do not know where the border between the waters of the EU and UK lies.  The border on the land is hard enough to establish and police but the border in the sea is even harder.  I am conscious of the fact that in a few years from now the December meeting of the agri-fisheries Council could face a much starker problem than is currently the case.</p></speech>

We wanted to work with the industry and with other member states that have fishing fleets, which are also exposed, to a greater or lesser extent, in terms of fishing UK waters and to prosecute our asks through the Barnier task force.  Regarding what has been agreed, we are where we set out to be and this has been acknowledged by industry leaders here.  If one assumes that the withdrawal agreement is approved, and that remains to be seen, serious negotiations on the future trading relationship will take place during the transition period.  Reference has been made to concluding those negotiations as they relate to fish at "an early stage".</p></speech>

I understand the concept of a commonality of purpose and everyone working together, which is all very well and good.  That is the appropriate way to proceed but in the cold light of day, when one is talking about a scarce resource with many people trying to make money from it, we could be in a position where others will take advantage of the situation.  Are we at a point where the Minister should put forward a strong argument for protecting our own waters to ensure they are not overfished?</p></speech>

If we were to break from that, apart from the bad faith, it would do untold damage to the CFP and the relative stability that it provides by sharing out the resources between member states.  We would effectively say to those who support our analysis and who have been part of getting us to where we are now that we want some of their fish.  That is the surest way to isolate ourselves and it would leave us vulnerable in the context of the rest of those member states.  When it comes to December Council, we will all fight each other tooth and nail for the maximum share for our own industries, taking into account the scientific advice, the data on socioeconomic impact and the journey towards maximum sustainable yield, MSY.  We have a shared interest in a critical issue and if we start flying solo on it, that would be counterproductive.</p></speech>

Our largest neighbour, whose waters practically surround ours, will not be governed by the TAC rules at all while we will continue thus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#S00600"><p>It is an interesting point but there is nothing to be gained from failing to prosecute 100% the analysis we have made with others.  If we were to suggest that we wanted in some way to protect Irish waters for Irish boats, we would alienate our allies.  In the context of the CFP and access to community waters, we fish for 60% of our mackerel outside of our own waters.  The CFP is based on Community waters being a Community resource.  We fish for 60% of mackerel in UK waters.  Our trawlers go elsewhere to what could be described as other countries' waters and equally, their trawlers come into our waters.  We have a large 200 mile zone but it would be a serious misjudgment to talk about reopening relative stability or the CFP.  That is for a later stage and when that happens, we will negotiate to get the best deal for Ireland.  At this moment in time, what unites is important.  What divides us or may divide us in future is not what we should explore now because that would be counterproductive.</p></speech>

I have read the Minister's opening statement and I thank him for coming in to discuss this important issue with the committee.  The outline that he gave is concerning in respect of the overall impact, particularly if the proposal remains unchanged.  It will result in a 15% reduction in volume and a 17% reduction in value in the sector.  That is the starting position and the Minister will have to fight a battle on behalf of the country and in conjunction with other member states in the coming weeks.  The proposed reductions this time last year and the position at the conclusion of the negotiations are an indication of what is possible in negotiations.  In that context, I ask the Minister to remind us of the position last year in terms of the final outcome<i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the original proposal.</p><p>What has been the cumulative impact of reductions or changes in recent years?  Have there been reductions every year for the past five or six years or have there been increases as well?  I ask this to assess the impact on the fishing sector in general.</p><p>The Minister indicated that it has not been agreed that the Hague preferences will be applied.  Have they not been applied in any years following negotiations?  How confident is the Minister that they will be applied in 2019?  I would have thought that given the pressure we are under because of Brexit there would be more solidarity from other member states this year.  That is counterposed by the fact that the British Government benefits from the preferences as well, which is a complicating factor.  I accept that fact but ask the Minister to elaborate a little on that matter.</p><p>On the TACs, the Minister indicated that he is seriously concerned about the fact that the Commission, in its proposal, has not allocated quota to member states in accordance with their respective shares for a number of key stocks.  Instead, it has proposed that a by-catch TAC would be available to any member state.  This is a concerning proposal that has never been suggested in the past.  I hope that it will not be implemented and I ask the Minister to elaborate on it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018112700002#S00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I do not have the figures that he seeks but I will endeavour to get them and forward them to him.  I do not have data on the cumulative impact of cuts and changes in recent years or the specific figures for last year to hand.</p><p>I recall some of them last year - for example, with Celtic Sea herring there was a proposed cut of 60% and we ended up with a 30% cut.  When the Hague Preferences were applied to nephrops, I think we went up by 15%.</p><p> Under the Common Fisheries Policy the Commission is committed to fishing under what is called MSY by 2020, whereby each species is only fished to the sustainable yield of the stock without putting itself under pressure to regenerate itself each year.  That and the discards ban requiring fishermen to land everything are two issues giving rise to considerable challenges this year.  Added to that is the issue on the Hague Preferences, which is a device applied where a stock is in decline.  This is predicated on a case that was prosecuted back in the 1980s.  In a way we were short-changed when the Common Fisheries Policy was established in 1982.  As our industry was in some way disadvantaged, we got the Hague Preferences so that where stocks are going down we get a little bit more than everybody else.  Every year other member states kick back against the application of the Hague Preferences.</p><p> It is complicated this year because the UK is going out the door.  It was our ally in those negotiations.  As it goes out the door, member states will feel we are more vulnerable on the Hague Preferences, notwithstanding that we have had a shared endeavour on Brexit.  This is about what will be fished next year and people feel everything is fair game in the context of those negotiations and the Brexit thing is parked.  The loss of the UK as an ally in negotiation over the Hague Preferences is a concern for us.</p><p> There is also concern about something of an unholy alliance emerging between the UK and Spain on what are referred to in the negotiations as Union TACs, that is where in certain species there would be no individual state allocations of quotas.  There would be a headline quota for a species.  We feel that would be severely detrimental to our interests.  We have been working with other member states which would feel equally challenged by this arrangement.  As Spain does not already have quotas for many of the species, it feels it could make a killing on this arrangement.  It would lead to everybody setting out on 1 January 2019 and trying to fish the total quota as quickly as possible.  I referred to it in my speech as kind of Olympic fishing.  It could result in every boat being tied up by 1 April.  That would not take into account when the market is strongest for a particular species.  Everybody would go hell for leather regardless of the market.  We are quite concerned about that, but are working with other member states to try to convince the Commission that is not a wise approach.</p><p> As always the background to the negotiations is the scientific advice from ICES.  BIM feeds in scientific analysis on stocks.  We need to take into account the science on one the hand and the socioeconomic impact on coastal communities on the other, and try to find a balance.  We are sometimes criticised by the NGOs which feel we are on the wrong side of that line.  Invariably if we go too far on the other side, those people who are employed in catching or processing feel we did not take their concerns into account.  It is a balancing act across a range of species.  As I said in my opening remarks, for some species the reports for 2019 are reasonable and for others they are particularly challenging.</p></speech>

It is an EU quota allowing everyone to go at it hell for leather with fishermen landing everything.  We really feel that would be a retrograde step.</p></speech>

In the Common Fisheries Policy Spain is "Mr. Fish".  It sees a real opportunity here.  It would be a major problem for us.  We understand the complexity related to the landing obligation.  The industry here has been very proactive in securing new fishing gear and adjusting net mesh sizes to meet the challenges on landing obligations.  However, many of our fisheries are mixed fisheries in contrast with other fisheries.  For example, the Baltics have clean fisheries where the fishermen who go out today will only catch cod.  In our case fishermen bring in a mixed bag of fish.  This can mean that one species caught early on will choke the opportunities for a host of other species.  The Commission's response is to allow everybody go hell for leather at it without having an individual quota for each member state.  We believe that is a really damaging proposition for our interests.</p> <p>  I have just been handed data in response to one of the Deputy's earlier questions.  Overall quotas increased from 2015 to 2017, but in 2018 the quota decreased by 8% in volume and by 1% in value.  The quotas in 2017 were the highest since 2002.  That is the position we are trying to defend as we go into the 2019 negotiations.</p></speech>

The industry here has been leading in introducing new technologies, and nets with escape hatches and larger mesh sizes so that fishermen are not catching juvenile fish other wild fish, etc., that they would be obliged to discard otherwise.  From 1 January 2019 they have to land everything.  The danger is that fishermen who have been out fishing one species might come in with a percentage of another species for which they have a very low quota and, hey presto, that becomes a choke preventing them going out catching fish for which they still have available quota.</p><p>We do not see the Commission&rsquo;s response in terms of zero quotas for member states, but as a Union TAC as a way to deal with that.</p></speech>

The total discards ban is coming in but until now there has been more flexibility.  Different fishermen have quotas for different things, but now they will be required by law to land everything.  How do we prevent the choke scenario where a fisherman is unable to go out lest he catch something for which he has no remaining quota?</p></speech>

It will take the industry's and the processors' best endeavours to share data and arrive at a situation where we can meet the obligation without having a consequent impact of closing off the opportunity to fish stocks for which we have quota remaining.  I presume it will require, for example, trading opportunities and swapping opportunities with other member states at an earlier stage to ensure that we maintain the capacity to fish where we still have quota.</p></speech>

It was funded to a certain level by the Department under previous Governments, however it has been mothballed and the project is half finished.  It is not one of seven harbours under State control, however in the past, the Department had a specific budget for these types of projects.  It would be a great advantage for Greencastle Harbour were that project to be completed.  Will the Minister update us on that project's status?  Has he made progress in reinstating a fund that can finish the project which the Department started in Greencastle, as well as other similar projects in future?</p></speech>

It is not one of the six State-owned piers.  Efforts are under way across Government to try to find a funding solution however it is not on the radar for the Department's 2019 capital programme.</p></speech>

There has been some discussion on the rural regeneration fund but I would counsel that that fund should relate to trying to start new projects and develop fresh enterprise and initiatives in parts of the country.  It is important a project such as this, which is half-finished, is completed by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was the parent Department funding it.  It should instate a fund to provide for it.</p></speech>

While the Department was previously involved that was in the context of the work being done by the local authority being funded by the Department.  Therefore, it does not matter what funding line goes to the project as long as the work is completed.  It is not one of the six State-owned harbours.  The Deputy will be aware that a pier extension in Killybegs will proceed in 2019 and that there are other efforts under way.  It would not matter to Donegal County Council, which ultimately would be the contracting body, who was funding it as long as the work was done.</p></speech>

That means funding being provided by the Department to finish the job.  That is starving other projects of funding because it is being taken out of the regeneration fund.</p></speech>

The problem with this project is that it has costed multiples of the conventional local authority scheme.  Apart from those, there is a very considerable shopping list from the six State-owned harbours, including the one closest to us here, in Howth, in terms of dredging.  Significant investment is already under way in some - for example, in Castletownbere.  In 2019 it will happen in Killybegs.  The Department has no shortage of capital projects on the marine-side that require funding.  As long as the work is done in Greencastle, there should not be particular concern over the source of funds.</p></speech>

I welcome Ms Karen White, who is the Twitter's director of public policy in Europe.  I also welcome Ms Sherry Perreault, who is the Standards in Public Office Commission's head of ethics and lobbying regulation and also serves as the secretary to the commission.  Both of them are very welcome.</p><p>Before we begin, I have to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind those present to put their phones on flight mode - we are not flying anywhere, but anyway - because they interfere with the sound system.</p><p>The opening statements of Ms White and Ms Perreault should not last more than five minutes in each case, although I will not be strict.  I will indicate to them after four minutes that they have one minute left.  Their presentations will be followed by a question and answer session.</p><p>Each member may ask a question not exceeding three minutes.  I also ask members to wait until all presentations have concluded before putting their questions.  I welcome Deputy Lawless and congratulate him on preparing the Bill and being on the official side of the room.  Unfortunately the turnout at today's meeting has faced difficulties.  The Chairman has gone to London for the hearings there and many members will be coming and going.  That is the way it works with committees because there is so much activity, particularly today with the report on communications being published.  Many people are engaged on that, including my colleague, Deputy Dooley.  I invite Deputy Lawless to give a brief overview of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1323" speakername="James Lawless" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018112700002#F00200"><p>The Acting Chairman has welcomed the witnesses and as sponsor of the Bill I second that welcome.  I also echo the Acting Chairman's comments that turnout today may appear to be low because some colleagues are attending a meeting of our sister committee in Westminster and others are elsewhere.  The transcript will be read in detail and people are watching online and through other fora.  There is significant interest in the matter under discussion.  I introduced the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill to the D&aacute;il this time last year.  It progressed through First Stage and passed Second Stage by majority vote of the D&aacute;il and is now being scrutinised by the committee.  This is the third or fourth session of detailed scrutiny by the committee.  We are progressing through the detail of the Bill and I look forward to today's interaction.</p><p>The concept of the legislation is to apply the same degree of transparency and rigorous scrutiny to online political advertising as already exists for offline advertising.  This will be achieved primarily by requiring that any political online advertisement carries a transparency notice.  The technological and platform requirements of the transparency notice are deliberately non-specific.  The notice can be very low-tech, such as a graphic designer working for the <i>Leinster Leader</i>including a graphic with the text at the bottom, or it could be very high-tech, such as a sophisticated global platform including a widget that can be clicked to open to see more information.  I have deliberately left this up to the platform in each case.  What is required is that it makes known the publisher and sponsor of the advertisement so people who want to see whether somebody is being influenced by political advertising have the right to know who is seeking to bring it to his or her attention.  People will be required to open an online account with a local newspaper or something as large as Twitter or Google and register who they are, who is behind them and what they are about.  This could be a company registration number or a campaign office.  This information must be accurate and it will be an offence for people to fail to provide accurate information on who they claim to be.</p><p>There are well established offences in the Electoral Acts and the Bill is consistent with them.  When I was researching the Bill I uncovered more than 30 offences under the existing Electoral Acts for all kinds of offline campaigning.  For example, if I put up a poster on a lamppost tonight if I am organising a public meeting or if I do so next year if there is an election I must disclose who arranged the poster and who published it and this must be written somewhere on the poster text.  If I do not do this I can be subject to sanction.  It is the same if I produce and distribute printed material in my constituency.  At present, we do not have this online.</p><p>There is some confusion about the next matter and I will be interested to hear the views of SIPO on it.  This is with regard to who governs the existing offences and what is the relevant enforcement agency.  During the recent eighth amendment referendum there was a suggestion that people tried to make complaints in Garda stations and other facilities but there was confusion as to who was the responsible person to take the complaints and how the complaints should be recorded and enforced.  I am sure SIPO will have comments on this.</p><p>The key concept of the Bill is that a disclosure notice appears on all online materials.  There are two qualifications to this.  The first is that it is with regard to paid political advertising.  The Bill is not for ordinary home users giving out about how much they do not like a political party or how much they are for or against a particular referendum.  It is aimed at professional users who are putting money behind a campaign and running sponsored advertisements or promoted posts.  The second qualification is that the material is political in nature.  I have a definition of political in the Bill, which is borrowed from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's advertising regulations regarding what comprises political matter.  It is quite broad.  I would welcome the thoughts of SIPO on this.  I have often felt that some of the Electoral Acts are very specific to the period within which a campaign is under way after the trigger is pulled, which may be 30 or 40 days before polling.  Often opinions are formed and minds are made up long before this.  I believe this is a lacuna in our electoral law and we should have a much longer run in with regard to who is influencing what and what type of disclosure is required for what type of window.  I am open to suggestion on this aspect of the Bill.</p><p>I have mentioned the Bill is technology and platform neutral.  It does not engage in specifics.  The Bill attempt to be robust enough to futureproof itself but with intentions that are clear so there can be follow up and enforcement.  There has been some debate about the penalties.  The Bill suggests failure to provide a disclosure notice or the correct and accurate information will be liable to sanction.  There will be a maximum penalty of five years in jail or a &euro;10,000 fine.  These are not my penalties; they are consistent with the more than 30 existing offences under the Electoral Acts.  I admit they appear onerous but they are consistently onerous with what is already on the Statute Book.  I am open to suggestion on this but I do think it is important that we are consistent.  I suggest there is no degree of censorship.  Free speech is protected in the legislation because it takes no view on the content of the advertisement or material.  It merely requires that if the material is political in nature the disclosure notice should apply in terms of who is running the content.</p><p>There is provision in the Bill for bots, which are automated software driven mass fake accounts that purport to be something other than what they are.  We speak about fake and organic.  Fake means somebody can press a button and use a software tool to run multiple fake accounts and in one go they can retweet, like or share particular posts.  The algorithms of the social media platforms push the posts up the system, which means they appear to more users and get more reach and traction.  It is an easy way to game the system.  It is important because they can influence people and can appear more popular than they actually are.  It is an artificial popularity.  There is absolutely no problem with a home user getting his or her friends to retweet something as it is part of normal democracy and free speech but the Bill does cover sophisticated operations running bot farms, and such things exist.  We have seen examples of this in many elections throughout the world, from the US presidential election to the Brexit vote and votes in Spain, Italy, Africa and South America in the past two to three years.  People run very specific operations with thousands of users at a time that are actually controlled by one entity but purport to be multiple individual users for organic purposes.  I do not know whether anybody here watches &quot;Homeland&quot; but there was a particularly chilling episode recently where a very sophisticated bot farm was run out of a warehouse and all the bots were controlled by one person.  It had the effect of multiplying one view and pretending it was the view of many.</p><p>The Government is not necessarily represented today but the Department is.  A previous issue had been flagged with regard to section 3, which proposes to make illegal public spending for political purposes.  The thinking behind the section is to reinforce the McKenna judgment that already prohibits this.  The Department suggested this could curtail legitimate public consultation engagement.  If this is the case I quite happy to remove the section from the Bill.  There is a new Minister at the Department and I am not sure whether the Department has considered the section again.  I look forward to this engagement.</p><p>This is a simple Bill that is badly needed.  Evidence of this need has been growing and multiplying over the past three years and with every passing month there are more scandals, such as that involving Cambridge Analytica, and more allegations about the employment of various online manipulations.  It is important to introduce the Bill in this jurisdiction and other jurisdictions are following its progress with interest.  I hope it is something we can get behind and bring transparency to the online world in the same way as there is already in the offline world.</p></speech>

I am director of public policy for Twitter in Europe.</p><p>I will outline some key elements of our election integrity work and then provide our observations on the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017.<br/><br/>Twitter is an open, public platform.  Our singular mission is to serve the public conversation.  We are a digital town square, where people from around the world come together in an open and free exchange of ideas.  We see ourselves as a service that supports freedom of expression, open democratic debate and healthy civic discourse.  Twitter&rsquo;s number one priority is improving the collective health of the public conversation.  This means encouraging more open debate and critical thinking, while simultaneously tackling issues such as spam and malicious automation, which can detract from the positive attributes of our service.  Nowhere is this goal more important than during elections.  Our election integrity work focuses on three critical areas: policy and product developments;<b></b>detection and enforcement; and elections outreach and media literacy.<br/><br/><b></b>In 2018, we launched a suite of new products, tools and features to enhance and protect the safety of the public conversation and built a more transparent communication process with the people who use our service.  A key development this year has been our adoption of a more proactive, technological approach to help us to detect violations of our rules and subsequently enforce our policies.  We now use behaviour-based signals to automatically challenge things like inauthentic accounts strategically and at scale.  Critically, this reduces the burden on people to report this type of content to us. <br/><br/>I would like now to step the committee through some of the specific election-related work we are doing in preparation for the European Parliament elections.  Twitter is the home of real-time, vibrant political conversations which are happening right across the political, social and cultural spectrum.  Twitter is a vital tool to connect, inform and illuminate, but it is equally vital that these political conversations are healthy.  This is why protecting the integrity of elections is important for us.  Across Europe, we have open, direct lines of communication with a range of stakeholders in the electoral arena.  Our work with them ranges from training sessions on trust and safety and platform health to regular updates on our reporting and escalation procedures.  For example, last week several of my colleagues addressed members and officials of the European Parliament to update them on our work ahead of next year's elections.  This includes the roll-out of a political advertisements policy, our commitments to the code of conduct on disinformation and illegal hate speech, our rules and reporting procedures and safety and best practice training. <br/><br/>Earlier this year, Twitter launched a section on its website dedicated to election integrity to inform the public about its election related  work.  Ahead of the European Parliament elections, and as we roll out an EU-wide election awareness raising campaign, we will continue to provide information to the public and our users about efforts in using this channel.  Our partner support portal will be expanded ahead of the elections.  This portal enables election partners to provide feedback directly to us about issues and concerns that may arise during major elections and global political events and to expedite reports to us. <br/><br/>We recognise that a healthy democracy needs well-informed citizens.  Industry, Government and educators must work together to equip citizens with better media and information literacy skills so that they can ask the right questions of content with which they engage and share online.  In Ireland, we collaborate with a number of NGOs that are focused on civic engagement, digital citizenship and media literacy, including <i>SpunOut.ie, </i>UNICEF and the Union of Students in Ireland.  We have worked with UNICEF Ireland and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on digital citizenship programmes to help students across the country to improve the health of their online experience.We also recently announced a global partnership with UNESCO as part of global media and information literacy week.<br/><br/>Twitter welcomes the committee&rsquo;s invitation to discuss the very important issues raised by the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017, and in particular, the stakeholder engagement that has been undertaken and the committee&rsquo;s willingness to hear different viewpoints.  Transparency is a core value of the work we do at Twitter.  Our global advertisements transparency centre is a key evolution of our transparency commitment.  Launched over the summer, it enables anyone - whether a Twitter user or not - to view every advertisement that has been served on Twitter over the previous seven days anywhere in the world.  We appreciate what the Bill seeks to achieve and we are supportive of its goals.  In many ways, what is being proposed mirrors what we are trying to achieve at Twitter around transparency in advertisements.  We also welcome the overarching importance that has been placed on developing a legal framework that balances the aim of transparency with facilitating and protecting freedom of expression online.  Much of the discussion in this committee has focused on particular definitions such as &quot;directed towards a political end&quot; and &quot;bots&quot;, which we also welcome.  We look forward to continuing to engage on these important issues and support the committees<br/><br/>work in this area.<br/><br/>I again thank the committee for inviting Twitter to be part of these discussions and I welcome any questions members may have.</p></speech>

My name is Sherry Perreault and I am the head of ethics and lobbying regulation and secretary to the Commission.  The Standards in Public Office Commission, in its current iteration, has been in place since 2001, replacing the former Public Offices Commission.  The Commission comprises six members, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Clerk of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, the Clerk of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and a former member of the Oireachtas, and it is chaired by a former judge of the High Court.  The current chairman is Mr Justice Daniel O&rsquo;Keeffe.<br/><br/>The Commission oversees several pieces of legislation, along with their associated statutory instruments, which serve to support transparency and good governance.  The Acts administered by the Commission are the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, which together are known as the ethics Acts and deal primarily with managing conflicts of interest; the Electoral Act 1997, as amended, which deals primarily with political financing; the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2014, which deals with the parliamentary activities allowance; and the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015, which provides transparency for decision-making processes.<br/><br/>Today, I intend to focus my remarks on the Commission's powers under the Electoral Acts, which I believe would be most relevant to these proceedings.  Under the current legislation, the Commission oversees compliance with respect to the disclosure of donations to Deputies, Senators, parties, candidates and third parties; the expenditure of Exchequer funding; donation limits, declaration thresholds and prohibitions on certain donations; disclosure of election spending and spending limits at D&aacute;il, European and Presidential elections; certification of election expenses for reimbursement; disclosure of political party accounts; registration of corporate donors; and registration of third parties.  Candidates, elected officials, political parties and third parties are subject to the Act's obligations, including donation acceptance rules and disclosure obligations.  To clarify, a third party is any individual or organisation that accepts a donation for political purposes valued at more than &euro;100.  The Standards in Public Office Commission has no role in disclosure of donations or electoral expenditure at local authority level.<br/><br/>The Commission has a role in issuing guidance and advice to those with obligations under the Acts.  It is empowered to make inquiries under the Act and where the Commission is of the view that an offence under the Act has been committed it may refer the matter to the Director for Public Prosecutions.  In practice, and at the request of the DPP, such referrals are made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.  In published reports, including its most recent annual report, the Commission has commented on areas of the Electoral Acts which it believes would benefit from review and modification.  These include transparency in respect of expenditure at referendums, the disclosure of sources of funding to political and third parties, and the definitions of third parties and what constitutes a political purpose.While the Commission does have oversight of political donations, it has no statutory role to oversee the content of political advertising, whether it originates inside or outside the State.<br/><br/>The Commission recently commented on the issue of online advertising in its 2017 annual report as follows: </p><blockquote>The landscape of political engagement has changed in the years since the Act was passed, with the Internet and social media now featuring heavily in any campaign.  While there are prohibitions on foreign political donations other than in specific circumstances, the Commission notes with concern that individuals and organisations based outside of Ireland may fund political advertising or launch digital campaigns financed outside the State.  As no legislative framework currently exists to address these matters, it would appear that an important and continually evolving tool in modern Irish political discourse (i.e. the internet) is unregulated.  This allows for foreign actors to influence Irish elections and referendums, with potentially significant consequences.</blockquote> <p>In its report, the Commission called for a comprehensive review of the Electoral Acts with a view to addressing this issue, preferably in the context of the creation of an electoral commission.  This summarises the role and statutory functions of the Commission I am happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

I thank Ms White for the update and positive engagement.  We are thinking along the same lines, which is great.  I was aware that Twitter had been progressing these measures for some time in parallel.</p> <p>  Ms White mentioned a transparency platform.  It seems to be along the lines of Facebook's platform to view advertisements, where one can go to see advertisements that others are running.  I am aware that during the recent elections in the United States, there was an issue with "dark" advertisements, where someone could be disingenuous and run an advertisement targeting a segment of the population, with two different messages targeting different segments.  The two different segments might never speak to each other and might never see the same advertisements, so a person could get away with saying two things to different groups of people.  That was seen as politically dishonest.  I am aware of a movement in the United States to do that.  I am not sure that it is as much of an issue in Ireland.  It is good that that has been progressed and tackled but a more fundamental issue is transparency about the advertisements.  It is useful to see what other advertising campaigns are running but it is most important to see who is running a specific set of advertisements.  I might have missed that in the presentation so I ask for clarification on that.  Are there moves to ensure that sponsored tweets can be linked back to see who is running them?  Is that part of the package?  I thank Twitter for the blue tick, which I received recently.  I am certainly above board.</p> <p>   I know a representative from Twitter mentioned bots in an earlier submission but they were not mentioned in the oral submission.  It is important that we define bots.  I welcome all input on this.  I have tried to define "bots" in a specific way in the legislation to say that not all bots are bad.  I use a bot for running and it prompts me every week about going out for my run.  It can be quite useful.  There are many innocent bots, such as "word of the day" bots and others.  The way I have defined a "bot" in the legislation is as one that is deliberately masquerading as and purporting to be something that it is not.  I have also set it to a level of 50 or more bots, to not have it apply to somebody is messing around at home.  I welcome further debate on that.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Perreault for her statement.  It seems to dovetail with what we are all saying here.  I notice in the annual report for 2017 that there is a strong statement from SIPO, highlighting that there is a gap in the law and potential for manipulation, particularly by foreign actors.  I thank Ms Perreault for highlighting that.  SIPO set out the provisions that exist, the terms of which it is bound by.  The unique thing about this House is that if we do not like the law, we can amend it.  We need majority support and usually to have the Government onside but that is what we are here for.  What would Ms Perreault like to see, whether this Bill or a variation of this?  I welcome her thoughts on that.</p></speech>

That is available to any member of the public or user on Twitter.  The objective is further transparency in the advertising process so that one can see what particular advertisements are running from a particular account.  If I searched for the Deputy's account, I could see whether he had run any advertisements over the past seven days.  Promoted advertisements on the platform take the form of promoted tweets, accounts and trends.  They are the three types of promoted products that we have.  As with organic content, our objective is to show the most relevant content.  Businesses and charities come to Twitter with the objective of amplifying their message.  The global ads transparency center was the first iteration and there will be further development on it in 2019.</p> <p>  With regard to the matter of bots, we welcome the many discussions that have taken place relating to definitions.  I acknowledge that it is difficult to find a definition for bots.  Academics and researchers have also struggled to find a definition.  We had concerns relating to the definition of "to a political end".  We have seen bots being used for positive reasons during major elections.  In Brazil, as the Deputy highlighted and as I pointed out in my written statement, my colleagues worked with the Brazilian electoral court on a direct message chat bot.  There are many positive use cases.  In advance of the European elections, we would hope that we can advance more of these types of services.  We seek clarification as to whether something such as that would fall foul of the Bill or would be allowed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-27a.182" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sherry Perreault" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018112700002#H00400"><p>With regard to changes that the commission would like to see to electoral legislation, it has made many recommendations over the years that relate to matters outside of this area.  I will not take the committee's time enumerating those.  The most relevant are the question of transparency on expenditure, identifying the source of funding and the source of advertising, particularly if they originate or are funded from outside the State.  That would be important to ensuring transparency in this area.  Another consideration is the definitions contained in the legislation.  We want some alignment with existing legislation.  Under the current Electoral Act, the definition of "political purposes" is broad and has posed some challenges.  The commission has raised those, as have some members of civil society.  The fact that this legislation would have a different definition of what constitutes a political end as opposed to a political purpose in the Electoral Act is something that could be aligned and would allow for more consistent regulation for the person who has to apply the legislation.</p> <p>  The commission's final suggestion relates to expenditure limits, particularly during an election or referendum.  We have limits in place during elections and people who participate as a candidate in an election must disclose their election expenses.  They are subject to thresholds which they must adhere to and there are offences for breaching that.  There are no expenditure limits for a referendum and any third party or political party can engage in campaigning at a referendum and there is nothing relating to disclosure or expenditure limits that they must adhere to in the legislation.</p></speech>

I am sure Deputy Lawless is pleased with the positive response he received to the Bill.  Ms Perreault presented ideas which are not necessarily relevant to this Bill, being outside its remit, relating to referendums, their cost and funding.  Has Deputy Lawless anything further to say?</p></speech>

There seems to be a bit of confusion relating to enforcement of current electoral offences.  There are 30 or so offences.  If I put up a poster in the morning and somebody does not feel that the notice on it adheres adequately to the current legislation, is there a section in SIPO that can investigate, police or sanction that?  Does it go through the Garda and then the Director of Public Prosecutions?  What is the channel?  There seems to be confusion.  Have there been any cases where SIPO has imposed sanctions in recent years or is there a lacuna there, as some commentators suggest?</p><p>There are several electoral Acts in place.  The commission oversees the Electoral Act 1997 which largely deals with political donations and expenditure at elections.  Certain aspects of the electoral legislation would be outside of the commission's remit.  It has no responsibility for the content of political advertising, but we do in relation to expenditure.  If someone spends money on posters, for example, they are obliged to declare that in their election expenses statement at the end of an election and then they can seek reimbursement of costs if they achieve a certain amount of the vote.  The commission would not have responsibility for the content of their adverting, its placement or similar matters.</p><p> On enforcement, for the offences which fall within the Act that is within the commission's remit, it has the authority to make any inquiries or direct the production of information or documents or anything in the possession of a person which might be relevant to the commission's work.  It may make inquiries and may form a view as to whether a contravention of the legislation may have occurred.  The commission does not have direct prosecutorial power.  It can refer any offences to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP.  In practice, and at the request of the DPP, we have referred potential offences to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation, which in turn, may refer them to the DPP for eventual prosecution.</p></speech>

The Supplementary Estimate will bring the 2018 net Estimate for the Vote to &euro;424.214 million.  The gross Supplementary Estimate is &euro;22 million which comprises costs of &euro;18 million associated with the papal visit this year and an estimated additional spend of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions.</p> <p>  The Government agreed to facilitate a visit by Pope Francis to the World Meeting of Families during August.  It was a large and complex event.  The OPW, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, devised the papal visit management plan with the World Meeting of Families, adopting a whole-of-government approach to ensure the health, safety and welfare of participants and visitors.  In implementing the plan the OPW did outstanding work to facilitate the event.  It facilitated the safety of all involved, while at the same time showcasing, nationally and internationally, the attractiveness of Ireland as a country and its ability to host such an event.  Like any event of this magnitude, there are associated costs involved which, in this case, amount to &euro;18 million.  As the event had not been finalised when the 2018 Estimates were published this time last year, the OPW Vote contained no allocation in the 2018 Estimate for the visit.</p> <p>  The OPW also expended an additional sum of &euro;4 million on new works, alterations and additions.  They include work on Leinster House and the rationalisation programme for the Department of Justice and Equality which was committed to in 2019 but advanced by the OPW to 2018.  In order to reduce the required Supplementary Estimate, I have sought to allocate &euro;2 million in additional appropriations-in-aid received by the OPW against this request, thereby reducing the requirement to &euro;20 million.  It is worth noting that the OPW expects to provide &euro;25.749 million for the Exchequer for appropriations-in-aid in 2018.  The vast bulk of this income is from the effective promotion of Ireland's heritage sites and efficient management of visitor demands and events at managed facilities of the OPW, including Dublin Castle, Kilkenny Castle and Castletown House.</p> <p>  The request for the Supplementary Estimate feeds from efficient and effective work undertaken by the OPW on behalf of the Government.  I am happy to recommend it for consideration and approval by the committee and answer questions members may have about the additional requirement.  If some of the questions are technical, my officials will be able to provide assistance.</p></speech>

It was a huge logistical exercise, involving dozens of contractors, all procured under frameworks and in accordance with the rules and regulations.  We also deployed much of our direct labour force.  We had set-ups in ten areas, not just the Phoenix Park, although the one there was by far the biggest.  We also had set-ups at Dublin Airport, &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, the Dublin Castle State Apartments, along the papal city route, at St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral, the Capuchin Day Centre for Homeless People, Knock airport, Knock, Knock Shrine, as well as the three media centre set-ups.  It was an enormous logistical exercise and from a management perspective we were delighted with the outcome and how it went.  There were no incidents or accidents.  It should be said, with reference to the previous papal mass in 1979 and the one this year, that health and safety represent a far more prevalent requirement now than it might have been in 1979.  It required many onerous but necessary actions by us.</p> <p>  I will not go through the process of how we got to it as the committee is interested in the cost.  The cost of which we are absolutely sure, in other words, what has already been paid, is &euro;16.5 million.  There is a further expense of approximately &euro;800,000, of which the biggest element is the cost of meeting the condition of Dublin City Council which allowed us to take down the Phoenix Park gates.  We took down most but not all of the park gates for health and safety reasons and to allow people in and out.  The condition was that we would refurbish them and put them back up.  In fact, they were taken down in 1979 and put back up again.  They were taken down again in 2018.  They are the old historical metal gates in the park which have huge heritage value.</p><p>The cost of refurbishing them has not yet been quantified.  We have an idea, but we do not know the precise cost.</p></speech>

However, I want to ask about a number of matters both in this case and regarding the fact that the park does not receive any money from some enormous lucrative events that are held there.</p> <p>  At the time of the Pope's visit, one particular firm's signs were all over the place, namely, a company called Actavo.  Was this company on a informal contract or was it a preferred bidder?  It seemed, to expand on what the Chairman was asking, to be providing a vast amount of the facilities at the time of the Pope's visit.  Can Mr. McMahon enlighten us as to whether Actavo was contracted for that?  What kind of money was Actavo getting in OPW contracts in the context of the Pope's visit?</p></speech>

The company was contracted on the basis of a framework contract that was already in place.  As I explained earlier, as we do many events other than the papal mass, we have framework contracts in place from which we draw.  The drawing on the framework contracts in this instance was necessitated by the fact that the confirmation of the papal visit and the State support for it only happened in the middle of the year, in mid-June, and we only had weeks to prepare for that.</p></speech>

Many of them are small businesses.  In fact, as with the walled garden and the organic vegetables, it is fantastic.  I was merely surprised that none of them seemed to have been involved in being preferred caterers, other than being asked to be open.  Clearly, when staff and members of the Garda were working in the final days of the preparation, they had more business.  I am really concerned.  My understanding is that Actavo is part of Mr. Denis O'Brien's commercial interests and he is either the managing director or chairperson of that company.</p><p>There are many small cafes in the park and I am not aware that they are part of bigger conglomerates.  I merely wonder what role, if any, did such businesses in the food sector, which could involve people from Kilkenny, Carlow or anywhere around Ireland, play in the papal mass.  Everything seemed to be stamped "Actavo".  The company seemed to dominate everything in what was a world conference.  Normally, one would expect local providers.  I am aware the Pope's visit was not confirmed until late.  I want to be fair but I would like to know about that.</p><p> There were Ed Sheeran concerts in the park earlier in the year which, I am told, were fabulously successful but I am not aware that a ha'penny of any of the money made on them went back into the park.  I accept there is an estimate here for the railings.  For those who might not know the park, the railings are historically important and practically must be remade by expert craftspeople over a long period.  I understand that.  In the case of the Bloom festival, for example, there was considerable traffic congestion all around the park for days and residents were basically locked in their homes.  Can the OPW confirm whether anything went back into the park from the Bloom receipts and the Ed Sheeran concerts?</p><p> Much work needs to be done in the park.  I commend the OPW on the work it has commenced on the Magazine Fort, in reinstating what is a bit of a ruin and a wreck, and which will eventually be a world-class attraction for Dublin.  I am aware, from acquaintances who are working on that project, that it will take years because there is an insufficient supply of funding.  Significant events are being run in the park, they are packed out but yet the park itself, and for that matter, the OPW, seem to be getting nothing back.  Did any money from the Bloom festival or from the super-successful, fantastic Ed Sheeran concerts go towards park infrastructure?  I ask because local residents agreed to put up with a lot of disruption on the understanding there would be a dividend for both the park and the OPW for all of the infrastructure it looks after well around the country.  I put it to the OPW that there needs to be a return from these important public events and I would like an account of it.</p><p> All I can say is whoever organised the Pope's visit - it was not the OPW, as it was a taker of orders based on a Government decision - scared most older people in Ireland into thinking that they could not do a two-mile walk up the main avenue.  Those in charge of health and safety went overboard.  People in wheelchairs were not allowed on the main avenue.  Buses, which could have picked up many participants, were not allowed on the main avenue.  Did the church group, which was organising it, call the shots on that?  There needs to be a re-evaluation.</p><p> During the first papal visit to Ireland years ago, there were none of these holding pens and gates.  For many, these destroyed the visit because where a family booked four tickets, they got one ticket for one gate, a ticket for another gate and a further ticket for yet another gate.  The park walls, as I am sure the OPW officials will be aware, are nine miles long.  Can the officials imagine a case where a person's mother gets a ticket for one gate, the person's ticket is for a gate two miles away, her husband's ticket is for a gate two miles away from there and the person's granny's ticket is for a gate a further two miles away.  Whoever designed that system, it was mental.  Many elderly people, people in wheelchairs and people with weaker health, who were among those who were keenest to see the Pope in person, were told they were putting themselves at threat.</p><p> The third aspect I want to ask about is the big bill for medical aid.</p><p>Is that in addition to what the Irish Red Cross and the Civil Defence were doing?  They are based in the Department.  I will finish on this one.</p></speech>

The medical provision relates to on-site medical care.  There are hospitals in the general vicinity.  It was expected that we would have a crowd of 500,000 or more in the Phoenix Park alone.  It did not work out that way in the end.  I am talking about the prediction before the event took place.  We also had to provide on-site medical facilities at the other nine or ten venues where we were involved in logistical arrangements for the papal visit.  It was not just the Phoenix Park where we had to make this provision.  It was also needed at the State apartments at Dublin Castle, the papal city route, St. Mary's Pro Cathedral, the Capuchin Day Centre and other locations, particularly Knock.  These on-site medical costs were required.  It turned out to be a very wet day.  I was personally quite concerned about slips, trips and falls on such a wet day.  I have been told that there were a couple of small injuries, but we were very lucky that there was nothing significant.  No bones were broken anyway.</p> <p>  The OPW had no involvement in the issuing of tickets for the event.  That was handled by the Catholic Church as part of the World Meeting of Families.  All of the ticketing arrangements were done by the World Meeting of Families as the event organisers.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, over 1 million people were reportedly in the Phoenix Park in 1979.  I have heard doubts and questions about that figure because there were no counters involved.  We had counters at this year's event.  For control reasons, we knew exactly how many people were coming in through the gates.  No such facilities were used in 1979.  I do not know whether 1 million people were there.  Anyway, let us say that there were.  It was expected that over 500,000 people would show up at this year's event.  Corralling is a necessary control mechanism for a crowd of that size.  As it turned out, a crowd of that size did not show up.  We had to plan on the basis of the best guess prior to the event, which was that there would be more than 500,000 people in attendance.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the effect on the park of three big events that were held there this year - the Ed Sheeran concerts, the Bloom festival, which is in its tenth or 11th year, and the papal visit, which thankfully does not happen very often.  We hosted a multiplicity of things as well as those events.  We host up to 300 events in the Phoenix Park every year, including charity runs.  Approximately 10 million people visit the park every year.  Over 10 million people of all shapes and sizes come in through the gates to do all sorts of things.  I refer, for example, to commuters and those who visit various facilities in the park, including Dublin Zoo and Farmleigh.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for her kind comments about the Phoenix Park.  We are very proud of how good a facility it is.  Deputies might not be aware that it recently won a gold medal at the world urban parks conference in Melbourne.  We are very proud of that as well.  We think we present the Phoenix Park to an exceptionally high standard.  That has been verified by an international benchmark.  I am not saying I could not do even better things with the Phoenix Park if I had an open chequebook.  I would be delighted to do so.</p></speech>

It has grown from very small beginnings into a major event that rivals the Chelsea Flower Show or any similar event.  It is a unique event because it is not just a flower show like Chelsea; it is also a mechanism for small producers of all sorts of food and other artefacts and heritage items, including some of the people about whom the Deputy spoke earlier, to sell their wares.  It is a big showcase for them every year.  The way we look at it is that we are supporting indigenous Irish industry and indigenous Irish food by agreeing to allow-----</p></speech>

In such circumstances, we are able to use the money from the bond to repair the ground.

I am following up on what the Chairman said.  We know there are costs involved, but is there a kind of financial construct whereby the venues get some reinvestment back through the State from hosting these events?  As I have mentioned, when these mega-events happen, by and large, those who live in the neighbourhood are unable to move out of their houses.  They support these events for the sake of the facilities in the park.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it does not work that way for us.  Any income we get, like the &euro;600,000 I have mentioned, goes into appropriations-in-aid and is returned to the Exchequer.  We have to argue during the Estimates process for moneys to invest in the Phoenix Park and all of our other heritage assets.  We hope and expect that the Government will recognise that these facilities generate income, and support them during the Estimates process by making investment over a prolonged period of time.  As I have said, I cannot lay a hand on a penny of the money that comes in.  I am afraid that is the way it is.  I wish it were otherwise.</p></speech>

I know this for a fact because I visited Knock.  The route around the shrine is nicely landscaped but the trees there had grown over the years.  When the route for vehicles was determined by the local organisers, health and safety reasons - it always involves health and safety - the branches had to be cut back.

They are not uniform.  The east gate is a different size and shape.  They were made specifically for a particular purpose at that entrance so when they are taken down, they will be scrapped.  There will be some value in the metal but they cannot be used anywhere else if that is what the Deputy is asking.</p></speech>

We are talking about the Phoenix Park but we must take the other areas visited by the Pope into consideration.  Let us take Knock, which I visited, and the Phoenix Park.  A total of 4,000 people worked to make this site available for the Pope's visit.  Can we learn from how the ticketing was organised?  Yes, we can but the OPW was given a task to put forward with regard to the Pope's visit and we did that.  We acknowledge that there is significant cost involved but if something happened and we did not do what we were told to do, the conversation we are having here today would be different.  We got that event up and running with no major injuries or anything like that.</p> <p>  There are costs involved.</p><p>Deputy Quinlivan referred to the gates.  From visiting the Phoenix Park, we all know the number of gates that are there.  The specialised work involved in them alone is enormous but we are guided by planning rules and conditions setting out that we must do it and we have taken them on board.</p></speech>

The Pope's visit coincided with a period when the gates needed to be painted.  My question goes back to my point about small traders, caf&eacute;s and food providers.  The gates have gone to England.  Am I correct in saying that?</p></speech>

There is a long history of foundry work in the Dublin area and in Northern Ireland.  As has happened in the past with the OPW, could some kind of training programme be put together so that young people or individuals without employment could become involved in a project in a positive way?  The signs I saw around the park were from Actavo.  Was it the only tenderer for supplying all the services described here?  Mr. McMahon may have to get the information for me.  I cannot understand why some smaller businesses and providers would not have got a shot at it.  We should remember that the park is on the edge of Dublin so I would have thought that anyone within a two-hour radius of Dublin or even further would have been quite interested in that tender.  Was Actavo the only one selected?  Was it because it had the exclusive expertise?</p></speech>

The firms that got the work were procured through invitation and tender on existing frameworks, it was not just a case of selecting on the basis of a single tender for this project.  That did not happen; the firms were already on our frameworks.  It is a case of horses for courses.</p></speech>

It got a significant proportion but it was on our framework and had the scale, capacity and experience to deal with an event of this size.  Ideally, we would love to engage a multiplicity of smaller contractors but for the management necessary to knit an event of this magnitude together, one really needs firms with experience and scale.  It is like building work.  One would not get small house builders to build large buildings because they do not have the capacity or experience.  That is the analogy I would use.</p> <p>  The OPW has a good record in terms of apprenticeships.  The Deputy will recall that during the recession, we had conversations at other fora.</p></speech>

That type of work would include work on the gates.  We have taken on some apprentices in the metalwork area.  The gates in the Phoenix Park represent a significant job.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned repainting.  This is not just about repainting the gates; it involves refurbishment and, in some cases, reconstruction.  The gates suffered as a result of being taken down in 1979 and put back up again.  A proper job was not done then.  I cannot say why but it was not done.</p><p>We were obliged to obtain a licence from Dublin City Council in order to hold the event.  This was not required in 1979.  Part of the conditionality around the 2018 event licence for the Pope's mass was that we would refurbish the gates properly.  We are complying with that condition but we wanted to do it in any event.</p></speech>

There are not that many foundries.  I come from a family of foundry workers and I know much about the trade.  There are not that many foundry businesses, although there are some, particularly north of the Border.  My general understanding is that much of this work will go abroad.  Has the Office of Public Works given any consideration to as much of the work as possible being done in Ireland?</p></speech>

We are part of the European Union and if work is over a certain value, we must tender it publicly.  I cannot say for sure but I would love the work to be done in Ireland.  I hope it is done here.

That is an estimate and we do not know for sure how much work needs to be done.  It could be more or it could be less.  I hope it will not be more as it is a lot of money.

What was the cost to the Army of the Defence Forces personnel working in this way?  There are barracks in the area and other public representatives and I received many complaints about how badly Defence Forces personnel were treated.  They were bivouacked in the trees around Farmleigh and the weather was terrible.  These personnel were not treated with the dignity they deserved.  I am not saying the OPW is responsible but we are only looking at part of the cost of this.  Some people, including those in the Defence Forces and the Garda, gave much service to the event.  What would it have cost for the services provided by the Defence Forces if it was categorised in the same way as the costs of the private security firms listed?  Was somebody from a private security firm on &euro;100 per day or a minimum or living wage?  Our soldiers were not treated very well, although this was not the direct responsibility of the OPW.  At events like this, where Defence Forces personnel are used, they should be treated with dignity and get at least the same consideration as others.  Is there a daily rate for what the private security personnel received?</p></speech>

We asked for volunteers in the OPW.</p><p>Many people volunteered both in Knock and Dublin, particularly in Knock.  As to what it cost the Defence Forces, I am not sure it cost anything in terms of their wages because they were being paid anyway.  I do not think there was any additional cost in having them in the Phoenix Park as opposed to having them in barracks or anywhere else.  That is just my own surmise.</p></speech>

It was an atrocious day but I think Army personnel are well kitted out in terms of protection against the elements.</p> <p>  I wanted to come back to something the Deputy said earlier about the effect of the events in the Phoenix Park.  Even though the park is a big place, there is no doubt that the various events impact on the locality which Deputy Burton represents.  I am fully aware of that.  As a public sector organisation, the OPW wants to be good neighbours to everybody in the area.  To that extent we will engage, as we do in any case through ongoing consultation, in a more intense consultation with our neighbours and internal stakeholders in the park, as well as residents associations and others who are impacted by the park.  That will take place in the new year.  The Deputy might be glad to hear that.  Would the Minister of State like to add anything?</p></speech>

Well done to Mr. McMahon and all the staff involved.  We do not want to lose sight of that.  I seek some clarification on park repairs.  The OPW reportedly sought &euro;924,000 from the State coffers to renovate the Phoenix Park in preparation for the event.  All the gates were to be removed to improve the flow of pedestrian traffic.  I presume the OPW did not need &euro;924,000.  Does the &euro;600,000 figure here refer to the amount spent?</p></speech>

Maintaining, caring for and presenting parks takes place on an ongoing basis obviously.  The grass has to be cut, the flora and fauna looked after, the deer managed and everything else.  Hosting this event was a huge exercise.  There were other significant bits and pieces, a multiplicity of smaller works, that needed to be done to prepare for it.  For example, designated walkways had to be taped off from the main gates up to the event area.  There was an awful lot of stuff like that to be done.</p></speech>

Should we request a far more detailed breakdown of the figures for further consideration?  No one is questioning the event, how it went off or stuff that could or could not have happened.  We are satisfied that the OPW did its job.  However, our job is to check the figures and I am not satisfied with the figures, as presented, or the answers we have been given.  I ask the OPW to resubmit a more detailed breakdown indicating which companies won the contracts and providing detail on the procurement process it used to piggy-back on, as Mr. McMahon put it.

Given that the OPW gives it as a contribution to Bord Bia, I think we need to know the parameters.  Public parks are important for families and everybody else to enjoy and we need to keep investing in them.</p><p>I would ask the same about the arrangement with MCD for the Ed Sheeran concerts.  I am delighted to hear Mr. McMahon say there is going to be a public consultation and I know a lot of people will be interested in taking part.  Many people are willing to be supportive because they understand something is going back.  If it is all just going to private operators, I think we should be told.</p></speech>

At our previous meeting with the Minister of State on an Estimate, I placed on record an issue in respect of Durrow Abbey in County Offaly. I am deeply disappointed that the matter has not been resolved and that a heritage site of value to the State, now leased to an arts for peace project, has been dealt with in such a way.  I know there was mediation and letters were sent to and fro.  I am aware the council in that county is interested.  I appealed to the Minister of State and his officials before and it has come to naught.  I intend to raise the matter again at the next meeting.  If common sense had prevailed, we might have got to the end of it.  In respect of the Estimate the Minister of State is looking for today, some of it might have been found in the accounts if he was to look at the cost of legal fees arising out of the Durrow Abbey case.  I have no intention of letting it go.  I have serious questions that I am going to put to the Minister of State, not today but the next time.  I will submit my questions to him.  I can assure him that in the interests of the State and taxpayers' money, I have no intention of allowing this go without some genuine and sincere effort on his side to resolve it.</p></speech>
